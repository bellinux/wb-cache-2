40|$|This study {{followed}} {{one male}} secondary school cohort over three years, prior and during a positive education implementation at their school. The {{purpose of this}} research was two-fold. Firstly, it investigated the predictive power of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> on the Wellbeing of this cohort. Secondly it examined whether the whole school approach towards positive education had any effect or impact on the predictors and outcome. This research was conducted as Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> have been proposed as protective factors for adolescent wellbeing in theoretical literature, however, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence that demonstrates this. Literature that demonstrates Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> are concepts which can successfully be taught as part of a positive education program to enhance student wellbeing is also limited. To conduct the research, a longitudinal mixed method research design was chosen. It followed a sequential exploratory mixed method approach, quantitatively measuring Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life,</b> Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Wellbeing via questionnaires at four time points over two years. The quantitative findings were then used to inform the design of three semistructured focus group interviews with fifteen randomly selected participants. This study found Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> to be strong predictors of secondary boys’ Wellbeing, and, each predictor can be taught as part of a whole school approach towards positive education to enhance wellbeing. However, the effectiveness of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> education is dependent on the successful implementation of the whole school approach. In the case of this study, Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> education could be improved by further collaboration with parents/carers/guardians, and, further teacher training on applying student-centred learning to the positive education based classes. These findings are significant as they empirically demonstrate Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> are protective factors for male adolescent Wellbeing, and, these predictors are teachable concepts that can be taught as part of a whole school approach to positive education to enhance male adolescent wellbeing...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} among beliefs about volunteerism, volunteering intention, volunteering behavior, and purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> were examined <b>in</b> this study. A total of 5, 946 participants completed {{a series of}} scales, including the Revised Personal Functions of Volunteerism Scale, Volunteering Intention Scale, and Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> Scale. The results showed that participants whose purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> had different levels also had varied prosocial beliefs about volunteerism, volunteering intention, and volunteering behavior. Purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> was associated more strongly with prosocial value function than {{with other types of}} beliefs (except understanding function). When different beliefs are grouped, the correlation between purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and other-serving beliefs was higher than that between purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and self-serving beliefs. Purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> was also associated with volunteering intention and behavior.

40|$|Meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important element of well-being. Recently attention has been directed to examining the differences between having meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and searching for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> Theory has speculated that if an individual is searching for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> he/she may be distressed. Researchers of late have begun to focus on the process of searching for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> {{to gain a better understanding}} of the individual differences which may exist. Interest has also been directed towards exploring whether any moderators of the possible negative effects of the searching process may exist. This research investigated the hypothesised negative link between high levels of searching for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and subjective well-being and the positive moderating effects of presence of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> while also exploring the influence of the demographic variables which were treated as control variables. From an exploratory stance further analysis examined the hypothesised positive moderating effects of self-actualisation, self-efficacy and achievement motives on the relationship between searching for meaning and subjective well-being. One study (n = 500) was conducted to assess the hypothesized relationships. The study confirmed the negative relationship between high levels of searching for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and subjective well-being and positive moderating effects that presence of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and self-actualisation have on happiness scores when individuals are searching for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> Self-efficacy and achievement motives were shown to have no significant moderating effects on searching for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and subjective wellbeing. Overall the results suggest that individuals who record high levels of searching for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> are protected from the negative outcomes of this process by holding high levels of presence of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and self-actualisation. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> {{and life}} {{satisfaction}} are both important variables in well-being research. Whereas an appreciable {{body of work}} suggests that life satisfaction is fairly stable {{over long periods of}} time, little research has investigated the stability of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> ratings. <b>In</b> addition, it is unknown whether these highly correlated variables change independent of each other over time. Eighty-two participants (mean age = 19. 3 years, SD 1. 4; 76 % female; 84 % European-American) completed measures of the presence of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> the search for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> and life satisfaction an average of 13 months apart (SD = 2. 3 months). Moderate stability was found for presence of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> search for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> and life satisfaction. Multiple regressions demonstrated specificity in predicting change among these measures. Support for validity and reliability of these variables is discussed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 An {{ability to}} meet the {{changing}} demands associated with development promotes purpose <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> {{a defining feature of}} psychological well-being. Midlife adults consistently report higher purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> compared to older adults. However, less is known about the dynamics of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the transition from middle to older adulthood. This mixed methods study first examined quantitative trajectories of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> over a five year period and explored the extent to which individuals' psychosocial characteristics predicted different trajectories. A qualitative inquiry followed to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} quantitative results by exploring ways in which midlife adults define, pursue, and adjust their purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> over time. This study used a sample of late midlife adults who took part in the Foley Longitudinal Study of Adulthood during a five-year period between 2008 and 2014. The sample included 70 African Americans and 90 White Americans (age= 55 – 58 at Time 1). Purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> was measured annually with the Psychological Well-Being Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> subscale. Non-normal growth mixture modeling was the statistical procedure utilized to identify patterns of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> trajectories, and to predict such patterns using baseline characteristics, including gender, race, education, personality traits, and generativity. Results suggested purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> was stable and non-normally distributed over the five-year period. Trait conscientiousness significantly predicted higher levels of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> after adjusting for other baseline characteristics. Moreover, African Americans tended to have higher purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> than White Americans. For subsequent qualitative analysis, a subsample of sixteen female participants was purposively sampled to explore how participants with higher and lower trajectories of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> defined their own purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> over time. The issue associated with intersectionality of gender and race and an imbalance in high and low trajectories by race and gender led to the decision to focus on female participants. Following the review of their Time 1 and Time 5 life-story interview transcripts, the sections of future script and major life themes were selected for analysis. A thematic analysis across the subsample was used. Seven main themes emerged that captured aspects related to purpose <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> The participants discussed their major life themes as being proactive, being reactive, having faith, and/or centering on relationships. Their sources of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> included self-needs, work, family relationships, personal development, caring for others, and spirituality. The findings indicated similar sources of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> between those with higher and lower purpose <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> such as work, family relationships, personal development, and spirituality. However, the findings also suggested different underlying pathways to higher versus lower purpose <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> Those higher <b>in</b> purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> tended to attain a proactive versus reactive major life theme and to be more others- versus self-oriented. Partially supporting the quantitative result, some racial differences were identified. In terms of family relationships, White participants tended to discuss their romantic relationships with their husbands, whereas African American participants were more likely to be single and hoped to pursue marriage in the future. In terms of spirituality, there were two African Americans actively practicing spirituality by teaching others, while three White participants were searching for more concrete sense of spirituality. The effect of conscientiousness suggested by quantitative findings was not supported. Consistent with prior research, it is likely that trait conscientiousness is related to certain psychological resources to strive for purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> from a variety of sources. This study is the first longitudinal attempt to explore the trajectory of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> late middle adulthood. A unique strength of the study is the use of mixed methods approach that incorporates survey and narrative interview data, allowing for meaningful discussions between theories of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and individuals who are experiencing purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> daily lives. Purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> among the sample shows a stable non-normally distributed trajectory, in which those higher in conscientiousness and African Americans are more likely to report higher-stable purpose <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> The qualitative findings further provide insights into how participants may pursue purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> similarly and differently across trajectories of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> race, and conscientiousness. Due to the sample selection, the generalizability of these results is limited. Nevertheless, the integrative method enables a more comprehensive understanding of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> late midlife. Future studies should investigate development of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> from a larger and more diverse sample, which includes men as well as women...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> among Macedonian students can be predicted based on their dominant orientation toward past, present or future.

Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory was used for measuring five factors of time perspective, while two dimensions of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> were measured with Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> Questionnaire. The results showed that students with sentimental attitude toward past (Past Positive), with the absence of traumatic past experiences (Past Negative), hedonistic orientation (Present Hedonistic) and direction to future goals and achievements (Future), report presence of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> On the other hand, students who search for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> are those who have a sentimental relationship with the past and future orientation, as well as unpleasant memories of the past and the present fatalistic view determined by external factors (Present Fatalistic). Hence, significant predictors of Presence of Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> appeared to be orientation toward past positive, hedonistic present and the future, as well as avoidance of the negative past reminiscences, explaining 11. 6 % of the variance. The Search for Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> can be predicted from Past Positive, Past Negative and Future, thus explaining 12. 9 % of the variance.

Moreover, the path between generative goals and meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> is hypothesized to be conditional on belief in the species (assessed through Machiavellianism as a proxy variable). This moderated mediation model is tested with data from 4 cultural samples: 856 Cameroonian, Czech, German, and Hong Kong Chinese participants aged at least 60 years provided information on their generative concern, generative goals, meaning <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> and Machiavellianism. Controlling for effects of relationship, level of education, everyday competence, and cognitive functioning on meaning <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> analyses confirmed the moderated mediation model in all cultural samples. That is, generative concern is partly associated with meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> because it leads to generative goals.

40|$|This {{focus of}} the current study is the role of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> with respect to career {{decision}} and anxiety. It was hypothesized that: (1) There is a negative correlation between career decidedness and anxiety; (2) Meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> mediates the relationship between career decidedness and state anxiety; and (3) The relationship between career decidedness and state anxiety will be moderated by the search for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life.</b> Participants consisted of undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university. Measures include: the Career Decision Scale (CDS; Osipow et al., 1976), the Meaning <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> Questionnaire (MLQ; Steger et al., 2006), and the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA; Ree et al., 2000). The results indicate that the presence of meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> mediates the relationships between career decidedness and anxiety. However, the results did not support the hypothesis that the search for meaning <b>in</b> <b>life</b> moderates the relationship between career decidedness and anxiety. Future research and practical implications are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of resilience in habituation to heat and cold pain in healthy women (n = 47). Heat and cold pain thresholds were each assessed across 5 equally spaced trials. Re- silience, purpose <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> optimism, social support, and neuroticism were assessed using self-report measures. The hypothesis was that the resilience and the associated resilience factors would be pos- itively related to habituation to heat and cold pain while controlling for neuroticism. Multilevel mod- eling {{was used to test}} the hypothesis. When considering each characteristic separately, resilience and purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> predicted greater habituation to heat pain while resilience, purpose <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> optimism, and social support predicted greater habituation to cold pain. When controlling for the other charac- teristics, both resilience and purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> predicted greater habituation to heat and cold pain. Re- silience and associated characteristics such as a sense of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> may be related to enhanced habituation to painful stimuli. Future research should further examine the relationship between re- silience, purpose <b>in</b> <b>life,</b> and habituation to pain and determine whether psychosocial interventions that target resilience and purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> improve habituation and reduce vulnerability to chronic pain...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{examine whether}} stress {{management}} mediates {{the relationship between}} purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and self-rated health status (SRH). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 6840 teachers in 2013 in Guangzhou, China. Purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> was assessed through the Purpose <b>in</b> <b>Life</b> Subscale of the Psychological Well-being Scale. Stress management was assessed using the eight-item questionnaire adapted from the Health-promoting Lifestyle Profile II. SRH was assessed by the Suboptimal Health Measurement Scale Version 1. 0. The mediation hypothesis was tested by the structural equation model for path analysis. Results: It was found that purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> had direct and indirect effects on SRH. The path analysis showed the total effect (β = 0. 563) of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> on SRH was comprised of a direct effect (β = 0. 319) and an indirect effect (β = 0. 244), which was mediated by stress management. Conclusions: By supporting the mediation hypothesis, our results indicate that stress management mediated the effect of purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> on SRH. Enhancement of teachers’ purpose <b>in</b> <b>life</b> and improvement of training skills of stress management should be incorporated in the strategy of improving teachers’ health...|$|R
