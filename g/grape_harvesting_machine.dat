In {{this type of}} olive cultivation, trees were grown with a central axis mode and a tree distance of 4, 00 x 1, 50 m. A “Braud” <b>grape</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>machine</b> for espalier vineyards was used in an experimental olive grove in Cassano delle Murge. On the basis of harvesting tests {{it was possible to}} verify that the harvesting machine is able to detach the almost all the product with an operative work capacity of 0, 5 ha/h. An evaluation of harvesting cost was carried out to determine the minimum convenience growing surface, and also to estimate the increase in income per hectare which could be achieved using mechanised harvesting as opposed to manual harvesting. Moreover, {{in order to determine the}} economic limits of using the grape harvester, its performance was compared with that of other harvesting machines used in both super-intensive and traditional plantations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of precision agriculture to viticulture is the management of the quality of grapes at the field level through selective harvest. The recent developments of prototypes of conventional <b>grape</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>machines</b> are able to sort two types of harvest quality. In this paper, we propose a formal description of the problem of differential harvesting. The objective is to optimize the routing of the grape harvester under several constraints. Our approach is based on Constraint Programming (CP), which is a powerful paradigm to solve combinatorial problems. We give a formulation of the problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem. The last section of the paper is devoted to preliminary experimental results on real data from a French vineyard...|$|R
40|$|In August 2003, {{six months}} after {{statutory}} minimum wages came into effect in South African agriculture, wine farmers in two Western Cape districts were surveyed to establish the initial employment impacts of the sectoral determination. The data suggest universal compliance with legal requirements for most labour classes. Specified wage rates required almost no wage increase in one district, and wage increases of between 16 % and 25 % in the other district, especially for workers at the bottom end of the wage scale. Price elasticity of demand for farm labour {{is estimated to be}} between – 0. 28 and – 0. 30. No evidence was found that tractors and labourers are substitutes in the production of wine grapes, but the data support a substitution hypothesis for labour and <b>grape</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>machines,</b> although the relationship was not statistically significant. Job losses during the past year were limited to about 1 % of permanent staff, and were in line with the estimated labour elasticity...|$|R
40|$|The {{wine sector}} is going today {{through a period}} of severe crisis mainly due to the process of {{globalization}} in which all the countries producing wine have entered into fierce competition with each other. As a consequence, the achievement of the product on the market exclusively depends on a good value for money. One of the main factors that affect the cost of running the vineyard and, therefore, the final price of the wine is certainly the <b>grape</b> <b>harvest.</b> For the reasons given above this technique, used to be performed manually, is today impossible to support except that there would be the use of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>machine.</b> It’s well known that the use of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>machine</b> has the limit of the production of must during harvest, that could reflect negatively {{on the quality of the}} final product. It depends on many factors including the physical-mechanical characteristics of the berry and the frequency of the shakers of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>machine</b> used. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of ambient factors on the quality of wines obtained from mechanically <b>harvested</b> <b>grapes</b> with different grape juice production. The results confirm that the control of some parameters such as grape juice production, ambient temperature and time of exposure of the <b>harvested</b> <b>grapes</b> to the ambient conditions is essential in order to obtain wines of quality from mechanically <b>harvested</b> <b>grapes...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Grape</b> <b>harvest</b> dates {{have been}} {{recorded}} in many European locations for several centuries, and potentially contain important information about past climate. In this study, we systematically analyse the relationship of <b>grape</b> <b>harvest</b> dates recorded in the Burgundy region (France) with different climate data sets {{in order to understand}} the connection between climatic conditions and the time of harvest. The results point to a primary dependence of the <b>grape</b> <b>harvest</b> on the temperature from April to August. The strength of this connection depends on the winter to summer temperature relationship and increases over the last 100 years. The <b>grape</b> <b>harvest</b> date is also related to the winter temperature. This connection is non-stationary on interannual, but stable on decadal-to-multidecadal time scales. Therefore, the <b>grape</b> <b>harvest</b> date can be used for independent reconstructions of local April-to-August temperature on interannual time scales as well as remote winter temperature on decadal-to-multidecadal time scales...|$|R
40|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>harvesting</b> is {{the most}} widely {{expanded}} vineyard mechanization practices today.

All data were subjected to Analysis of variance at P < 0, 05.
