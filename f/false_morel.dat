5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> or big red, is an ascomycete fungus of {{the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mushroom}} {{species are}} poisonous to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or allergic reactions {{as well as}} hallucinations to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the destroying angel (A.virosa) and the death cap (A.phalloides), {{the most common cause}} of deadly mushroom poisoning. The <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing rhabdomyolysis. Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of north-eastern Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E
5000|$|True morels are {{distinguished}} from <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> (Gyromitra spp. and Verpa spp.). <b>False</b> <b>morels</b> have caps attached {{at the top}} of the stalk, while true morels have a honeycombed cap and a single, continuous hollow chamber within.|$|R

50|$|Discina is a genus of ascomycete fungi {{related to}} the <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> of the genus Gyromitra. There are about 20 species in the genus. They bear dish- or {{cup-shaped}} fruit bodies. The best known member is the pig ear (D. perlata), which is deemed edible after thorough cooking, although is viewed with suspicion given its relation to the highly toxic <b>false</b> <b>morels.</b>|$|R
500|$|A 10-year {{study of}} the distribution, time of fruiting and {{habitats}} of morel and <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> population in Iowa showed that early false morels are the first morels to fruit in the spring, appearing shortly after leaves begin to form on deciduous trees. [...] Narrow-head morels (Morchella angusticeps) fruit next, followed by the yellow or white morels (Morchella esculenta), then lastly Morchella crassipes. The fruit bodies serve as a habitat for breeding dipterans (flies), including Porricondyla media, Pegomya geniculata, and Trichocera annulata.|$|E
500|$|The genus name {{is derived}} from the Greek words gyros/γυρος [...] "round" [...] and mitra/μιτρα [...] "headband"; the {{specific}} epithet is [...] from the Latin infǔla, a heavy band of twisted wool worn by Roman officiants at sacrifices. It is known more commonly as the elfin saddle or the hooded <b>false</b> <b>morel.</b> Additionally, G.infula is a member of a group of fungi collectively known as [...] "false morels", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded edible true morels of the genus Morchella. This group includes other species of the genus Gyromitra, such as G.esculenta (brain mushroom), G. caroliniana (beefsteak mushroom) and G. gigas (snow morel).|$|E
500|$|Verpa bohemica is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae. Commonly known as the early morel (or early <b>false</b> <b>morel)</b> or the {{wrinkled}} thimble-cap, {{it is one of}} several species known informally as a [...] "false morel". The mushroom has a pale yellow or brown thimble-shaped cap— in diameter by [...] long—that has a surface wrinkled and ribbed with brain-like convolutions. The cap hangs from the top of a lighter-colored, brittle stem that measures up to [...] long by [...] thick. Microscopically, the mushroom is distinguished by its large spores, typically 60–80 by 15–18µm, and the presence of only two spores per ascus.|$|E
50|$|Gymnohydnotrya is a genus of ascomycete fungi {{related to}} the <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> of the genus Gyromitra.|$|R
50|$|While {{many people}} eat <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> without {{apparent}} harm, {{some people have}} developed acute toxicity and recent evidence suggests {{that there may be}} long-term health risks as well.|$|R
50|$|Finnish cuisine {{includes}} fresh ingredients, particularly {{game and}} fish, foraged berries and mushrooms such as <b>false</b> <b>morels,</b> and even reindeer. Alcoholic drinks of note are Koskenkorva, the salty liquorice-flavored Salmiakki Koskenkorva and cloudberry liqueur.|$|R
500|$|Gyromitra infula, {{commonly}} known as the hooded <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> or the elfin saddle, is a fungus in the family Helvellaceae. The dark reddish-brown caps of the fruit bodies develop a characteristic saddle-shape in maturity, and the ends of both saddle lobes are drawn out to sharp tips that project above the level of the fruit body. The stipe is white or flushed pale brown, smooth on the outside, but hollow with some chambers inside. It is found in the Northern Hemisphere, usually in the late summer and autumn, growing on rotting wood or on hard packed ground. G.infula is considered inedible as it contains the toxic compound gyromitrin, which, when metabolized by the body, is converted into monomethylhydrazine, a component of some rocket fuels. The toxin may be removed by thorough cooking. Gyromitra fungi are included in the informal category [...] "false morels".|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{recognized}} toxicity, Gyromitra esculenta is marketed {{and consumed}} {{in several countries}} or states in Europe and North America. It was previously consumed in Germany, with fungi picked in and exported from Poland; more recently, however, Germany and Switzerland discouraged consumption by prohibiting its sale. [...] Similarly in Sweden, the Swedish National Food Administration warns it is not fit for human consumption, and restricts purchase of fresh mushrooms to restaurants alone. The mushroom is still highly regarded and consumed in Bulgaria, being sold in markets and picked for export there. In some countries such as Spain, especially in the eastern Pyrenees, they are traditionally considered a delicacy, and many people report consuming them for many years with no ill effects. Despite this, the <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> is listed as hazardous in official mushroom lists published by the Catalan Government and sale to the public is prohibited throughout Spain. [...] Outside of Europe, Gyromitra esculenta is consumed in the Great Lakes region and some western states in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The edibility of {{this species}} is questionable; {{although}} Verpa bohemica is eaten by many, consumption of large amounts in a single sitting, or on successive days, {{has been reported to}} cause poisoning in susceptible individuals. Symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination, similar to the effects reported by some individuals after consuming the <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> species Gyromitra esculenta. The responsible toxin in G.esculenta is gyromitrin; it is suspected that V.bohemica may be able to synthesize low levels of the toxin. Over-consumption of the mushroom has been reported to have induced a coma. Those who do wish to eat this species are often advised to parboil with copious quantities of water (discarding the water before consumption), to dry the specimens before eating, or, if eating for the first time, to restrict consumption to small portions to test their tolerance. Some advocate only eating the caps and discarding the stems. Opinions on the flavor of the mushrooms vary, ranging from [...] "strong but not on a par with true morels", to [...] "pleasant", to [...] "not distinctive".|$|E
5|$|The more distantly related ascomycete {{mushrooms}} of {{the genus}} Verpa, such as V. bohemica and V. conica, are also known as <b>false</b> <b>morels,</b> early morels or thimble morels; like the Gyromitra, they are eaten by some and considered poisonous by others.|$|R
50|$|Hydnotrya is a genus of ascomycete fungi {{related to}} the <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> of the genus Gyromitra. There are about 15 species in the genus. A {{molecular}} phylogenetic study recovered a species that was described but neglected for 50 years, Hydnotrya bailii.|$|R
50|$|The more distantly related ascomycete {{mushrooms}} of {{the genus}} Verpa, such as V. bohemica and V. conica, are also known as <b>false</b> <b>morels,</b> early morels or thimble morels; like the Gyromitra, they are eaten by some and considered poisonous by others.|$|R

5000|$|When {{gathering}} morels for the table, {{care must}} be taken to distinguish them from the poisonous [...] "false morels", a term loosely applied to describe Gyromitra esculenta, Verpa bohemica, and other <b>morel</b> lookalikes. Although <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> are sometimes eaten without ill effect, they can cause severe gastrointestinal upset, loss of muscular coordination (including cardiac muscle), or even death. Incidents of poisoning usually occur when they are eaten in large quantities, inadequately cooked, or over several days in a row. <b>False</b> <b>morels</b> contain gyromitrin, an organic carcinogenic poison, hydrolyzed in the body into monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Gyromitra esculenta has been reported to be responsible for up to 23% of mushroom fatalities each year in Poland.|$|R
50|$|Gyromitrin is a {{volatile}} water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed {{in the body}} into monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the <b>false</b> <b>morel's</b> toxicity.|$|R
5000|$|Morchella species, (morel family) morels {{belong to}} the ascomycete {{grouping}} of fungi. They are usually found in open scrub, woodland or open ground in late spring. When collecting this fungus, {{care must be taken}} to distinguish it from the poisonous <b>false</b> <b>morels,</b> including Gyromitra esculenta. The Morel must be cooked before eating.|$|R

50|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> or big red, is an ascomycete fungus of {{the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> G. esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
50|$|Monomethylhydrazine is {{believed}} to be the main cause of the toxicity of Gyromitra genus mushrooms, especially the <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> (Gyromitra esculenta). In these cases, MMH is formed by the hydrolysis of gyromitrin.|$|E
50|$|The Discinaceae are {{a family}} of ascomycete fungi, the best known members of which are the <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> of the genus Gyromitra. Originally erected by Erich Heinz Benedix in 1961, it {{was found to be}} a {{discrete}} clade in a molecular study of ribosomal DNA by mycologist Kerry O'Donnell in 1997. As of 2008, the family is thought to contain 5 genera and 58 species.|$|R
5|$|The {{identity}} of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone, better known as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed in the body into monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the <b>false</b> <b>morel's</b> toxicity.|$|R
500|$|MMH boils at [...] {{and thus}} readily vaporizes {{into the air}} when water {{containing}} fresh <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> is boiled. Poorly ventilated spaces allow vapor to accumulate, resulting in gyromitrin poisoning. If boiling the mushrooms indoors, care {{should be taken to}} ensure adequate ventilation, and, if symptoms of gyromitrin poisoning appear, immediately seek fresh air. Even after boiling, small amounts of gyromitrin remain in the mushrooms. Given the possibility of accumulation of toxins, repeated consumption is not recommended.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> is an edible fungus {{which looks}} {{very similar to}} a morel or Morchella {{in the same order}} of Pezizales as is shown with the example of the Verpa fungus ...|$|E
50|$|Pseudorhizina is a genus of ascomycete fungi {{related to}} the false morels of the genus Gyromitra. The type species is Pseudorhizina korshinskii, the genus being erected in 1913. Known as the {{umbrella}} <b>false</b> <b>morel,</b> P. californica is a well-known species of western North America.|$|E
50|$|The name <b>false</b> <b>morel</b> {{is given}} to several species of {{mushroom}} which bear a resemblance to the highly regarded true morels of the genus Morchella. Like Morchella, false morels {{are members of the}} Pezizales, but within that group represent several unrelated taxa scattered through the families Morchellaceae, Discinaceae, and Helvellaceae, including the genera Gyromitra and Verpa.|$|E
5|$|The genus Gyromitra {{had been}} classically {{considered}} part of the family Helvellaceae, along with the similar-looking elfin saddles of the genus Helvella. Analysis of the ribosomal DNA of many of the Pezizales showed Gyromitra esculenta and the other <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> to be only distantly related to {{the other members of the}} Helvellaceae and instead most closely related to the genus Discina, forming a clade which also contains Pseudorhizina and Hydnotrya. Thus the four genera are now included in the family Discinaceae.|$|R
50|$|There are {{treatments}} {{to reduce or}} eliminate the toxicity of certain (but not all) poisonous species {{to the point where}} they may be edible. For instance, <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> are deadly poisonous when eaten raw or incorrectly prepared, but their toxins can be reduced by a proper method of parboiling. Prepared in this way, this mushroom is widely used and considered a delicacy in many European countries, although recent research suggests that there may still be long-term health consequences from eating it.|$|R
50|$|The gyromitrin {{content in}} <b>false</b> <b>morels</b> has been {{reported}} to be in the range of 40-732 milligrams of gyromitrin per kilogram of mushrooms (wet weight). Gyromitrin is volatile and water soluble, and can be mostly removed from the mushrooms by cutting them to small pieces and repeatedly boiling them in copious amounts of water under good ventilation. Prolonged periods of air drying also reduces levels of the toxin. In the US, there are typically between 30 and 100 cases of gyromitrin poisoning requiring medical attention. The mortality rate for cases worldwide is about 10%.|$|R
