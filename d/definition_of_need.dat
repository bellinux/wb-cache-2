40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{compilation}} scheme for a functional logic programming language. The input program to our compiler is a constructor-based graph rewriting {{system in a}} non-confluent, but well-behaved class. This input is an intermediate representation of a functional logic program in a language such as Curry or T OY. The output program from our compiler consists of three procedures that make recursive calls and execute both rewrite and pull-tab steps. This output is an intermediate representation that is easy to encode {{in any number of}} programming languages. Our design evolves the Basic Scheme of Antoy and Peters by removing the “left bias ” that prevents obtaining results of some computations—a behavior related to the order of evaluation, which is counter to declarative programming. The benefits of this evolution are not only the strong completeness of computations, but also the provability of non-trivial properties of these computations. We rigorously describe the compiler design and prove some of its properties. To state and prove these properties, we introduce novel definitions of “need ” and “failure. ” For non-confluent constructor-based rewriting systems these concepts are more appropriate than the classic <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need</b> of Huet and Levy...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this analysis}} were to ascertain the population need for out-patient cardiac rehabilitation in England, to estimate {{the current level of}} provision and associated costs, to identify economies of scale in service provision and to investigate budgetary implications of extending provision. Discharge statistics from the Hospital Episode Statistics database (HES) in England in the year 2000, and data from centres contributing to the British Association for Cardiac Rehabilitation (BACR) survey were analysed. A short follow-up questionnaire was sent to respondents of the BACR survey. The main outcome measures were: the number of patients eligible for cardiac rehabilitation; the percentage referred, joining and completing programmes; health service costs associated with current levels of provision; elasticity of costs; and costs associated with expanding services. Using an inclusive <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need,</b> about 267, 000 people required cardiac rehabilitation in England in the year 2000.

40|$|The use of {{mortality}} {{data in the}} form of standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to measure the need for health care resources in the Resource Allocation Working Party (RAWP) formula in England has been criticised for underestimating the wider effects of adverse socioeconomic conditions on need, particularly in inner city areas. To assess this criticism, we explored the relationships at NHS Regional and District levels in England between two indicators of illness from the 1981 Census, two contrasting indices of deprivation based on the 1981 Census (the Jarman 8 Underprivileged Area (UPA) score and Townsend's Index of Material Deprivation) and their constituent variables, and all cause SMRs for 1982 - 3. All cause SMRs were highly correlated at Regional and District level with permanent and temporary sickness rates. At Regional level, three of the Thames Regions showed relatively high deprivation scores in relation to their SMRs, in comparison to the remaining Regions where the relative level of deprivation closely matched the Region's mortality ranking. District level analyses of the relations between SMRs and the deprivation indices and their constituent variables showed that the Thames/non-Thames dichotomy was accounted for by the 14 Districts in inner London. These findings suggest that although there may be a prima facie case for including an allowance for deprivation in RAWP, it is still not clear how the deprivation variables available in the Census relate empirically to the need for additional health service resources. The analysis raises questions about the appropriate <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need</b> in this context and whether the Census is a suitable source {{for the construction of a}} deprivation weighting for use in national RAWP...|$|E
40|$|Equity {{in health}} care is a goal embraced by most industrialized countries. Although {{universal}} coverage of health care services does not eliminate inequalities, it represents the first step towards a more equitable health care system. This paper explores the main methodological issues involved in defining and measuring equity in access to health care. Access, equity and need are complicated concepts which are difficult to define and to measure. The definition of equity most appropriate for policy makers is that of equal access for equal need. There is no consensus about the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need,</b> although most commonly ill-health is used to indicate need for health care, because of relative ease of measurement. Access is a multi-dimensional concept influenced by both supply and demand factors; however it is commonly approximated by utilization which is easily observed. Methodological issues arise in the simplification of these complex terms; for instance, the measurement of utilization alone to define access leaves out other important factors such as quality of care, and cultural and financial barriers, which are necessary in understanding inequalities. Most countries use surveys and/or administrative sources to measure access and need. However, each of these methods faces inherent limitations. Surveys collecting data on utilization or self-assessed health are subject to bias based on questionnaire design, question wording and psychosocial and cultural factors. Administrative sources on the other hand are less able to collect information on health status, and might be limited in their coverage of other important indicators. Generally, there are three main approaches to calculating equity in access to health care, these are: 1) odds ratios, 2) rates of access and use-needs ratios, and 3) horizontal inequity index. Although increasingly surveys are available at EU-level, more work is needed to improve these surveys and collect more comprehensive and reliable information on both health and access to health care...|$|E
40|$|In {{common with}} {{other areas of}} public services, recent years have seen {{a shift in the}} National Health Service (NHS), with {{increased}} power and authority transferring from professionals towards the users of services. As a result, user involvement has come to form a central element of government policy on public services, and health in particular, with a series of specific policy commitments to give users a stronger voice and to involve them in the health service having been published by both the Westminster and Scottish parliaments. These seek to increase users’ involvement in making decisions about their own care and treatment, in examining and improving the quality of services and in policy and planning activity. In doing so, this policy aspires to respond to the changing culture of personal and societal expectations of health and the health service; to build democratic participation in the difficult targeting and rationing decisions faced by health agencies and, thus, to help renew public trust and strengthen confidence in the NHS. These are ambitious aims with far-reaching implications as they represent a transformation in the interaction between users, health professionals and health policy makers. This thesis examined how this policy has been understood and implemented in the NHS by exploring the scope, relevance and quality of the user involvement processes available in three health service settings. In order to develop {{a better understanding of the}} issues in user involvement it explored the nature of user participation; the character of user representation and the barriers and facilitators to user involvement in maternity, gynaecological oncology and mental health services. The study examined the response to this policy within these three settings; the functioning of existing user involvement mechanisms and their capacity to involve users in determining their individual health care and in shaping health services and policy to their <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need.</b> From this examination it defined the key features of a model process for user involvement within the professional service culture and organisational ethos of the NHS. The study then drew conclusions on the capacity of these current user involvement processes to deliver on the policy directive to develop both individual treatment and health services in ways that are responsive and accountable to users. Finally, the thesis identified those areas that require further research before proposing the lessons for the further development of this significant and potentially influential policy directive.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} the users visiting the syringe exchange clinic in Malmö with respect to what characterises the group, how they utilize the services of the clinic and how their patterns of participation relate to risk behaviour, {{physical and mental health}} and social development. The heterogeneity of the group has been captured by the use of Stimsons dimensions “integration in majority society” and “involvement in sub-culture”, yielding four different groups of syringe exchangers: “stables”, “loners”, “two-worlders” and “junkies”. The study rests on two sources of data: a register from the clinic including all syringe exchangers that have visited the clinic between 1989 and 2003, altogether 3660 individuals, and an interview of visitors at the clinic during 1995, including 496 persons. The results show that syringe exchangers, compared to other persons with severe addiction in Malmö, to a larger extent use amphetamine as their drug-of-choice, are older and inject more irregularly. The population visiting the clinic is heterogeneous with respect to integration in society and involvement in sub-cultures. The group classified as junkies do, as expected, display the highest inclination to share syringes and needles with other and hence have the most advanced risk behaviours. As to utilization of the programme, the results show that the longer the syringe exchangers stay in the programme, the more frequent they visit it. Also with respect to utilization-patterns, we find substantial variations within the studied group. Five categories are discernible: drop-in visitors with only one or two visits, sporadic visitors who in spite of contacts {{over a number of years}} never really establish a regular contact, intermittent visitors who have had contact over several years but display a very irregular visiting pattern, regular visitors who relatively fast establish a consistent contact with visits between uniform time intervals and frequent visitors who tend to stay longer than others and visit the clinic more often. Another aspect of utilization is to what extent the distribution of needles and syringes cover the needs of the visitors. With a strict <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need,</b> only a minority manages to cover their needs, but if we accept a more extensive individual re-use, around 90 percent of the average need is covered. Data also reveals that a very high proportion of the users on at least one occasion have visited the programme without syringe exchange taking place or any complementary service delivered. Basically these visits seem to be of a more social nature, reinforcing the contacts between the staff and the visitors. Data do not give any clear support for the basic assumption that syringe exchange reduce the incidence of HIV or hepatitis. Recent sharing of utensils or low coverage of syringe need through the programme do not predict a higher infection risk. Instead we find that the social contacts with the staff (without syringe exchange) function as a predictor of lower incidence. This indicates that the mechanisms may be more complex than just related to the provision of clean needles and syringes. The result shows that integration increase over time while sub-cultural involvement decreases. However, the patterns for different groups are very diverse and we find no evidence that more frequent contacts as such are related to increased integration. There is however, some evidence that social visits are positively related to increased integration. No support could be found for the assumption that the programme increases the number of severe addicts...|$|E
40|$|How an animal’s {{behavioural}} (ethological) needs {{can be met}} is {{a pivotal}} issue {{in the assessment of}} welfare for captive animals. The value of swimming water for farmed mink is an example how scientific and societal questions relating to animal welfare can be answered. A number of studies have addressed the issue of the indispensability of swimming water for mink; however, so far with inconclusive evidence. In this paper, the results of these studies and related literature are reviewed. First, the biological <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need</b> is discussed. Subsequently, attention is paid to the effects of the presence, absence and the removal of swimming water on behavioural and physiological correlates of well-being including stereotypic and anticipatory behaviour and urinary cortisol. Thereafter we discuss individual differences in the use of swimming water, the price animals pay for access to a water bath, and the effect of access to swimming water on juvenile play. 	The main conclusions of the literature review are that 1) the use of a water bath for mink is most likely related to foraging behaviour (foraging areas: land and water); 2) absence of swimming water, without prior experience, does not lead to consistent changes in level of stereotypic behaviour, or anticipatory responses; 3) removal of a previously experienced water bath may induce short-term stress as indicated by behavioural parameters and elevated cortisol responses; 4) mink work hard for access to a swimming bath and running wheel in consumer demand studies. Other cage modifications such as tunnels and biting objects, may also provide environmental enrichment, if they are added to otherwise impoverished conditions; 5) There are individual differences in the use of swimming water: these are related in part to variation in prior experience of aquatic resources.; 6) As prior experience is important both with respect to individual use of swimming water and the response to deprivation, swimming water can not be described as biological need {{in the sense of a}} fixed requirement for survival. As swimming water appears to act as an incentive that induces its own motivation a more accurate term may be an “incentive induced or environmentally facilitated need”. Given the available evidence, it is not possible to conclude whether mink that have never experienced swimming water, suffer as a consequence of its absence. However, it is possible to predict that mink with access to water have improved quality of life, due to increased behavioural opportunities, in comparison to farmed mink without access to swimming water. In practical terms, it is still open to debate whether mink should be provided with swimming water, or if alternative, less valued, but easier to install and maintain forms of environmental enrichment, should be provided in mink housing. To clarify these issues a number of future studies would be valuable. These include; 1) whether specific environmental cues affect motivation to swim, such as the form of drinking water delivery systems; 2) whether prior experience of swimming water affects its incentive value; in other words “can you miss what you never experienced?”; 3) do behavioural parameters such as stereotypic behaviour; rebound effects and vacuum activity have any general utility in assessing the value of absent resources; 4) what are preferences for and the value of alternative resources which may act as substitutes for swimming water. In addition we would recommend further work investigating: relationship between access to swimming water and positive indicators of welfare such as play and/or anticipatory behaviour; the effects of preventing the performance of rewarding behaviours and deprivation of a previous experienced resource; and health and hygeine issues related to provision of a water bath. In future work, it would be desirable to present be the actual percentages of animals using a water bath during the experiment and the use of power analyses, to aid their interpretation...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{looks at}} {{changing}} everyday normative distinctions between consumption practices in {{three generations of}} Hungarian families and explores the ethical and practical beliefs that these distinctions are based on. It builds {{on the one hand}} on material culture studies, Miller's work in particular, which sees consumption as a realm objectifying relationships and cosmologies. On the other hand it takes up Slater's argument that different notions <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> mediate normative visions of how to live; hence people's diverse <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> have to be taken seriously as a basis of a political debate. The fieldwork that forms the basis of the thesis was carried out in Budapest in 2005 - 2006 with eight families of two or three generations from different class backgrounds. The oldest generation grew up during pre-socialist times; the middle generation was born under socialism; while those in the youngest generation started their adult life under capitalism. The methods included individual and joint family interviews with observations in everyday contexts. First, the thesis investigates ethical and practical concerns that <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>needs</b> and 'appropriate' practices draw on in different generations. Second, by comparing different generations of the same families, it maps the way practices and the concerns underlying them are appropriated and changed. Finally, it looks at links between private and public moralizing discourses on consumption, drawing on the existing literature and participants' own accounts and practices. The theoretical argument I put forward is that normative distinctions between practices draw on relatively coherent personal cosmologies that include on the one hand practical wisdom, on the other hand ethical visions of how to live, who to be and entitlement, which are bound up with particular self-understandings, social and personal relationships and visions of a good life. Furthermore, the thesis shows that public discourse and previous practices are not simply adopted, but incorporated into personal ideas through these cosmologies...|$|R
40|$|Commitment to a single, {{inclusive}} education {{system has been}} the aspiration of reform in education in a democratic South Africa. The dilemma facing the democratically elected government was to write educational policy which, when translated into practice, would improve the educational standards offered to students in impoverished schools {{while at the same}} time allow the maintenance of the high standards achieved in schools which had been privileged under the apartheid system. There was, furthermore, the challenge of providing a curriculum that would be meaningful to students from diverse backgrounds bearing in mind the socio-historical moment within which education found itself. Research on {{inclusive education}} in the developed world has been extensive. There has been less research completed in developing world countries. Situated in the Pietermaritzburg area of KwaZulu‐Natal (KZN), South Africa, a developing world country, participants in the current study were parents of children with disabilities, aide workers, regular and special educators, managers who made decisions affecting the education of these children, and the children themselves. The research is positioned in the theory of interpretivism which provided the opportunity to give a voice to the participants, to interpret how they made sense of their world. The methodology used was qualitative description with an evaluation component. Qualitative description allowed the discovery and understanding of "a phenomenon, a process, or the perspectives and worldviews of the people involved" (Merriam, 1998, p. 11). Data are presented so that the participants' point of view could be understood and made explicit (Artinian, 1988). Using qualitative description, this current study explored the beliefs about disability and inclusive education specifically of stakeholders in the education of disabled children. The evaluation component provided the means of ascertaining the extent to which disabled students were having their educational needs met, and the extent to which the policy ideals of inclusive education, as articulated in White Paper 6 (Department of Education, 2001), were being achieved. Inclusive education in this present study is viewed as a multifaceted construct which shares a reciprocal relationship with various theoretical determinants. The determinants considered in the present study are (a) concept of other, (b) disability discourse, (c) equity, (d) reconceptualist/incrementalist approaches to inclusive education, and (e) prerequisites for regular and special educator buy-in. Findings revealed that there was evidence of inclusive education beginning to be implemented in KZN in that barriers to learning for many students were being addressed and removed. The specific provision in policy documents directed towards children with disabilities was behind schedule, however, and there was little evidence of full inclusion of students with disabilities in regular education. Reasons for this were multiple and were explored in relation to criteria at a macro- and micro-level, distilled from the literature, which seem to be necessary for the successful inclusion of students with disabilities. The most significant macro-level factors were (i) the legacy of apartheid and the democratic process, moving towards a liberal democracy, still being in progress; (ii) the discourse around disability espoused by the majority of the population resulting in high levels of ostracism of the disabled; and (iii) the disabled becoming lost in the wide <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need</b> in the barriers to learning approach to inclusive education. The most significant micro-level factors were (i) regular educators being reluctant to embrace the inclusive education initiative because of problems they had encountered with another recent initiative, the implementation of Outcomes Based Education; (ii) special educators fearing for their students if they were to be included without the requisite preparation and support; and (iii) some parents lacking the efficacy to access education of any sort for their disabled children.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{national model}} {{described in this}} report has been developed by a working group comprised of staff from the National Board of Health and Welfare, the National Centre for Priority Setting in Health Care, and other organisations involved in vertical prioritisation – including the Östergötland County Council, Stockholm County Council, Västra Götaland, the Health Services Region of Southern Sweden, the Swedish Society of Medicine, the Swedish Society of Nursing, and the Swedish Association of Health Professionals. Throughout the process of designing the model, the Swedish Federation of Occupational Therapists and the Swedish Association of Registered Physiotherapists were regularly informed and given opportunities to review and comment on the proposal. Furthermore, the report was reviewed and discussed at a meeting with invited representatives from the other county councils, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Board, and several professional interest groups. Viewpoints were also obtained at a seminar arranged by PrioNet, a network of individuals interested in prioritisation. Potentially, the working model described in Chapter 4 {{could be used in}} any context where vertical prioritisation takes place, e. g. activities arranged by the state, county councils, municipalities, hospital departments, and professional groups. This report is designed to be a useful tool for those working on development projects in priority setting. We believe that the contents must be adapted, with the help of relevant examples and some simplifications; to fit the specific needs of different projects or groups. The text must also be adapted to a target group’s knowledge and previous experience in dealing with transparent priority setting. It must be the responsibility of each provider and other affected organisation to adapt the material to the given situation and project. The National Centre for Priority Setting in Health Care, the National Board of Health and Welfare, and others who have participated actively in this effort can be helpful to various target groups in adapting this report. When and how to engage in practically implementing vertical prioritisation are questions that need to be answered at the local level. Primarily, it is the duty of the local authorities/providers to take responsibility for implementation. Professional organisations also play an important role. Public agencies, universities, and knowledge centres should be sources of support for the local authorities/providers. The Riksdag’s resolution on prioritisation served as the foundation for developing the model. Where there are areas of uncertainty in how to translate these guidelines in practice, or where practical implementation might conflict with the principles, we have pointed this out. Our conclusions and proposals are the following: When facing a choice – regardless of whether it involves allocating new resources for different purposes, or to implement cutbacks – it can be advantageous to rank the possible choices in order of priority. In our model, only the relevant options can be ranked by priority. The consequences of this ranking are not obvious at the outset, but can serve as a basis either to allocate more resources or ration by some means. In vertical prioritisation, it is advantageous to organise the prioritization process starting from a general categorisation of health problems/disease groups. As a rule, these categories cover many organisational units/clinical departments, specialties, or professional groups, thus providing a more multidimensional view of the problem. Furthermore, this allows the process to start from a patient/population perspective, which appears to be more goal-oriented than an organisational/staff perspective. That which is ranked, i. e. one of the choices, we refer to as a prioritization object. We suggest that prioritisation objects consist of different combinations of health conditions and interventions. 1 When deciding on the appropriate level of detail, the decision must be based on the context in which prioritisation is carried out. A starting point would be to focus on typical cases, large-volumes services, and controversial care. All forms of vertical prioritisation should be based on the ethical principles that the Riksdag decided should apply in prioritising health services. However, these ethical principles must be made known, clarified, and perhaps complemented before they can be applied to practical priority setting. Furthermore, we believe that the Riksdag’s four so-called priority groups should not be part of the model. The human dignity principle, i. e. that all people should have equal value and equal rights to care irrespective of their personal characteristics and function in society, is the undisputed cornerstone in priority setting. When personal characteristics such as age, gender, lifestyle, or function of a group are expressions of the presence of special needs, so that benefits of the interventions are different, these personal characteristics could be addressed in a priority at the group level. Further discussion is needed regarding the question of how external effects (i. e. the effects of an intervention on families and groups other than the individual directly affected by the intervention) should be valued in priority setting. The concept of need in health care includes both the severity level of the condition and the expected benefits of intervention. As a patient, one needs only those interventions that can be expected to yield benefits. Based on this <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>need,</b> a person does not need an intervention that does not improve health and quality of life, i. e. an intervention with no benefit. In such cases, health services have a responsibility to refer people who seek care for some type of problem, to other appropriate services. The Riksdag’s guidelines regarding the cost-effectiveness principle (applied to individual patients) are too limited to provide guidance for vertical prioritisation at the group level. From the outset, the Government’s bill (Priority Setting in Health Care) highlighted the importance of differentiating a cost-effectiveness principle that applied to choices among various interventions for the individual patient (where the principle can be applied as the Commission of Inquiry proposed) and the aim of health services to achieve high cost-effectiveness in health care generally. Here we also refer to the Riksdag’s directive to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Board. In its decisions on subsidising (prioritising) a drug, the Board should determine, e. g. whether the drug is cost effective from a societal perspective, which requires comparing the patient benefits of the drug to its cost. In such decisions, the cost effectiveness should be considered along with the needs and solidarity principle and the human dignity principle. The proposed working model essentially concurs with the working model used by the National Board of Health and Welfare in developing national guidelines. In describing a national working model, {{it is not possible to}} include every aspect that might be considered. Hence, one must start from the model and decide which other relevant aspects should be included. For instance, the International Classification on Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) can be used as guidance to describe the severity of health conditions. Due to the wealth of variety in outcome measures for different activities, and the limited experience in working with explicit threshold values, we believe would be premature to recommend standardised categories, e. g. risk levels. However, it is important that those working with prioritization describe their reasoning. Primarily, the categories applied by the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) to grade the scientific evidence of an intervention’s effects should be used. Local prioritisation projects with limited resources at their disposal should describe (text) their appraisal of the scientific evidence and reference the scientific sources used. The strength of evidence should be expressed in numbers only when supporting a conclusion of a systematic review by SBU, or other literature reviews of good quality. Prioritisation projects having access to health economic evaluation should, until further notice, adhere to the approach used by the National Board of Health and Welfare and present cost-effectiveness on a scale from low to very high cost per life-year gained or cost per quality-adjusted life-year. Economic evidence should be presented according to the principles applied by the National Board of Health and Welfare. In local projects with limited resources, or problems in consistently acquiring information on cost effectiveness, we recommend that the authors at least discuss cost effectiveness in cases where the priority ranking would be decisively affected when costs are weighed in. A 10 -level ranking list should be used. The ranking list should be complemented by a “don’t do” list for methods that should not be used at all, or not used routinely, and a research and development (R&D) list for methods where the evidence still insufficient to motivate their use in standard practice. In the absence of an objective quantitative/mathematical method, a qualitative method should be used in the appraisal. Here too, we believe that it is not yet possible to establish standard criteria to determine within which ranking level a prioritisation object should fall. Results should be presented as a ranking list. The parameters used as a basis for prioritisation should also be presented in a uniform manner in ranking lists that are shared with other parties. For pedagogic reasons, details concerning language and format need to be adapted to the respective target groups. Thresholds for what constitutes an acceptable coverage of need (care quality, volume, and percentage of the patient group with access to services) are regional and local issues, and hence are not included in the national model...|$|E
