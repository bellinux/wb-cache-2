5|$|Unlike the {{warships}} of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and {{the primary}} means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, {{as well as the}} use of <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials</b> such as Greek fire.

25|$|Prosecutor General's {{technical}} juridical expertise, released {{three months}} after the fire, revealed that no control of Sector 4's City Hall took place in five years. Moreover, use of incompliant, <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials,</b> lack of emergency exits and construction deficiencies hampering evacuation (the verge was higher by 7cm) were among the main causes of the tragedy.|$|E
25|$|Developed under Johann Joachim Becher and Georg Ernst Stahl, phlogiston {{theory was}} an attempt to account for {{products}} of combustion. According to the theory, a substance called phlogiston was released from <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials</b> through burning. The resulting product was termed calx, which was considered a 'dephlogisticated' substance in its 'true' form. The first strong evidence against phlogiston theory came from pneumatic chemists in Britain during the later half of the 18th century. Joseph Black, Joseph Priestley and Henry Cavendish all identified different gases that composed air; however, it was not until Antoine Lavoisier discovered in the fall of 1772 that, when burned, sulphur and phosphorus “gain in weight” that the phlogiston theory began to unravel.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half of 1978, they toured with the Tom Robinson Band, and in 1979, they {{released}} their first album on the Rough Trade Label, <b>Inflammable</b> <b>Material.</b> The band signed a contract with Island Records, but it fell through, leaving the band to release the album on their existing label. Despite the album's independent release, it reached number 14 in the UK Albums Chart and reached Silver status, selling over 100,000 copies. <b>Inflammable</b> <b>Material</b> was the first album distributed by Rough Trade records, and the first independent album to chart in the UK.|$|R
500|$|An {{investigation}} has been launched {{to determine the}} cause of the fire as well as the reason the building had been locked from the outside. To this end, the building was inspected by the KMC, and was subsequently scheduled to be demolished on Thursday, November 23. However, the structure is standing [...] Although no actual cause of the fire has been established, it has been noted that large quantities of <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials,</b> such as adhesives, were stored inside the building. It was also revealed that the factory experienced a similar fire two years previously, but on that occasion there were no fatalities.|$|E

[...] The possibility of arson was discounted, because it was thought {{it would not have}} been perpetrated at so early in the evening.|$|E

[...] The vessel was loaded up with fireworks and other <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials,</b> and towed into Elliott Bay by the tug Goliah and set on fire. [...] Although the vessel burned for hours, it proved difficult to sink. [...] Only when the fireboat Duwamish filled up the vessel with water at high-pressure did the hull finally go under the water during night, off Alki Point.|$|E
50|$|Stiff Little Fingers' debut album, <b>Inflammable</b> <b>Material</b> {{entered the}} UK Albums Chart {{as the highest}} new entry and, coincidentally, the first ever {{completely}} independent album on 21 February 1979, which also happened to be Burns' 21st birthday.|$|R

60|$|Three great wooden towers were erected, {{consisting}} of different stages or stories, where the warriors stood, {{while they were}} wheeled up to the walls. Godfrey, Raymond, and Tancred each had the direction {{of one of these}} towers, and on the fourteenth of July the general assault began. The Turks, on their side, showered on them arrows, heavy stones, and Greek fire--an invention {{consisting of}} naphtha and other <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials,</b> which, when once ignited, could not be quenched by water, but only by vinegar. It was cast from hollow tubes, and penetrating the armor of the Christians, caused frightful agonies.|$|E
60|$|One {{ship was}} christened the Fortune, {{and on this}} the mine was to be {{exploded}} by a slow match, cut so as to explode at a calculated moment. The mine on board the Hope was to be started by a piece of clockwork, which at the appointed time was to strike fire from a flint. Planks and woodwork were piled on the decks {{to give to the}} two vessels the appearance of simple fireships. Thirty-two small craft, saturated with tar and turpentine and filled with <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials,</b> were to be sent down the river in detachments of eight every half hour, to clear away if possible the raft above the bridge and to occupy the attention of the Spaniards.|$|E

50|$|In 1671 CE, a {{treasure}} house at Hilikha, containing a great store {{of gold and}} silver, was burnt down. Enquiry showed that the Bharali Barua, the officer {{in charge of the}} store-house was responsible for the fire, which was caused by his carelessly leaving a lighted pipe near some <b>inflammable</b> <b>material.</b> As a punishment for his carelessness, Bharali Barua was compelled to smoke elephant’s dung.|$|R
60|$|There was one {{inevitable}} {{result of}} magnificent publicity which Amelius failed to consider. His advertisements were certain {{to bring people}} together, who might otherwise never have met in the great world of London, under one roof. All over England, Scotland, and Ireland, he invited unknown guests to pass the evening with him. In such circumstances, recognitions may take place between persons who have lost sight of each other for years; conversations may be held, which might otherwise never have been exchanged; and results may follow, for which {{the hero of the}} evening may be innocently responsible, because two or three among his audience happen to be sitting to hear him on the same bench. A man who opens his doors, and invites the public indiscriminately to come in, runs the risk of playing with <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials,</b> and can never be sure at what time or in what direction they may explode.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a good}} blazing, roaring, soul-stirring fire--a dry-salter's warehouse, {{with lots}} of <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials</b> to give it an intense heart of heat, and fanned by a pretty stiff breeze into ungovernable fury--yet it was as nothing to the fire that raged in Ned's bosom. If he had hated his wife, or been {{indifferent}} to her, he would in all probability, like too many husbands, have sought for congenial society elsewhere, {{and would have been}} harsh to her when obliged to be at home. But Ned loved his wife, and would have made any sacrifice, if by so doing, he could have smoothed her into a more congenial spirit. When, therefore, he found that his utmost efforts were of no avail, and that he was perpetually goaded, and twitted, and tweaked for every little trifle, his spirit was set alight--as he at last remarked in confidence to David Clazie--and all the fire-engines in Europe, Asia, Africa and America couldn't put it out.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Fred, he has {{a circle}} of hungry Parliamenteers about him; young Pitt, a Cornet of Horse, young Lyttelton of Hagley, our old Soissons friend, not to mention others of worse type; to whom this royal Young Gentleman, with his vanities, ambitions, inexperiences, {{plentiful}} inflammabilities, is important for exploding Walpole. He may have, and with great justice I should think, the dim consciousness of talents for doing something better than [...] "write madrigals" [...] in this world; infinitude of wishes and appetites he clearly has;--he is full of <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials,</b> poor youth. And he is the Fireship those older hands make use of for blowing Walpole and Company out of their anchorage. What a school of virtue for a young gentleman;--and for the elder ones concerned with him! He did not get to the Rhine Campaign; nor indeed ever to anything, except to writing madrigals, and being very futile, dissolute and miserable with what of talent Nature had given him. Let us pity the poor constitutional Prince. Our Fritz was only {{in danger of losing}} his life; but what is that, to losing your sanity, personal identity almost, and becoming Parliamentary Fireship to his Majesty's Opposition? ...|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} Lahar {{can be traced}} back to the Mahabharat era. It is said that the famous Lakchhagrih, (a palace built up of Lakh, which is a highly <b>inflammable</b> <b>material),</b> was built by the Kauravas for Pandavas at the end of their exile. As the legend goes, Kaurav wanted to kill Pandavas by burning them inside the Lakchhagrih. One can still find the pieces of charred lakh in the {{outskirts}} of town.|$|R
30|$|In {{the study}} area, the {{occurrence}} of grass ignition is accidental and depends on man, but the area of fire spread is essentially determined by climatic parameters {{and the presence of}} <b>inflammable</b> <b>material,</b> i.e., dry grass. High March temperatures cause a rapid snowmelt and then a low sum of precipitation in April increases the inflammability of the abundant dry grasses on the former fields: the less the density of the tree layer, the higher the abundance of grass and the quantity of <b>inflammable</b> <b>material.</b> Similar results were obtained in studies on savanna–grassland communities in Africa and south-central Brazil: tree cover was found {{to be one of the}} main factors limiting fire there and the predominance of grassy fuel was the primary cause of the high inflammability of these communities (Archibald et al. 2009; Hoffmann et al. 2012; Baudena et al. 2015). A strong association of wildfire risk with an earlier spring snowmelt, and increasing spring and summer temperatures, was also shown for mid-elevation Northern Rockies forests (USA) (Westerling et al. 2006), where grassy <b>inflammable</b> <b>material</b> may be scarce, but the ignition process is similarly related to climatic parameters. Prichard et al. (2017) showed for several fire-prone ecosystems that fire odds are higher in places burnt before. For the Mediterranean region, Moreria et al. (2011) concluded that with increase of fire frequency, homogeneous landscapes covered by fire-prone vegetation are formed. Our results indirectly confirmed these findings: in our area, fire odds increased along the series A 12 -A 13 -A 14, and in that sequence also the area of burning and the frequency of fires increased; fire odds also increased with the extent of the patch size (log transformed) and the increase in the number of burnt patches in the surroundings.|$|R
60|$|While we lay in Callao, we {{received}} from shore several barrels of powder. So {{soon as the}} launch came alongside with them, orders were given to extinguish all lights and all fires in the ship; and the master-at-arms and his corporals inspected every deck {{to see that this}} order was obeyed; a very prudent precaution, no doubt, but not observed at all in the Turkish navy. The Turkish sailors will sit on their gun-carriages, tranquilly smoking, while kegs of powder are being rolled under their ignited pipe-bowls. This shows the great comfort there is in the doctrine of these Fatalists, and how such a doctrine, in some things at least, relieves men from nervous anxieties. But we all are Fatalists at bottom. Nor need we so much marvel at the heroism of that army officer, who challenged his personal foe to bestride a barrel of powder with him--the match to be placed between them--and be blown up in good company, for it is pretty certain that the whole earth itself is a vast hogshead, full of <b>inflammable</b> <b>materials,</b> and which we are always bestriding; at the same time, that all good Christians believe that at any minute the last day may come and the terrible combustion of the entire planet ensue.|$|E
