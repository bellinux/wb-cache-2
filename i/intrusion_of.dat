5|$|Although use of {{the local}} Ocosito-style {{ceramics}} continued, there was a marked <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> K'iche' ceramics from the highlands in the Postclassic period, concentrated particularly {{in the northern part}} of the site but extending to cover the whole. The indigenous accounts of the K'iche' themselves claim that they conquered this region of the Pacific coast, suggesting that the presence of their ceramics is associated with their conquest of Takalik Abaj.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCreary's election, his wife Kate was the {{youngest}} first lady in the Commonwealth's history. Due to the near completion of an annex to the state capitol building by {{the time of}} McCreary's inauguration, he was able to move the official governor's office out of the governor's mansion, freeing his family from the <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> public business into their private quarters. McCreary's receipt of the executive journal and Great Seal of the Commonwealth from outgoing Governor Leslie in the mansion's office {{is believed to be the}} last official act performed by a governor there.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
50|$|About {{a hundred}} million years ago, the area of {{southern}} Quebec was over the New England hotspot, creating the magma <b>intrusions</b> <b>of</b> the Monteregian Hills.

5|$|It {{also led}} to the birth and {{diffusion}} of small independent record labels, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases. Indie labels are considered important to the movement's evolution, because they removed the <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance to experiment with more extreme forms of music.|$|E
5|$|Stela 4 is {{dated to}} AD 396, {{during the reign}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin after the <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> Teotihuacan in the Maya area.

It has a portrait of the king with the Underworld Jaguar God under one arm and the Mexican Tlaloc under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the Teotihuacan War Serpent. Unusually for Maya sculpture, but typically for Teotihuacan, Yax Nuun Ayiin is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile.|$|E

5|$|Eruptions from Mount Cleveland are {{generally}} vulcanian and strombolian in nature, characterized by short explosive ash clouds sometimes accompanied by a'a flows, lava fountains, pyroclastic flows, ash and steam emissions, lava dome growth, and the ejection of breadcrust bombs. Hot springs were reportedly {{found on the}} volcano in the 1800s, and persistent fumarolic activity was observed in the 1980s and 1990s. Mount Cleveland is a site of persistent steam emissions and thermal anomalies that represent constant background activity. During 2011, a summit lava dome formed, by continuous <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> magma at the summit. Late in 2011, nearly 6 explosions demolished the dome. In June 2012, another small dome was observed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> {{urban areas}} into {{wilderness}} {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|Tidal action {{along the}} coast {{affected}} the balance of salinity in coastal marshes and water bodies. The sudden <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> saltwater stressed delicate plants. Fish, shrimp and oysters also suffered the ecological effects of Hurricane Carmen. Flooding on land caused some wildlife to drown. Several parks in Louisiana sustained damage, either from flooding or high winds; losses to Grand Island State Park in particular totaled $114,600. The {{oil and gas industry}} was also affected, and its estimated $24.7million in losses resulted mainly from damage to equipment and offshore facilities. The storm diminished oil production by 1.4 million barrels when it shut down operations for 24 to 48 hours at various locations. Over 60,000 electric cooperative customers lost power.|$|E

50|$|<b>Intrusions</b> <b>of</b> the Coast Range Arc are intruded by {{widespread}} basaltic dikes. These dikes, {{although not}} voluminous, provide an important {{sampling of the}} post-arc lithosphere. Additionally, widespread volcanic belts, such as the Anahim Volcanic Belt, lie {{in the middle of}} the Coast Range Arc. Volcanics that form the Anahim Volcanic Belt are not strictly related to Coast Range Arc subduction, but might have formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding over a place that has experienced active volcanism for a long period of time which is described as the Anahim hotspot. During its formation, it lay beneath granitic <b>intrusions</b> <b>of</b> the Coast Range Arc. The approximately 20 km long Bella Bella and approximately 6 km long Gale Passage dike swarms lie in granitic <b>intrusions</b> <b>of</b> the Coast Range Arc and are used to calculate the first appearance of the Anahim hotspot about 13 and 12 million years ago.|$|R
5|$|After moving ashore, Beryl quickly {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression. It slowed {{due to the}} weakening ridge to its north, and an approaching cold front turned it {{to the north and}} northeast on May29. Despite being well inland, Beryl retained enough convection to remain a tropical cyclone. As Beryl approached the Atlantic Ocean on May30, its convection increased to the south and east of the center, although the <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> dry air resulted in a ragged appearance on satellite imagery. Based on reports from ships, Beryl was upgraded to a tropical storm on May30 near the South Carolina coastline. The approaching front caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. Beryl's circulation became elongated and its associated convection spread northward, suggesting the transition into an extratropical cyclone. By late on May30, Beryl became extratropical, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories. The storm continued to the northeast, later turning to the east-southeast. On June2, a larger extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of Beryl to the southeast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Late on July17, Ma-on {{underwent}} another eyewall replacement {{cycle and}} weakened, despite developing improved outflow and convection {{in the northern}} quadrant. The typhoon's large size prevented re-intensification– gale force winds extended 370km (200mi) east of the center. In addition, the <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> dry air diminished thunderstorms in the western periphery. By July18, Ma-on reached the western extent of the ridge and began a motion to the north toward Japan. The next day, it turned to the northeast as it paralleled the Japan coastline just offshore. At around 1400UTC on July19, Ma-on made landfall on Shikoku as a minimal typhoon. Turning to the east, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before moving over {{the southern tip of}} the Kii Peninsula early on July20. After emerging from the country, Ma-on turned to the southeast. Increased wind shear displaced the convection to the east, although slight re-intensification was expected. However, the JTWC downgraded Ma-on to a tropical depression on July21 after the storm lost much of its convection. The circulation became ill-defined, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July22, noting the system {{was in the process of}} dissipation. However, the JMA maintained Ma-on as a severe tropical storm until July23, by which time the storm had turned to the northeast. The storm became extratropical on July24 near the Kuril Islands, lasting another seven days before dissipating east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|When Typhoon Sudal {{struck the}} island, {{there were about}} 8,000people living on Yap, with about 1,700houses. The typhoon {{destroyed}} 700homes, and left another 900damaged; many of the destroyed homes were wooden. Damage was heaviest in the southeastern portion of the island, including in and around Colonia, the capital city. The strong winds downed trees across the island. Over 90% of the structures on the island were damaged or destroyed, including the hospital, airport, most government facilities, and the water, power and communications systems. One of the five hotels on the island was also destroyed. About 80% of the residents lost power or water after the storm. In the southeastern portion of the island, high waves wrecked most of the coastal homes, and also severely damaged the seawall. The <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> salt water destroyed {{almost all of the}} food crops on the island. Following the typhoon's passage, about 1,000people were left homeless, and another 500 were forced to stay in shelters.|$|E

5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; <b>intrusion</b> <b>of</b> sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
