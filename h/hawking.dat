40|$|<b>Hawks</b> and owls are {{birds of}} prey and are {{frequently}} referred to as raptors— a term that includes the falcons, eagles, vultures, kites, ospreys, northern harriers, and crested caracaras. There are two main groups of hawks: accipiters and buteos. Accipiters are the forest-dwelling <b>hawks.</b> North American species include the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Cooper’s <b>hawk</b> (Accipiter cooperii), and sharpshinned <b>hawk</b> (Accipiter striatus). The buteos are known as the broadwinged or soaring <b>hawks.</b> They are the most commonly observed raptors in North America. Typical species include the red-tailed <b>hawk</b> (Buteo jamaicensis), red-shouldered <b>hawk</b> (Buteo lineatus), broad-winged <b>hawk</b> (Buteo platypterus), Swainson’s <b>hawk</b> (Buteo swainsoni), rough-legged <b>hawk</b> (Buteo lagopus), and ferruginous <b>hawk</b> (Buteo regalis) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{first known}} SGD was prototyped in the mid-1970s, and rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development has meant that SGD capabilities can now be integrated into devices like smartphones.

5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of <b>Hawking</b> radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E

50|$|The Golden <b>Hawk</b> was {{matched with}} three other <b>Hawk</b> models for 1956, and was the only <b>Hawk</b> not {{technically}} considered a sub-model within one of Studebaker's regular passenger car lines; the Flight <b>Hawk</b> coupe was a Champion, the Power <b>Hawk</b> coupe was a Commander, and the Sky <b>Hawk</b> hardtop was a President.|$|R
5|$|Cumberbatch {{featured}} in Michael Dobbs' play, The Turning Point, which aired {{as one of}} a series of TV plays broadcast live on Sky Arts. The play depicted an October 1938 meeting between Soviet spy Guy Burgess, then a young man working for the BBC, and Winston Churchill.

5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting <b>Hawking</b> radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E

50|$|The Studebaker Sky <b>Hawk</b> was a pillarless two-door hardtop coupe {{produced}} by the Studebaker-Packard Corporation for the 1956 model year only. The Sky <b>Hawk</b> was {{considered part of the}} Studebaker President series. One of four models of <b>Hawks</b> available that year, the Sky <b>Hawk</b> was positioned between the flagship Golden <b>Hawk</b> and Power <b>Hawk</b> pillared coupe. Sky <b>Hawks</b> differed from Golden <b>Hawks</b> in that they had less chrome trim and lacked the Golden <b>Hawk's</b> fins. They also had slightly less luxurious interiors, and were powered by the President's 289 cubic inch (4.7 L) V-8 with 210 horsepower (157 kW) standard and 225 horsepower (168 kW) optional (rather than the Packard 352 of the Golden <b>Hawk).</b> The Sky <b>Hawk's</b> base price was $2,477 before options, and 3,050 were produced that year. The Sky <b>Hawk</b> was discontinued for the 1957 model year.|$|R

5|$|In 1975, Stephen <b>Hawking</b> {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict {{with one of the}} basic postulates of quantum mechanics, which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen <b>Hawking</b> {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another.
