25|$|Dusts {{also have}} {{upper and lower}} {{explosion}} limits, though the upper limits are hard to measure and of little practical importance. Lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> for many organic materials {{are in the range}} of 1050g/m³, which is much higher than the limits set for health reasons, as is the case for the LEL of many gases and vapours. Dust clouds of this concentration are hard to see through for more than a short distance, and normally only exist inside process equipment.|$|E
25|$|Controlling gas and vapor {{concentrations}} {{outside the}} <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> {{is a major}} consideration in occupational safety and health. Methods used to control the concentration of a potentially explosive gas or vapor include use of sweep gas, an unreactive gas such as nitrogen or argon to dilute the explosive gas before coming in contact with air. Use of scrubbers or adsorption resins to remove explosive gases before release are also common. Gases can also be maintained safely at concentrations above the UEL, although a breach in the storage container can lead to explosive conditions or intense fires.|$|E

50|$|Below {{a certain}} value, the lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (LEL), {{there is simply}} {{insufficient}} dust to support the combustion at the rate required for an explosion. A combustible concentration at or below 25% of the LEL is considered safe. Similarly, if the fuel/air ratio increases above the upper <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (UEL), there is insufficient oxidant to permit combustion to continue at the necessary rate.|$|R

25|$|In the U.S., OSHA lists vinyl {{chloride}} as a Class IA Flammable Liquid, with a National Fire Protection Association Flammability Rating of 4. Because of its low boiling point, liquid VCM will undergo flash evaporation (i.e., autorefrigerate) upon its release to atmospheric pressure. The portion vaporized will form a dense cloud (more {{than twice as}} heavy as the surrounding air). The risk of subsequent explosion or fire is significant. According to OSHA, the flash point of {{vinyl chloride}} is −78°C (−108.4°F). Its flammable limits in air are: lower 3.6 volume% and upper 33.0 volume%. The <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> are: lower 4.0%, upper 22.05 by volume in air. Fire may release toxic hydrogen chloride (HCl) and carbon monoxide (CO). VCM can polymerise rapidly due to heating and {{under the influence of}} air, light and contact with a catalyst, strong oxidisers and metals such as copper and aluminium, with fire or explosion hazard. As a gas mixed with air, VCM is a fire and explosion hazard. On standing VCM can form peroxides, which may then explode. VCM will react with iron and steel in the presence of moisture. Vinyl chloride is a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure.|$|E

50|$|The {{operating}} principle also works with other combustable fuels besides acetylene, but since most others have narrower <b>explosive</b> <b>limits,</b> {{the effect is}} not as reliable. Common examples are solvent-containing aerosol consumer products such as spray paint or hairspray.|$|E
5000|$|Flammable gases are not {{generally}} explosive under all conditions, and indeed, must be present within specific ranges {{in order to}} be explosive, or flammable. Additionally, oxygen must be present. [...] The flammability limits of gases are expressed in proportions to the other gases present. For example, for methane, the lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (LEL) is 4.4% and the upper <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> (UEL) is 17%. A positive pressure enclosure works by making sure that the methane present in the work area never approaches the 4.4% LEL.|$|R

25|$|Like other hydrocarbons, {{gasoline}} {{burns in}} a limited range of its vapor phase and, coupled with its volatility, this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present. Gasoline has a lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> of 1.4% by volume and an upper <b>explosive</b> <b>limit</b> of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6%, the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable.|$|R
50|$|Mixtures of {{dispersed}} {{combustible materials}} (such as gaseous or vaporised fuels, and some dusts) and air will burn {{only if the}} fuel concentration lies within well-defined lower and upper bounds determined experimentally, referred to as flammability limits or <b>explosive</b> <b>limits.</b> Combustion can range in violence from deflagration through detonation.|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{a mixture}} of air and gas is {{combustible}} depends on the air-to-fuel ratio. For each fuel, ignition occurs only within the explosive range (i.e. the Lower and upper <b>explosive</b> <b>limits).</b> For example, for methane and gasoline vapor, the explosive range is 5-15% and 1.3-6.0% gas to air, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{air-fuel ratio}} determines whether a mixture is {{combustible}} at all, how much energy is being released, {{and how much}} unwanted pollutants are produced in the reaction. Typically a range of fuel to air ratios exists, outside of which ignition will not occur. These are known as the lower and upper <b>explosive</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since {{several types}} of {{secondary}} batteries give off hydrogen and oxygen if overcharged, ventilation of a battery room is critical to maintain the concentration below the lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|R

50|$|Cases {{also exist}} where the {{ignition}} factor {{is not the}} activation energy. For example, a smoke explosion is a very violent combustion of unburned gases contained in the smoke created by a sudden fresh air input (oxidizer input). The interval in which an air/gas mix can burn {{is limited by the}} <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of the air. This interval can be very small (kerosene) or large (acetylene).|$|E
50|$|Dusts {{also have}} {{upper and lower}} {{explosion}} limits, though the upper limits are hard to measure and of little practical importance.

50|$|Explosive atmospheres have {{different}} chemical properties {{that affect the}} likelihood and severity of an explosion. Such properties include flame temperature, minimum ignition energy, upper and lower <b>explosive</b> <b>limits,</b> and molecular weight. Empirical testing is done to determine parameters such as the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG), minimum igniting current (MIC) ratio, explosion pressure and time to peak pressure, spontaneous ignition temperature, and maximum rate of pressure rise. Every substance has a differing combination of properties but {{it is found that}} they can be ranked into similar ranges, simplifying the selection of equipment for hazardous areas.|$|E

5000|$|As its {{boiling point}} is below room temperature, LPG will {{evaporate}} quickly at normal temperatures and pressures {{and is usually}} supplied in pressurised steel vessels. They are typically filled to 80-85% of their capacity to allow for thermal expansion of the contained liquid. The ratio between the volumes of the vaporized gas and the liquefied gas varies depending on composition, pressure, and temperature, but is typically around 250:1. The pressure at which LPG becomes liquid, called its vapour pressure, likewise varies depending on composition and temperature; for example, it is approximately [...] for pure butane at , and approximately [...] for pure propane at [...] LPG is heavier than air, unlike natural gas, and thus will flow along floors and tend to settle in low spots, such as basements. There are two main dangers from this. The first is a possible explosion if the mixture of LPG and air is within the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> {{and there is an}} ignition source. The second is suffocation due to LPG displacing air, causing a decrease in oxygen concentration.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are to {{determine}} the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of LPG/ air and to investigate the effect on <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of LPG/ air when addition of hydrogen and dilution of nitrogen at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. The purpose of diluting with nitrogen is to control the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> range of LPG because hydrogen will extend the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of LPG. This is for safety to avoid the LPG become very flammable fuel {{but at the same time}} to get the best performance of fuel mixing. The experiments were performed in a 20 L closed explosion vessel. The mixtures were ignited by using a spark permanent wire that placed at the centre of the vessel. The pressure-time variations during explosions of LPG/air mixtures in explosion vessel were recorded. The explosion pressure data is used to determine the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> which flame propagation is considered occurred if explosion pressure greater than 0. 1 bar. From the explosion pressure data, the maximum explosion pressure is determined also. In this study, the result shows the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> of LPG is from 2 vol% to 8 vol % of LPG. The addition of 2 and 8 vol% hydrogen in 7 vol% nitrogen reduce the lower explosive limit(LEL) initially 1 vol% to 0 vol% of LPG/air mixture. For safety aspect, the addition too much hydrogen seems very dangerous for application because the mixture is in very flammable condition. The dilution nitrogen seems not give effect in controlling the <b>explosive</b> <b>limits</b> in this case...|$|E
