2500|$|Jenney is {{best known}} for {{designing}} the ten-story Home Insurance Building in Chicago. The building was the first fully metal-framed building, and is considered the first skyscraper. It was built from 1884 to 1885, enlarged in 1891, and demolished in 1931. In his designs, he used metal columns and beams, instead of stone and brick to support the building's upper levels. [...] The steel needed to support the Home Insurance Building weighed only one-third as much as a ten-story building made of heavy masonry. Using this method, the weight of the building was reduced, thus allowing the possibility to construct even taller structures. Later, he solved the problem of <b>fireproof</b> <b>construction</b> for tall buildings by using masonry, iron, and terra cotta flooring and partitions. In the years from 1889 to 1891, he displayed his system {{in the construction of the}} Second Leiter Building, also in Chicago.|$|E

50|$|The east wing {{opened on}} 5 May 1873, with the Midland Railway {{appointing}} Herr Etzensberger (formerly of the Victoria Hotel, Venice) as General Manager. The hotel was competed in Spring 1876. The hotel was expensive, with costly fixtures including a grand staircase, rooms with gold leaf {{walls and a}} fireplace in every room. It had many innovative features such as hydraulic lifts, concrete floors, revolving doors and <b>fireproof</b> floor <b>constructions,</b> though none of the rooms had bathrooms, as was the convention of the time. The hotel {{was taken over by}} the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1922 before closing in 1935, by which time its utilities were outdated and too costly to maintain, such as the armies of servants needed to carry chamber pots, tubs, bowls and spittoons.|$|R
25|$|The Brunswick mill {{was built}} around 1840 in one phase. The main seven storey block that faces the Ashton Canal {{was used for}} spinning. The {{preparation}} was done {{on the second floor}} and the self-acting mules with 400 spindles were arranged transversely on the floors above. The wings contained the blowing rooms, some spinning and ancillary processes like winding. The four storey range facing Bradford Road was used for warehousing and offices. The mill was built by David Bellhouse, but it is suspected that William Fairbairn was involved in the design. It is built from brick, and has slate roofs. <b>Fireproof</b> internal <b>construction</b> was now standard. Brunswick was built using cast iron columns and beams, each floor was vaulted with transverse brick arches. There was no wood in the structure. It was powered by a large double beam engine.|$|R
50|$|Just before 1870, a mill {{was built}} by a joint-stock {{spinning}} company and this financial structure led to {{a new wave of}} mill construction. The phrase Oldham Limiteds describes these companies. Family-run firms continued to build, but grouped into associations such as the Fine Spinners' and Doublers' Association. Joseph Stott of Oldham perfected a method of <b>fireproof</b> floor <b>construction</b> using steel beams supporting brick vaults that in turn supported concrete floors that would support heavier equipment. Ring frames replaced mule frames; they were heavier and larger and were placed transversely, the floors became larger (up to 130 ft wide) and higher to provide light. The bay size in a mill was defined by the positioning of machines. In an 1870 mill the bay was typically 10 ft, and the brick vaults 5 ft though there were variations.|$|R

5000|$|The Evans Manufacturing Company Building, {{also known}} as Metropolitan Supply Company Building, is a {{historic}} building located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States. The Brown-Evans Manufacturing Company, which made men's work clothing, was relocated from Sedalia, Missouri to Cedar Rapids when this bulding was completed in 1919. It {{was built in the}} 4th Street Railroad Corridor, which had attracted various industrial enterprises in the years before and after World War I. The Modern Movement building was designed according to the principles of industrial design of the time in light of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911. [...] Its <b>fireproof</b> masonry <b>construction</b> was intended to lessen the risk of fires. Storage of raw stock was located in the basement, cutting and storage of finished stock was located on the first floor, and sewing was done on the second floor and balcony. Its open floor plan allowed for assembly line production.|$|R
50|$|The {{bank was}} built using <b>fireproofed</b> steel frame <b>construction,</b> with the {{exterior}} being faced with semi-enamel Terra Cotta.

The altar-like constructions from the 18th century developed to constructions similar to church towers and in the 2nd half of the 20th century they developed to 30m high sculptural towers.While originally the towers were mainly made from papier mâché, today materials like steel, aluminium and fibre glass are used to achieve a light and <b>fireproof</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cotton mills {{were huge}} fire risks, cotton fibres {{in the air}} could form an {{explosive}} mixture in their gas-lit interiors. The first mills using <b>fireproof</b> <b>construction</b> were built in Shropshire and Derbyshire in the 1790s and Philips & Lee's mill built in Salford in 1801-2. Fireproofing {{took the form of}} cast iron columns and beams from which sprang jack arches that were infilled with ash or sand and covered with stone flags or floorboards. In some mills timber was also eliminated from the roof structure which was supported by cast or wrought iron trusses. Until the properties of cast iron were properly understood some mills constructed using the early technology collapsed. In Manchester extensive testing of cast iron as a structural material was carried out by Eaton Hodgkinson and William Fairbairn in the early 1820s. <b>Fireproof</b> <b>construction</b> was expensive and timber, sometimes clad in plaster or metal continued to be used throughout the 19th century. Rolled steel beams and reinforced concrete flooring was introduced in a limited way in the 1880s but not widely adopted in Lancashire mills until the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the current Pier 57, a wooden pier also called Pier 57 was located at the site, built in 1907 at the cost of $1.2 million. It was leased to the Grace Line in 1939. On September 29, 1947, a spectacular fire engulfed the pier lasting several days into early October. Over 200 firefighters were dispatched to the blaze, along with numerous fireboats including the John J. Harvey. The fire originated in the structure's wooden support piles, and the fire was attributed to either the preservation of the piles with creosote or another oil substance, or the accumulation of fuel in the wooden beams. The damage was estimated at $5 million. Shortly after the fire, a replacement pier was planned, with the concrete caisson supports selected to provide a <b>fireproof</b> base. <b>Construction</b> began on August 30, 1950. By September 18, 1952, the three concrete boxes were installed. The pier was dedicated on March 5, 1954, and opened on December 29, 1954. In attendance of both events were Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. and city Fire Commissioner Edward Francis Cavanagh, Jr., who had been the Department of Marine and Aviation commissioner that oversaw the planning of the pier. The Grace Line began serving the pier on March 7, 1955 after a dispute with the International Longshoremen's Association. From its opening, the pier served as a terminal for shipping and storage of cargo for the company, replacing the original wooden structure. The company sold its shipping business in 1967. From 1971 until 2003, Pier 57 housed the Hudson Pier Bus Depot for the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA). The pier was vacated in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exterior}} featured loggias, balconies, gables, {{groups of}} chimneys, and tiled roofs. One {{of the chief}} features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes and stained glass. The entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling. The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897. Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with an alcove off it containing the elevators and grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which {{was used as a}} reception room for women. It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of Marie Antoinette, and an antique clock which was once owned by her. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling Delmonico's and Sherry's. It was modeled after the grand salon in King Ludwig's palace at Munich, with satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and Crowninshield's frescoes. Empire in style, the Waldorf's restaurant feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that came opposite them were of mahogany, with ormolu work in the panels. The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, the Francois V Bedroom, which was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits. The old Astoria Hotel, opened in 1897, was situated on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. It was also designed in the German Renaissance style by Henry J. Hardenbergh. With dimensions of 99 x 350 ft, its height, from the floor of the sub-basement, which was 33 ft below the street level, to the roof-line, was about 270 ft, or about 240 ft above the street-level. It was 16 stories in height, including the four stories in the roof.
