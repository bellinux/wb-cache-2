Overcrowding leads to faster and wider spread of diseases due to the limited space in slum housing. Poor living conditions also make slum dwellers more vulnerable to certain diseases.

40|$|We {{propose a}} three step {{procedure}} to investigate measurement bias and response shift, {{a special case}} of measurement bias in longitudinal data. Structural equation modelling is used {{in each of the}} three steps, which can be described as (1) establishing a measurement model using confirmatory factor analysis, (2) detecting measurement bias by testing the equivalence of model parameters across measurement occasions, (3) detecting measurement bias with respect to additional exogenous variables by testing their direct effects on the indicator variables. The resulting model can be used to investigate true change in the attributes of interest, by testing changes in common factor means. Solutions for the issue of constraint interaction and for chance capitalisation in model specification searches are discussed as part of the procedure. The procedure is illustrated by applying it to longitudinal <b>health-related</b> quality-of-life <b>data</b> of HIV/AIDS patients, collected at four semi-annual measurement occasion...|$|R
