30|$|A {{collaboration}} between Hokkaido University, Japan, and Central Department of Geology (CDG), Tribhuvan University, Nepal, began in 2011 {{to study the}} strong-motion characteristics in Kathmandu Valley (Takai et al. 2016). Four strong-motion accelerometers (Mitsutoyo JEP- 6 A 3 - 2) were installed at KTP, TVU, PTN, and THM, in a west to east array (Fig.  1). These accelerometers are bolted to the ground <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> (RC) buildings, except at PTN where the building is a single story masonry structure. These accelerometers operate continuously at a sampling rate of 100  Hz, and the time calibration is carried out using GPS. Although the data loggers are powered with regular 200  V AC supply, backup batteries are employed due to inconsistent electricity supply in the valley. The seismometers recorded a number of earthquakes including the Gorkha Earthquake on April 25, 2015, and its subsequent aftershocks. The seismic activity has largely increased after the Gorkha Earthquake. Four more temporary stations (BKT, RBN, PPR, and KPN) were deployed for 3 months (May 8 to August 6, 2015), after the Gorkha Earthquake, to observe aftershock activity.|$|E

The {{first part of the}} paper deals with basic information about the composition, structure and purpose of the facility and its location, with consequent impact on the calculation of seismic activity. The next part of the paper presents a calculation of required loads in loading, together with all combinations. To determine those loads and combinations used in the Republic of Slovenia, the current standards for building construction, namely Eurocode standards (EN) or slovenian translations of these regulations (SIST EN). These standards are mandatory in all states of the European Union. In addition to all standards and loads also mention the materials used. The central part represents a conceptual design and production of the numerical model. This section is further detailed design of the bearing structure, which varies depending on the source material used. Shown are {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} numerical program. Described is the detailed manufacturing process of the numerical model (linear and planar) in architectural coatings. The last part of the thesis contains an analysis and presentation of results and design elements. Analysis of the structure is performed using the computer program "Dlubal RFEM.

40|$|At {{the design}} of a project for {{remodeling}} the old building and constructing new ones at the dock of the National Navy of Argentina, several additions were introduced to provide the civil staff with necessary installations. &# 13; In {{view of the fact that}} the available space was quite restricted, the work was carried out in the following way: demolition of old buildings, construction of new ones to meet the present requirements and increase of the number of storeys in the already existing buildings. &# 13; For the enlargement of the dining room, wardrobes and other service sections of the civil staff, one of the old buildings has been used, where the roof was replaced by a prefabricated hollow <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete.</b> The thus formed upped floor was covered with self-supporting, also prefabricated terracotta vaults, the cores of which are of reinforced concrete. &# 13; The Labour Relations Office occupies a circular shaped area with walls of concrete blocks that support the terracotta dome. &# 13; Thanks to the use of rationalized construction procedures and to the use of important auxiliary means, the work was carried out in a precise, rapid and economical manner, by mixing members that were prefabricated in series on the site with the traditional construction system. La creación de un plan de construcciones nuevas y remodelación de las antiguas en el dique de la Armada Nacional, se aprovechó para realizar toda una serie de instalaciones necesarias de servicio para el personal civil de dicha organización. &# 13; Para ello, y dado que la superficie disponible era muy limitada, se recurrió a: demolición de antiguos edificios, construyendo otros nuevos más acordes con las necesidades actuales, y ampliación del número de plantas en las edificaciones existentes. &# 13; Para la ampliación del comedor, vestuarios y servicios del personal civil se ha utilizado un viejo edificio, en el que se sustituyó la cubierta por un forjado de losas huecas, prefabricadas, de hormigón armado.

40|$|Two {{complete}} cradle to grave {{life cycle}} assessments are {{conducted for the}} comparison of a house built after today s building standard, TEK 07, and a passive house built after the Norwegian Standard NS 3700 : 2010. Both houses are projected by the building company Nordbohus AS, and are to be constructed in Stord, {{on the west coast}} of Norway. The usable floor area, BRA, is 187 m 2 for both houses, and a lifetime of 50 years is assumed. The houses are constructed with a wooden framework, insulated with mineral wool in the walls and roof, and have a ground lever <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> on a layer of expanded polystyrene. The passive house has, compared to the TEK 07 house a different foundation, 15 cm more mineral wool in the outer walls, 5 cm more in the roof, and better insulated windows and doors. In addition, the thermal conductivity for the outer wall insulation is reduced for the passive house. The house life cycle is divided into several phases. Construction of the house, waste treatment of materials connected to the construction, surface finish and maintenance of the house during the lifetime, water and electrical energy consumption during the house operation and finally demolition and waste treatment of the materials {{after the end of the}} house lifetime. Transportation of workers and materials to the construction site, as well as to waste treatment plant, are included. Generic data from Ecoinvent 2. 0 database is used, but some processes are modified to satisfy Norwegian production information. The Nordel electricity mix is used for Norwegian production and house electricity consumption. SimaPro 7. 1. 8 is used to process the data, and the ReCiPe method, hierarchist midpoint version 1. 03 is used for the impact assessment. It is assumed that both houses have the same heating system, and cover 100 % of the energy needs from electrical energy. For the 50 year life cycle, the passive house has 20 % less impacts to climate change than the TEK 07 house. For the other categories assessed, the passive house has between 10 - 20 % lower impacts than the TEK 07 house. The only exception is impacts to freshwater ecotoxicity, where the passive house impacts are increased with 7 % from the TEK 07 house. The TEK 07 house has impacts to climate change with 1, 6 tons CO 2 eq/m 2 useful floor, while the passive house 1, 3 tons CO 2 eq/m 2 useful floor. Cumulative energy demand is 55 GJ/m 2 and 42 GJ/m 2 respectively. The construction phase is responsible for 13 %, waste treatment of materials connected to construction 1 %, surface finish and maintenance 6 % and end of life waste treatment 4 % of overall climate change impacts for the TEK 07 house. Water and electricity consumption during the operation are thus responsible of 76 % of the TEK 07 life cycle climate change impacts. For the passive house, this is 19 %, 1 %, 7 %, 6 % and 67 % respectively. Main activities contributing to the overall impacts are transportation of materials, workers and waste to and from the construction site, diesel combusted in building machines, production and incineration of EPS/XPS and paint, waste treatment of wood ash, and production of cement and ceramic tiles. A sensitivity analysis of energy consumed by the construction dryer, frequency of house maintenance, a change of house consumption electricity mix to the Norwegian and UCTE electricity mix, and a change to different heating systems for both houses is carried out. The overall conclusion is that it is environmentally beneficial to build, operate and waste treat a passive house compared to a house following the TEK 07 building standard...|$|E

The growth in the office's activities and holdings brought a need for more accommodation and improved facilities. In 1971 the former St George's Church in Charlotte Square was converted into West Register House. Robert Adam, architect of General Register House, designed the frontages of the houses in Charlotte Square and included a plan for a church in his drawings in 1791. The plan was never used and in 1810 Robert Reid drew up a new design. The foundation stone was laid in May 1811 and the building opened to public worship in 1814. The church discovered dry rot in 1959 and, unable to meet the spiralling costs of repair, closed in 1961, the congregation moving to St Andrew's Church along George Street. In 1968 began the process of converting the church into a branch of the Scottish Record Office.

Moreover, these models apply the seismic loads and carry out the time history analysis. The results show that the frame’s stiffness has been weakened after the floor is opened, the peak acceleration reduced and the displacement increased. However, the ductility has been strengthened, which slightly reduce the reaction of the acceleration and displacement. In addition, the appearance of the plastic hinges in the beam are advanced, and the development of their plastic deformation becomes quicker than those of column’s, and the plastic hinges {{in the bottom of the}} column are delayed.

A structural solution contemplating supplementary <b>floors</b> made <b>of</b> small <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs resting on steel beams was implemented in the course of renovation. Pursuant to the proposed design solution, <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs were arranged with their ribs down and leaned upon ribs of metal beams. The findings demonstrate that small <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs rest both on top and bottom ribs of metal beams. Moreover, patterns of arrangement of slabs different from the design solution were implemented. Some slab ribs looked down while others looked up. Therefore, the implemented pattern of arrangement of the above elements was different from the one specified in the design, and the difference caused different values of load that the slabs were exposed to, and the same about the pre-designed cross sections of slabs. Alteration of design solutions concerning the load produced by <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs onto metal beams also caused changes in the levels <b>of</b> supplementary <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> the building versus the design solution. This inconsistency can cause difficulties in terms of design associated with any future reconstruction of a boiler house. The analysis <b>of</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs performed {{in the course of the}} research confirms the possibility of their arrangement according to the pattern different from the one specified in the design. Рассмотрены конструктивные решения реконструируемых перекрытий по металлическим балкам с различным положением мелкоразмерных железобетонных плит заполнения. При выполнении авторами обследования этих перекрытий выяснилось, что отступая от проектного решения, которое определяло опирание мелкоразмерных ребристых плит на нижние полки двутавровых металлических балок ребрами вверх, при возведении перекрытий плиты укладывались на нижние и верхние полки балок, ребрами вниз и вверх. Выполненный расчет подтвердил возможность различного положения плит...|$|R
50|$|Work {{began in}} 1903, with the {{construction}} of various outbuildings, including thatched semi-detached gardeners' cottages and a complex of gardens. Initially experiments with construction techniques using materials derived from the site were carried out, for example {{in the construction of the}} walls of vegetable garden. The main house was not begun until 1904, when the sunken flower garden, 1 acre and 6 ft deep, was excavated to provide aggregates for the construction of the house itself. Pebbles were used for facing the walls, gravel for concrete and sand for general building purposes. Surface earth was used for the terraces. The excess ballast produced was sold to local authorities. Local carstone was employed, quarried near Sandringham, as were tiles made of local Norfolk clay, though some materials had to be got from Cambridgeshire when supplies ran out. Oak was also obtained locally. The house is constructed of mass concrete made of local lime and the materials derived from the site. The flint facing is tied to the external walls with carstone and fixed to the core with bricks. The lace coursings of tile-bricks binds and reinforces the structure. Galletting with flints was widely used. The <b>floors</b> are <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>reinforced</b> with iron chains. The roof is covered in local pantiles.|$|R
5000|$|After her post-Crisis origin {{was created}} Donna regained the powers {{she had lost}} at the Titans of Myth's behest, but now they were {{virtually}} identical to Diana's. Donna and Diana also share a psychic rapport which allows one to feel either what the other is experiencing or even share dreams. Shortly after her resurrection as the Goddess of the Moon, during the Return of Donna Troy limited series, Donna's powers were enhanced and upgraded. She retained all of the abilities she had before, and regained her energy manipulation abilities (which, being cosmic-based, were far more powerful). She also commanded darkness and cold to great effect. Donna has not been shown using those powers since regaining her memories. Over the years, Donna has grown extremely powerful, with power and strength, almost rivaling her big sister, Diana (Wonder Woman). She {{is considered to be}} one of the strongest superheroines of the DC Universe along with Power Girl, Supergirl, Big Barda, Mary Marvel, and Wonder Woman. Donna also has incredible super-speed. She is fast enough to outrace bullets with ease, and like Wonder Woman, she's said to be able to move at speeds far beyond the speed of sound. She has been shown moving fast enough to catch up to speedsters such as Jesse Quick. While not totally invulnerable, Donna has a very high degree of resistance to injury. Donna has been punched through several <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>reinforced</b> steel and <b>concrete,</b> as well as taken on powerful beings such as Etrigan, Black Mary Marvel, Wonder Woman, Superwoman, Black Adam, and Superman.|$|R
