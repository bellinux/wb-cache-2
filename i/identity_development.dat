25|$|Research since reveals self-examination {{beginning}} {{early in}} adolescence, but identity achievement rarely occurring before age 18. The freshman {{year of college}} influences <b>identity</b> <b>development</b> significantly, but may actually prolong psychosocial moratorium by encouraging reexamination of previous commitments and further exploration of alternate possibilities without encouraging resolution. For the most part, evidence has supported Erikson's stages: each correlates with the personality traits he originally predicted. Studies also confirm the impermanence of the stages; there is no final endpoint in <b>identity</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Identity</b> <b>development</b> is a {{stage in}} the {{adolescent}} life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are liklely to cycle {{through a number of}} identities to find one that suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as <b>identity</b> <b>development,</b> rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of <b>identity</b> <b>development</b> are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood. Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also {{plays an important role in}} their <b>identity</b> <b>development.</b> Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.|$|E

500|$|Margaret Beale Spencer and Vinay Harpalani (2008) {{argue that}} {{usage of the}} term [...] "acting white" [...] by black {{teenagers}} does not reflect their cultural values; rather, it is a manifestation of their racial <b>identity</b> <b>development,</b> experienced in conjunction with normal adolescent hassles and peer pressure. [...] Spencer and Harpalani employ William E. Cross's (1991) Nigrescence framework and contend that black teenagers' use of [...] "acting white" [...] in relation to academic achievement is similar to white teenagers' {{use of the term}} [...] "nerd": {{the only difference is that}} black teenagers express it in racialized terms, as in addition to normal teenage peer pressure, they are grappling with racial identity and what it means to be [...] "black". [...] Expressions such as [...] "acting white" [...] may or may not reflect black teenagers' cultural values, and their usage is sometimes counterintuitive: for example, Ogbu (2003) himself documented one instance where a black teenage girl with natural hair was accused of [...] "acting white" [...] by her black peers because [...] "like white people, she did not have to process her hair." [...] These kind of examples show that accusations of [...] "acting white" [...] are not fundamentally about black cultural attributes (although such accusations may reflect these attributes). [...] Rather, [...] "acting white" [...] is just a manifestation of racial <b>identity</b> <b>development</b> for black children and teenagers, who are learning and defining for themselves what it means to be [...] "black"—in conjunction with normal adolescent peer pressure and hassles. That is also why such accusations are less common among black adults, who have come to greater resolution regarding racial identity issues.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} {{identity}} was established {{from the beginning}} of Angelou's series of autobiographies, with the opening lines in Caged Bird, which [...] "foretell Angelou's autobiographical project: to write the story of the developing black female subject by sharing the tale of one Southern Black girl's becoming". [...] Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. [...] Feminist scholar Maria Lauret has made a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret called [...] "fictions of subjectivity" [...] and [...] "feminist first-person narratives", with fictional first-person narratives (such as The Women's Room by Marilyn French and The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing) written during the same period. [...] Both genres employed the narrator as protagonist and used [...] "the illusion of presence in their mode of signification". Scholar Yolanda M. Manora agreed, stating that Angelou broke stereotypes of African-American women by describing these images and stereotypes, and then disproving them, which set the stage for Angelou's <b>identity</b> <b>development</b> in her later autobiographies.|$|E

500|$|Towards her [...] "weak perfectionist" [...] liberalism, Levinson {{requires}} three {{traits of}} a liberal society: (1) an agreeable, transparent, and equally accessible [...] "legitimation process" [...] for government, (2) pluralism, and (3) [...] "substantive liberal institutions" [...] such as [...] "individual liberties and ... governmental duties". She pairs this view of liberalism with thick autonomy as [...] "the only defensible interpretation of liberalism". Levinson develops an idea of autonomy that would be agreeable to most citizens while sufficient to guarantee liberalism's [...] "substantive liberal institutions", and defines it as [...] "higher-order preference formation" [...] that minds one's personal values while allowing for openness to criticism and a developed personality. She argues that capacity for autonomy is a right to children, {{that the state is}} obligated to facilitate it, and that children are obligated to receive it. In this way, Levinson's stance is that the state must make education compulsory. Children require paternalistic decisions of some sort, and the state is best suited to promote consent and operate {{in the best interests of}} children. The state has a right to override lack of child and parental interest in such an autonomy-promoting education, since such an override lets children decide their values later in life, as adults, as opposed to never having that opportunity. Levinson contends that parents, on the other hand, must provide for the well-being, <b>identity</b> <b>development,</b> and [...] "cultural coherence" [...] sense of their children.|$|E

2500|$|There is some {{evidence}} linking prenatal hormonal influences on sexual orientation, gender identity and transsexual development, {{but this is an}} area of behavioral research that remains controversial. Several published studies in the medical literature on psychoneuroendocrinology have examined the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to estrogens (including DES) may cause significant developmental impact on sexual differentiation of the brain, and on subsequent behavioral and gender <b>identity</b> <b>development</b> in exposed males and females. One of the leading investigators of this area of research is June Reinisch, former director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction.

2500|$|An adolescent's {{environment}} plays a huge role {{in their}} <b>identity</b> <b>development.</b> While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, {{studies show that the}} more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case {{during the middle of the}} 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. [...] So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. [...] Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. [...] While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful <b>identity</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to ignoring patients' voices, physicians involved in intersex care had embarrassingly little long-term outcome {{data to support}} their claims. In 1997 a patient account was published {{which could not be}} ignored. David Reimer's tragic story, told in both popular and medical publications, was widely interpreted by the public and many physicians as a cautionary tale of medical hubris, of the folly of attempting to foil nature with nurture, of the importance of early hormones on brain development, and the risks and limitations of surgery. [...] Some clinicians proposed a moratorium on pediatric sex reassignment, particularly of undervirilized males as females, {{due to a lack of}} data that rearing or appearance of genitalia play a major part in gender <b>identity</b> <b>development.</b> [...] Those clinicians encouraged delaying surgery until elected by adolescents in order to preserve sexual sensitivity.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{coming out}} {{story is the}} person {{trying to come to}} terms with who they are and their sexual orientation. Several models have been created to {{describe}} coming out as a process for gay and lesbian <b>identity</b> <b>development,</b> e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the Cass identity model established by Vivienne Cass. This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. [...] Regardless of whether LGBT youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping. High school students and even middle school students are coming out.|$|E
2500|$|Bisexuality as a {{transitional}} identity {{has also been}} examined. In a longitudinal study about sexual <b>identity</b> <b>development</b> among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, Rosario et al. [...] "found evidence of both considerable consistency and change in LGB sexual identity over time". Youths who had identified as both gay/lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately {{three times more likely}} to identify as gay/lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments. Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments, 60 to 70 percent continued to thus identify, while approximately 30 to 40 percent assumed a gay/lesbian identity over time. Rosario et al. suggested that [...] "although there were youths who consistently self-identified as bisexual throughout the study, for other youths, a bisexual identity served as {{a transitional}} identity to a subsequent gay/lesbian identity." [...] By contrast, a longitudinal study by Lisa M. Diamond, which followed women identifying as lesbian, bisexual, or unlabeled, found that [...] "more women adopted bisexual/unlabeled identities than relinquished these identities," [...] over a ten-year period. The study also found that [...] "bisexual/unlabeled women had stable overall distributions of same-sex/other-sex attractions." [...] Diamond has also studied male bisexuality, noting that survey research found [...] "almost as many men transitioned at some point from a gay identity to a bisexual, queer or unlabeled one, as did from a bisexual identity to a gay identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|The art of {{narrative}} is, by definition, an aesthetic enterprise, {{and there are}} a number of artistic elements that typically interact in well-developed stories. Such elements include the essential idea {{of narrative}} structure with identifiable beginnings, middles, and endings, or exposition-development-climax-resolution-denouement, normally constructed into coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality, which includes retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on characters and characterization which is [...] "arguably the most important single component of the novel"; a given heterogloss of different voices dialogically at play [...] "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers"; possesses a narrator or narrator-like voice, which by definition [...] "addresses" [...] and [...] "interacts with" [...] reading audiences (see Reader Response theory); communicates with a Wayne Booth-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, conditioning a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, [...] "arguing" [...] for and against various positions; relies substantially on now-standard aesthetic figuration, particularly including the use of metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony (see Hayden White, [...] for expansion of this idea); is often enmeshed in intertextuality, with copious connections, references, allusions, similarities, parallels, etc. to other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward bildungsroman, a description of <b>identity</b> <b>development</b> with an effort to evince becoming in character and community.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationships}} adolescents {{have with}} their peers, family, {{and members of}} their social sphere {{play a vital role}} in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. [...] "The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and,... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons)." [...] This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and <b>identity</b> <b>development.</b> These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.|$|E
