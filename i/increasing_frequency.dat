5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with <b>increasing</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with <b>increasing</b> <b>frequency,</b> converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E

However, studies that empirically measured the {{performance of}} these microkernels did not analyze the reasons of such inefficiency. The explanations of this data were left to [...] "folklore", {{with the assumption that}} they were due to the <b>increased</b> <b>frequency</b> of switches from [...] "kernel-mode" [...] to [...] "user-mode", to the <b>increased</b> <b>frequency</b> of inter-process communication and to the <b>increased</b> <b>frequency</b> of context switches.|$|R

5|$|Burma in the 15th {{century was}} divided into four {{principal}} power centers: the Ava Kingdom in present-day central Burma, the Hanthawaddy Kingdom on the southern coast, the Mrauk-U Kingdom (Arakan) in the west, and various Shan States {{in the east and}} the north. Beginning in the 1480s, Ava began to disintegrate into even smaller kingdoms. By the early 15th century, Ava's former vassals—Mohnyin (and its allies Confederation of Shan States) in the north and the Prome Kingdom (Pyay) in the south—were regularly raiding their former overlord's territory with <b>increasing</b> <b>frequency</b> and intensity.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the <b>increasing</b> <b>frequency</b> and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the <b>increasing</b> <b>frequency</b> of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E

The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements {{to abandon their}} new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with <b>increasing</b> <b>frequency,</b> independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{was born}} in Churwell, a village close to Morley, on 12 February 1857. He {{was the son of}} a miner, and Peel himself worked in the mines for a time. From the age of 16, he played with <b>increasing</b> <b>frequency</b> for the Churwell cricket team, and by 1882 was part of the Yorkshire Colts. At the time, Edmund Peate was the first-choice left-arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team, and his {{presence}} restricted Peel's opportunities. An injury to Peate allowed Peel to make his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Surrey at Sheffield on 10 July 1882. Peel took nine wickets in the game, including five for 83 (five wickets taken while conceding 83 runs) in the second innings. Lord Hawke—who assumed the captaincy of Yorkshire later that season—subsequently described Peel's debut as one of the most impressive for Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|For {{the early}} part of the era, the {{authority}} of the crown was limited by the large number of minorities it had seen since the early fifteenth century. This tended to decrease the level of royal revenues, as regents often alienated land and revenues. Regular taxation was adopted from 1581 and afterwards was called on with <b>increasing</b> <b>frequency</b> and scale until in 1612 a demand of £240,000 resulted in serious opposition. A new tax on annual rents amounting to five per cent on all interest on loans, mainly directed at the merchants of the burghs, was introduced in 1621; but it was widely resented and was still being collected over a decade later. Under Charles I the annual income from all sources in Scotland was under £16,000 sterling and inadequate for the normal costs of government, with the court in London now being financed out of English revenues. The sum of £10,000 a month from the county assessment was demanded by the Cromwellian regime, which Scotland failed to fully supply, but it did contribute £35,000 in excise a year. Although Parliament made a formal grant of £40,000 a year to Charles II, the rising costs civilian government and war meant that this was inadequate to support Scottish government. Under William I and after the Union, engagement in continental and colonial wars led to heavier existing taxes and new taxes, including the Poll and Hearth Taxes.|$|E
5|$|For {{the early}} part of the era, the {{authority}} of the crown was limited by the large number of minorities it had seen since the early fifteenth century, with every monarch coming to the throne as a minor between 1406 and 1625. This tended to decrease the level of royal revenues, as regents, lacking the royal authority to create support, often alienated land and revenues, with Margaret Tudor reducing royal income from about £30,000 Scots to £13,000 in the minority of James V. James V was able to extract the heaviest taxation every levied on the Scottish church in exchange for his continued loyalty to the papacy, taking £72,000 in four years.
