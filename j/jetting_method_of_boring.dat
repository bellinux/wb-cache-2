40|$|Flow {{separation}} is mostly an undesirable phenomenon and boundary layer control {{is an important}} technique for flow&# 13; separation problems on airfoils and in diffusers. Longitudinal (streamwise) vortices are produced by the interaction&# 13; between jets and a freestream.

The vortex generator <b>jet</b> <b>method</b> is an active control technique that provides a time-varying control action to&# 13; optimize performance under a wide range of flow conditions because the strength of longitudinal vortices can be&# 13; adjusted by varying the jet speed. In the present study, an active separation control system using vortex generator jets&# 13; with rectangular orifices has been developed. The active separation control system can be practically applied to the&# 13; flow separation control of a two-dimensional diffuser.

40|$|The precise {{prediction}} of maximum {{load carrying capacity}} <b>of</b> <b>bored</b> piles is a complex problem because the load {{is a function of}} a large number of factors. These factors include <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>boring,</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> concreting, quality of concrete, expertise of the construction staff, the ground conditions and the pile geometry. To ascertain the field performance and estimate load carrying capacities of piles, in-situ pile load tests are conducted. Due to practical and time constraints, it is not possible to load the pile up-to failure. In this study, field pile load test data is analyzed to estimate the ultimate load for friction piles. The analysis is based on three pile load test results. The tests are conducted at the site of The Cultural and Recreational Complex project in Port Said, Egypt. Three pile load tests are performed on <b>bored</b> piles <b>of</b> 900 mm diameter and 50 m length. Geotechnical investigations at the site are carried out to a maximum depth of 60 m. Ultimate capacities of piles are determined according to different methods including Egyptian Code of practice (2005), Tan-gent-tangent, Hansen (1963), Chin (1970), Ahmed and Pise (1997) and Decourt (1999). It was concluded that approxi- mately 8 % of the ultimate load is resisted by bearing at the base of the pile, and that up to 92 % of the load is resisted by friction along the shaft. Based on a comparison of pile capacity predictions using different method, recommendations are made. A new method is proposed to calculate the ultimate capacity of the pile from pile load test data. The ultimate capacity <b>of</b> the <b>bored</b> piles predicted using the proposed method appears to be reliable and compares well to different available methods...|$|R

40|$|Proposed {{configurations}} for {{the next}} generation of transatmospheric vehicles will rely on air breathing propulsion systems during all or part of their mission. At flight Mach numbers greater than about 7 these engines will operate in the supersonic combustion ramjet mode (scramjet). Ground testing of these engine concepts above Mach 8 requires high pressure, high enthalpy facilities such as shock tunnels and expansion tubes. These impulse, or short duration facilities have test times on the order of a millisecond, requiring high speed instrumentation and data systems. One such facility ideally suited for scramjet testing is the NASA-Ames 16 -Inch shock tunnel, which over the last two years has completed a series of tests for the NASP (National Aero-Space Plane) program at simulated flight Mach numbers ranging from 12 - 16. The focus of the experimental programs consisted of a series of classified tests involving a near-full scale hydrogen fueled scramjet combustor model in the semi-free <b>jet</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> engine testing whereby the compressed forebody flow ahead of the cowl inlet is reproduced (see appendix A). The AIMHYE- 1 (Ames Integrated Modular Hypersonic Engine) test entry for the NASP program was completed in April 1993, while AIMHYE- 2 was completed in May 1994. The test entries were regarded as successful, resulting in some of the first data of its kind on the performance of a near full scale scramjet engine at Mach 12 - 16. The data was distributed to NASP team members for use in design system verification and development. Due to the classified nature of the hardware and data, the data reports resulting from this work are classified and have been published as part of the NASP literature.
