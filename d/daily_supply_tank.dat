50|$|Cleaning is {{accomplished}} by inserting a choke plug {{into one of the}} lines leading to the transfer pump, and sucking large volumes of water from a wash-water <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> into the choked line. This choke plug is mounted on a rod, and is inserted into the line before cleaning, and pulled out for regular milking. Due to the choke, the water, which is sufficient to completely fill the pipe, is sucked up one side of the pipeline, over the high point joining the two pipeline sections, and then flows back to the receiver bowl and transfer pump through the unchoked line. The transfer pump is then used to move the cleaning solution from the receiver bowl back to the wash-water <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> to restart the process.|$|R

5000|$|Under {{this system}} a {{water-tight}} growing bed, containing either clean gravel or coarse sand as the rooting medium, is periodically flooded {{for a short}} period (5 to 10 minutes) with a nutrient solution pumped from a <b>supply</b> <b>tank.</b> By placing the nutrient solution <b>supply</b> <b>tank</b> below the growing bed, the nutrient solution can drain back by gravity. This hydroponic growing system is little used today other than for hobby-type systems. The method is inefficient in its use of water and plant nutrient reagents. Root disease occurrence and nutrient element insufficiencies can occur with repeated use of the nutrient solution. Because it is a [...] "closed‚Äù system, the re-circulated nutrient solution will require reconstitution, filtering, and sterilization. Within the growing period, the nutrient solution may require replacement. The rooting medium will require washing to remove root debris and accumulated precipitates as well as sterilization before reuse.|$|R

50|$|In July 1917, two Gun Carrier Companies {{were formed}} of 24 {{vehicles}} each. Probably {{none of them}} ever fired a shot. As breakthroughs never materialized the vehicles were ultimately only used as <b>supply</b> <b>tanks.</b> It was calculated a single tank had the same carrying capacity as 291 human porters. The first Gun Carrier Tanks arrived in France before the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July - 10 November 1917) and were attached to XVIII Corps. The gun carriers were first used at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July - 2 August 1917) {{and by the end}} of the year 44 were in France. The gun carriers moved 60-pounder guns and several hundred tons of ammunition. The gun carriers were rarely employed as mobile artillery but as <b>supply</b> <b>tanks</b> they had much greater capacity than converted Mk I and Mk IV tanks and were well-suited to the conditions of the Western Front and they would remain in constant use until the end of hostilities.|$|R
