5|$|During {{the same}} off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles {{had failed to}} control Washington. During the trial, {{numerous}} players and coaches {{who were at the}} game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> portrayed as a dangerous rogue. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.|$|E
5|$|On the Danubian plains {{north of}} Vienna, the summer battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram shaped {{the outcome of}} the 1809 campaign. Klenau's forces played a {{critical}} role at both. At Aspern-Essling, Napoleon's army was decisively defeated {{for the first time in}} northern Europe, demonstrating that the master of Europe could <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> mastered. After their defeat at Wagram, the Austrians withdrew into Moravia, leaving the French in control of that part of the Danube valley; Wagram was the largest European land-battle to date, engaging 262 battalions and 202 squadrons—153,000 men—for France and her allies, and 160 battalions and 150 squadrons—135,000 men—on the Austrian side.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 43 in {{the first}} innings, the second Test in Lahore came down to a run-chase for Australia, with Harvey and Norm O'Neill {{seemingly}} on schedule to win before time ran out. However, the Pakistani fielders began to waste time {{in an attempt to}} foil an Australian victory. They swapped the cover and midwicket fielders very slowly whenever the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single and changed the batsman on strike. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away from a straight ball and let <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> bowled, throwing his wicket away for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give the Pakistanis no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Australia won the match with minutes to spare. Harvey scored 54 and 13 not out in the drawn third Test at Karachi. Australia took the series 2–0, but would not win another Test in Pakistan until 1998. Harvey ended the series with 273 runs at 54.60.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season O'Neill was Australia's leading batsman {{during the}} 1959–60 tour to Pakistan and India, {{where he was}} a part of the last Australian team to win a Test on Pakistani soil for 39 years. After a quiet match in the First Test eight-wicket win in Dacca in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), in which he scored two and 26 not out, O'Neill played a key role in the victory in the Second Test in Lahore that was to Australia's last in Pakistan until 1998. O'Neill made his maiden Test century of 134 in the first innings to give Australia a 245-run lead. He then took his maiden Test wicket in Pakistan's second innings, that of Shujauddin. This left Australia chasing a target of 122 in the last two hours on the final day. The chase was on schedule with O'Neill partnering Neil Harvey when the Pakistanis began wasting time to prevent an Australian victory. This was implemented by swapping fielders very slowly when the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single, and overs began taking seven minutes instead of three. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away when a ball was aimed at the stumps and threw away his wicket by letting <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> bowled for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Benaud then threatened Pakistani captain Imtiaz Ahmed with a formal complaint over the time-wasting, and proceesings returned to their normal pace. Australia made the target with a few minutes to spare, with O'Neill on 43. O'Neill failed to make double figures in the final Test, which was drawn, but ended the series with 218 runs at 72.66. In another tour match, against the President's XI, O'Neill scored an unbeaten 52 in a low-scoring match as Australia stumbled to their target of 116 with only three wickets in hand.|$|E

25|$|The Childermass, after a {{traditional}} {{name for the}} Feast of the Holy Innocents, is the opening novel of Wyndham Lewis's trilogy The Human Age. In the novel The Fall (La Chute) by Albert Camus, the incident is argued by the main character to be the reason why Jesus chose to let <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> crucified—as he escaped the punishment intended for him while many others died, he felt responsible and died in guilt. A similar interpretation is given in José Saramago's controversial The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, but there attributed to Joseph, Jesus' stepfather, rather than to Jesus himself. As depicted by Saramago, Joseph knew of Herod's intention to massacre the children of Bethlehem, but failed to warn the townspeople and chose only to save his own child. Guilt-ridden ever after, Joseph finally expiates his sin by letting <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> crucified (an event not narrated in the New Testament).|$|E

25|$|Even {{as a young}} boy, Ryelandt had a mind of his own.

25|$|Because of his {{position}} as {{the heir to the}} throne after his elder brother Gustav, he was early targeted as a useful tool for the opposition to his brother: already in the 1760s, the Caps (party) tried to use him against his brother the crown prince through his then love interest countess Brita Horn, daughter of the Cap's politician Adam Horn. This was in the critical period following the December Crisis (1768). Gustav, however, was always careful to prevent Charles from being used by the opposition, which came to its first test during the 1768 crisis, when Charles, ultimately, did not let <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> used by the Caps party. In 1770, he made a journey through Germany and France alone.|$|E
