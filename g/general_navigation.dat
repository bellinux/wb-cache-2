25|$|Line arrows {{are placed}} {{to help the}} divers to {{establish}} the direction they come from, when they later need to find the way out, but should not alter the <b>general</b> <b>navigation</b> information of the system, so line arrows are added only where they cannot cause other groups to become confused about the direction to the nearest air source. An arrow would be added {{at the point of}} attachment of a reel line when tying off to explore new areas, and may be removed after return and removal of the temporary line. If the place is to be marked for future reference, the arrow may be left in place.|$|E
60|$|Various {{members of}} the crew wander past to look at us. This little {{promenade}} deck is over the first-class quarters, full in the stern. So we see first one head then another come up the ladder--mostly bare heads: and one figure after another slouches past, smoking a cigarette. All crew. At last the q-b stops one of them--it is what they are all waiting for, an opportunity to talk--and asks if the weird object {{on the top of}} Pellegrino is a ruin. Could there be a more touristy question! No, it is the semaphore station. Slap in the eye for the q-b! She doesn't mind, however, and the member of the crew proceeds to converse. He is a weedy, hollow-cheeked town-product: a Palermitan. He wears faded blue over-alls and informs us he is the ship's carpenter: happily unemployed {{for the rest of his}} life, apparently, and taking it as rather less than his dues. The ship once did the Naples-Palermo course--a very important course--in the old days of the <b>General</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company. The <b>General</b> <b>Navigation</b> Company sold her for eighty thousand liras years ago, and now she was worth two million. We pretend to believe: but I make a poor show. I am thoroughly sick to death of the sound of liras. No man can overhear ten words of Italian today without two thousand or two million or ten or twenty or two liras flying like venomous mosquitoes round his ears. Liras--liras--liras--nothing else. Romantic, poetic, cypress-and-orange-tree Italy is gone. Remains an Italy smothered in the filthy smother of innumerable Lira notes: ragged, unsavoury paper money so thick upon the air that one breathes it like some greasy fog. Behind this greasy fog some people may still see the Italian sun. I find it hard work. Through this murk of Liras you peer at Michael Angelo and at Botticelli and the rest, and see them all as through a glass, darkly. For heavy around you is Italy's after-the-war atmosphere, darkly pressing you, squeezing you, milling you into dirty paper notes. King Harry was lucky that they only wanted to coin him into gold. Italy wants to mill you into filthy paper Liras.|$|E

50|$|The {{downside}} to the K band system {{was a lack}} of power in the magnetrons. Being physically much smaller than the X band versions, they were difficult to cool when operated at higher power levels.

50|$|At {{the rear}} of the CSBS is a large compass with a slip ring {{carrying}} a rotating compass rose known as the bearing plate. The bearing plate has lines on it that are used to represent the wind direction during manual calculations.

50|$|Although these {{parameters}} {{limit the}} usefulness of the RTK technique for <b>general</b> <b>navigation,</b> the technique is perfectly suited to roles like surveying. In this case, the base station is located at a known surveyed location, often a benchmark, and the mobile units can then produce a highly accurate map by taking fixes relative to that point. RTK has also found uses in autodrive/autopilot systems, precision farming, machine control systems and similar roles.|$|E

It was also widely used as a <b>general</b> <b>navigation</b> system, allowing landmarks to be identified at long range.|$|E
