When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E
25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

If [...] were concerned {{and wanted to be}} part of the American debate…it struck me as…sort of odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by China, and that he would then go to Russia—two countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships." [...] As Clinton saw it, [...] "turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority." [...] Clinton later said that if Snowden wished to return to the U.S., [...] "knowing he would be held accountable," [...] he would have the right [...] "to launch both a legal defense and a public defense, which can of course affect the legal defense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Haye and Enzo Maccarinelli (28-1, 21 KOs) met in an all-British world cruiserweight title fight, in {{the early}} hours of 9 March 2008 at O2 Arena in London. Haye's WBA, WBC, and The Ring titles were at stake, while Maccarinelli's WBO title was on the line. British trade paper Boxing News {{produced}} a pullout special on the match, which was widely billed as the biggest all-British bout since Chris Eubank met Nigel Benn. As both fighters are hard punchers with excellent KO records, a short fight was predicted. These predictions proved to be correct, as Haye knocked out Maccarinelli in the second round of the contest. Commenting on the fight and of the prospect of working again with Frank Warren, Maccarinelli's promoter, Haye said, [...] "We thank Frank for sacrificing Maccarinelli, but we'd feel immense guilt if we took any more free money from Sports Network. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> enough time sleeping at night as it is." ...|$|E
