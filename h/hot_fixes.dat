40|$|Metal leaf (gold, silver {{or their}} alloys) glass {{tesserae}} {{began to be}} used in wall mosaics in the first century AD (the first examples are in Rome) and their use has been uninterrupted up to day. The metal leaf could be obtained from circulating coins, jewellery or refining. According to various techniques that have changed over the centuries, the leaf was <b>hot</b> <b>fixed</b> between two glass layers. From an archaeological point of view, it is interesting to know when and where these tesserae were made, if they were new made or if they were reused tesserae recovered from earlier dismantled mosaics. The determination of the glass composition of the tesserae is not of great help in this connection, for the same kind of glass was used over long periods. Available information is still scanter for glasses produced between the 1 st to 8 th centuries when the batch of raw materials (a natural soda called natron and a silica-lime sand) was melted in large tank furnaces and chunks of raw glass were transported all over the Mediterranean to be remelted and shaped into manufacts in small pot furnaces. The SEM-EDS analysis is proposed in this study as a useful tool to investigate the composition of both the glass and the gold alloy in leaf tesserae from mosaics of the 1 st - 9 th centuries. The comparison of the composition of the gold leaf of the tesserae with that of circulating gold coins (for which an important analytical data base is available), adds further information to the glass analysis, allowing us to improve the dating of the tesserae and increase the knowledge that may result from scientific analyses. The results demonstrate that good quantitative analyses of the metal leaf can be performed and that metal leaves made of pure gold or gold-silver alloys were used...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} over-subscription and pre-listing information in fixed-price IPOs. We find a strong negative relation between investors' opportunity cost of fund and over-subscription. Since investors are required to make upfront payment {{at the time of}} IPO applications, lengthy offer period increases investors' opportunity cost of fund and thus reduces their interests in the IPOs. To increase over-subscription, firms should time their IPOs to coincide with periods of large positive initial returns and low volume of IPO activity. We find that over-subscription is negatively correlated with offer price but is not significantly related to issue size.

40|$|Testing vendor-issued patches {{remains one}} of the major hurdles to their speedy deployment. Studies have shown that administrators remain {{reluctant}} to quickly patch their systems, even when they have the capability to do so, partly because security patches in particular are often incomplete or altogether non-functional. We propose Band-aid Patching, a new approach for concurrently testing application patches. Using binary runtime injection techniques, we patch binaries such that when program execution reaches a program segment that has been affected by an issued patch, two (or more) program execution threads are created. These threads speculatively execute both parts of the code (patched and unpatched). Our system then retroactively selects one of the execution threads based on a variety of criteria, including obvious faultiness, prior history, and user input. We believe this approach to offer significant advantages to accelerating deployment of <b>hot</b> <b>fixes</b> while providing some assurance to system administrators. In this paper, we describe our initial thoughts on the system architecture, and provide some preliminary indications on the feasibility and performance impact of our scheme. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mobile {{phones are}} {{integral}} to everyday life with emails, social networking, online banking and other applications; however, {{the wealth of}} private information accessible increases economic incentives for attackers. Compared with fixed networks, mobile malware can replicate through both long range messaging and short range radio technologies; the former can be filtered by the network operator but determining the best method of containing short range malware is an open problem. While global software updates are sometimes possible, they are often not practical. An alternative and more efficient strategy is to distribute the patch to the key nodes {{so that they can}} opportunistically disseminate it {{to the rest of the}} network via short range encounters; but how can these key nodes be identified in a highly dynamic network topology? In this paper, we address these questions by presenting Socio-Temporal Opportunistic Patching (STOP), a two-tier predictive mobile malware containment system: devices collect co-location data in a decentralized manner and report to a central server which processes and targets delivery of <b>hot</b> <b>fixes</b> to a small subset of k devices at runtime; in turn mobile devices spread the patch opportunistically. The STOP system is underpinned by a recent theoretical framework for analysing dynamic networks that takes into account temporal information of links. Using empirical contact traces, we find firstly, the top-k ranking temporal centrality nodes are highly correlated with past time windows; and secondly, simple prediction functions can be designed to select the set of top-k nodes that are optimal for patch spreading.

30|$|The {{deformation}} {{behavior of}} {{low molecular weight}} phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin-impregnated wood under compression in the radial direction was investigated for obtaining high-strength wood at low pressing pressures. Flat-sawn grain Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) blocks with a density of 0.34 [*]g/cm 3 were treated with aqueous solution of 20 % low molecular weight PF resin resulting in weight gain of 60.8 %. Oven-dried specimens were compressed using <b>hot</b> plates <b>fixed</b> to a testing machine. The temperature was 150 °C and the pressing speed was 5 [*]mm/min. The impregnation of PF resin caused significant softening of the cell walls resulting in collapse at low pressures. The cell wall collapse was strain-dependent and occurred at a strain of 0.05 – 0.06 [*]mm/mm {{regardless of whether the}} wood was treated with PF resin. Thus, pressure holding causing creep deformation of the cell walls was also effective in initiating cell wall collapse at low pressure. Utilizing a combination of low molecular weight PF resin impregnation and pressure holding at 2 [*]MPa resulted in a density increase of PF resin-treated wood from 0.45 to 1.1 [*]g/cm 3. At the same time, the Young’s modulus and bending strength increased from 10 [*]GPa to 22 [*]GPa and 80 [*]MPa to 250 [*]MPa, respectively. It can be concluded that effective utilization of the collapse region of the cell wall is a desirable method for obtaining high-strength PF resin-impregnated wood at low pressing pressures.|$|R

This reference wake structure has a planar symmetry defining an azimuthal phase θ W that is observed to be random in time. The secondary smaller sphere is treated as a local disturbance of the reference wake. It is found that the shedding occurs closer to the symmetry axis for the control sphere placed {{at the center of the}} wake than for the natural case. When the control sphere is off-centered, a subharmonic at half the natural frequency appears and the azimuthal phase becomes imposed by the control sphere position.

The volume gain (VG) and weight gain due to 20 % resin solution impregnation were different among species. Furthermore, the specific volume gain (VG/specific gravity), indicating the degree of swelling of the cell wall, also varied from 17.7 % for European spruce to 26.4 % for elm. Oven-dried {{specimens of}} each species were compressed using <b>hot</b> plates <b>fixed</b> to an Instron testing machine. The deformation behavior of resin-impregnated wood up to 10 MPa was significantly different among the species. Stress development during cell wall collapse for low density wood was minimal. As a consequence, a significant increment of density occurred up to 2 MPa for low density wood such as albizia and Japanese cedar. When PF resin-impregnated wood was compressed up to 2 MPa and the pressure was kept constant for 30 min, the density of Japanese cedar reached 1.18 g/cm 3, about 30 % higher than the density of compressed Japanese birch, which possesses an original density that is 2.5 times {{higher than that of}} Japanese cedar. The mechanical properties of resin-impregnated wood, especially low density wood, increased with density. Hence, it is manifested that low density wood species have an advantage as raw materials for obtaining high-strength wood at low pressing pressure.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{observations}} of jovian auroral x-ray emissions provided limited spectral information and extensive but low spatial resolution images. These emissions have been thought {{to result from}} charge exchange and excitation of energetic sulfur and oxygen ions precipitating from {{the outer edge of}} the Io Plasma Torus; bremsstrahlung emission from precipitating energetic electrons is too inefficient to produce the x-ray emissions. However, new high spatial resolution observations demonstrate that most of Jupiter's northern auroral x-rays come from a hot spot located much further north than the footprint of the Io Plasma Torus and which is even poleward of the main ultraviolet auroral oval. The <b>hot</b> spot appears <b>fixed</b> in magnetic latitude and longitude and occurs in a region where anomalous infrared and ultraviolet emissions have also been observed. Interestingly, the hot spot x-rays pulsate with an approximately 40 -minute period, a period similar to that reported for high-latitude radio and energetic electron bursts observed by near-Jupiter spacecraft. These results invalidate the idea that jovian x-ray emissions are mainly excited by steady precipitation of energetic heavy ions from the region of the Io Plasma Torus. Instead, the x-rays appear to result from currently unexplained processes in the outer magnetosphere that produce highly localized and highly variable emissions over an extremely wide range of wavelengths...|$|R
