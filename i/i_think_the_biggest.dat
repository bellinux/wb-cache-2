Jenson Button, on describing the effects on the car of the off-throttle blown diffuser ban. Further controversy erupted on the Friday of the Grand Prix when it was revealed that the FIA had allowed Renault-powered teams certain concessions over the ban. Where the ban prevented teams from running engine maps that simulated throttle conditions of more than 10%, Renault had applied for a special exemption to the rule on the grounds that running at 10% of full throttle conditions adversely affected the reliability of their engines. The FIA granted the concession, permitting them to run up to 50% of full throttle. This sparked a protest from the Mercedes-powered teams, in particular McLaren. Red Bull Racing's Christian Horner responded to the protest, stating that the Mercedes teams had been granted concessions of their own to manage pressure within the crank case. The FIA agreed to review the exemptions granted to the Renault-powered teams, and the concessions allowed to Renault-powered teams were revoked ahead of the final free practice session on Saturday morning; however, early reports indicated that the concessions granted to Mercedes-powered teams would remain in place, with Red Bull and McLaren team principals Christian Horner and Martin Whitmarsh seeking clarification over the matter with FIA technical delegate Charlie Whiting, who called an extraordinary meeting of the sport's Technical Working Group to resolve the dispute. Due to the teams' dissatisfaction with the situation, the FIA has stated that it is prepared to withdraw the rule change from the German Grand Prix, restoring the Valencia specification of regulations, which would allow teams the freedom to run engine maps at their discretion, but require them to use the same engine maps between qualifying and the race. However, team principals and technical chiefs failed to come to an agreement at an extraordinary meeting on Sunday morning, with the Ferrari-powered Ferrari and Sauber teams refusing to sign an agreement restoring the pre-Silverstone specifications. At a second meeting among the teams on Sunday afternoon, Ferrari and Sauber agreed to the terms of the proposal, abandoning the ban on blown diffusers for the 2011 season.|$|E

It would be a place where the appropriate knowledge, the experience, and the intellectual energy could be focused on this single goal. It would have the status of other national colleges. It would also be a virtual college or a university, and it would be collaborative with colleges and universities and other learning institutions all across the country and perhaps the world. Experts on space from almost any corridor could participate and contribute to what this institute would do. It also would have very strong business participation. We would have folks from industry come to this environment, learn, go back and work, and then come back and teach. It would be a means for individuals to become more proficient in the technical engineering operations, as well as the business and political aspects of space exploration. Such a national space institute also would need to establish and maintain close contact with ongoing development and operations in human space programs...|$|E
40|$|It?s {{not fair}} trade! Cue: Huge markets and wealthy {{consumers}} in the United States or Europe, all looking to buy the nutritious, healthy foods that developing countries can grow: farmers in Africa have often heard about the benefits that globalisation can bring. But for the majority, and particularly for smallholder farmers, the liberalisation of world trade {{has done little to}} improve their livelihoods. Global markets are simply unreachable for a whole range of reasons, from lack of information and communications facilities, to export tariffs and farming subsidies paid to developed world farmers. In our next report, Sylvia Jiyane finds out how in Zimbabwe, farmers are finding ways to target the world food markets. She talks to Langton Mkweresa, an economist in Zimbabwe?s Ministry of Agriculture, who begins by explaining some of the reasons why the open, global market is far from being a fair place for developing world farmers to sell their produce. IN:		?As far as our farmers ? OUT:		?to help the smallholder farmer. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 29 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Langton Mkweresa suggesting how smallholder farmers might be able to exploit world markets. Transcript Mkweresa	As far as our farmers are concerned, they cannot fully exploit the benefits of the world markets in that, the information that we have got is fairly limited, and even the channels of information sharing and whatever, they are not as much as those enjoyed by developed countries? farmers. Like the Internet, and whatever; we have got very limited telephone facilities for example, so we cannot fully exploit the markets in developed countries. We also have the issue of subsidies, which is quite a contentious issue. We are looking at quite some significant subsidies which farmers in developed countries enjoy. So those subsidies are resulting in over-production by developed country agriculture, and that has got an effect on world prices, that is also now depressing world prices and reducing the incentives for developing country farmers to produce. The other aspects that is also impacting negatively on these smallholder farmers in developing countries, is the issue of tariffs. Over 100 % for our sugar exports to the US; again over 100 % for grain exports into Europe. That has got an effect of impeding trade, yet we know that most benefits to smallholder agriculture, to agriculture in general really, are got through trade more than anything else. Jiyane	Could there be any positive effects? Mkweresa	One thing is there are quite some out-grower schemes, which are quite catching up. By growing some crops for the European market, say, as out-growers, and then selling your produce through some established pack-houses; we are seeing quite a lot of success in that regard. We are also seeing quite some strong efforts by our government and also by some international development partners, the NGOs, to try to also increase the outreach programmes to the smallholder farmers. We are looking at things like provision of inputs and much more extension services and things like that. That is also helping the smallholder farmers. A lot of diversification is going on where new crops are coming in. So there are certainly some things going on but as I said <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> issue is the issue of liberalising the trade regimes world-wide, through the reforms going on at the World Trade Organisation. I think that is where we feel most impact would be felt by smallholder farmers. Jiyane	In view of all that, what then is the future of small-scale farming? Mkweresa	The future is certainly bright, but {{it is a question of}} the smallholder farmers working closely with the governments and all the other international development partners, looking at what are the opportunities that are there, largely by way of specialising in those products where we have got some comparative advantage. Particularly we are looking at the weather; when Europe is in winter, when they can?t grow a lot of the crops then that is some window of opportunity which we can exploit. So it is a question of some niche markets and also exploiting some windows of opportunity. And also through these various schemes, like I said, the out-grower schemes, specialisation in some high value crops, I think that is where the potential is. We have to specialise in some high value crops. So these are some of the things that I can think of to help the smallholder farmer. End of track. An economist in Zimbabwe?s Ministry of Agriculture summarises the reasons why developing country farmers struggle to sell their produce to foreign markets. He points out some of the progress that is being made in smallholder farming, and suggests the kind of opportunities available to farmers who want to boost their profits...|$|E

40|$|John Harbold is a busy guy. In 2013, he was 58 {{years old}} and {{teaching}} physical education, algebra and personal finance at a private Christian school near his hometown of Woodbury, NJ. He was also coaching the football team at Clearview Regional High School and working as a chaplain for the New Jersey Department of Corrections. By late summer, he started feeling very tired but chalked it up to “being an old guy running around with the young guys – nothing to worry about. ” Around that time, Harbold says, he started having bouts of hiccups lasting 10 to 15 minutes every time he ate. It was a nuisance but didn’t seem like an emergency. Then, in September, he awoke in the night sneezing and coughing. When he found a blood clot in his tissue, he {{got in touch with}} his family doctor. A blood test revealed that he was anemic, while other symptoms pointed to the need for a visit to his gastroenterologist, Howard Kroop, MD, at Jefferson. According to Harbold, the day after that visit is one he will never forget: “I was lying in my bed reading a book when my family doctor called and said, ‘John, you have cancer,’” he recalls. More specifically, he says, “It was adenocarcinoma of the esophageal-gastric junction – where the esophagus meets the stomach about 12 inches down from my Adam’s apple. ” Within days, Harbold was being seen by other physicians at the Jefferson Gastroesophageal Center, where the multi-disciplinary team was prepared to map out his treatment plan. He quickly underwent additional testing, which confirmed that his cancer was in an advanced stage. In a single day, he met with surgeon Ernest L. Rosato, MD, FACS, as well as radiation oncologist, Pramila Rani Anne, MD, and medical oncologist, Christina Brus, MD. He enrolled in a clinical trial and, in November 2013, started the first round of chemotherapy. At the end of those six weeks, a scan showed that the chemo had shrunk the tumor, and Harbold began a second, even more intense, round of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy. He recalls the extreme fatigue and numerous side effects but lauds Jefferson’s team. (“Every time I had a symptom, they had an answer,” he says.) Allowing six to eight weeks to recover from the second round of chemo and radiation therapy, Harbold was scheduled for an esophagectomy in April 2014 with Dr. Rosato and Nathaniel R. Evans, MD, FACS, FCCP. “An esophagectomy is a major procedure,” explains Dr. Rosato. “Dr. Evans and I were able to perform a minimally invasive esophagectomy to remove the tumor with a segment of esophagus and stomach as well as surrounding lymph nodes. This was all performed thoracoscopically and laparoscopically – by inserting scopes and instruments through small incisions into the chest and abdomen — without the need for any significant incisions. ” “The collaboration between general and thoracic surgeons allows us to tailor surgical therapy to the specific needs of each patient,” Dr. Evans notes. “The vast majority of our patients have minimally invasive surgery like Mr. Harbold. Smaller incisions mean less pain, so patients can get out of bed and get on the road to recovery sooner. ” Harbold spent almost two weeks recovering in the hospital before returning home to continue the process. “After surgery is a pretty difficult time,” he recalls. “Your body has to learn how to eat all over again, and just walking a few yards is a major event. ” He relied on Dr. Rosato and nurse practitioner Lori Pellegrino, MSN, CRNP, for answers to the many challenges he encountered along the way (see “On the Job” above). He also leaned heavily on his faith and his family, including his children and his ex-wife, all of whom have helped in providing his care. “The physical part is 50 percent – take the medication, take care of yourself, don’t push yourself,” he says. “But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> advice I would give to another patient is to prepare yourself emotionally and spiritually. Your faith either gets deeper or you find faith pretty quickly. You’re facing a very long recovery. ” These days, Harbold continues to be monitored by his team at Jefferson, but he is back to teaching and coaching, he’s exercising several times a week, and he’s even volunteering at the Jefferson Infusion Center – doing his best to give others hope and encouragement. He’s also active in a number of in-person and telephone-based support groups, including the one recently launched by the Gastroesophageal Center. “I can’t fight this thing alone, and the people who have helped me are just marvelous,” he says. “I thank God every day for the people at Jefferson!...|$|E

Chapman then approached Gillian Armstrong who said:I really loved it because I love Helen's writing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she has incredibly acute observation of people and wonderful poetry in her writing. <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> challenge was that so much was in one house, but I took that on board and thought, well, we'll just have to do everything possible to make people still feel they're watching a movie. After all, the house is also a character in the story.|$|R

The question people have to ask themselves is, who are the other 35 000 odd people who bought the Hilltop Hoods album? It’s such a small insular and at times disturbingly ignorant little slice of Australia that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we’d just be banging our heads against the wall {{trying to get through}} to those 15-year-old kids. Yeah, I don’t know. There’s always that responsibility of just trying to keep it true, even though we don’t focus on that as much as a lot of acts do, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s always in the back of everyone’s mind - probably whatever art form it is - that if they really love the art form that they’re attempting or drawing influences from then, you know, everyone is always really quite sensitive about other people’s perceptions in that culture or community. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>the</b> only responsibility, and obviously not to sell out is the other one. But that is pretty unlikely. And I’d say to hopefully bring more people in and that’ll change the culture of it, or it’ll make that more ignorant style of the culture a bit more isolated. I don’t know, to tell you the truth, sometimes I don’t feel like we’re part of the community that’s there at all. And neither are a lot of the artists we know, and even the artists that are respected in that community just throw their hands up and go ‘Look, I stopped trying to deal on that level with those fans a long time’.|$|R
5000|$|Katrín {{has said}} that missing {{qualification}} in 2014 was the [...] "differentiator" [...] that helped her {{come back to the}} Games and win in 2015. Not making it last year affected me a lot, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is a differentiator. I started working more closely with my coach, Ben Bergeron, and he not only got me the fittest that I've ever been, but he got my mental game to a whole other level. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> thing. We can all work out and we're all fit, but this year I've been working so much on my mental approach and just staying in that mental mind game, staying focused on yourself, and only the next task at hand.
