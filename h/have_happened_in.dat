5|$|High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato {{supports}} {{an early}} dating for Ebla {{that would put}} the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash—who boasted of taking tribute from Mari—or Lugalzagesi of Umma, {{who claimed to have}} reached the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Many of the locations, characters, {{and events}} in Dynasty Warriors 4 are {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Chinese history although many have been exaggerated to make the game more appealing to the player. There are also some features that are historically inaccurate. The game features environments resembling that of ancient China and various items from the era. Common items throughout the game include Fairy Wine and Dim Sum’s.|$|E

The last models were appreciated {{by a number of}} bus operators, and missed after production was stopped. All Vanaja bus chassis were fitted with air brakes by 1958, after the failure of hydraulic brakes on a Vanaja bus had led to one of the worst traffic accidents ever to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Finland.|$|E

50|$|The {{eruption}} of Hokkaido Koma-ga-take in June 1640, resulting in heavy ashfall and plants poisoning in Tsugaru Peninsula and nearby areas, has triggered the local crop failure, continuing to 1642. The early 1641 {{has a lot}} of abnormal weather events in East Asia. <b>In</b> Japan, drought <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Kinai, Chūgoku region and Shikoku. Cold wind and heavy rain <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Hokuriku region. Elsewhere, the abnormal patters of heavy rain, flooding, drought, frost (<b>in</b> particular, frost <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Akita in August) and insect damage has drained food reserves on markets to zero. Overall, the heaviest crops failure <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Tōhoku region areas facing the Sea of Japan.|$|R

5|$|Warelwast's {{relations}} with his cathedral chapter were good, and no disputes arose during his episcopate. It {{was not until}} late in his bishopric that the diocese was split into multiple archdeaconries, which appears to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> 1133. Warelwast instituted the two offices of treasurer and precentor for the cathedral chapter, {{as well as the}} first sub-archdeacons, who were under the archdeacons. Sub-archdeacons are not attested again at Exeter until the episcopate of Bartholomew Iscanus, who was bishop from 1161–1184. William of Malmesbury felt that during Warelwast's episcopate the cathedral chapter relaxed its communal living, which previously had been strong. It is likely that during Warelwast's episcopate the canons of the cathedral chapter quit living in a communal dormitory.|$|E
5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a wicket gate), a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E

5|$|The {{decipherment}} of the Mycenaean Linear B script, {{a writing}} system adapted {{for the use}} of the Greek language of the Late Bronze Age, demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period. Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th century BC epic, the Iliad, in reference to the Trojan War. The latter was supposed to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> the late 13thearly 12th century BC, when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae, besieged the walled city of Troy. Homer used the ethnonyms Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers. These names appear to have passed down from the time they were in use to the time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his Iliad. There is an isolated reference to a-ka-wi-ja-de in the Linear B records in Knossos, Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.|$|E
