2500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 27 October 2002, during high winds of between [...] and gusts {{reaching}} [...] within Portsmouth Harbour, the Pride of Portsmouth collided with the warship, HMS St Albans moored at the end of Fountain Lake Jetty during her turn into Fountain Lake. The collision {{was the result of a}} combination of factors, most notably the high wind speeds at the time. The Marine Accident Investigation Board determined that along with the high winds, an inappropriate <b>helm</b> <b>order</b> and the failure of a bow thruster prior to the incident had allowed the Pride of Portsmouth to pass close to the warship HMS Ocean and then make a starboard turn, which was accelerated by the high winds and lee from HMS Ocean towards HMS St Albans.|$|E

25|$|<b>Helm</b> <b>orders</b> or {{commands}} {{fall into}} two categories: rudder commands and heading commands. A rudder command dictates changing {{the angle of the}} rudder, which is a single-event action. Whereas steering a heading is a comparatively long event and will require ongoing or continuous rudder adjustments.|$|R
25|$|In 1973, {{amidst a}} government-wide panic caused by Watergate, CIA Director Richard <b>Helms</b> <b>ordered</b> all MKUltra files destroyed. Pursuant to this order, most CIA {{documents}} regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible. A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms' purge, {{as they had}} been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a FOIA request in 1977. These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977.|$|R

25|$|Clear and exact {{communication}} between the helmsman and officer on the bridge is essential to safe navigation and ship handling. Subsequently, a set of standard steering commands, responses by the helmsman, and acknowledgment by the conning officer are widely recognized in the maritime industry. The helmsman repeats any verbal commands {{to demonstrate that the}} command is heard and understood. The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) requires that a helmsman be able to understand and respond to <b>helm</b> <b>orders</b> in English.|$|R
60|$|After issuing this {{command the}} King {{resigned}} the <b>helm,</b> and <b>ordered</b> his banner {{to be set}} up, which was done immediately. At the same time his opponents shook out their banners, and both fleets were put in order of battle.|$|R

Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed <b>Helms)</b> <b>orders</b> to answer the phone. With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{commands}} {{would be}} {{passed from the}} senior officer on the bridge to stations dispersed throughout the ship, where physical control of the ship was exercised, as technology did not exist for the remote control of steering or machinery. <b>Helm</b> <b>orders</b> would be passed to an enclosed wheel house, where the coxswain or helmsman operated the ship's wheel. Engine commands would be relayed to the engineer in the engine room by an engine order telegraph that displayed the captain's orders on a dial. The engineer would ensure that the correct combination of steam pressure and engine revolutions were applied. The bridge was often open to the elements, therefore a weatherproof pilot house could be provided, from which a pilot, who was traditionally the ship's navigating officer, could issue commands from shelter.|$|R
50|$|Episode II {{begins with}} a {{flashback}} of the Miltian Conflict, where <b>Helmer</b> <b>orders</b> chaos and Canaan to pilot E.S. Asher to Old Miltia and retrieve the U.R.T.V. units from the Realian rioting near Labyrinthos, the U-TIC Organization headquarters. Along the way, the two men encounter Federation officer Jin Uzuki, who is investigating {{the root of the}} Conflict. Uzuki believes that the entire Conflict is a set-up to turn U-TIC into a scapegoat, which, in turn, will keep the larger organization hidden in the shadows. He has data that he believes can prove this, but the data can only be decoded at Labyrinthos. The trio encounters U-TIC operative Margulis along the way, who demands that Jin return the U-TIC's encoded data. Uzuki defeats Margulis in a sword fight. Canaan is then entrusted with Jin's data before parting ways with Canaan and chaos, who then rescue U.R.T.V.s Rubedo and Nigredo.|$|R
50|$|Andy Bernard (Ed <b>Helms)</b> <b>orders</b> Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|R

50|$|It {{is unknown}} what caused Captain Dickman to come about {{and head back}} into the Sound. Maybe he wished to follow the tanker and move in tandem to a safe haven. Perhaps the {{decision}} {{was based on a}} far more sinister condition. At the prevailing temperature of zero degrees, each wave that broke against the tug would have frozen solid along the sides of the tug. The ice would have accumulated inch by inch, crusting over the railings and then the pilothouse windows, until the tug’s shape no longer was recognizable. Sometime within the course of 20 minutes, after the vessel started back out to the sound, the crew realized they were in great peril. The tug, weighed down by the ice, and likely heeling to one side, would have become sluggish to respond her <b>helm</b> <b>orders.</b> The engineers would have been monitoring the conditions in the engine room, reporting their findings to the wheelhouse. Soon - the order was called to ready the lifeboat. The lights of Northport, so tantalizingly close, would suddenly appear very distant.|$|R
50|$|Oneida {{departed}} from Yokohama, Japan on 24 January 1870, on passage {{back to the}} United States. Some 12 miles into this voyage, she {{was struck by the}} British Peninsula & Oriental steamer Bombay, at 6:30 pm near Saratoga Spit. The Court of Inquiry unanimously held that the officers of Oneida were entirely to blame for the collision. The Oneida was under the command of an inexperienced junior officer whilst the senior officers were at dinner. On seeing a light ahead, this young officer had sought the advice of a navigating officer who briefly came on deck and then returned to dinner. Confusing <b>helm</b> <b>orders</b> were given on Oneida, with the result that Bombay's efforts to avoid collision were in vain and she struck Oneida at an angle of 45 degrees, abaft the mizzen chains. The starboard quarter was cut off Oneida and she sank at 6:45 pm in 20 fathoms (37 m) of water with the loss of 125 men, 61 sailors being saved in two Japanese fishing boats.|$|R
60|$|Spike now {{ventured to}} look behind him, {{commanding}} an experienced hand {{to take the}} <b>helm.</b> In <b>order</b> to do this he was obliged to change places with the man he had selected to come aft, which brought him on a thwart alongside of the boatswain {{and one or two}} other of his confidants. Here a whispered conference took place, which lasted several minutes, Spike appearing to be giving instructions to the men.|$|R
5000|$|Bernays {{was awarded}} the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal for his heroic actions. His actions {{displayed}} such a degree of courage that a prominent flag officer in the RCN recommended him for the Victoria Cross. Rear Admiral L.W. Murray believed that [...] "the manner in which this comparatively young rating remained at his post, alone, and carried out the 133 telegraph orders {{as well as the}} many <b>helm</b> <b>orders</b> necessary to accomplish the destruction of this submarine, whilst the wheelhouse was being pierced by explosive shell from the enemy's Oerlikon gun and his only exit was cut off by fire, is not only in keeping with the highest traditions of the Service but adds considerably to those traditions. I am proud of the privilege to recommend Acting Chief Petty Officer Bernays for the Victoria Cross."Bernays did not receive the Victoria Cross due to conflicts with the British Admiralty, which was hesitant upon receiving the recommendation despite a push from Canadian authorities. This {{was one of the first}} cases where the Canadian Government had intervened in the process, but like many other cases after it, the attempt failed.|$|R
60|$|It is {{scarcely}} necessary to say, {{that the process}} of scudding requires the nicest attention to the <b>helm,</b> in <b>order</b> that the hull may be brought speedily back to the right direction, when thrown aside by the power of the billows; for, besides losing her way in the caldron of water--an imminent danger of itself--if left exposed to the attack of the succeeding wave, her decks, at least, would be swept, even should she escape a still more serious calamity.|$|R
50|$|Jeanne flees to Paris, {{followed}} by Khalibiev and Andreas. She takes {{a job as}} a secretary under her uncle Raymond (Adolph Edgar Licho), a private detective.

The latter girl balks and warns Raymond, who has meanwhile been searching for a stolen diamond with a $50,000 reward. The diamond turns out to have been swallowed by a shiny-object-loving parrot.|$|R
50|$|The City of Launceston {{observed}} the SS Penola, inbound from Adelaide, approaching head on {{while they were}} still five miles apart. According to the rules of the sea ships on converging courses were supposed to port their <b>helm</b> in <b>order</b> to pass each other safely. However, this did not happen and the two ships closed, and at around 9.00 p.m. Penola ran her bows squarely into City of Launcestons starboard side. As the Launceston began to sink all of the passengers and crew were transferred to the Penola, which despite leaving her stem lodged in the hull of the Launceston was able to make port safely.|$|R
50|$|There {{has since}} been a Spanish Borbón Grand Master at the <b>helm</b> of the <b>order</b> except for a short interregnum where the Grand Master belonged to the French House of Bourbon family, which {{occurred}} in 1969, {{with the election of}} the Duke of Brissac as Grand Master with the approval of the Count of Paris, head of the Royal House of France, solicited by the Patriarch Maximos V.|$|R
50|$|In {{the bridge}} view, most game {{functions}} {{are carried out}} by selecting an individual bridge officer, and selecting from a set of commands or options {{in order to control}} that individual's set of responsibilities. In this way, the game simulates being in command of a starship. For example, a player could issue the command to intercept a fleeing starship through the <b>Helm</b> menu, or <b>order</b> Lt. Felix Savali, the tactical officer to destroy an enemy ship. An artificial intelligence would then pilot the ship for the player.|$|R
5000|$|When President renewed her attack {{she did so}} by {{bringing}} her starboard guns to bear, which caused considerable damage to Belvideras sails and rigging. While repairs were carried out, Byron personally supervised the chase guns, despite having sustained a wound to his leg. By 17:00, President had closed the gap to 400 yards and again put her <b>helm</b> over in <b>order</b> to give Belvidera a second broadside. President continued alternating between her chase and maindeck guns and only once did Belvidera yaw {{in an attempt to}} use hers, but President matched the manoeuvre and Belvidera was forced to turn back without firing.|$|R
6000|$|When {{everything}} was ready, I went aft, {{stood by the}} man at the <b>helm,</b> and <b>ordered</b> him to bear up. Neb placed himself just behind me. I knew it was useless to interfere, and let the fellow do as he pleased. The pilot had told me the water was deep, up to the rocks of the bluff; and we hugged the land as close as possible, in rounding the point. At the next moment the ship was in sight, distant less than a hundred fathoms. I saw we had good way, and, three minutes later, I ordered the fore-sail brailed. At the same instant I walked forward. So near were we, that the flapping of the canvass was heard in the ship, and we got a hail. A mystified answer followed, and then crash came our bows along those of the Crisis. [...] "Hurrah! for the old craft!" [...] shouted our men, and aboard we tumbled in a body. Our charge was like the plunge of a pack of hounds, as they leap through a hedge.|$|R
60|$|The {{man at the}} <b>helm</b> obeyed the <b>order.</b> Releasing {{his hold}} of its spokes, the wheel made a quick evolution; and the ship, feeling a fresh impulse of the wind, turned her head heavily towards the quarter whence it came, the canvas {{fluttering}} with a noise like that produced by a flock of water-fowl just taking wing. But, met by the helm again, she soon fell off as before, powerless from having lost her way, and settling bodily down toward the fancied slaver, impelled by the air, which seemed, however, to have {{lost much of its}} force, at the critical instant it was most needed.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{professional}} Helms highly valued information gathering (favoring the interpersonal, but including the technical, obtained by espionage or from published media) and its analysis. He also prized counterintelligence. Although a participant at planning such activities, he remained a skeptic about covert and paramilitary operations. Helms understood {{the bounds of}} his agency role as being able to express strong opinions over a decision under review, yet working as a team player once a course was set by the administration. He saw it as his duty to keep official secrets from press scrutiny. While DCI, Helms managed the agency {{following the lead of}} his predecessor John McCone. In 1977, as a result of earlier clandestine operations in Chile, he became the only DCI convicted of misleading Congress. His last post in government service was Ambassador to Iran, 1973–1977. Yet he was a key witness before the Senate during its investigation of the CIA by the Church Committee in the mid-1970s, 1975 being called the [...] "Year of Intelligence". This investigation was hampered severely by <b>Helms</b> having <b>ordered</b> the destruction of all files related to the CIA's mind control program in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|By design, {{the vessels}} parted {{company on the}} evening of July 30, 1775 with the Santiago {{continuing}} north, to what is today the border between Washington and British Columbia, Canada.

There, and near a Russian settlement on present day Kodiak Island, the Spaniards performed numerous [...] "acts of sovereignty" [...] claiming the territory. Bodega y Quadra named Puerto de Bucareli (present day Bucareli Bay, Alaska), Puerto de los Remedios, and Cerro San Jacinto that was renamed Mount Edgecumbe three years later in 1778 by English explorer James Cook.|$|R
2500|$|On June 17, Nixon's Plumbers {{were caught}} burglarizing the DNC {{offices in the}} Watergate. On June 23, DCI <b>Helms</b> was <b>ordered</b> by the White House to wave the FBI off using {{national}} security as a pretext. The new DCI, Walters, another Nixon hack, called the {{acting director of the}} FBI and told him to drop the investigation as ordered. On June 26, Nixon's counsel John Dean ordered DCI Walters to pay the plumbers untraceable hush money. The CIA was {{the only part of the}} government that had the power to make off the book payments, but it could only be done on the orders of the CI, or, if he was out of the country, the DCI. The Acting Director of the FBI started breaking ranks. He demanded the CIA produce a signed document attesting to the national security threat of the investigation. Jim McCord's lawyer contacted the CIA informing them that McCord had been offered a Presidential pardon if he fingered the CIA, testifying that the break-in had been an operation of the CIA. Nixon had long been frustrated by what he saw as a liberal infection inside the CIA, and had been trying for years to tear the CIA out by its roots. McCord wrote [...] "If [...] Helms goes (takes the fall) and the Watergate operation is laid at the CIA's feet, where it does not belong, every tree in the forest will fall. It will be a scorched desert." ...|$|R
60|$|When the {{sun went}} down in that vast waste of water which lies to the southward of this continent, the little Sea Lion had fairly lost sight of land, and was riding over the long southwestern ground-swell like a gull that holds its way {{steadily}} towards its nest. For many hours her course had not varied half a point, being as near as possible to south-southwest, which kept her a little off the wind. No sooner, however, did night come to shut in the view, than Roswell Gardiner went aft to the man at the <b>helm,</b> and <b>ordered</b> him to steer to the southward, as near as the breeze would conveniently allow. This was a material change {{in the direction of the}} vessel, and, should the present breeze stand, would probably place her, by the return of light, a good distance to the eastward of the point she would otherwise have reached. Hitherto, it had been Roswell's aim to drop his consort; but, now it was dark, and so much time had already passed and been improved since the other schooner was last seen, he believed he might venture to steer in the precise direction he desired to go. The season is so short in those seas, that every hour is precious, and no more variation from a real object could be permitted than circumstances imperiously required. It was now generally understood that the craft was making the best of her way towards her destined sealing-ground.|$|R

60|$|So swift was the {{progress}} of the little craft that, within fifteen minutes after bearing up, Raoul and Ithuel, who again occupied their stations on the forecastle, saw the headland where they had so lately been concealed, and <b>ordered</b> the <b>helm</b> a-port in <b>order</b> to sheer out and give it a berth. Then rock was passed after rock, cove after cove, and village after village, until the entrance between Capri and Campanella was again reached. In sweeping down the shore in this manner, the intention was to pick up any boat that might happen to be in the lugger's track; for, while Raoul was disposed to let his prisoner go, he had a strong desire to seize any other officers of the frigate that might fall in his way. The search was ineffectual, however; and when the lugger came out into the open sea, all expectation of further success, of this nature, was reluctantly abandoned.|$|R
60|$|As {{the evening}} {{advanced}} the land-breeze increased, and the Proserpine gradually gained upon the boat. When {{the latter was}} {{about two-thirds of the}} distance across the bay, the frigate caught the stronger current that came down athwart the campagna, between Vesuvius and the mountains behind Castel-à-Mare, when she drove ahead fast. Her sails, as seamen express it, were all asleep; or swelled outward without collapsing; and her rate of sailing was between five and six miles in the hour. This brought them up with the boat hand-over-hand, as it is called; and Ghita, at Raoul's request, put the <b>helm</b> aside, in <b>order</b> that they might {{get out of the way}} of the huge body that was approaching. It would seem that there was some design on the part of the ship in coming so near, for she made a sheer toward the yawl in a way to frighten the timid helmswoman and to induce her to relinquish her hold of the tiller.|$|R
