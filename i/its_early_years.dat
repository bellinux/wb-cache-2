The orchestra's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert; with Sargent and the Royal Choral Society the LPO recorded choruses from Messiah and The Creation at Kingsway Hall in September 1932. The first Abbey Road recording was in October, under Sir Henry Wood. Beecham's first discs with the orchestra were made in January 1933, with his ballet suite The Origin of Design, arranged from music by Handel. From then until his last LPO recording in December 1945 Beecham recorded ninety-nine 78-rpm sets with the orchestra. Other conductors {{who worked in the}} EMI studios with the orchestra in <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years</b> included Elgar, Felix Weingartner, John Barbirolli, and Serge Koussevitzky.

5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the textile industry, with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much more rapidly than weaving.|$|E
5|$|A gold dollar coin {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{several times in}} the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. Congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the California gold rush, and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. In <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E

During that span, the team had three head coaches (including future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens); team executive Stu Inman also served as coach. The team won the first pick in the NBA draft twice during that span. In 1972, the team drafted LaRue Martin with the number one pick, and in 1974 the team selected Bill Walton from UCLA.|$|E
5|$|During <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> Georgetown College {{suffered}} from considerable financial strain. The Maryland Society of Jesus began its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, {{in the form}} of teachers and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college. The school relied on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands which had been donated to the Jesuits. To raise money for Georgetown and other schools in 1838, Maryland Jesuits conducted a mass sale of some 272 slaves to two Deep South plantations in Maringouin, Louisiana from their six in Maryland, ending their slaveholding.|$|E
5|$|During <b>its</b> <b>early</b> <b>years,</b> the Centre Democrats {{received}} extensive {{media attention}} on two occasions.

The venue was severely damaged, Janmaat narrowly escaped death and the party secretary Wil Schuurman had one leg amputated after jumping from a window to escape the conflagration.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, the United States {{established}} military {{ties with}} Liberia by sending some five black American officers to help reorganize the force.
