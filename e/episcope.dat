The inner flap was padded so that the driver could rest his head on it when driving. The radio operator sat on the left and had his own [...] vision port with [...] of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter. His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull. The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a ball mount with 30° of traverse. It could elevate 25° and depress 10°. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough. The mount had a spotting telescope or open sights could be used if the plug {{at the top of the}} ball mount was removed. If necessary the driver could lock the mount into position and fire it himself using a Bowden cable.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{production}} series featured several improvements. The {{most important of}} these was the fitting of the APX 4 turret, equipped with the longer SA 35 gun, which had a far better antitank-capacity, with about twice the original armour penetration. Due to the longer rounds the ammunition load decreased to 108 rounds. The new turret also had PPLR X 160 <b>episcopes</b> instead of Chrétien diascopes and was fitted with a S 190 G attachment point on the roof above the back hatch, to use the reserve machine gun as an AA-weapon.

5000|$|During the {{production}} run several modifications would be made, {{such as the}} fitting of lifting hooks. The first thirty vehicles had two more primitive periscopes on the turret roof, a Chrétien diascope on its front and simple vision slits with armoured shutters on its sides; their drivers too had to use vision slits instead of an <b>episcope.</b> They also lacked a silencer and had semi-circular cut-outs at the wheel plate edges. From about the 111th vehicle (or fourth production batch) onward, several changes were introduced, including the fitting of an armoured ventilator covering {{on top of the}} turret, a factory plate with the name [...] "Panhard" [...] on the nose and a new softer factory camouflage pattern with the brown and bronze green spots no longer separated by black lines. From the 270th vehicle onwards stowage boxes were constructed on the back fenders, obscuring the pointed form of the engine compartment.

5000|$|In {{common with}} British tank {{doctrine}} of the time, the vehicle was designed to fire on the move. The turret offered hydraulically powered turret traverse motors with proportional speed control. Later vehicles fitted an all-round view cupola for the commander to identify and track targets.

There was a 7.92 mm Besa machine gun mounted co-axially to the main armament, operated by the gunner. A second was gimbal mounted {{in the front of}} the hull, with 45 degrees horizontal and 25 degrees vertical movement. Sighting was by a No. 35 telescope, which was connected through a linkage to the mounting. In the top of the turret was a 2 inch [...] "bombthrower" [...] angled to fire forward.

50|$|A {{modernisation}} programme {{was initiated}} in early 1940. This included besides the fitting of <b>episcopes,</b> tails and some radio sets, the gradual {{introduction of a}} longer L/35 37 mm SA38 gun with a much improved anti-tank capability (30 mm penetration at 1,000 m); about 350 vehicles were (re)built with the better gun, among them about fifty H35s. The new gun became standard on the production lines in April. Before that, the available new guns had, from January 1940, gradually been fitted to the tanks of platoon, company and battalion commanders; {{about half of the}} commander vehicles in Hotchkiss units were so modified. It had been intended to fit the longer gun to all vehicles {{during the second half of}} 1940. After the war it was wrongly assumed for a time that H38 was the official name of the tank with the new engine but without the new gun and that H39 was the name of the type that had both major improvements. H38 however, in contemporary use indicated the same type as H39 and it is only possible to refer to the latter with historical accuracy in an informal sense.|$|R
5000|$|By November all turrets {{had been}} {{delivered}} by Landsverk. However, {{they had not}} yet been fitted with any armament because the Ordnance Department had decided to produce the needed 37 mm cannon itself in its arsenal, under a licence obtained from Bofors in June 1937 to equip the earlier M38, and manufacture had met with some serious delays. When the first car was officially delivered by DAF on 27 November 1939, not only did the turret lack any guns but also the hull machine guns and all visors were absent. Nine vehicles, also in an unfinished state, were delivered in December and the final two on 3 and 5 January 1940 respectively. DAF reduced the price by 1500 guilders per unit to partly compensate for the deficiencies. The cars were moved to an Ordnance Department facility in Delft to be completed. In late January the first vehicle could be fitted with the first 37 mm gun produced for the series {{and at the same time}} equipped with a full set of <b>episcopes</b> and periscopes provided by the Nederlandsche Instrumenten Compagnie (Nedisco); it was immediately tested at the gunnery range at Oldebroek.

50|$|As DAF {{had never}} before {{produced}} armoured fighting vehicles, the planned interval of just four months between order and the first delivery had been very optimistic. Production was soon delayed, largely because components were not made available on time. Ougrée Malhaye could only send the armour sets five to seven weeks later than DAF had expected. The electrical components had been ordered from the German manufacturer Bosch but their delivery stagnated after the outbreak of war on 1 September. France halted export of military goods {{at the start of}} the war, including the prismatic <b>episcopes</b> and visors intended to be fitted in the M39. The Dutch Philips company started a crash programme for production of a suitable prism but this would take several months to come into effect. The worst delay was caused by changed Army specifications for the machine gun mounts; these had been received by DAF in April and new drawings were only ready in August. The special steel pieces again had to be produced by Ougrée Malhaye, but the only steel oven capable of casting them happened to be in revision for several months. In November the entire production process was halted for some weeks because of the Venlo Incident: the German Abwehr had abducted two British intelligence officers from Dutch territory and it was feared that the Dutch protests regarding the incident would be used as a pretext to invade The Netherlands; all vehicles were temporarily evacuated to Rotterdam as Eindhoven, where DAF was based, was dangerously close to the German border.|$|R

50|$|The APX-R turret was {{the same}} {{standard}} type as used on the R35 and R40 tanks, made of 40 mm cast steel and armed with the short 37 mm SA 18 gun, which had a maximum armour penetration of only 23 mm. Traverse of the turret was with a handwheel. The commander sat in a saddle suspended from the turret.The tank carried about 100 rounds for the gun, and 2,400 rounds for the coaxial 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun - the 37 mm ammunition racked on the left hand side of the hull, the 7.5 mm ammunition {{on the right side}} in fifteen circular magazines with 150 rounds each; a final magazine was to be at the ready on the machine-gun itself. The turret had a rotating cupola with a PPL RX 180 P visor but there was no hatch in the cupola though its top could be lifted a bit for better ventilation. Apart from the cupola there were protected vision devices, a binocular periscope and diascopes, to the front beside the gun and to each side. For access there was a hatch {{at the back of the}} turret. When opened, the commander could sit on it for better observation, but this left him very vulnerable and slow to reach the gun. The alternative was to fight closed-up, observing through the vertical slits or the visor of the hatchless cupola. The Cavalry liked neither this arrangement nor the weak gun. The latter problem was lessened somewhat by enlarging the breech so that special rounds with a larger charge could be used. This increased muzzle velocity to about 600 m/s and maximum penetration to about 30 mm. Only a small part of the tanks with the Cavalry alone were modified however, because it greatly increased barrel wear. In the Spring of 1940 the original diascopes of the Chrétien type were gradually replaced with <b>episcopes,</b> offering more protection.|$|R
