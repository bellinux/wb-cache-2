5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market in 1994, {{the lack of}} free slots at Fornebu {{made it impossible to}} have free competition, since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and a <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E

5|$|Following the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airline {{market in}} 1994, which allowed any European Economic Area-airline to operate any route they wished, Teddy Air tried to start {{services}} at Moss Airport, Rygge. Since {{it at the}} time was the military-only Rygge Air Station, with no passenger facilities, the airline was not successful in receiving permission. However, it did choose to start competing with Air Stord on the Skien–Bergen route, starting 8May 1995. Using its Embraer 110 aircraft, it launched tickets for under NOK1000, compared with the NOK1290 price offered by Air Stord. The latter had aircraft half the size, but offered 31 flights per week, compared to the 16 offered by Teddy Air. In addition, Coast Air launched two weekly round trips. The routes were mainly used by commuters working on offshore oil platforms in the North Sea. By 1995, 60 percent of the airline had been bought by Hermann Løvenskiold.|$|E
5|$|Teddy Air AS was a {{regional}} airline, based at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen, in Norway. Operating between 1989 and 2004, the company operated Britten-Norman Islander, Embraer 110 and Saab 340 aircraft. The company started {{by providing a}} scheduled service between Skien and Oslo in 1990, followed by services to Stavanger in 1993 and Bergen in 1994. In 1996, it won {{a contract with the}} Ministry of Transport from Oslo to Fagernes. It was involved in intense competition with other regional airlines, notably Coast Air and Guard Air, following the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aviation market.

40|$|Abstract: This paper explores <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> {{licensing}} on an oligopoly insurance market. We {{show that}} <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> licensing in a Stackelberg-type oligopoly market {{may not have}} any impact on the leader’s output if <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> firms increases but the market structure remains. On the other hand, if the market structure is reorganized because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> licensing, <b>the</b> leader’s output could be significantly reduced after deregulation. By using <b>the</b> unique data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurance market in Taiwan, this paper provides further empirical evidence to dem-onstrate that <b>the</b> <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> a Stackelberg-type oligopoly insurance market reduc-es <b>the</b> outputs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market leader more than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market followers.

40|$|During recent years, {{concerns}} about <b>the</b> real effectiveness <b>of</b> electric utility regulation {{have led to}} a number of policy prescriptions, including total <b>deregulation</b> and <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> only <b>the</b> generating function.

This paper presents an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> whether competition in distribution would actually lead to higher costs. Data from real markets, where direct electric utility competition actually exists, show that competition in distribution does not lead to higher costs. The main conclusion is that policy prescriptions, which only recommend <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> generation only, are too limited in scope. <b>Deregulation</b> <b>of</b> Electric Utility Firms...|$|R
5|$|Norway Airlines {{applied in}} 1990 for {{permission}} to operate a charter route from Oslo to Penang, Malaysia, using a Boeing 757. The application was dismissed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to protect SAS' route from Copenhagen to Singapore. The Penang route was necessary for Norway Airlines to procure a third aircraft, which {{according to the company}} was necessary to generate a profit, and would have created 100 new jobs. In the mean time, Tjæreborg Reiser sent their charter passengers with scheduled flights to London and onwards with British carriers to Malaysia. The dismissal was appealed to Minister of Transport and Communications, Lars Gunnar Lie of the Christian Democratic Party. The issue became a political issue within Syse's Cabinet, as the Conservative Party and the Progress Party were both in favor of increased <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airline industry. The issue was complicated by the common aviation policy of the three Scandinavian counties, which had largely been established to protect SAS' interest on international services. The cabinet therefore opened for discussion a further deregulation with the governments of Sweden and Denmark. The Conservative Party stated that this was in part a response to Danish and Swedish authorities allowing charter services to Phuket, Thailand, which could be seen as competing to SAS' route to Bangkok. Syse's Cabiet resigned on 3 November over issues regarding Norway and the European Union, before a reply to the application could be made.|$|E

40|$|Due to <b>deregulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{energy sector}} and <b>the</b> setting <b>of</b> targets {{such as the}} 20 / 20 / 20 in <b>the</b> EU, {{operators}} <b>of</b> public buildings are now more exposed to instantaneous (short-term) market conditions.

Therefore, there are incentives for the operators to develop and use a Decision Support System to manage their energy sub-systems in a more robust energy-efficient and cost-effective manner. In this paper, a two-stage stochastic model is proposed, where some decisions (so-called first-stage decision) regarding investments in new energy technologies have to be taken before uncertainties are resolved, and some others (so-called second-stage decisions) on how to use the installed technologies will be taken once values for uncertain parameters become known, thereby providing a trade-off between long- and short-term decisions...|$|R

The cross-sectional and time-series variation <b>of</b> branching <b>deregulation</b> allows us to develop a hazard model to explain <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> across <b>the</b> states using proxies motivated by private-interest, public-interest, and political-institutional theories, the public interest approach cannot easily explain our findings that deregulation occurs later in states with relatively more small banks and with a relatively large insurance sector in states where banks can sell insurance. We also find that the ex post consequences <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> for <b>the</b> different interest groups are consistent with the ex ante lobbying patterns we infer from the hazard model. Some political-institutional factors also play a role in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> regulatory change. <b>The</b> same forces that explain <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> across <b>the</b> states also explain <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> voting in Congress on interstate branching deregulation.
