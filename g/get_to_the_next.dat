25|$|Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air is {{structured}} much like other three previous {{games in the}} series with some major twists. There are lots of improvements in gameplay overall compared to others. It {{is more of a}} quest-like adventure than a traditional hidden object game, a mixing of adventure and puzzle game. Featuring loads of puzzles and logical quests with different difficulties, The Book of Air still assure that puzzles are well-tricky and tightly blended with the story, which is a typical feature of quest or click-and-point games, such as: putting together parts of broken statues, reconstructing tricky mechanisms, unscrambling messages using the power of Dream Jewels and many more. There are no lists of items to find but a huge amount of inventory based puzzles, logical riddles and quests to solve, which have been scattered through the locations in the game. The objects that players find may be used in a scene other than the one they found it in. Objects will stay in inventory until players need to use them. All objects that players are able to pick up will serve a purpose, whether they are used in that scene or not. A lot of times in this game the pieces players pick up may only be used as they <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> scene. Some items may not become visible in a scene right away, players must perform other tasks first before they become visible.|$|E

I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room.

Feeling that the band's {{previous}} album did {{not live up to}} expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. To prepare for the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder. [...] "I think that as an artist, in order for me to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> plateau, I kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy," [...] he explains. [...] "And Alien was no exception with that." [...] Although Townsend considered the album an [...] "impenetrable mass of technicality", it was well received on its release, selling 3,697 copies in its first week and appearing on several Billboard charts. Around this time, Townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game [...]|$|E

500|$|Advent Children has {{received}} mixed reviews. The computer-animated graphics were generally praised; 1UP.com's James Mielke, who awarded the film an [...] "A-", said {{the quality and}} clarity of the CG visuals was [...] "genuinely amazing". Anime News Network writer Carlo Santos praised the animation while awarding the film a [...] "B", calling it [...] "outstanding", and About.com's Roger Altizer, while giving the film overall 2 {{and a half stars}} out of 5, cited the visuals as one of its few positive points. The film's plot was generally criticized as confusing; Leslie Felperin of Variety, in a sharply negative review, described the plot as [...] "soulless" [...] and [...] "utterly impenetrable" [...] to anyone who had not played the game, and Anime News Network's Santos agreed that people who had not played Final Fantasy VII would not understand the story. Mania Entertainment's John Eriani also found the plot confusing to non-players, though they liked how the characters were further explored in the film. Todd Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk, while [...] "highly recommending" [...] the film, praised Cloud's character development in particular. About.com's Altizer summarized the plot and dialogue as [...] "weak", and IGN's Chris Carle, in their 9 out of 10 review, felt that the plot was just as excuse to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> action sequence. The story digest [...] "Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII", included with the DVD to explain the plot of Final Fantasy VII, was described by Anime News Network's Santos as [...] "just as confusing as the movie", and of no help in explaining the plot to anyone who had not already played the game, though Carle of IGN felt it was helpful to those who had not played the game in a while.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1915 and 1917, the IWW's Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) {{organized}} {{more than}} a hundred thousand migratory farm workers throughout the Midwest and western United States, often signing up and organizing members in the field, in rail yards and in hobo jungles. During this time, the IWW member became synonymous with the hobo riding the rails; migratory farmworkers could scarcely afford any other means of transportation to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> jobsite. Railroad boxcars, called [...] "side door coaches" [...] by the hobos, were frequently plastered with silent agitators from the IWW.|$|E
2500|$|Game Revolution's Duke Ferris {{scored the}} game a B+, praising the graphics, but criticizing the {{difficulty}} level, writing [...] "you have unlimited lives in MDK2, {{and it is}} a strictly linear game with fixed checkpoints. This means that when you get to a hard section, your only choice is to do {{it over and over again}} until you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> checkpoint.

2500|$|Scott and Shackleton's {{experience}} in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. Simpson, Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, did {{a huge amount}} of research into the weather during the time of their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced a prolonged period of low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records. The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily mileages they needed to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> depot.

Generally the number seven flanker is referred to as the openside flanker, and with the number six flanker as the blindside flanker. [...] "Openside" [...] and [...] "blindside" [...] refer to the wide and narrow side of the pitch respectively, as scrums usually occur closer to one of the touchlines than the other. The openside flanker's job is to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ruck or maul as quickly as possible, so they will usually bind on that side.

[...] "There, sir, sit you there, and I will sit here beside you--you desire {{to hear of}} Colonel John Moredock. Well, a day in my boyhood is marked with a white stone--the day I saw the colonel's rifle, powder-horn attached, hanging in a cabin on the West bank of the Wabash river. I was going westward a long journey through the wilderness with my father. It was nigh noon, and we had stopped at the cabin to unsaddle and bait. The man at the cabin pointed out the rifle, and told whose it was, adding that the colonel was that moment sleeping on wolf-skins in the corn-loft above, so we must not talk very loud, for the colonel had been out all night hunting (Indians, mind), {{and it would be}} cruel to disturb his sleep. Curious to see one so famous, we waited two hours over, in hopes he would come forth; but he did not. So, it being necessary to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> cabin before nightfall, we had at last to ride off without the wished-for satisfaction. Though, to tell the truth, I, for one, did not go away entirely ungratified, for, while my father was watering the horses, I slipped back into the cabin, and stepping a round or two up the ladder, pushed my head through the trap, and peered about. Not much light in the loft; but off, in the further corner, I saw what I took to be the wolf-skins, and on them a bundle of something, like a drift of leaves; and at one end, what seemed a moss-ball; and over it, deer-antlers branched; and close by, a small squirrel sprang out from a maple-bowl of nuts, brushed the moss-ball with his tail, through a hole, and vanished, squeaking. That bit of woodland scene was all I saw. No Colonel Moredock there, unless that moss-ball was his curly head, seen in the back view. I would have gone clear up, but the man below had warned me, that though, from his camping habits, the colonel could sleep through thunder, he was for the same cause amazing quick to waken at the sound of footsteps, however soft, and especially if human." ...|$|E
