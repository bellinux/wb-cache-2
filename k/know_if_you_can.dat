5|$|In 2011, Frusciante married Nicole Turley, drummer {{and lead}} vocalist of the {{experimental}} band Swahili Blonde. On May 8, 2015 {{it was announced that}} Turley had filed for divorce. On October 3, 2015, Turley announced that she was seeking $75,000 a month as part of their divorce settlement. According to court documents, Turley, who was already being paid $20,000 a month, needs a higher payment to maintain her quality of living. She claims her finances are down to only $30,000. Turley said that Frusciante was worth $14 million and she was entitled to more money saying that together the couple employed a team of personal assistants, and owned three homes and a private music studio. A week later Frusciante responded to Turley's demands saying that he refuses to pay her any more money and that she is also seeking $2,600 a month for gifts and expenses for her adult brother. He also said he was done footing the bill for her musical career saying “I don’t <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> call her recording efforts a hobby or a past-time … but it seems improper to characterize Nicole as a professional musician.” On October 19, 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Turley saying Frusciante had to pay his former wife $53,000 a month. Frusciante was also forced to pay $71,000 for Turley's legal expenses.|$|E

The storm {{was not expected}} to disrupt oil supplies from these two nations. However, oil prices rose early on June 5 because of concerns of disruptions caused by Gonu, {{as well as the}} threat of nationwide strikes in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer. Crude oil for July delivery rose $1.13, or 1.7percent, to $66.21 Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close in 15 days.

Hillenburg described the process, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was hard to get}} people. Most of the people that allow themselves to be on have kids who like the show. Often, they're kids are fans.

[Footnote 1: The {{following}} anecdote {{related by}} Mr. Coleridge, in April, 1811, was preserved and communicated {{to me by}} Mr. Justice Coleridge:--"As I was descending from Mount AEtna with a very lively talkative guide, we passed through a village (I think called) Nicolozzi, when the host happened to be passing through the street. Every one was prostrate; my guide became so; and, not to be singular, I went down also. After resuming our journey, I observed in my guide an unusual seriousness and long silence, which, after many hums and hahs, {{was interrupted by a}} low bow, and leave requested to ask a question. This was of course granted, and the ensuing dialogue took place. Guide. [...] "Signor, are you then a Christian?" [...] Coleridge. [...] "I hope so." [...] G. [...] "What! are all Englishmen Christians?" [...] C. [...] "I hope and trust they are." [...] G. [...] "What! are you not Turks? Are you not damned eternally?" [...] C. [...] "I trust not, through Christ." [...] G. [...] "What! you believe in Christ then?" [...] C. [...] "Certainly." [...] This answer produced another long silence. At length my guide again spoke, still doubting the grand point of my Christianity. G. [...] "I'm thinking, Signor, {{what is the difference between}} you and us, that you are to be certainly damned?" [...] C. [...] "Nothing very material; nothing that can prevent our both going to heaven, I hope. We believe in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." [...] G. (interrupting me) [...] "Oh those damned priests! what liars they are! But (pausing) we can't do without them; we can't go to heaven without them. But tell me, Signor, what are the differences?" [...] C. [...] "Why, for instance, we do not worship the Virgin." [...] G. [...] "And why not, Signor?" [...] C. [...] "Because, though holy and pure, we think her still a woman, and, therefore, do not pay her the honour due to God." [...] G. [...] "But do you not worship Jesus, who sits on the right hand of God?" [...] C. [...] "We do." [...] G. [...] "Then why not worship the Virgin, who sits on the left?" [...] C. [...] "I did not <b>know</b> she did. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> show it me in the Scriptures, I shall readily agree to worship her."
