5|$|It {{was also}} {{at this time that}} Shostakovich {{composed}} the first of his string quartets. His chamber works allowed him to experiment and express ideas which would have been unacceptable in his more public symphonic pieces.

5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One {{is that with}} increasing reputation and <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and {{had more time to}} develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E

While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.|$|E

They married in July 1872, with Mussorgsky serving as best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs had seven children.

It proposed cash advances for farm-stored wheat, {{short and long term}} loans for farmers at low interest rates, and government support of prices, to assure the farmer a full income even in bad years. For the Atlantic fisherman, the CCF proposed cash advances {{at the start of the}} fishing season and government-owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices.|$|E

The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> in their final years.

5|$|A {{month after}} the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted {{in the ranks of}} those who fought against the {{military}} uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{supported}} {{himself as}} an organist at the English Church, where the chaplain had previously known Bache's brother Edward. As {{his reputation as a}} performer grew, he also came into demand as a teacher. These two activities guaranteed <b>financial</b> <b>security.</b> He also became acquainted with several young gifted musicians, including fellow Liszt pupil Giovanni Sgambati and violinist Ettore Pinelli. During this time, Bache began exploring the two-piano repertoire, especially the arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poem Les préludes and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy, which he performed with Sgambati in concert. The two-piano arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poems would become an important feature of Bache's concert series once he returned to England. He was also active in chamber music—the works he performed during this time include Chopin's cello sonata, the David-Pinelli Violin Variations, Mendelssohn's D minor piano trio, a piano trio by Anton Rubinstein and a Schumann violin sonata arranged for viola.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run of}} Iolanthe, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert {{that had}} earned him the {{broadest}} fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should {{put an end to}} his career as a composer of comic opera—that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Sullivan, despite the <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after Iolanthe opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.|$|E

5|$|Franck found a {{position}} at the Polytekniske Læreanstalt in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide <b>financial</b> <b>security</b> for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold medal, along with that of Max von Laue in aqua regia to prevent the Germans from taking them. He placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.|$|E

May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide <b>financial</b> <b>security.</b> May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E

It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler {{had to deal with}} the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow happening only a few years after Keplers excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.|$|E
