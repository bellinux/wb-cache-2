5|$|During {{the postwar}} years, Lutosławski {{worked on his}} first symphony—sketches {{of which he had}} {{salvaged}} from Warsaw—which he had started in 1941 and which was first performed in 1948, conducted by Fitelberg. To provide for his family, he also composed music that <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> functional, such as the Warsaw Suite (written to accompany a silent film depicting the city's reconstruction), sets of Polish Carols, and the study pieces for piano, Melodie Ludowe ("Folk Melodies").|$|E
5|$|In February 1843, Macdonald {{announced}} his candidacy {{for the post}} of alderman in Kingston's Fourth Ward. On 29 March 1843, Macdonald celebrated his first election victory, with 156 votes against 43 for his opponent, a Colonel Jackson. He also suffered what <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> his first downfall, as his supporters, carrying the victorious candidate, accidentally dropped him onto a slushy street.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Mendel's work, the {{dominant}} theory of heredity {{was one of}} blending inheritance, which suggested that each parent contributed fluids to the fertilisation process and that the traits of the parents blended and mixed to produce the offspring. Charles Darwin developed a theory of inheritance <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> pangenesis, from Greek pan ("all, whole") and genesis ("birth") / genos ("origin"). Darwin used the term gemmule to describe hypothetical particles that would mix during reproduction.|$|E
50|$|Jacobs {{claims that}} {{criticism}} of Israel, which <b>he</b> <b>terms</b> “anti-Israelism,” {{is equivalent to}} anti-Semitism, and further argues that “anti-Israelism dominates the current discourse.” Jacobs has often warned of what <b>he</b> <b>terms</b> a “left/Muslim alliance” antagonistic to Israel.|$|R

5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as part of what <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{rejected}} {{the use of}} fiscal policy {{as a tool of}} demand management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> the Great Contraction, arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve.|$|E

5|$|While {{he worked}} {{extensively}} {{in the tradition of}} earlier Renaissance polyphony, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica, contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> the prima pratica. Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.|$|E
25|$|In 1845, Faraday {{discovered}} that many materials exhibit a weak repulsion from a magnetic field: a phenomenon <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> diamagnetism.|$|E
25|$|His works {{include a}} {{detailed}} description of what <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> the 'non-natural features' of the planet's surface, including especially a full account of the 'canals,' single and double; the 'oases,' as <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> the dark spots at their intersections; and the varying visibility of both, depending partly on the Martian seasons. He theorized that an advanced but desperate culture had built the canals to tap Mars' polar ice caps, the last source of water on an inexorably drying planet.|$|E

25|$|Muslim {{neoconservative}} journalist Stephen Schwartz, Executive Director of {{the non-profit}} Center for Islamic Pluralism, said that building the center {{two blocks from}} Ground Zero is inconsistent with the Sufi philosophy of simplicity of faith and sensitivity towards others and disregards the security of American Muslims.

25|$|From {{the above}} {{examples}} {{one can see}} why understanding of referred pain can lead to better diagnoses of various conditions and diseases. In 1981 physiotherapist Robin McKenzie described what <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> centralization. He concluded that centralization occurs when referred pain moves from a distal to a more proximal location. Observations {{in support of this}} idea were seen when patients would bend backward and forward during an examination.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, Lessig {{launched}} a crowd-funded {{political action committee}} which <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> Mayday PAC {{with the purpose of}} electing candidates to Congress who would pass campaign finance reform. He is on the boards of MapLight and Represent.us. He serves on the advisory boards of the Democracy Café and the Sunlight Foundation. Lessig's TED talks explaining the corruption of Congress and how to stop it have been viewed by millions.|$|E

25|$|Darden had {{a rather}} {{idiosyncratic}} term he {{used to describe the}} underside, substratum of architecture (and certainly this applied to anything in general), which <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> the underbelly. It was a term/idea that Darden himself did not feel could be fully defined, as he expresses in Douglas Darden: Looking After the Underbelly, but generally refers to the unknown and the unknowable, the unconventional, unexpected, improper, obscene, and ultimately the inverse of custom and tradition.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel Harvey {{was also}} {{critical}} of Kranich. In a marginal note in his copy of Georg Meier's In Iudaeorum Medicastrorum Calumnias (1570), he compared Kranich to the Queen's physician, Doctor Lopez, whom <b>he</b> <b>termed</b> 'none of the learnedest or expertest physicians in the court, {{but one that}} maketh as great account of himself as the best'. Harvey added: 'Doctor Burcot was in a manner such another; who so bold as blind Bayard?'.|$|E
25|$|William Smith (1769–1839), an English canal engineer, {{observed}} that rocks {{of different ages}} (based {{on the law of}} superposition) preserved different assemblages of fossils, and that these assemblages succeeded one another in a regular and determinable order. He {{observed that}} rocks from distant locations could be correlated based on the fossils they contained. <b>He</b> <b>termed</b> this the principle of faunal succession. This principle became one of Darwin's chief pieces of evidence that biological evolution was real.|$|E
