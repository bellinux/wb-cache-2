O leitmotiv da realização desta investigação é avaliar a utilização destes recursos, quer nas práticas pedagógicas inovadoras por parte dos docentes, quer na contribuição para melhorar a aprendizagem dos alunos. No sentido de melhor compreender e analisar o impacto da integração dos recursos digitais no ensino-aprendizagem, escolhemos os recursos da Porto Editora, visto tratar-se de um estudo de caso centrado numa escola que adotou estes recursos. A partir de um enquadramento metodológico que procura ultrapassar as dicotomias entre as abordagens quantitativas e as abordagens qualitativas, centramos o nosso estudo numa unidade didática, Astronomia, lecionada no 7 º ano de escolaridade, na disciplina de Ciências Físico-Químicas. Com base num modelo heurístico, os dados recolhidos através de questionários a professores e alunos numa escola onde a investigadora estagiou, referente a este conteúdo, indicam que a utilização dos referidos recursos digitais no ensino-aprendizagem, fomentou a motivação para a realização de atividades propostas, facilitou a compreensão e a aprendizagem de conceitos e motivou os alunos para o estudo na disciplina de Ciências Físico-Químicas. Não podemos deixar de enfatizar a exploração do manual interativo, como um elemento extremamente inovador, e simultaneamente potenciador da disseminação de conhecimentos em espaços não convencionais de ensino, pela possibilidade de autoaprendizagem, respeitando as particularidades dos alunos. No entendimento de uma postura de abertura e de investigação permanente e, conscientes de que o ensino-aprendizagem engloba inúmeros fatores, apontamos alguns trajetos investigativos possíveis que poderão, eventualmente, despontar, a partir deste estudo.  In this {{dissertation}} we {{scrutinize the}} use of the school manual in the classroom, in line with the changes in pedagogical practices resulting from the existence of new digital resources added to the school manual, such as the <b>e-manual,</b> such as CD-ROMs and DVDs and educational platforms on the Internet, in particular, the Virtual School, from Porto Editora. The leitmotiv of this research is to evaluate {{the use of}} these resources, both innovative pedagogical practices used by the teachers and their contribution to improve learning. In order to better understand and analyze the impact of the integration of the digital resources in the teaching-learning process, we choose the resources of Porto Editora, as it is a case study centered on a school which adopted these resources. From a methodological framework which seeks to overcome the dichotomies between the quantitative and qualitative approaches, we focused our study on a teaching unit, astronomy, taught in the 7 th year of schooling, in the discipline of Physics-Chemistry Science. Based on a heuristic model, the data collected through questionnaires to teachers and students from several schools {{in the center of the}} country, concerning this content, indicate that {{the use of the}}se digital resources, in the teaching-learning process, has fostered the motivation for the suggested activities, facilitated the understanding and learning of concepts and motivated students to the study of this subject of Physics-Chemistry program. We should emphasize the use of the interactive manual, as an extremely innovative element, and simultaneously a dissemination of knowledge enhancer in non-conventional teaching spaces, because of the potential of self-learning, respecting the particularities of pupils. In the understanding of a position of openness and permanent research, aware that the teaching-learning process encompasses numerous factors, we point out some possible investigative approaches that may likely emerge from this study.

These relationships provides the services that are essential for marine organisms to sustain in the nature. The studies examining the structure and functioning of these relationships remains unclear and hence understanding and modelling of the ecological functioning is imperative {{in the context of}} the threats different ecosystem components are facing. The relationship between marine population and their environment is complex and is subjected to fluctuations which affects the bottom level of an ecosystem pyramid to higher trophic levels. Understanding the energy flow within the marine ecosystems with the help of primary to secondary producers and secondary consumers are potentially important when assessing such states and changes in these environments. Many of the physiological changes are known to affect the key functional group, ie. the species or group of organisms, which play an important role in the health of the ecosystem. In marine environment, phytoplankton are the main functional forms which serves as the base of marine food web. Any change in the phytoplankton community structure may lead to alteration in the composition, size and structure of the entire ecosystem. Hence, it is critical to understand how these effects may scale up to population, communities, and entire marine ecosystem. Such changes are difficult to predict, particularly when more than one trophic level is affected. The identification and quantification of indicators of changes in ecosystem functioning and the knowledge base generated will provide a suitable way of bridging issues related to a specific ecosystem. New and meaningful indicators, derived from our current understanding of marine ecosystem functioning, can be used for assessing the impact of these changes and can be used as an aid in promoting responsible fisheries in marine ecosystems. Phytoplantkon is an indicator determining the colour of open Ocean. In recent years, new technologies have emerged which involves multidisciplinary activities including biogeochemistry and its dynamics affecting higher trophic levels including fishery. The winter school proposed will provide the insights into background required for such an approach involving teaching the theory, practical, analysis and interpretation techniques in understanding the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems from ground truth measurements as well as from satellite remote sensing data. This is organized with the full funding support from Indian council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) New Delhi and the 25 participants who are attending this programme has been selected after scrutiny of their applications based on their bio-data. The participants are from different States across Indian subcontinent covering north, east, west and south. They are serving as academicians such as Professors/ scientists and in similar posts. The training will be a feather in their career and will enable them to do their academic programmes in a better manner. Selected participants will be scrutinized initially to understand their knowledge level and classes will be oriented based on this. In addition, all of them will be provided with an <b>e-manual</b> based on the classes. All selected participants are provided with their travel and accommodation grants. The faculty include the scientists who developed this technology, those who are practicing it and few user groups who do their research in related areas. The programme is coordinated by the Fishery Resources Assessment Division of CMFRI. This programme will generate a team of elite academicians who can contribute to sustainable management of marine ecosystem and they will further contribute to capacity building in the sector by training many more interested researchers in the years to come...|$|E

Work on any scientific, pedagogical or similar project is inconceivable without existing knowledge collation {{and without the}} consistent study of information resources. Scientific information is the assumption, mediator and final result of scientific, research and pedagogical activity of physicians. Institute of Scientific Information at 1 st Medical Faculty (Charles University in Prague) ensures information support for physicians, tutors, students and professional community. It is divided into several departments: library, bibliographic department and reference department. It offers an access to many e-resources and also takes part in education of the students of 1 st Medical Faculty. The main function of certified course “Scientific and Research Work” (developed from “Library Science”) is to prepare full-time students and extra-mural students in medical and non-medical field for their work with everyday professional information. After completion of the course, students should be oriented in the flood of information, {{be able to find}} and choose relevant scientific documents and utilize them according to their study needs. Through 20 -year-experiences with the teaching at 1 st Medical Faculty, Institute of Scientific Information tries to enrich basic knowledge by implementing new e-methods in education (<b>e-manuals,</b> e-presentations, etc.). The tutors also respond to current situation in the research field and in the operation of the institute. Tuition conception is unified for the particular forms of the study. We are going to support e-learning and preparing e-scripts. Their content will be placed in Wikiskripta. The Institute of Scientific Information closely cooperates with the Institute of Information Studies and Librarianship, the Faculty of Arts, Charles University – their tutors participate in teaching at 1 st Medical Faculty and together with us apprise the function of our institute to foreign students from ERASMUS exchange study program...|$|R
