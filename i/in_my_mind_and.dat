25|$|I had not {{a dispute}} but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> at once {{it struck me}} what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, {{especially}} in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.|$|E

'Can't get them over on the stage,' said the producer, and I humbly bowed to his judgment. However, these fragments stayed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> gradually I saw a poem shaping itself round them: in the end it came out as 'Burnt Norton.' ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can I Have It Like That" [...] is a [...] song {{performed}} by rapper Pharrell Williams featuring Gwen Stefani. [...] It was written and produced by Williams for his 2006 debut album <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind,</b> <b>and</b> {{the song is}} the opening track. [...] The song's hook comes from a one-line contribution from Stefani, used {{as part of a}} call and response in the chorus.

500|$|... "Can I Have It Like That" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Entertainment Weekly {{called it an}} [...] "odd opener" [...] to <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> <b>and</b> remarked that Williams [...] "never commits to putting his hips into it", leaving the track without any climax. [...] The Observers Luke Bainbridge, however, referred to the song as [...] "a grinding instant smash". For IGN, Spence Abbott described Williams' rapping as [...] "a little sticky, but…ruggedly appealing {{in a manner of}} speaking", and commented that [...] "it's the shuffling and infectious beat…that will have you swerving and slinking like a cobra with epilepsy." [...] In his review for Slant Magazine, Preston Jones characterized the song as [...] "curiously inert", adding that it sounded better as a sample on Girl Talk's 2006 mashup album Night Ripper.|$|E
500|$|In 1665, Bashō and Yoshitada {{together}} with some acquaintances composed a hyakuin, or one-hundred-verse renku. In 1666, Yoshitada's sudden death brought Bashō's peaceful {{life as a}} servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but {{it is believed that}} Bashō gave up any possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto miko named , which is unlikely to be true. Bashō's own references to this time are vague; he recalled that [...] "at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that [...] "there was a time when I was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love": there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or fictional ones. He was uncertain whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, [...] "the alternatives battled <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> made my life restless". His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of renga and haikai no renga as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors. In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published a compilation of work by himself and other authors of the Teitoku school, , in 1672. In about the spring of that year he moved to Edo, to further his study of poetry.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, good-girl Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E

Josephus recounts: [...] "I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered." [...] Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve.|$|E
2500|$|Media personalities {{have weighed}} in on the confrontations. During the standoff, Bundy was interviewed (via remote link) by {{television}} host Sean Hannity. Hannity stated that some fear events could wind up mirroring the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge and said, [...] "This is public land, and it's not being used, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> I'm not a rancher, (but) I would think the federal government might be thankful because you're cutting the lawn for free, and they're charging huge amounts of money, right, to let your cattle graze there with these fees". In contrast, a comparison of BLM grazing fees with private land market prices demonstrated the Bundy's are getting a 93% discount by grazing on BLM land.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} who later becomes Mockingbird first {{appears in a}} short sequence in Astonishing Tales #6 (June 1971) in which a frantic young brunette arrives at the English country estate of Lord Kevin Plunder (who {{is also known as}} [...] "Ka-Zar"). Encountering the butler, she exclaims, [...] "Lord Kevin Plunder where is he? I must speak with him! ‘tis a matter—of the fate of worlds!" [...] In a brief second appearance in the same issue, the character claims that [...] "Lord Kevin Plunder and I have never met—and yet I feel that I know him...You see, I can—can 'feel' people <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind!</b> <b>And</b> I know that unless I speak with him—Lord Kevin will die!" [...] Subsequent creators continued to develop the character, and no later story makes reference to any psychic abilities.|$|E

2500|$|Gerber wrote 27 {{issues of}} the series (for the most part {{ditching}} the horror parodies), illustrated {{by a variety of}} artists, beginning with Frank Brunner. For Gerber, Howard was a flesh and blood duck and that, [...] "if Wile E. Coyote gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote who can be expected to snap back to three dimensions within moments; if Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt." [...] Gene Colan became the regular penciller with issue #4. Gerber later said to Colan: [...] "There really was almost a telepathic connection there. I would see something <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> that is what you would draw! I've never had that experience with another artist before or since." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] in [...] "A Transatlantic Interview - 1946", Stein insisted that this work was completely [...] "realistic" [...] {{in the tradition of}} Gustave Flaubert, stating the following: [...] "I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> create a word relationship between the word and the things seen." [...] Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the reference of objects remained central to her work, although the representation of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that [...] "nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know." ...|$|E

By then, the Lower East Side was, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world." [...] "I certainly didn’t think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I {{had no idea what was}} about to happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1924 the British and Irish governments {{agreed to}} attend the [...] "Boundary Commission" [...] to redraw the border which {{partitioned}} Ireland between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. The Free State's representative was Eoin MacNeill, a respected scholar and Minister for Education. The Free State expected to gain much territory in heavily Catholic and republican parts of counties Londonderry, Fermanagh, Tyrone, and Armagh, as the British government had indicated during the treaty negotiations that {{the wishes of the}} nationalist inhabitants along the border would be taken into account. However, after months of secret negotiations a newspaper reported that there would be little change to the border and the Free State would actually lose territory in Donegal. MacNeill resigned from the commission and the government for not reporting to Cosgrave on the details of the commission. Cosgrave immediately went to London for a meeting with the British Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, where they agreed to let the border remain as it was, and in return the Free State did not have to pay its pro-rata share of the Imperial debt. In the Dáil debate on 7 December Cosgrave stated: [...] "I had only one figure <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> that was a huge nought. That was the figure I strove to get, and I got it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Lynch {{was working}} on the first few episodes of Twin Peaks, his friend Monty Montgomery [...] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be {{executive}} producer or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." [...] The book was Barry Gifford's novel Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula, which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was [...] "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> many different things happened." [...] With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called Wild at Heart, a crime and road movie starring Nicolas Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula. Describing his plot as a [...] "strange blend" [...] of [...] "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film The Wizard of Oz. Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1989, Lynch had {{finished}} the pilot episode for the successful Twin Peaks television series and tried to rescue two of his projects – Ronnie Rocket and One Saliva Bubble – both involved in contractual complications {{as a result of}} Dino De Laurentiis' bankruptcy, which had been bought by Carolco Pictures. Lynch stated, [...] "I've had a bad time with obstacles... It wasn't Dino's fault, but when his company went down the tubes, I got swallowed up in that". Independent production company Propaganda Films commissioned Lynch to develop an updated noir screenplay based on a 1940s crime novel while Monty Montgomery, a friend of Lynch's and an associate producer on Twin Peaks, asked novelist Barry Gifford what he was working on. Gifford happened to be writing the manuscript for Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula but still had two more chapters to write. He let Montgomery read it in pre-published galley form while the producer was working on the pilot episode for Twin Peaks. Montgomery read it and two days later called Gifford and told him that he wanted to make a film of it. Two days afterwards, Montgomery gave Lynch Gifford’s book while he was editing the pilot, asking him if he would executive produce a film adaptation that he would direct. Lynch remembers telling him, [...] "That’s great Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?" [...] Montgomery did not think that Lynch would like the book because he did not think it was his [...] "kind of thing." [...] Lynch loved the book and called Gifford soon afterwards, asking him if he could make a film of it. Lynch remembers, [...] "It was just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> many different things happened." [...] Lynch was drawn to what he saw as [...] "a really modern romance in a violent world – a picture about finding love in hell," [...] and was also attracted to [...] "a certain amount of fear in the picture, as well as things to dream about. So it seems truthful in some way." ...|$|E
