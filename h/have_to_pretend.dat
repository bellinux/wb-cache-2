500|$|Just before Dwight {{starts his}} fire simulation, {{he said his}} {{co-workers}} previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, [...] "PowerPoint is boring". Michael refers to Barack Obama, the first African American president of the United States, to Stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting, [...] "Stanley! Barack is president! You are black! Stanley!" [...] A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl half-jokingly telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (they no longer <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because [...] "he's more for you guys"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart {{to the tune of}} [...] "Stayin' Alive", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by Gloria Gaynor. At the end of the lesson, Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and places it on his face in the manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs [...] "You Make My Dreams Come True" [...] by Hall and Oates, [...] "All Out of Love" [...] by the soft rock duo Air Supply, [...] "Have a Little Faith in Me" [...] by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and [...] "Lady" [...] by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday.|$|E

Later, before Noah Bennet is about to leave on business, Sandra tells him that she is only pretending to have had her mind wiped, as he told her to do; and that he had told her everything about what he really did, who he works for, and what happened to Claire. She gives him a note that he left for himself, warning him not to look for Claire because she is with friends. Then, Bennet and Candice travel to New York to [...] "clean up" [...] Isaac's mess.

2500|$|In 2003 Dom {{underwent}} a storyline where he fell for {{his best friends}} sister, 15-year-old Delphi Greenlaw. Cortese was at first uncomfortable with the storyline, stating; [...] "I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful." [...] Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dom was truly in love with Delphi; [...] "Dom sees Delphi as his soul mate, she affects {{him in a way}} no one has before because he's always been suspicious of relationships. He doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> to be anyone else for her to like him." [...] Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; [...] "To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion makes you think, ‘Okay, he’s an absolute bastard but we know he does love Delphi." [...] The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss. The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dom comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines. Dom flees when Delphi confronts him about the murder but later returns, with Cortese suggesting it was for love; [...] "But the thing about Dominic is he believes he's doing everything for the right reasons. He's done everything he can for Delphi— that's his main reason for coming back." [...] Dom later scares Delphi into fleeing the country, ending the once seemingly perfect relationship.|$|E
