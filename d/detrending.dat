50|$|Note that A {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} the Intrinsic mode functions of a noise corrupted signal can help in estimating {{the significance of that}} mode. It is usually assumed that the first IMF captures most of the noise and hence from this IMF we could estimate the Noise level and estimate the noise corrupted signal eliminating the effects of noise approximately. This method is known as Denoising and <b>Detrending.</b> Another advantage of using the MEEMD is that the mode mixing is reduced significantly due to the function of the EEMD.The Denoising and <b>Detrending</b> strategy can be used for image processing to enhance an image and similarly it could be applied to Audio Signals to remove corrupted data in speech.

50|$|The {{first to}} {{introduce}} and analyse {{the concept of}} spurious—or nonsense—correlations was Udne Yule in 1926.Before the 1980s many economists used linear regressions on (de-trended) non-stationary time series data, which Nobel laureate Clive Granger and Paul Newbold showed to be a dangerous approach that could produce spurious correlation, since standard <b>detrending</b> techniques can result in data that are still non-stationary. Granger's 1987 paper with Robert Engle formalized the cointegrating vector approach, and coined the term.|$|E
50|$|The AMO {{signal is}} usually defined from the {{patterns}} of SST variability in the North Atlantic once any linear trend has been removed. This <b>detrending</b> is intended to remove the influence of greenhouse gas-induced global warming from the analysis. However, if the global warming signal is significantly non-linear in time (i.e. not just a smooth linear increase), variations in the forced signal will leak into the AMO definition. Consequently, correlations with the AMO index may mask effects of global warming.|$|E

This cooling had contributed towards the recent Global warming hiatus in surface temperatures, and would change to enhanced surface warming in the next phase of the oscillation.|$|E

We assess the long range dependence over time through Hurst exponents of pound-dollar and extended euro-dollar exchange rates employing three alternative techniques, namely rescaled range analysis, <b>detrended</b> fluctuation analysis, and <b>detrended</b> moving average.

30|$|The <b>detrended</b> TEC map at 05 : 50 UT in Fig. 2 (a), {{about four}} {{minutes after the}} {{earthquake}} onset, indicates that any remarkable TEC variations were not observed over Japan. At 05 : 55 UT in Fig. 2 (b), enhancements of the <b>detrended</b> TEC were observed {{in the vicinity of}} the epicenter. It is noted that the trend of the vertical TEC obtained with a 10 -minute running average decreases (increases) within five minutes before the sudden depletion (enhancement) in the vertical TEC. The <b>detrended</b> TEC derived by subtracting this trend from the vertical TEC could show a virtual enhancement (depletion) during this period. Considering the time sequence of the vertical TEC in Fig. 1 (a) and the characteristics of this <b>detrended</b> technique, the enhancements of the <b>detrended</b> TEC would correspond to the sudden depletions in the vertical TEC. The center of these enhancements (represented by cross marks in Fig. 2) was estimated to be around 37.5 °N of latitude and 144.0 °E of longitude. We termed this center the “ionospheric epicenter”. The ionospheric epicenter was about 170 km distance from the epicenter in the southeast direction.|$|R

In comparison to standard OI, used in Data assimilation, DIVA, when applied to ocean data, takes into account coastlines, sub-basins and advection because of its variational formulation on the real domain.

50|$|The {{statistical}} methods {{used in the}} MBH reconstruction were questioned in a 2004 paper by Hans von Storch with a team including Eduardo Zorita, which said that the methodology used to average the data and the wide uncertainties might have hidden abrupt climate changes, possibly {{as large as the}} 20th century spike in measured temperatures. They used the pseudoproxy method which Mann and Rutherford had developed in 2002, and like them found that regression methods of reconstruction tended to underestimate the amplitude of variation, a problem covered by the wide error bars in MBH99. It was a reasonable critique of nearly all the reconstructions at that time, but MBH were singled out. Other researchers subsequently found that the von Storch paper had an undisclosed additional step which, by <b>detrending</b> data before estimating statistical relationships, had removed the main pattern of variation. The von Storch et al. view that the graph was defective overall was refuted by Wahl, Ritson and Ammann (2006).|$|E

A regression of the variable at date t+h on the four most recent values as of date t offers a robust approach to <b>detrending</b> that achieves all the objectives sought by users of the HP filter with none of its drawbacks." ...|$|E

5000|$|Zorita and von Storch later claimed {{their paper}} was a {{breakthrough}} in moving the question from [...] "the reality of the blade of the hockey stick" [...] to focus on [...] "the real problems, namely the ‘wobbliness’ of the shaft of the hockey-stick, and the suppressing of valid scientific questions by gate keeping."

The von Storch et al. view that the graph was defective overall was refuted by Wahl, Ritson and Ammann (2006), who pointed to this incorrect implementation of the reconstruction procedure.

5000|$|Yule (1936) and Granger and Newbold (1974) {{were the}} first to draw {{attention}} to the problem of spurious correlation and find solutions on how to address it in time series analysis. Given two completely unrelated but integrated (non-stationary) time series, the regression analysis of one on the other will tend to produce an apparently statistically significant relationship and thus a researcher might falsely believe to have found evidence of a true relationship between these variables. Ordinary least squares will no longer be consistent and commonly used test-statistics will be non-valid. In particular, Monte Carlo simulations show that one will get a very high R squared, very high individual t-statistic and a low Durbin-Watson statistic. Technically speaking, Phillips (1986) proved that parameter estimates will not converge in probability, the intercept will diverge and the slope will have a non-degenerate distribution as the sample size increases. However, there might a common stochastic trend to both series that a researcher is genuinely interested in because it reflects a long-run relationship between these variables. Because of the stochastic nature of the trend it is not possible to break up integrated series into a deterministic (predictable) trend and a stationary series containing deviations from trend. Even in deterministically detrended random walks walks spurious correlations will eventually emerge. Thus <b>detrending</b> doesn't solve the estimation problem. In order to still use the [...] Box-Jenkins approach, one could difference the series and then estimate models such as ARIMA, given that many commonly used time series (e.g. in economics) appear to be stationary in first differences. Forecasts from such a model will still reflect cycles and seasonality that are present in the data. However, any information about long-run adjustments that the data in levels may contain is omitted and longer term forecasts will be unreliable. This lead Sargan (1964) to develop the ECM methodology, which retains the level information.|$|E

40|$|Non-parametric <b>detrending</b> or noise {{reduction}} methods are often employed to separate trends from noisy time series when no satisfactory models exist {{to fit the}} data. However, conventional <b>detrending</b> methods depend on subjective choices of <b>detrending</b> parameters. Here, we present a simple multivariate <b>detrending</b> method based on available nonlinear forecasting techniques. These are in turn based on state space reconstruction for which a strong theoretical justification exists for their use in non-parametric forecasting. The <b>detrending</b> method presented here is conceptually similar to Schreiber's {{noise reduction}} method using state space reconstruction. However, we show that Schreiber's method contains a minor flaw that can be overcome with forecasting. Furthermore, our <b>detrending</b> method contains a simple but nontrivial extension to multivariate time series.
