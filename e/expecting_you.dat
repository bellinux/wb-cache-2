I don't like to make the [...] outright say [...] "I need you to do X, then I'll give you Y"...– it makes the character into an automated quest kiosk.

500|$|Renwick {{decided to}} use the {{flashback}} structure for several reasons. He felt that the episode should be about [...] "life After Victor, which I think will be more interesting and not the route people are <b>expecting</b> <b>you</b> to take." [...] He realised that most viewers would have been aware of Victor's death because of the press coverage; there would be little point in having the death be the climax of the episode because everyone already knew the outcome. However, the focus would be upon Victor's death rather than the details of the accident. Renwick's decision to kill Victor in a road accident was fuelled by the writer's concerns about reckless driving. Also, the suddenness of an accident, as opposed to death by illness, would not negate the comic tone {{of the rest of the}} episode. The twist that the person responsible for Victor's death is Margaret's new best friend was designed to add some complexity to the show.|$|E
500|$|Having seen Black Mischief {{launched}} to mixed {{but generally}} favourable critical comment (Oldmeadow's intervention was not immediate), Waugh sailed from Tilbury on 2 December 1932. He arrived in British Guiana on 23 December, and after some days of indecision opted {{to accompany the}} district commissioner for Rupununi, on a journey into the interior. He hoped that he might reach Manaus, a large city deep within the Brazilian jungle, but transport proved unreliable, and he got {{no further than the}} border town of Boa Vista. On the way, at one of his overnight stopping points, he encountered Mr Christie, an elderly mixed-race settler who greeted him by saying, [...] "I was <b>expecting</b> <b>you.</b> I was warned in a vision of your approach". The two enjoyed an agreeable dinner together, where Christie talked of the [...] "Fifth Kingdom" [...] (a biblical prophecy from the Book of Daniel). He told Waugh that he had seen the entire gathering of the saints in heaven—surprisingly few, he said—but could not count them because they were incorporeal. Waugh added Christie to his [...] "treasury of eccentrics", set aside for future literary use.|$|E

Let me add that if you do things merely because you think some other fool <b>expects</b> <b>you</b> to do them, and he <b>expects</b> <b>you</b> to do them because he thinks <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> him to <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to do them, it will end in {{everybody}} doing what nobody wants to do, which is in my opinion a silly state of things.|$|R

500|$|Williams {{released}} his second album, I've Been <b>Expecting</b> <b>You,</b> in October 1998. It too topped the UK Albums Chart and experienced reasonable international success, reaching the top twenty of several worldwide charts. Two of the album's singles, [...] "Millennium" [...] and the double A-side [...] "She's the One" [...] / [...] "It's Only Us", became Williams' first singles {{as a solo}} artist to top the UK Singles Chart. Sing When You're Winning followed in August 2000, and became his first to achieve significant overseas commercial success, topping many national album charts and including the UK number-ones [...] "Rock DJ" [...] and [...] "Eternity" [...] / [...] "The Road to Mandalay". A collection of covers of popular swing songs, entitled Swing When You're Winning, was released in November 2001 and his cover of the Carson Parks song [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] with actress Nicole Kidman became his most successful single to date, reaching the top three of many singles charts and peaking at {{number one in the}} United Kingdom and New Zealand. During 2002, Williams collaborated with concept band 1 Giant Leap on their single [...] "My Culture", which reached number nine in the UK. His next two albums, Escapology (2002) and Intensive Care (2005), maintained this success, both topping the UK Albums Chart, and contained the international top-five hits [...] "Feel" [...] and [...] "Tripping". Williams {{released his}} first live album, Live at Knebworth, in 2003 and his first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits, in 2004, with the latter certified six times platinum by the BPI and eight times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were <b>expecting,</b> <b>you</b> quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
