For such buildings simply insuring life safety and preventing collapse are not sufficient, and the buildings must remain operational during or suitable for immediate occupancy after a major earthquake.

40|$|This project {{examined}} {{the behavior of}} nonstructural components present in <b>essential</b> <b>facilities</b> in Mid-America. School buildings were chosen for detailed studies because of the vulnerability of their occupants {{and the importance of}} these particular facilities to post earthquake emergency response. An inventory of nonstructural components was made for this class of <b>essential</b> <b>facilities</b> using the categorization of components developed by FEMA. In addition, the results of an inventory of schools and other <b>essential</b> <b>facilities</b> from Project SE- 1 (Inventories of <b>Essential</b> <b>Facilities</b> in Mid-America) were used in this study. Partial height interior unreinforced masonry walls were found in many schools and because of their clear vulnerability to seismic forces were selected as the focus of this study. The primary objective of the present investigation was to evaluate and then suggest retrofit strategies for these components to enable them to meet the life safety and/or immediate occupancy performance levels specified in current FEMA guidelines. Additional objectives were to assess the accuracy of current evaluation methods recommended by FEMA and if necessary to develop improved analysis procedures, rehabilitation guidelines, and performance measures. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

The Redskins had a 30-year contract with the Armory Board prohibiting it from leasing to any other professional football team. The AFL would not consider the Hecht franchise application until Hecht had a stadium lease. PF would not negotiate a waiver of its exclusive stadium rights until Hecht had a franchise. The D.C.

When the Lorain Journals monopoly over advertising in the Lorain, Ohio area was threatened by the establishment of a competing radio station, the Journals publisher refused to accept advertising from those who advertised over the radio station and required them to advertise only in the Journal. The purpose of the publisher was to eliminate the competition of the radio station.

5000|$|In US {{antitrust}} law, monopolization is {{an offense}} {{and the main}} categories of prohibited behavior include exclusive dealing, price discrimination, refusing to supply an <b>essential</b> <b>facility,</b> product tying and predatory pricing. Monopolization is an offense under Section 2 of the American Sherman Antitrust Act 1890. It has a specific legal meaning, which {{is parallel to the}} [...] "abuse" [...] of a dominant position in EU competition law, under TFEU article 102. The Sherman Act 1890 §2 states that any person [...] "who shall monopolize [...] [...] [...] any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations shall be deemed guilty of a felony." [...] Section 2 also forbids [...] "attempts to monopolize" [...] and [...] "conspiracies to monopolize."

That criticism, Ratner argues, does not adequately address the problem of whether to prohibit the activities because they are socially harmful even without increasing market power. If nothing else, [...] "the market power possessed by essential facilities suggests that denial of access frequently will create economically harmful output reduction without increasing or maintaining market power." [...] Therefore, the essential facilities doctrine provides [...] "the only meaningful remedy for these harmful denials" [...] and unfortunately that [...] "requires someone, usually a poorly equipped federal court," [...] to impose judicial regulation.

5000|$|Glen Robinson {{argues that}} [...] "the {{essential}} facilities doctrine provides the proper framework for analyzing both regulatory and antitrust requirements for forced dealing or sharing among rivals." [...] In deciding {{what is an}} <b>essential</b> <b>facility,</b> Robinson deprecates the distinction between tangible assets (such as the transmission lines in Otter Tail) and intellectual property, based on the claim that it [...] "is critical for encouragingowners to invest in innovation." [...] He points out:An incentives problem is created any time one firm is permitted to free-ride on a competitor's investments, whether those investments are represented by tangible assets or intellectual property. Forced sharing of an unpatented or uncopyrighted gizmo undermines investment incentives {{to the same degree}} as forced sharing of a patented or copyrighted widget. In the former case, the owner's common law property right in the unpatented widget is entitled to the same legal protection as the property right in the patented gizmo for basically the same reason-to protect settled expectations and the incentive to create wealth. Innovation is merely one form of investment in wealth-creating activity. Regardless of the form of the investment, the ultimate task is to accommodate both the general laws of property and the special laws of antitrust.|$|E

"Every {{person who}} shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire {{with any other}} person or persons, to monopolize {{any part of the}} trade or {{commerce}} among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court." [...] Sherman Act 1890 §2 The law's treatment of monopolies is potentially the strongest in the field of antitrust law. Judicial remedies can force large organizations to be broken up, be run subject to positive obligations, massive penalties may be imposed, and/or the people involved can be sentenced to jail. Under §2 of the Sherman Act 1890 every [...] "person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize...any part of the trade or commerce among the several States" [...] commits an offence. The courts have interpreted this to mean that monopoly is not unlawful per se, but only if acquired through prohibited conduct. Historically, where the ability of judicial remedies to combat market power have ended, the legislature of states or the Federal government have still intervened by taking public ownership of an enterprise, or subjecting the industry to sector specific regulation (frequently done, for example, in the cases water, education, energy or health care). The law on public services and administration goes significantly beyond the realm of antitrust law's treatment of monopolies. When enterprises are not under public ownership, and where regulation does not foreclose the application of antitrust law, two requirements must be shown for the offense of monopolization. First, the alleged monopolist must possess sufficient power in an accurately defined market for its products or services. Second, the monopolist must have used its power in a prohibited way. The categories of prohibited conduct are not closed, and are contested in theory. Historically they have been held to include exclusive dealing, price discrimination, refusing to supply an <b>essential</b> <b>facility,</b> product tying and predatory pricing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} rationale in defining an <b>essential</b> <b>facility</b> also considering {{the evolution of}} competition policy decisions in US and EU.

We apply the test to a specific antitrust case regarding the railway sector in Italy. We conclude that in the GVG/FS case the European Commission went too far in defining incumbent’s locomotives as an <b>essential</b> <b>facility</b> for competitors to enter the Italian market. In our view, the Commission’s application of the <b>essential</b> <b>facility</b> doctrine in that case was redundant with respect to sanction a simple refusal to deal and had the potential to reduce consumers welfare.

Among other things it argues that a proper application of the doctrine of <b>essential</b> <b>facilities</b> should recognize the prominence of dynamic over static efficiency in promoting consumer welfare. Regulators may be averse to recognizing these tradeoffs because unlike the behavior of prices the welfare losses from foregone innovation may be unobservable to the regulators' constituency. Moreover, an emphasis on dynamic efficiency requires the short-term regulator to take the "long view" fostering the competitive process rather than emulating the competitive outcome. ...|$|R
