50|$|Typical organic phase {{separation}} methods use cojetting of polymers to produce Janus nanoparticles. This technique is {{exemplified by the}} work of Yoshid et al. to produce Janus nanoparticles where one hemisphere has affinity <b>for</b> <b>human</b> cells, while the other hemisphere has no affinity <b>for</b> <b>human</b> cells. This was achieved by cojetting polyacrylamide/poly(acrylic acid) copolymers which have no affinity <b>for</b> <b>human</b> cells with biotinylated polyacrylamide/poly(acrylic acid) copolymers, which when exposed to streptavidin-modified antibodies, obtain an affinity <b>for</b> <b>human</b> cells.|$|R

5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, squid axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm <b>for</b> <b>humans).</b> In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the squid to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food <b>for</b> <b>humans</b> in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E

The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that vanadium {{is an essential}} nutrient <b>for</b> <b>humans,</b> so neither a Recommended Dietary Intake nor an Adequate Intake have been established.

5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant <b>for</b> <b>humans</b> and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
5|$|Fish are an {{important}} resource <b>for</b> <b>humans</b> worldwide, especially as food. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture).

Fish have {{had a role in}} culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.|$|E
