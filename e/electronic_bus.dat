5000|$|The {{first product}} {{released}} by the new subsidiary was MG1212, a 12 channel, 12 track recorder in 1984. This innovative device used a special VHS-like cartridge (a MK-20), and was good for 10 minutes of continuous 12 track recording (19 cm per second) or 20 minutes at half speed (9.5 cm per second). One track (14) was permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another one for synchronization such as SMPTE or MTC. Each channel strip included dbx type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with fixed bandwidths). The unit also had innovations like an <b>electronic</b> 2 <b>bus</b> system, a 12 stereo channel patch bay and auto punch in and out, among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality rivaling that of more expensive 16 track machines using 1" [...] tape. The MG-1212 was later replaced by the MG-1214, which improved the transport mechanism and overall performance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Future {{data centers}} will require novel, {{scalable}} memory architectures capable of sustaining high bandwidths while still achieving low memory access latencies. Electronic interconnects cannot {{meet the challenges}} presented by the need for multi-terabit off-chip memory data paths. In this work, the <b>electronic</b> <b>bus</b> between main memory and its host processor is replaced with a circuit-switched optical interconnection network. We investigate the impact of our optically connected memory system on large-scale architectures and experimentally validate the protocol using field-programmable gate array based processor nodes and a custom-designed memory controller. The processor communicates all-optically with multiple synchronous {{dynamic random access memory}} nodes using 4 × 2. 5 -Gb/s wavelength-striped payloads, operating error free with bit-error rates less than 10 − 12.

30|$|This paper {{examines}} the interconnection of two DC microgrids (MGs) with tie-line. The voltages at respective MG buses are controlled {{to manage the}} power flow across the tie-line. Formation of such a DC MG cluster ensures higher reliability of power supply and flexibility to manage distributed energy resources and loads in the system. Two MGs consist of photovoltaic and battery units interfaced by power <b>electronic</b> converters. The <b>bus</b> voltages of two DC MGs act as an indicator for the power flow monitoring the supply-demand balance. A decentralized control approach is proposed to control each MG and bus voltage fluctuation in an allowable range. Furthermore, a mode adaptive decentralized control approach is proposed for seamless mode transition in order to assign microgrid operation modes and for the power management of DC MGs. The effectiveness of the proposed concept is validated by simulation and experimental results.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Resilience is {{becoming}} an increasingly critical performance requirement for future large-scale computing systems. In data center and high-performance computing systems with many thousands of nodes, errors in main memory can be {{a significant source of}} failures. As a result, large-scale memory systems must employ advanced error detection and correction techniques to mitigate failures. Memory devices are primarily designed for density, optimizing memory capacity and throughput, rather than resilience. A strict focus on memory performance instead of resilience risks undermining the overall stability of next-generation computers. In this work, we leverage an optically connected memory system to optimize both memory performance and resilience. A multicast-capable optical interconnection network replaces the traditional <b>electronic</b> <b>bus</b> between a processor and its main memory, allowing for a novel error-correction technique based on dynamic bit-steering. As compared to an electronically connected approach, we demonstrate significantly higher memory bandwidths and reduced latencies, in addition to a 700 × improvement in resilience.

40|$|For decades, silicon {{has been}} the {{material}} of choice for mass fabrication of electronics. This {{is in contrast to}} photonics, where passive optical components in silicon have only recently been realized. The slow progress within silicon optoelectronics, where electronic and optical functionalities can be integrated into monolithic components based on the versatile silicon platform, is due to the limited active optical properties of silicon. Recently, however, a continuous-wave Raman silicon laser was demonstrated; if an effective modulator could also be realized in silicon, data processing and transmission could potentially be performed by all-silicon electronic and optical components. Here we have discovered that a significant linear electro-optic effect is induced in silicon by breaking the crystal symmetry. The symmetry is broken by depositing a straining layer on top of a silicon waveguide, and the induced nonlinear coefficient, χ^(2) åpprox 15 pm V⁻¹, makes it possible to realize a silicon electrooptic modulator. The strain-induced linear electro-optic effect may be used to remove a bottleneck in modern computers by replacing the <b>electronic</b> <b>bus</b> with a much faster optical alternative...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the use of holographic techniques for information processing and transmission systems. Until recently information has been processed and transmitted mainly electronically. With the advent of optical fiber communications the monopoly of electronics has receded in the telecommunications field, but the domain of information processing is still dominated by electronic processors. This thesis follows a top-down approach {{to the design of}} processors that integrate both electronic and optical components. It begins with the design considerations of a compact, rapidly reconfigurable opto-electronic processor, which possesses an optical bus in addition to the traditional <b>electronic</b> <b>bus.</b> The optical bus takes advantage of the massive parallelism that is afforded by optics and can be coupled to a holographic digital memory, allowing rapid reconfiguration of the device. The capability of rapid reconfiguration gives rise to a new computational paradigm, where the reprogramming of the device can become part of the computation. We suggest additional applications of this processor, namely as a smart reading head for large scale holographic disk memories. Finally we present novel algorithms that were developed specifically {{to take advantage of the}} additional capabilities of our processor. The next section is concerned with the wavelength and angular tuning of strong volume holograms, both in the reflection and 90 -degree geometries. Since photons have no charge, we need to rely on their wave properties to manipulate them, both for long-range transmission, such as telecommunications, and short-range transmission, such as on chip interconnects. In this section we investigate how volume holograms can be used to selectively redirect information bearing light beams. The final part of this thesis is concerned with material issues. Holographic recording of strong volume gratings is one of the most commonly used approaches, and photorefractive materials have a strong bearing on the overall performance of the final system. Two properties of iron doped lithium niobate are investigated, namely the dependence of absorption on temperature and the quadratic electro-optic coefficient. The former is crucial for the commonly used technique of thermal fixing, and the latter can become significant should we choose to use applied continuous fields to tune our gratings...|$|E
50|$|Rocar De Simon 412E is a {{model of}} {{trolleybus}} that was manufactured by Rocar, in Romania, in 1997 and 2002. A total of only 19 were produced, 18 equipped with DC motors and one with an AC motor. Two were delivered to the Bucharest trolleybus system, #7454 and #7459 (the one on AC), another two were delivered to Cluj and the remaining 15 were delivered to Constanta. Models sent to Constanta are equipped with resistor controller instead of <b>electronic</b> chopper. Although <b>bus</b> version was also available with 2 doors, 412E was only built on the 3 doors body. Transmission of all 412E is from AUTOCAMIOANE BRASOV, probably because the motor is somehow identical to the DAC/ROCAR 112/117/212/217. Although it was meant as a replacement for 112/117/212/217 series, they were built in parallel. Like its bus counterpart, it had no articulated version built by ROCAR. Low Floor 812E or/and ROCAR Solaris Urbino were designed as its successors, but ROCAR went bankrupt.|$|R
40|$|The {{remanufacturing}} {{industry as}} a whole and the automotive sector in particular have, over the years, proven to be beneficial to the environment and economically lucrative to the companies involved as well as to their customers. However, remanufacturing is associated with complicating characteristics, not least to mention the process of core acquisition. The automotive industry is one of the earliest adapters of remanufacturing. Parts like engines, brake calipers and servo pumps are common targets for remanufacturing. Modern cars also have several embedded computers, often referred to as electronic control units that communicate, share information and verify each other over a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Due to their high value and an increasing trend in the amount of CAN bus mechatronic devices, interest in their remanufacture is growing. Previous research has shown that it is preferable that the remanufacturer is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), or has a close relation to the OEM, in order to achieve a well-performing remanufacturing business. In the automotive industry, there are many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that perform remanufacturing; for these enterprises, the challenges to have a profitable business are even harder. This is because the OEMs will not release any information on the communication parameters and therefore will not support the independent remanufacturing business. As a consequence, the independent remanufacturers, often SMEs, have to perform substantial reverse engineering. This paper presents a qualitative research study, based on interviews at SMEs regarding challenges linked to the reverse logistics of SMEs remanufacturing and trading used automotive mechatronic devices, to identify specific challenges concerning the collection phase of automotive mechatronic remanufacturing. Challenges previously identified by researchers are confirmed, additional challenges within the collection phase are recognized, and challenges expected to arise when remanufacturing and trading automotive <b>electronic</b> CAN <b>bus</b> mechatronic devices are identified. The major concern for the involved companies when commencing future challenges is the handling, transportation and storing of cores. Even though the cores today mainly consist of mechanical devices, these challenges are still present; they are expected, however, to become even more crucial when cores contain a higher degree of mechatronic devices.
