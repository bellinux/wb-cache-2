5|$|Although {{the force}} was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, {{there was also}} an influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 in response to Macleod's financial mismanagement of the force. For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the force, and the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines, while useful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> acute alcohol withdrawal, if used {{long-term}} {{can cause}} a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management. Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has {{a high rate of}} relapse with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6â€“12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642 between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Beaumaris Castle was a strategic location in the war, as it controlled part of the route between the king's bases in Ireland and his operations in England. Thomas Bulkeley, whose family had been involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the castle for several centuries, held Beaumaris for the king and may have spent around Â£3,000 improving its defences. By 1646, however, Parliament had defeated the royal armies and the castle was surrendered by Colonel Richard Bulkeley in June. Anglesey revolted against Parliament again in 1648, and Beaumaris was briefly reoccupied by royalist forces, surrendering {{for a second time}} in October that year.|$|E
