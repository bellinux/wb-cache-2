40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase flow systems such as high <b>head</b> <b>gated</b> conduit flow systems and two phase pipe flow systems using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase flow systems, air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high <b>head</b> <b>gated</b> conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase flow systems also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase flow systems have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase flow systems were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{evaluated}} the Hofer Dam fish screen and provided technical assistance at two other fish passage sites as {{requested by the}} Bonneville Power Administration, the Walla Walla Watershed Council, or the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Evaluation of new sites such as Hofer Dam focuses on their design, construction, operation, and maintenance {{to determine if they}} effectively provide juvenile salmonids with safe passage through irrigation diversions. There were two requests for technical assistance in 2008. In the first, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation requested an evaluation of the Nursery Bridge fish screens associated with the fish ladder {{on the east side of}} the Walla Walla River. One set of brushes that clean the screens was broken for an extended period. Underwater videography and water velocity measurements were used to determine there were no potential adverse effects on juvenile salmonids when the west set of screens was clean enough to pass water normally. A second request, received from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Walla Walla Watershed Council, asked for evaluation of water velocities through relatively new <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> above and adjacent to the Eastside Ditch fish screens on the Walla Walla River. Water moving through the <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> and not taken for irrigation is diverted to provide water for the Nursery Bridge fish ladder on the east side of the river. Elevations used in the design of the <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> were incorrect, causing excessive flow through the <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> that closely approached or exceeded the maximum swimming burst speed of juvenile salmonids. Hofer Dam was evaluated in June 2008. PNNL researchers found that conditions at Hofer Dam will not cause impingement or entrainment of juvenile salmonids but may provide habitat for predators and lack strong sweeping flows to encourage juvenile salmonid passage downstream. Further evaluation of velocities at the Eastside Ditch and wasteway gates should occur as changes are made to compensate for the design problems. These evaluations will help determine whether further changes are required. Hofer Dam also should be evaluated again under more normal operating conditions when the river levels are typical of those when fish are emigrating and the metal plate is not affecting flows...|$|E

40|$|Although {{data are}} scarce, {{it is clear}} that {{grouping}} strategy can {{have a significant impact on}} the feeding behavior and feed intake of dairy cattle. Feed intake is controlled by ruminoreticular fill and physiological mechanisms, but grouping is a component of the cow’s feeding environment that can modulate intake as a result of its impact on cow comfort, competition for feed and other resources, and herd health. Social dominance and competition for feed impact feeding behavior and proper grouping strategy will minimize the negative impact of excessive competition on intake and enhance beneficial effects of group feeding such as social facilitation. Primiparous cows benefit from separate grouping from older animals by increased intake and productivity. Bunk space, accessibility of feed, and type of feeding system must be considered when determining the optimal group size. There appears to be no problem with large (3 ̆e 200 cows) groups of cows per se, but management decisions such as overcrowding with insufficient <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> or manger space play a role in determining cow well-being and feeding behavior. Research with group sizes larger than 400 cows needs to evaluate productivity, feeding and other behavior, and animal well-being. Significant overcrowding appears to reduce feeding activity, alter resting behavior, and decrease rumination activity. Negative social consequences of moving cows between groups last 3 to 7 d. Although the effect of grouping on feeding behavior remains largely unquantitated at this point, the effect is potentially large and requires further research to describe the impact of cow dynamics within a group on feed intake...|$|E
40|$|Around {{the high}} <b>head</b> <b>gates</b> as the {{velocity}} is too high, every non uniform object {{such as a}} slot makes the flow too disturbed. Vertical-lift gate required recessed slots in abutments for {{the movement of the}} gate slides. The flow of water across the slots causes flow separation at the upstream lip of the slot and reattachment on the downstream side. Eddies are set up within the slots and vortices are formed. Thus, under higher velocity flow conditions (due to high head), cavitations can occur within gate slots by fluctuations. In addition of cavitations the pressure fluctuation can make impacts on the structure too. This hydraulic phenomenon can be occurred with serious damages. In this research, experimental data is used based on measuring pressure fluctuation by pressure transducer under an experimental model which has built and taken place in Michelle Hydraulics Laboratory at civil engineering department of the University of Melbourne. Pressure fluctuations were measured under two group of seven piezometers along the two gate slots for gate positions of 10 %- 10 %, 30 %- 10 %, 50 %- 10 %, 70 %- 10 %, 30 %- 30 %, 50 %- 30 %, 70 %- 30 %, 50 %- 50 %, 70 %- 50 %, 70 %- 70 %, head condition behind the gates were constant for all tests.
