5|$|A <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the county}} in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Americans {{entered the}} battle with a very <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of where, when, and in what {{strength}} the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too-widely separated {{to be able to}} support each other. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, reducing the number of anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained mainly unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.|$|E
25|$|Middle to Late Bronze Age: Beginning {{with the}} Akkadian Empire around 2300 BC, the chronological {{evidence}} becomes internally more consistent.

The assignment of absolute dates {{is a matter of}} dispute; the conventional middle chronology fixes the sack of Babylon at 1595 BC while the short chronology fixes it at 1531 BC.|$|E

25|$|Though {{many of the}} Morrison Formation fossils are fragmentary, {{they are}} {{sufficient}} to provide a <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the flora and fauna}} in the Morrison Basin during the Kimmeridgian. Overall, the climate was dry, similar to a savanna but, since there were no angiosperms (grasses, flowers, and some trees), the flora was quite different. Conifers, the dominant plants of the time, were to be found with ginkgos, cycads, tree ferns, and horsetail rushes. Much of the fossilized vegetation was riparian, living along the river flood plains. Insects were very similar to modern species, with termites building 30m (100ft.) tall nests. Along the rivers, there were fish, frogs, salamanders, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, pterosaurs, crayfish, clams, and monotremes (prototherian mammals, the largest of which was {{about the size of a}} rat).|$|E
25|$|Imperial Mali is {{best known}} through three primary sources: {{the first is the}} account of Shihab al-'Umari, written in about 1340 by a geographer-administrator in Mamluk Egypt. His {{information}} about the empire came from visiting Malians taking the hajj, or pilgrim's voyage to Mecca. He had first-hand information from several sources, and from a second-hand source, he learned of the visit of Mansa Musa. The second account is that of the traveller Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali in 1352. This is the first account of a West African kingdom made directly by an eyewitness; the others are usually second-hand. The third great account is that of Ibn Khaldun, who wrote in the early 15th century. While the accounts are of limited length, they provide a fairly <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of the empire at its height.|$|E

500|$|Food {{at various}} stages of {{digestion}} {{has been found in}} the intestines of several woolly mammoths, giving a <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of their diet. Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food, mainly grass and sedges, which were supplemented with herbaceous plants, flowering plants, shrubs, mosses, and tree matter. The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location. Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth, like modern elephants. An adult of six tonnes would need to eat [...] daily, and may have foraged as long as twenty hours every day. The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age (Quaternary glaciation, 2.58 million years ago to present) by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments. The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts, delicately picking buds and flowers, and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present. The [...] "Yukagir mammoth" [...] had ingested plant matter that contained spores of dung fungus. Isotope analysis shows that woolly mammoths fed mainly on C3 plants, unlike horses and rhinos.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz {{published}} a track-by-track review of each {{song on the}} album. He thought that the single did not {{fit in with the}} rest of Hell: The Sequel, but alone, is a good song, [...] " [...] track doesn't fit with EP, but Em's effortless confidence carries the celebratory anthem." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN gave a shared a similar opinion, calling the song odd and uncommon. Grischow did not favor the influences of [...] "gooey synthpop" [...] and soul fusion genres. However, the critic appreciated the [...] "inspirational verses" [...] from Eminem and Royce and summarized, [...] "In the end, this brief look at the duo's skills does not fully deliver what you expect, but still leaves you wanting to hear more." [...] Web magazine Plugged In Online, once a magazine that published reviews from a Conservative Christian's perspective, praised Mars' singing but harshly criticized the duo's lyricism, [...] "These two Detroit rappers use a lot more nasty words to get the job done". The reviewer, Adam Holz, went on to analyze Royce's verse, [...] "Toss in nods to toking marijuana and two allusions to oral sex, and you've got a pretty <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of what Royce's vision of 'living out our dreams' looks like in action." [...] While exploring the Billboard charts on their segment at The A.V. Club, writers Genevieve Koski and Steven Hyden, commented on [...] "Lighters". Koski said that the single shared some similarities with [...] "Nothin' on You", which also featured Mars. Despite noticing the contrast between the rap verses and the hook, she focused her attention on the various elements of the recording which [...] "are each uplifting in their own way" [...] and awarded it a B–. On the other hand, Hyden gave the song a harsh critic calling it the, [...] "absolute worst in pop music right now". He criticized Eminem for spitting in his verses, Mars for singing a [...] "melodramatic chorus" [...] and the type of music the rapper, Eminem, was embracing dubbing it, [...] "maudlin power balladry".

2500|$|Heinrich Isaac's career spanned {{well over}} thirty years and allowed him to travel far from his {{homeland}} of Flanders into Germany, Italy, and Austria, {{as well as other}} parts of central Europe. [...] While the absence of plentiful primary sources makes it hard for us to map out Isaac's life, piecing together the sources we do have along with the works he wrote gives us a <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of just how popular this Franco-Flemish composer was in his time. [...] Isaac was probably writing music by the 1470s, and the first document mentioning his name dates back to 15 September 1484, placing him in Innsbruck as a singer for Duke Sigismund of Austria, of the House of Habsburg. [...] The following year Isaac migrated to Florence, since documents show that by July 1485 Isaac had become employed as a singer at the church Santa Maria del Fiore. [...] By the middle of 1491, he was designated as a singer at Santissima Annunziata, a position that he held until 1493.|$|E

His obituary in The Times states that he [...] "was regarded by many as the best and most successful Director of Operations in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s", though it also notes that he himself would be happy to attribute much of the preparatory work to Tuzo (who has been described in similar terms). His success was attributable to a number of factors: he regularly visited the troops on the ground which gave him a <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of the difficulties faced in particular areas; once a unit or commander had proved itself, he was happy to delegate considerable authority, in particular to his immediate subordinate, Commander Land Forces (Sir) Peter Leng; he had a good relationship with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, who said of King [...] "You have never played at politics and I have never played at being a soldier; that's why we have got on so well."
