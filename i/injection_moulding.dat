5|$|<b>Injection</b> <b>moulding</b> is used {{to create}} many things such as wire spools, packaging, bottle caps, {{automotive}} parts and components, gameboys, pocket combs, some musical instruments (and parts of them), one-piece chairs and small tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including gears), and most other plastic products available today. <b>Injection</b> <b>moulding</b> {{is the most common}} modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object.|$|E
5|$|Like all {{industrial}} processes, <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> {{can produce}} flawed parts. In {{the field of}} <b>injection</b> <b>moulding,</b> troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with {{the design of the}} mould or the characteristics of the process itself. Trials are often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in the injection process.|$|E
5|$|The German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker {{invented the}} first soluble forms of {{cellulose}} acetate in 1903, which was much less flammable than cellulose nitrate. It was eventually made available in a powder form from which it was readily injection moulded. Arthur Eichengrün developed the first <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> press in 1919. In 1939, Arthur Eichengrün patented the <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> of plasticised cellulose acetate.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{the time}} to market for metal casting {{products}} is becoming shorter, thus the lead time available for making the wax <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> is decreasing.

5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{examination}} of structure of <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> parts, coming form different cavities of <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> with geometrically balanced runners, was {{the purpose of}} this research. The parts were manufactured from polypropylene. Design/methodology/approach: The method of optical microscopy was used. The samples were prepared from microtomed slices from parts and next they were observed in polarized light. The skin-core morphology was analyzed and spherulitic structure was described by spherulites size measuring. Findings: The differences in morphology and spherulite size for parts from particular mould cavities were found. They are caused by different thermal conditions in each cavity. Research limitations/implications: An <b>injection</b> <b>mould</b> with geometrically balanced runners was used for investigation. The differences in parts’ structure occur for each <b>injection</b> <b>mould,</b> but they are dependent on the cavities layout and runners configuration. Practical implications: Knowledge about the differences in structure of parts from different cavities is the reason to look to the solution by minimizing the temperature inequality in the <b>injection</b> <b>mould.</b> Originality/value: Despite using geometrically balanced runners the cavities are not filled equally and the parts have different structure. In some recent works the issue of flow imbalance in multicavity <b>injection</b> <b>moulds</b> was analyzed and even some solutions of this problem were proposed. All investigation was focused on simultaneous plastic flow into all cavities, but there were no investigation of parts’ structure and properties...|$|R

To understand the changes in mechanical properties, both morphology of <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> samples and recycled granulates were investigated. A three-phase morphological model was applied for the evaluation of morphological properties while mechanical properties were determined by tensile and impact tests. Relationship was found between morphological and mechanical characteristics {{as a function of}} time elapsed since production. Crystalline ratio, tensile strength, and modulus of <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> specimens increased while impact strength decreased in the four weeks after production...|$|R

5|$|Parts to be {{injection}} moulded {{must be very}} carefully designed to facilitate the moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and {{the properties of the}} moulding machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw injection machines account {{for the vast majority of}} all injection machines. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> process, which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.|$|E

5|$|<b>Injection</b> <b>moulding</b> {{consists}} of the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Injection</b> <b>moulding</b> {{machines}} {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy is}} not {{generally}} such as to provide riches. Neither is it one which used to require large towns as other than external markets in which to sell.
