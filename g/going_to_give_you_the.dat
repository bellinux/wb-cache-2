But I count {{it a crime to}} shut one's eyes to the cloud in the sky, even though it be no larger than a man's hand. Years ago that cloud was there for those who would to see. To-day it looms over us, a black and threatening peril, and those who, ostrich-like, still hide their heads in the sand, are the men upon whose consciences must rest in the future the responsibility for those evil things which are even now upon us. Theories are evil things, but when theory and fact are at variance, give me fact. Theoretically Free Trade should--I admit it--make us the most prosperous nation in the world. As a matter of fact, never since this country commenced to make history has our commercial supremacy been in so rotten and insecure a position. There isn't a flourishing industry in the country, save those which provide the munitions of war, and their prosperity is a spasmodic, and I might almost add, an undesirable thing. Now, I am dealing with facts to-night, not theories, and I am going to quote certain unassailable truths, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> immediate causes for them. The furniture and joinery trade of England is bad. There are thousands of good hands out of employment. They are out of work because the manufacturer has few or no orders. I want the immediate cause for that, and I go to the manufacturer. I ask him why he has no orders. He tells me, because every steamer from America is bringing huge consignments of ready-made office and general furniture, at such prices or such quality that the English shopkeepers prefer to stock them. Consequently trade is bad with him, and he cannot find employment for his men. I find here in Medchester the boot and shoe trade in which you are concerned bad. There are thousands of you who are willing to work who are out of employment. I go to the manufacturer, and I say to him, 'Why don't you find employment for your hands?' 'For two reasons,' he answers. 'First, because I have lost my Colonial and some of my home trade through American competition, and secondly, because of the universally depressed condition of every kindred trade throughout the country, which keeps people poor and prevents their having money to spend.' Just now I am not considering the question of why the American can send salable boots and shoes into this country, although the reasons are fairly obvious. They {{have nothing to do with}} my point, however. We are dealing to-night with immediate causes! ...|$|E

5000|$|Modrowski {{also claims}} that his defense {{attorney}} William Von Hoene refused to dispute Robertson's testimony {{and did not}} allow any witnesses to testify on his behalf (including Modrowski's sister who reports that Modrowski was with her {{the night of the}} murder). Van Hoene also did not reveal Modrowski's diagnosis of autism to the jury. Modrowski has made allegations that this led jury members to mistake his awkward body language, lack of eye contact and aloofness (autistic traits) as lack of remorse and proven guilt. Ultimately, Faraci's wife confessed to framing Modrowski in order to have the blame removed from her husband. Despite Faraci being acquitted of murder, two days later on February 17, 1995, Modrowski was found guilty of murder accountability. On April 27, 1995, Modrowski was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without the possibility of parole by Associate Cook County Judge Sam Amirante, who told Modrowski, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> same hope that you gave to (Fawcett): no hope[...] [...] [...] You deserve the term of natural life in prison." ...|$|E

5000|$|BBC and Entertainment Tonight writers {{noted that}} Hart is [...] "widely regarded" [...] {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} professional wrestlers of all time. Sky Sports described his legacy as [...] "one of, if not the greatest, to have ever graced the squared circle". Jon Robinson of IGN called him [...] "one of the greatest (if not the single best) pure wrestler to ever walk that aisle". Veteran wrestlers including CM Punk, Booker T and Michael Hayes have named Hart [...] "the greatest of all time", with Hayes noting that he is considered by many as the best Canadian performer ever, if not the single greatest overall. Veteran announcer Gene Okerlund dubbed Hart [...] "the greatest ever", and stressed that he should appear in anyone's list of the all-time top 10 wrestlers. Olympic wrestling gold medalist and six-time WWE world champion Kurt Angle studied tapes of Hart in order to learn the art of pro wrestling; he and Stone Cold Steve Austin have ranked Hart as the best in-ring performer ever (Austin tying Hart with Shawn Michaels). Similarly, former opponent Harley Race described Hart as being [...] "as good as they got". WWE chairman Vince McMahon described Hart as having [...] "unparalleled" [...] technical wrestling and storytelling skills, and retrospectively characterized the late 1990s Hart as an [...] "extraordinary star who you know is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> best match of the night every time he goes out there".|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Gail Vance Civille, {{along with}} David Kessler, {{was interviewed by}} Ira Flatow for the NPR [...] program Science Friday in a segment {{entitled}} [...] "How Tasty Foods Change the Brain". In discussing Dr. Kessler's book [...] "The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite", Civille commented {{to the people who}} want to lose weight to take a product in the mouth and think about what the sensory properties are; what is the smell, what is the taste, what are the aromatics, what are the textural characteristics. She proposes that if they think hard and long about what they actually perceive, they will be less inclined to just go with the joy ride of the kick of the food and through thinking about what is perceived, they might actually eat less. [...] "We used to have foods that we chewed for 15, 20 or 30 times before we swallowed; it took more work to eat." [...] Today she says [...] "There is rarely a food out there, outside of a sweet chewy candy, you have to chew more than 12 times and it is gone; so, you're in for the next hit to get more pleasure." [...] She directed the radio audience to the value of the texture experience in food and the connection it has in the overall satisfaction of the consumer. In conclusion, she suggested [...] "eating fruits and vegetables in reasonable amounts because it's a good way to start losing weight; they are filling, they're satisfying and they're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> fat, sugar, salt hit over and over again." ...|$|E
40|$|I am {{delighted to}} present the Dr Elizabeth Casson Memorial Lecture at the 41 st conference of the newly ‘Royal’ College of Occupational Therapists (RCOT), here at the ICC in Birmingham. Indeed I am {{especially}} delighted to be delivering the lecture in Birmingham, as this feels like coming home – I was born and bought up nine miles down the road, in Solihull. I {{would like to thank}} my nominees and the RCOT council for giving me this opportunity {{to present the}} prestigious Dr Elizabeth Casson Memorial Lecture. No Casson Memorial Lecture should start without a reminder to its namesake, and to the importance of Elizabeth Casson’s work to the profession of occupational therapy in the United Kingdom. She opened the first school of occupational therapy in the United Kingdom (UK) at Dorset House, Clifton, Bristol in 1930. We continue to owe her a lot. While writing and researching this lecture I was struck by the opening sentence of Dr Casson’s paper, published in 1941, in which she details 40 cases treated at the clinic attached to the school: Rehabilitation needs serious attention at present (Casson 1941). I will come back to this important statement later on.
