They moved to Memphis, Tennessee during World War II and Miss Alice taught eighth grade English in Whitehaven and Memphis over the next 30 years. She began {{painting}} while caring for her Alzheimer afflicted mother, painted her first 40 paintings, went to the Nashville flea market with her son, and sold all 40 of her paintings 30 minutes after getting set up. They were purchased by a Mr. Barr who used them to decorate his chain of steakhouses in Kentucky That was the day that Alice Moseley became a professional folk artist. She always painted in acrylics because {{she said she was}} impatient and needed something that would dry quickly. Early on Alice was labeled as an idyllic folk artist by the Jules Pfeiffer in his magazine [...] "Folk Art Finder" [...] and [...] "idyllic folk Art" [...] was described as showing not only what the artist saw but what he or she wanted to see. Alice began to receive acclaim and had a successful career while she lived in Pope Mississippi and did shows mostly in Memphis. After the death of her husband she moved to Bay St. Louis Mississippi in 1989 when she was 80 years old. She described those years in Bay St. Louis as the happiest and most successful years of our life. Moseley's paintings are historic in that they depict Southern life in the country during earlier times; they are literary in that Moseley's paintings did not just depict scenes but had to tell a story; Moseley's paintings are often comedic and reflect Alice Latimer Moseley's wonderful sense of people and a sense of humor. Some of her more popular titles are: [...] " [...] Life is so Daily" [...] - [...] "The House Is Blue But the Old Lady Ain't" [...] and [...] "Labor Versus Management" [...] which shows a farmer throwing his hat down on the ground in anger while his mule sits on his hindquarters with a little smile on his face. Alice Moseley painted until her death in July 2004, at the age of 94. Her beloved blue house at 214 Bookter St. in Bay St. Louis was untouched by Hurricane Katrina even though it's only a half mile from the beach. Alice's son Tim Moseley founded the Alice Moseley Folk Art and Antique Museum after Katrina in 2006 and it has since been relocated from the blue house to the <b>historic</b> <b>Bay</b> St. Louis train depot. Visitors to Bay St. Louis rave about the museum and the entertaining and informative tours given by docents at the museum. The museum is free and is open Monday through Saturday from 10 to 4.|$|E
