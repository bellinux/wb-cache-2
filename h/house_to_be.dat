5|$|After the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1660, the Bankes family regained their properties. Rather than rebuild Corfe Castle, the eldest son Ralph Bankes built a house on their other Dorset estate near Wimborne Minster. In 1663, he commissioned Sir Roger Pratt to design a new <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as Kingston Hall on the current site, based on Clarendon House which he had visited several times. Construction started the same year, and was completed by 1665.|$|E
5|$|During a storm, {{after having}} {{her choice of}} {{profession}} attacked by Eleanor, Nola leaves the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone. Chris follows Nola outside and confesses his feelings for her, and they passionately have sex in a wheat-field. Feeling guilty, Nola treats this as an accident; Chris, however, wants an ongoing clandestine relationship. Chris and Chloe marry, but Tom ends his relationship with Nola.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Clifton Maybank corridor, built in the 18th century from stone obtained from another house then undergoing alteration, allowed the principal ground- and first-floor rooms to have some privacy from the servants' areas and linked the two staircases. It also allowed the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> turned around by creating a new entrance façade facing west.|$|E

5|$|The {{night before}} the execution, Anna took a second dose of {{laudanum}} {{but was unable to}} keep it down. On July 7, 1826, the morning of the scheduled execution, Anna asked the guard to give her privacy to dress. Once the guard left, Anna revealed to Beauchamp that she had smuggled in a knife, and she and her husband stabbed themselves. Anna was taken to a nearby <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated by doctors.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{established}} Tintern Abbey as a Cistercian monastery on 9 May 1131, {{the second}} Cistercian monastic <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> endowed in Britain. The monks {{for the establishment}} came from L'Aumône Abbey in France. Although the ruins of Tintern were {{the subject of a}} poem by William Wordsworth and a painting by J. M. W. Turner, these ruins are not Walter's original buildings, as little remains of them.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E

5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed {{and some of}} them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings {{were heavily}} invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended {{the house and}} the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out {{until the end of the}} battle.|$|E

The father quickly exits {{in time to see}} his chauffeur drive away and hails a taxi. Hal arrives at the boarding school and the disguise works, claims Sue and drives away. Seconds later the father arrives and confronts the mistress, departing to pursue in a fit of anger. Hal and Sue go to the parson's <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> immediately wed. The father is delayed for a short time by car trouble, but quickly arrives before the two are wed. He bursts in and sees his double and both he and Hal laugh. The father relents and approves the marriage as Hal removes his disguise in front of the stunned Parson.|$|E
50|$|The {{housing policy}} {{focused on the}} removal of rubble, setting up {{temporary}} shelters, full reconstruction of damaged houses, and the retrofitting of undamaged units. The policy established a community-driven housing recovery process. The communities affected by the earthquake were given the option for complete or partial relocation to in-situ reconstruction. The total number of eligible <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repaired was 929,682 and {{the total number of}} eligible <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reconstructed was 213,685.

5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E

On 2 February 1944, the Premier of Victoria, Albert Dunstan, {{appointed}} Ned as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. For {{much of the}} next 30 years he would also serve as lieutenant governor of Victoria, this being a common additional function of the chief justice. When Ned became acting governor for eight months in February 1949, Mary found Government <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in a state of}} disrepair. She successfully lobbied James Kennedy for funds for its refurbishment, and supervised the work personally.|$|E
5|$|The Wheeler family {{stayed at}} the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst {{asked if she could}} {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E

5|$|The {{more severe}} north front is of eleven bays, {{with the end}} bays given {{significance}} by rustication at ground floor level. The centre of the façade has Ionic columns supporting a pediment and originally had the Dashwood coat of arms. This façade is thought to date from around 1750–51, although its segmented windows suggest {{it was one of}} the first of the 2nd Baronet's improvements to the original <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completed, as the curved or segmented window heads are symbolic of the earlier part of the 18th century; the design has been given to Isaac Ware.|$|E
5|$|The north façade {{has three}} bays {{separated}} by windows and features a loggia, typical of early 17th-century houses, {{with a central}} arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at {{either side of the}} gable. Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on this side, building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.|$|E

5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E
