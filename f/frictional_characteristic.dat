40|$|Abstract: Strength {{anisotropy}} in soils {{needs to}} be characterized by proper anisotropic failure criterion. This paper presents a novel yet simple methodology to generalize an isotropic failure criterion to account for strength anisotropy in soils. A salient ingredient of the method involves {{the introduction of the}} degree of cross anisotropy and an anisotropic variable, defined by the joint invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor and the deviatoric fabric tensor, into the <b>frictional</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the isotropic criterion. The well-received Lade’s failure criterion is taken as an example to demonstrate the generalization. Predictions using the newly generalized Lade’s criterion for a number of soils, including completely decomposed granite, glass beads (virtual sand), natural clays, sand, as well as silty sand, show good agreement with test data. The proposed approach has proved to be simple and generic, and can be effortlessly applied to many existing isotropic failure criteria to adapt them to account for strength anisotropy. The treatment also requires very few parameters, which can be conveniently calibrated from conventional laborator...|$|E

The orientations of the maximum horizontal stress rotate from north-northwest in the northern to northwest in the middle, and to west-northwest in the southern. The stress magnitudes are characterized by higher values in the two ends and lower values in the middle segment. Furthermore, three stress measurement campaigns in two boreholes on the northern segment of the Longmenshan fault belt, before and after the great earthquake, show clear stress decrease of 23 %– 29 % in the shallow crust after the earthquake. Analysis using the mathematical fitting method also indicates a decrease in regional stress state after the earthquake. Meanwhile, the <b>frictional</b> <b>characteristic</b> indexes based on the stress measurements further imply that the frictional strength of the Longmenshan fault belt is characterized by a strong southern segment, a weak middle segment, and a moderately strong northern segment.

They are Group 1 - stainless steel, Group 2 - composite bracket Group 3 - (American Orthodontics) radiance ceramic bracket Group 4 - self-ligating bracket (SLB) (Empower). In this study, five maxillary brackets of an arch of each type were used. All brackets are 0. 022 × 0. 028 " in preadjusted edgewise appliance which simulates the dental arch. Five brackets were bonded to a stainless steel bar of dimension 150 mm × 25 mm × 3 mm. The bracket-arch wire units were submitted to mechanical test with an Instron universal testing machine 3365. A testing apparatus or holding jig was designed to hold the bracket during the mechanical test. Each sample was pulled at a speed of 6 mm for 1 min.

3000|$|Comparing Fig.  9 a, c may {{indicate}} {{the evolution of}} the ash in the conduit. The unbroken scoriae at 950 °C indicated by the circles in Fig.  9 a show rate strengthening at low angular frequencies ([...] < 1 [...] Rad. s^- 1). As the flow rate in the conduit becomes faster, the friction between the conduit wall and the internal magma increases. In addition, the magma is eventually cooled. Finally, bubbly magma fractures. The friction coefficient of the fractured magma, containing both large and small particles, like scoriae and ash (Fig.  6 d), is lower than that before fracturing but still shows rate strengthening, as indicated by the crosses in Fig.  9 a. Thus, large particles (small scoriae) further break down into small particles (ash). Concurrently, the size separation of particles takes place; that is, small particles (ash) flow down in the space at the grain boundaries of large pieces (scoriae), which causes hysteresis in the friction coefficient, as shown by the blue curve with crosses in Fig.  9 c, a measurement for ash with large grains at a low temperature. Once the particle size becomes uniform at each location, the <b>frictional</b> <b>characteristic</b> changes into rate weakening, as indicated by the blue and green curves in Fig.  9 c, measurements for fine ash at a low temperature.

Particle shape factor and specific surface area did not greatly affect the coefficient of internal friction. For the range of powder parameters considered, it was most affected by particle size with the smaller particle samples having the higher friction. There was good qualitative agreement between the coefficient of internal friction deduced from shear cell and die pressing experiments. Despite evidence of the development of cohesion in the powders in the die pressing experiments, the linearity of the axial stress-radial stress relations suggested that the powder response could be characterised in terms of a constant value of the coefficient of internal friction. In dynamic compaction, appreciably lower radial stresses are developed. This is consistent with a higher value of internal friction under these loading conditions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} results of {{measurements}} and physical modeling of the string vibrations in three common musical instruments: the guitar, the piano, and the violin. The string vibrations are determined by three major conditions: {{the properties of the}} string, the boundary conditions at the end supports, and the excitation (plucking, striking, or bowing). Simulating the string vibrations by means of a discrete model on a computer provides a powerful method for evaluating the importance of each of these conditions. In general, the numerical simulations and the measurements showed a close agreement. As for the guitar, the resonances of the guitar body was modelled with 66 resonances in the frequency range 0 - 5 kHz. It was found that the dominating resonance of the guitar body influences the string vibrations shortly after, but not during, the attack. This influence could also be perceived in listening tests. For the piano, the nonlinearity of the piano hammer was included. This allowed a realistic modeling of the force history between hammer and string, and different combinations of hammer properties and dynamic levels were simulated. Also in this case, calculated waveforms and spectra agreed well. Attempts of simulating the bowed string indicated that the discrete model also could be adapted to a continuous driving force. In spite of initial numerical stability difficulties, {{it was found that the}} condition for switching between slip and stick is a more important factor than the details of the <b>frictional</b> <b>characteristic</b> between bow hair and string in setting up a rcalistic Helmholtz motion. 1...|$|E

Inflatable structures are relatively lightweight and portable, and can maintain the required rigidity while in operation.

This work presents experimental results obtained from the evaluation of <b>frictional</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the fabric material that constitute the structural membrane of confined inflatable structures developed for protection of underground transportation tunnels and other large conduits.
