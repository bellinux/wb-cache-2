25|$|The painter Edwin Henry Landseer {{submitted}} a picture called 'The Shrew Tamed' for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1861.

500|$|In his memoirs, written {{more than}} thirty years after her death, her father wrote of Elisabeth's [...] "deep sensitivity" [...] and [...] "very large heart."

[...] In October 1901, after the death of Queen Victoria, Elisabeth's parents finally divorced. Her mother had rekindled a previous romance with another cousin, her future husband, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia. Her father, according to letters written by her mother, had been caught cavorting with domestic servants. Her parents' divorce meant that Elisabeth divided her year between Darmstadt and her mother's new home in Coburg. Elisabeth was at first mistrustful of her mother and resented the divorce, although Victoria did her best to mend her relationship with her daughter during her visit with Elisabeth in the spring of 1902. She was only partially successful, though Victoria enjoyed turning her daughter into an outstanding <b>horsewoman.</b>|$|E

[...] She was a rejuvenating influence in his life, coaxing him out for evening car rides, dinners at the Rue Jacob, a masked ball, even a short cruise on the Seine. [...] He turned some of their wide-ranging conversations into a series of letters that he published in the Mercure de France, addressing her as l'Amazone, a French word that can mean either <b>horsewoman</b> or Amazon; the letters were later collected in book form. [...] He died in 1915, but the nickname he gave her would stay with her all her life—even her tombstone identifies her as [...] "the Amazon of Remy de Gourmont"—and his Letters to the Amazon left readers wanting {{to know more about the}} woman who had inspired them.|$|E
