The genus Tetragnatha Latreille, 1804 has been known from 56 species in the Australasian region (Roewer, 1942; Brignoli 1983). However, no detailed study of the genus {{has been made in}} this vast geographical region. Recently I was able to study the Australasian tetragnathid spiders based on the collection of the several museums and institutions. As a result 31 species were recognized from Australia, New Guinea and neighboring islands. Of these, 3 species are already known as the cosmopolitan species (Okuma, 1983). The present paper gives the descriptions of 11 new species and the redescriptions of 17 known species. Illustrations of important characters as well as measurements of the relative lengths of legs of the 31 species are also presented. The number of materials examined, and the abbreviations of the museums and the institutions are as follows : BMH : Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu, 356 specimens. AMS : Australian Museum, Sydney, 181 specimens. NSMT : National Science Museum, Tokyo, 17 specimens. KUF : Entomological Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 72 specimens. Terminology of the cheliceral armature of Tetragnatha was established by Wiehle (1939). Later, Locket & Millidge (1953) adopted his terminology and translated it in English in their book, British Spiders. In the present paper, the terms are used according to Locket & Millidge. In addition, some new terms are provided. These are summarized as follows (an asterisk shows a new term) : a : An apophysis, used for locking the female’s fang during copulation. “Gu : The <b>guide</b> <b>tooth</b> of upper row. *Gl : The <b>guide</b> <b>tooth</b> of lower row. *e : An extra tooth found between (Gu) and (T) in the female of some species. T : The first (largest) tooth of the row proper. *rsu : The upper row of small teeth. *rsl : The lower row of small teeth. *U 2 : The next tooth of (Gu). *L 2 : The next tooth of (Gl). *s : A spur or prominence, present in the female of some species. t : A tooth or prominence, found in the male of some species. sl : A tooth which usually slopes towards the base of the segment in the male of some species. *AXu : An auxiliary <b>guide</b> <b>tooth</b> of upper row, present in some species. *AX 1 : An auxiliary <b>guide</b> <b>tooth</b> of lower row, present in some species.

Starting {{with the onset of}} amelogenesis beneath the future cusp tips, the shape of the enamel layer covering the crown is determined by five growth parameters: the (1) appositional growth rate, (2) duration of appositional growth (at the cusp tip), (3) ameloblast extension rate, (4) duration of ameloblast extension, and (5) spreading rate of appositional termination. Appositional growth occurs at a mineralization front along the ameloblast distal membrane in which amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) ribbons form and lengthen. The ACP ribbons convert into hydroxyapatite crystallites as the ribbons elongate. Appositional growth involves a secretory cycle that is reflected in a series of incremental lines. A potentially important function of enamel proteins is to ensure alignment of successive mineral increments on the tips of enamel ribbons deposited in the previous cycle, causing the crystallites to lengthen with each cycle. Enamel hardens in a maturation process that involves mineral deposition onto the sides of existing crystallites until they interlock with adjacent crystallites. Neutralization of acidity generated by hydroxyapatite formation is {{a key part of the}} mechanism. Here we review the growth parameters that determine the shape of the enamel crown as well as the mechanisms of enamel appositional growth and maturation...|$|E

Two applications were completed each treatment session and three sessions were appointed, with one week interval between them. Tooth colour was registered each session and 1 week and 1 months after completing the treatment by spectrophotometer, registering parameters L*, a* and b*, and subjectively using VITA Classic <b>guide.</b> <b>Tooth</b> sensitivity was registered by VAS and patient satisfaction and self-perception result was determined using OHIP- 14. Tooth colour variation and sensitivity were compared between both bleaching agents.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the predictability of F 22 aligners (Sweden & Martina, Due Carrare, Italy) in <b>guiding</b> <b>teeth</b> into the positions planned using digital orthodontic setup. Methods Sixteen adult patients (6 males and 10 females, mean age 28  years 7  months) were selected, and a total of 345 teeth were analysed. Pre-treatment, ideal post-treatment—as planned on digital setup—and real post-treatment models were analysed using VAM software (Vectra, Canfield Scientific, Fairfield, NJ, USA). Prescribed and real rotation, mesiodistal tip and vestibulolingual tip were calculated for each tooth and, subsequently, analysed by tooth type (right and left upper and lower incisors, canines, premolars and molars) to identify the mean error and accuracy of each type of movement achieved with the aligner with respect to those planned using the setup. Results The mean predictability of movements achieved using F 22 aligners was 73. 6 %. Mesiodistal tipping showed the most predictability, at 82. 5 % with respect to the ideal; this was followed by vestibulolingual tipping (72. 9 %) and finally rotation (66. 8 %). In particular, mesiodistal tip on the upper molars and lower premolars were achieved with the most predictability (93. 4 and 96. 7 %, respectively), while rotation on the lower canines was the least efficaciously achieved (54. 2 %). Conclusions Without the use of auxiliaries, orthodontic aligners are unable to achieve programmed movement with 100 % predictability. In particular, although tipping movements were efficaciously achieved, especially at the molars and premolars, rotation of the lower canines was an extremely unpredictable movement...|$|R

40|$|Background: After third molars, the maxillary canines are {{the most}} {{commonly}} impacted permanent teeth and one-third of these are labial impactions. Impacted canines often require orthodontic guidance in the eruption. This {{study was conducted to}} assess the posttreatment results of surgically exposed and orthodontically aligned labially impacted maxillary canines comparing two different surgical techniques. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in two phases, a surgical phase and an orthodontic phase. In surgical phase, events during surgical exposure and recovery of 31 patients with labially impacted maxillary canine were recorded. Patients were managed with open and closed eruption technique. The assessment included comparison of two techniques of surgical exposure, postoperative pain, mobility, vitality, periodontal health, level of impaction, and duration of orthodontic treatment. Results: The postoperative recovery was longer after open eruption than close eruption technique (P = 0. 000). Postoperative pain experienced by patients was similar, but regression of pain was faster in closed eruption technique. The mean surgical time for open eruption technique was lesser when compared with closed eruption technique (P = 0. 000). The total duration of orthodontic treatment was directly dependent upon the level of impaction, with deeper level of impaction having longer duration of orthodontic treatment. The mobility and vitality of guided canine was similar in both techniques. Conclusion: The closed eruption technique was a longer surgical procedure, but the postoperative pain regression was faster.

25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the <b>guide</b> flange. The <b>teeth</b> of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth.

This model is a function of a number of material and processing parameters, including the thermal expansion of the die, thermal contraction of workpiece, elastic expansion of the die during forging, and workpiece recovery after ejection. To improve the accuracy of the hot forged gear tooth, an equation set to define modified involute that is used to design the die tooth has been proposed based on the model. The distribution of deflection along the involute was also predicted using the commercial FE code, PRO-E. The deflection characteristic of the toothed die through the tooth width was analyzed by combining the theoretical method and FEM to investigate the non-uniform deflection. The dimension of the forged gears was measured using a gear measurement machine WGT 3000. A close agreement between predicted and measured tooth involute profiles was obtained, which validated the involute deflection prediction model.

A postoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan of each patient was taken and superimposed on a preoperative CT scan to evaluate any discrepancies between the planned and actual implant positions (apex and platform positions), as well as the implant tilt. Implant placement using bone- and mucosa-supported guides was found to be more precise compared to using <b>guides</b> supported by <b>teeth</b> or a combination of teeth and mucosa. However, the differences were not statistically significant. The accuracy of the guided surgery system is in line with the data found in the literature. Considering the mean positioning discrepancies between the planned and actual implant outcomes, clinicians are advised to maintain a safe distance between implants and anatomical structures of at least 2 mm. In immediate loading cases, relining a provisional prosthesis to compensate for any discrepancies between the virtual and clinical implant positions is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relation between skin and tooth colour parameters in various ethnic groups. Materials and Methods. Saudi Arabian, Indian, African, and East Asian ethnic groups of 75 each were included in the study. The tooth colour was determined by spectrophotometer in CIELAB parameters. The skin colour was measured at earlobe, forehead, and malar locations by clinical skin photography. The data was statistically analysed by one-way ANOVA and correlation tests. Results. The “L” vale for the Saudi Arabian group had a strong correlation at earlobe location (r= 0. 275), while correlation was found at forehead (r= 0. 271) and malar region (r= 0. 261) with Indian ethnic group. A strong negative correlation was observed in African ethnic group at all three locations for “L” parameter. The redness value “a” is found to have strong negative linear correlation between the earlobe and tooth for Saudi Arabian (r=- 0. 240) and Indian ethnic groups (r=- 0. 268). The “b” showed no correlation with skin location in all groups except positive correlation in African ethnic groups. Conclusions. The strong correlation was found between the skin and tooth colour parameters; hence the skin colour can be used as a <b>guide</b> for artificial <b>tooth</b> selection in edentulous patients...|$|R
40|$|Digital image {{capturing}} {{and analysis}} techniques {{have been used}} to measure the colour of teeth and to compare with spectrophotometric results and visual observations. A non-linear image analysis approach was developed and, for the colour range of human teeth, allows device-dependant digital camera colour data to be quantitatively transformed to Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) colorimetric values. With reference to a CIE standard illuminant, two different lighting arrays have been used. For flat and non-translucent white and yellow surfaces, spectrophotometric results showed that this transformation achieves required accuracy. It was found, in all of the present studies, which included measurements on the VITA Lumin® Vacuum shade <b>guide</b> and extracted <b>teeth,</b> that spectrophotometry invariably underestimated values of the CIE whiteness index. However, the results from these two types of measurement correlated well. There was also a reasonably good correlation between earlier data obtained by visual assessment and the present data by the two instrumental methods. For extracted teeth, both instrumental methods used in this work did not confirm a whitening effect for 2 -min brushing with toothpaste, but did show significant whitening results for bleaching with 15 % hydrogen peroxide.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of tooth eruption (i. e., {{the answer to}} the question of how and why teeth erupt) has been a matter of long historical debate. This review focuses on human and other mammalian teeth with a time- and spacewise limited period of eruption and analyzes recent observations and experimental data on dogs, rats, primates, and humans in a framework of basic biological parameters to formulate a <b>guiding</b> theory of <b>tooth</b> eruption. Acknowledging basic parameters (i. e., that teeth move in three-dimensional space, erupt with varying speed, and arrive at a functional position that in inheritable) eliminates a number of previously held theories and favors those that accommodate basic parameters, such as alveolar bone remodeling in association with root elongation, with possible correction factors in the form of cementum apposition and periodontal ligament formation. We have critically analyzed, summarized, and integrated recent findings associated with preeruptive movements of developing teeth, the intraosseous stage of premolar eruption in dogs, molar eruption in rodents, and premolar and molar eruption in primates. The variable speeds of eruption are particularly important. We conclude with basic principles of tooth eruption [...] that is, the type of signals generated by the dental follicle proper, the conditions under which teeth are moved and the clinical understanding to be derived from this knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to derive {{alternative}} implant shapes which could minimize the stress concentration at the shoulder level of the implant. Materials and Methods: A topological shape optimization technique (soft kill option), which mimics biological growth, was used in conjunction with the finite element (FE) method to optimize the shape of a dental implant under loads. Shape optimiza-tion of the implant was carried out using a 2 -dimensional (2 D) FE model of the mandible. Three-dimen-sional (3 D) FE analyses were then performed to verify the reduction of peak stresses in the optimized design. Results: Some of the designs formulated using optimization resembled the shape of a natural <b>tooth.</b> <b>Guided</b> by the results of the optimization, alternative implant designs with a taper and a larger crestal radius at the shoulder were derived. Subsequent FE analyses indicated that the peak stresses of these optimized implants under both axial and oblique loads were significantly lower than those observed around a model of commercially available dental implant. Conclusion: The new implant shapes obtained using FE-based shape optimization techniques can potentially increase the success of dental implants due to the reduced stress concentration at the bone-implant interface.
