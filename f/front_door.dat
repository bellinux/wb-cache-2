5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked <b>front</b> <b>door</b> for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E

He informed them that the embassy's <b>front</b> <b>door</b> was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E

50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>doors</b> open on to {{pedestrian}} only area:In Cressingham Gardens the <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of dwellings open on to pedestrian only avenues and pathways.

The most important of these, is that the pedestrianized space provides a safe play area for small children.|$|R
