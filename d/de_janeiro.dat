5|$|A grand state funeral—not {{seen since}} the death of PedroII's sister Paula in 1833—was held for the Prince Imperial at 7p.m. three days after his death. He was buried in the Convento da Ajuda (Convent of Aid) in Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro.</b> When the convent was {{demolished}} in 1911 his remains were moved to the mausoleum of the Convento de Santo Antônio (Convent of Saint Anthony) in Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> where other members of the Brazilian House of Braganza (including his younger brother Pedro, his uncle João and his aunt Paula) are also located.|$|E
5|$|After Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro.</b>|$|E

5|$|At the Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E

The delegation included two track and field athletes: Bachir Mahamat in the men's 400 metres and Bibiro Ali Taher in the women's 5000 metres. Both athletes participated at the Games through wild card places since they {{did not meet the}} required standards to qualify. Neither athletes progressed past their heats.|$|E
5|$|During the Bahia campaign, {{high-ranking}} officers mutinied against Labatut, who {{was taken}} prisoner and {{sent back to}} Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro.</b> It is unlikely that Luís Alves was involved, but his uncle, Joaquim de Lima, was almost certainly part of the conspiracy and was chosen by the officers to replace Labatut. The campaign resumed, and the Portuguese withdrew from Salvador and set sail back to Portugal. On 2 July, the victorious Brazilians entered the city. The Emperor's Battalion returned to Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> and Luís Alves was later promoted to captain on 22 January 1824.|$|E

5|$|Luís Alves' grandfather, José Joaquim, was a Portuguese {{military}} {{officer who had}} emigrated in 1767 to Brazil. He settled {{in the city of}} Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> capital of both the Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro</b> captaincy and of Brazil. He had neither noble rank nor noble ancestry and lacked patrons in an environment in which advancement depended upon exchanges of favors and family connections. Having fought against the Spaniards on Brazil's southern frontiers, he secured a place for himself in Rio de Janeiro's upper class when he married a member of a local and influential family.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the film}} {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida, and Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro.</b> The {{production}} team had considered India and Nepal as a location in the film but on arriving at those places to investigate, they found that it was inconceivable to write them into the script, particularly with time restrictions to do so. They decided on Rio <b>de</b> <b>Janeiro,</b> Brazil, relatively early on, a city that Cubby Broccoli had visited on holiday, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival festival, which featured in the film.|$|E
