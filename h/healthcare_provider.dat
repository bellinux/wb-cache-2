40|$|Background To {{facilitate}} {{collaboration between}} different <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> and to exchange patient data {{we developed a}} paper-based tool, which also enabled to plan interventions and follow-up activities: the PCP. Interviews with participating <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> concluded the PCP was a very useful tool to collect and share patient data. A disadvantage was the time spent to collect all information. We therefore developed our PCP into a web-based tool: the web-based PCP (W-PCP). Objectives Development of a W-PCP to (1) provide <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> with information from pharmacist- and GP computer systems and (2) facilitate collaboration between <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> and patients. Method The W-PCP was used in three research lines, two in primary care and one in a hospital setting. Outcomes measures were defined as satisfaction about efficiency and effectiveness during data sharing and documentation in providing care and conducting medication reviews using the W-PCP. First experiences concerning the use of W-PCP in a primary care setting were collected by a questionnaire and interviews with pharmacists and GPs using the W-PCP. Results A questionnaire was sent to 38 <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers.</b> 17 <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> returned the questionnaire. The use of W-PCP resulted in positive experiences from participating <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers.</b> On the basis of experiences and requirements collected, the application will be further developed. Conclusions The W-PCP application can potentially support successful collaboration between different <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> and patients, which is important for medication therapy management. With this application, a successful collaboration between different <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> and patients could be achieved. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Reduction of {{the stigma}} of mental illness is an {{international}} priority; arts- and contact-based approaches represent a promising mode of intervention. This project was designed to explore {{the impact of a}} one-woman theatrical performance on attitudes towards bipolar disorder (BD) on people with BD and <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers.</b> Methods: A playwright and actress who lives with BD developed a stage performance- ‘That’s Just Crazy Talk ’- targeting stigmatizing attitudes towards BD. Prospective, longitudinal and sequential mixed methods were used {{to assess the impact of}} the performance on people with BD (n = 80) and <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> (n = 84).

25|$|The {{two most}} {{commonly}} used screening methods, physical examination of the breasts by a <b>healthcare</b> <b>provider</b> and mammography, can offer an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple cyst. When these examinations are inconclusive, a <b>healthcare</b> <b>provider</b> can remove {{a sample of the}} fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known as fine needle aspiration, or fine needle aspiration and cytology—FNAC) to help establish the diagnosis. The needle aspiration may be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic using local anaesthetic if required. A finding of clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, physical examination of the breasts, mammography, and FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.|$|E

30|$|Conclusion Gasps {{seem to be}} {{frequent}} at {{the time}} of end-of-life, and they can be very impressive for the parents. In our study, we show that gasps provoke discomfort to the <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> too and complicate their accompaniment of the parents and the dying child. Almost half of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> think that gasps should be prevented, mainly for the well-being of the parents. A lack of specific formation is likely a source of the difficulties of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers.</b> A dedicated formation would allow the <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> to better assist the parents and diminish their distress. Finally, studies on the prevalence of gasps in pediatric population and on how the parents are dealing with them, depending upon the information given by <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> would help us to limit parental and professional distress.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{perceptions}} of <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> towards health information technology applications in King Abdul-Aziz Medical City (KAMC) in terms of benefits, barriers, and motivation to use these applications. Data Collection: The study population consists of all <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> working at KAMC. A sample size of 623 was drawn from a population of 7493 <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> using convenience random sampling method. Of 623 questionnaires distributed, 377 were returned, giving a response rate of 60. 5 percent. Measurement A self-administered questionnaire was developed based on extended literature review. The questionnaire comprised 25 statements measuring benefits, barriers, and motivation to use health information applications to be responded on a five-point Likert-scale. In addition, the questionnaire included questions on demographic and organizational variables. Results: The results show that the majority of <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> had good knowledge and skills in information technology, as most of them use KAMC health information applications regularly and/or had training courses in the field. The results indicated that training has a significant positive effect on health providers' IT knowledge and skills. The majority of <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> perceived that the information technology applications in KAMC are valuable and beneficial to both patients and KAMC. However, the <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> were split over the barriers to HIT use in KAMC. As for drivers, the results showed that <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> generally would be motivated to use IT applications in KAMC by provision of new applications and training, contribution in change hospital's work procedures, and provision of technical support. Finally, the results showed the perceptions of <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> on benefits, barriers and motives were influenced by gender, occupation and training. However, the effect of these variables on <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> towards benefits, barriers and motives of IT use were inconsistent. Conclusion: Despite the perceived benefits and motives of health information applications, there were many barriers identified by <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers.</b> These were insufficient number of computers, frequent system down, and the use of computerized systems is time consuming. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the perceptions of <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> towards benefits, barriers, and motives to health information technology with respect gender, occupation, and training...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: The use of self-report {{measurements}} may {{be problematic}} {{in patients with}} limitations that interfere with reliable self-assessment like cognitive impairment, as {{may be the case}} in multiple sclerosis (MS). In these situations proxy respondents, such as close relatives or <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers,</b> may provide valuable information. To examine the accuracy and value of <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> and close relatives to assess disease impact of MS. Methods: MS patients, close relatives and <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> completed the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS- 29) before and after a rehabilitation program. Agreement between outcomes was assessed by calculating mean absolute and directional differences and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: Comparison of ratings between patients and proxy respondents revealed low levels of agreement. Close relatives appeared to significantly overestimate the disease impact of MS whereas <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> tended to underestimate the disease impact of MS. Conclusion: Caution is advised when incorporating close relatives and <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> as proxy respondents in a rehabilitation setting. However, when close relatives are consulted, one should expect a certain level of overestimation of disease impact. When consulting <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers,</b> one should expect a certain level of underestimation of disease impact. © 2008 The Author(s) ...|$|R

Like other women in the world, female <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> are also biologically two to four times more vulnerable to STIs, HIV and AIDs infections than men. Women are also vulnerable to unplanned pregnancies. However, the utilisation of FC 2 by <b>healthcare</b> <b>providers</b> is still inadequate.
