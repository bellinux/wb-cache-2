40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} impact of intrinsic and extrinsic job factors on overall employee job satisfaction for two generation cohort groups, Baby Boomers and Generation X, in a small rural healthcare organization. Eight job factors were selected for the study, reflecting popular characteristics associated with the two groups. The job factors were classified as intrinsic or extrinsic using Hertzberg’s two-factor theory. Intrinsic factors studied were: work itself, promotion, and recognition. Extrinsic factors studied were: pay, supervision, people, technology, and work-family balance. The Job Descriptive Index (JDI) scale {{was used to assess}} employee satisfaction with certain job factors; work itself, promotion, pay, supervision, and people. Scales similar to the JDI were created and used to measure satisfaction with technology, work-family balance, and recognition. The Job In General (JIG) scale was used to assess overall job satisfaction for each generation group. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine which of the job factors predicted of overall job satisfaction for each group. Results of the study indicate that overall satisfaction is influenced a discreet combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors for each group. Generation X’s overall job satisfaction is predicted by extrinsic job factors, (work-family balance, and supervision) as well as intrinsic job factors, (work itself). Baby Boomers’ overall job satisfaction is predicted by an intrinsic <b>job</b> <b>factor,</b> (recognition) as well as an extrinsic <b>job</b> <b>factor</b> (supervision). Smaller than optimal sample size reduces applicability of the results and implies the need for extended research in this area to confirm findings of this study...|$|E

40|$|Background: bserving plate {{waste is}} {{categorized}} {{as a simple}} way but yet still needs evaluation. When many foods are wasted, a dietitian should quickly respond and know the best way how to overcome the matters. There are three accurate ways to determine plate waste: plate waste weighing, visual estimation, and 24 hours recall. The application of each method really depends on its purposes. According to previous researches there are significant and positive correlations between the visual estimation of Comstock Scale and plate waste weighing. Visual estimation, moreover, has more advantages as {{it is easy to}} apply, cheap, and less time consuming. Considering those advantages, visual estimation needs to be socialized and considered as a new accurate method besides weighing methods. Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} know the medical official accuracy in determining plate waste using visual estimation of 6 point Comstock Scale. Methods: An observational study was conducted using a cross-sectional design. Subjects were nurses and meal servants from hospital wards. Before the meal served to the patient the food is weighed, than the observers officer has to observed portion sized. After the patient having meal, plate waste should be estimated using Comstock Scale by the officer after that the plate waste have to be weight to know the actual weigh. The accuracy difference between two groups in determining plate waste using Comstock Scale were analysed with t-test. Results: There was significant differences of accuracy (p= 0. 01) between nurse group and meal servant in estimating wasted rice and wasted meat (p= 0. 02). The difference were not due to the <b>job</b> <b>factor</b> but the significant of various meal (p= 0. 0001). The work experience is a significant factor in the accuracy of plate waste (p= 0. 42).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of two papers. Epidemiological studies of the associations between nutrients and health may yield misleading conclusions if relative prices are not taken into account. The first paper applies a household production approach to assess impacts of nutrients and other health inputs on health. Choices of health inputs in the health production technology are assumed to respond to nutrient prices. Moreover, potential measurement error associated with the health inputs biases the estimates of the health production parameters. Thus, prices, along with wages and other exogenous variables, serve as instruments in the demand for health inputs and the resulting reduced-form health equations to correct the problems of endogeneity and measurement error of the health inputs in the health production function. Empirical findings suggest that food prices are important determinants of health. Hence, policy implications concerning food price interventions to improve health are discussed. Moreover, household production and benchmark epidemiological estimates of the impacts of health inputs upon blood pressure are compared to examine the existence of endogeneity and measurement error associated with the health inputs. A comparable worth pay analysis for the State of Iowa Merit Employment Pay System was conducted in 1984 by Arthur Young Consulting Company of Milwaukee. Greig (1987) suspected that Arthur Young 2 ̆ 7 s recommended pay plans were biased due to possible measurement error in the job evaluation. Hence Greig explored the sensitivity analysis of pay recommendations to various measurement error corrections. His estimates were confounded by multicollinearity among several of Arthur Young 2 ̆ 7 s originally recommended thirteen job evaluation factors. The second paper aims to obtain unbiased estimates for the <b>job</b> <b>factor</b> weights in comparable worth pay analysis by correcting both the problems of measurement error and multicollinearity in the job evaluation factors simultaneously. Potential measurement error correlations between pairwise job evaluation factors are explored to analyze the sensitivity and statistical robustness of the estimates for the job evaluation factor weights to various measurement error correlation specifications...|$|E

Psychosocial <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> were ascertained by the Job Content Questionnaire. Sick-leave absenteeism data were collected from personnel records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and presenteeism was assessed using the eight-item version of the Work Limitations Questionnaire. Associations between psychosocial <b>job</b> <b>factors,</b> biological cardiovascular risk factors, and productivity indicators were examined in multiple regression models, adjusting for physical workload and socio-demographic factors. Overall, and in agreement with our hypotheses, psychosocial <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> had a negative impact on blood glucose, total blood cholesterol levels, smoking, leisure-time physical activity, and productivity indicators. Mixed associations were found between psychosocial <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> and overweight/obesity indicators and blood pressure. Social support (in particular supervisor support) was protective against high total blood cholesterol levels, overweight/obesity, and smoking, and promoted leisure-time physical activity.

The problem addressed in this study concerned identifying <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> for two groups of randomly selected elementary school Kenyan educators, teachers and headteachers, considered as most satisfying and dissatisfying in their current jobs. A comparison of the two group members' perceptions on 14 selected <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> from Herzberg's two-factor theory (motivation-hygiene) was conducted. Generation of data was accomplished through a three-part questionnaire which was completed by 338 teachers and 35 headteachers. Part I of the instrument contained 4 write-in, open-ended, questionnaire items; Part II contained 48, forced choice, paired motivation-hygiene job factors; and Part III contained 9 demographic and personal independent variables. The design for the study was descriptive and ex post facto. Seven hypotheses were analyzed, 4 of them by hand and 3 by use of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Frequency, percentage count, and ranking of the identified <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> were completed for the descriptive hypotheses, schi-square, t-test, and analysis of variance conducted for the comparative hypotheses. Significance level was set at the. 05 level. Results of this study indicated that the Kenyan educators in the sample groups identified Job Security, No Alternatives, Holidays, Sense of Building the Nation, Chance to Continue Learning, Love of Job Itself (Noble), Love for Children, Extracurricular Activities, and Communication with Teachers, Parents, and Pupils as the most satisfying <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> in their current positions and also as the factors which cause them to retain their positions. The <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> that were identified as dissatisfying and as reasons for wanting to resign current jobs were Poor Pay, Poor Promotion Methods by Merit, Lack of Recognition, No Chance for Advancement, No House Allowance for Married women, No Loan Privileges, Frequent Supervision and Administration Policies, and Delay of School Supplies and Maintenance. For the comparative hypotheses, it was concluded that {{there was no significant difference}} in the preferences of the total respondent educator group with respect to motivation and hygiene factors. No significant differences were found between teachers' and head-teachers' preference with respect to motivation and hygiene <b>job</b> <b>factors.</b> When preferences of teachers and headteachers were further analyzed by demographic and personal independent variables (gender, location, education, marital status, race, tribe, years of experience, and religion) only age of respondents (35 years and younger as compared to 36 years and older) yielded significant difference. One implication of this study is that personnel problems and policies might be adopted to deal with feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction among educators in Nairobi...|$|R

Within this context of change, this research explores <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> contributing to the job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction of primary principals in one Ministry of Education district in Western Australia. Studies based on Herzberg 2 ̆ 7 s motivation-hygiene theory, conducted in educational and non-educational settings, in addition to previous principal job satisfaction research were important in the development of the study 2 ̆ 7 s conceptual framework and research questions. Data to address the research questions were collected through a modification of Flanagan 2 ̆ 7 s critical incident technique. During interview sessions, eighteen primary principals were each asked to provide four sequences of events: two relating to periods of job satisfaction, and two sequences relating to periods of job dissatisfaction. An a posteriori approach to content analysis revealed that eleven <b>job</b> <b>factors</b> contributed to the job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction of primary principals; seven <b>job</b> content <b>factors</b> and four <b>job</b> context <b>factors.</b> Four <b>job</b> content <b>factors</b> and two <b>job</b> context <b>factors</b> were identified as being bipolar. Results indicated that principals 2 ̆ 7 job satisfaction was strongly related to the job content, and that job dissatisfaction was related both to the job content and to the job context. Based on the results obtained, a description of a work situation which would make principals more satisfied with their work was described, and recommendations for further research were proposed...|$|R
