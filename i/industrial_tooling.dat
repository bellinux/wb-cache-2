40|$|AbstractSince the {{synthesis}} of the boron nitride in its cubic crystallographic structure, cBN, a material with exceptionally high hardness and special properties was developed for technical engineering applications. For practical use, cBN is, after diamond, the second known hardest material and is today being increasingly used as cutting and drilling tools in substitution for diamond-based tools owing to superior thermal stability and chemical inertness. In this study, the advances {{in the use of}} the cBN competing with diamond as a superhard <b>industrial</b> <b>tooling</b> for petroleum extraction, automobile manufacture and other engineering applications, was reviewed. The properties of both single crystals and polycrystalline cBN in the form of composites and thin films were assessed to characterize the possibilities of a next generation of superhard materials to replace diamond in tool and other technological devices...|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates on {{why and how}} {{business}} relationships develop {{through an}} indepth study of a world-leading <b>industrial</b> <b>tooling</b> company (ITC). The study of the ITC focuses {{on the development of}} a “preferred supplier ” concept, developed in the UK subsidiary since the mid- 1990 ’s. The aim was to capture business volume at customers through greatly increased embeddedness from a legal, technical and social point of view. In brief, the ITC offers greater productivity at the customer plant through productivity analysis using its network knowledge of cutting, milling and drilling operations and the tools involved. This has been codified in a software package. The ICT also offers automated, real-time stock control and consignment stocks. The case study highlights some important implications of business relationships. It shows that strong ties can be built relatively fast if a working methodology exists and if buyers are willing to give suppliers a greater role. The main driver for the relationship in general, commitment, investments and trust, is the explicit methodology and documentation of achievements in terms of productivity gains and cost savings. It is the network knowledge of the ITC that is exchanged, not the tools themselves but rather the optimization of the activities that they perform. For the ITC, what was previously a fragmented but stable market is becoming a winner-takes-all market, at the customer level. This indicates that increased levels of supplier-customer embeddedness can lead to fierce competition among suppliers...|$|E

40|$|High {{competitive}} {{pressure in the}} high-wage market Germany, caused by Eastern European and Asian competition, is currently intensified by {{the implications of the}} financial crisis in Europe. Especially the manufacturing industry features an unsteady environment of high fluctuations in orders and capacity as well as increased pricing pressure. The tooling industry in Germany is directly affected by the development of series manufacturing as its most important customer. It has to face global competition {{and at the same time}} offer its customers an improved price-performance ratio. Therefore differentiating competences and enhanced cost efficiency have to be developed effectively. Over the past years tool manufacturing was characterized by the introduction of industrial structures and procedures. Due to the standardization of tools and processes, repetitive effects to improve efficiency could be realized for the single and small batch manufacturing in the tooling industry. However, the exclusive focus on internal value and operative excellence do not yield a competitive advantage any longer. The tooling industry requires a new solution to improve its competitiveness. In the future, internal value creation has to be combined with collaboration with customers, partners and sites in global value creation networks. Thereby individual competences can be developed and refined while simultaneously offering the customer an extensive range of tools and services. Industrial manufacturing and global collaboration are a new solution for competitiveness for the tooling industry. Global <b>industrial</b> <b>tooling</b> has to master industrial manufacturing and collaboration with customers, partners and sites to realize a competitive price-performance ratio and ensure sustainability...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOur {{problem is}} a {{diagnostic}} task. Due to environment degraded conditions, direct measurements are not possible. Due to the rapidity of the machine, human intervention is not possible in case of position fault. So, an oriented vision solution is proposed. The problem must be solved for high velocity <b>industrial</b> <b>tooling</b> machines. Degraded conditions: vibrations, water and chip of metal projections, dazzling [...] ., are present all the time. Image analysis in constraint environment depends on constraint importance. Before tooling, the vision system has to answer: “is it the right piece at the right place?” Complementary methods {{presented in this paper}} are proposed in an adaptive way to solve this diagnostic problem. This detection is made by comparing an acquired camera image of the piece to be tooled with an image of reference. Some image processing methods are performed and combined in order to extract 2 D features. Some of these 2 D features are evaluated and used as parameters in a diagnostic process. After a data analysis, image parameters are reduced. First, we present an overview of image processing methods generally used to solve that kind of problem and their limitations in our particular degraded case. In order to obtain automatic and robust classification, two methods are implemented. The first one is based on Bayes technique that provides a good classification in case of fault presence. The second method is based on neural networks and provides good results in case of images without faults. These two methods give a global rate of good classification greater than 90 %, for 720 images acquired from an industrial site...|$|E
30|$|Company F is an {{industrial}} materials and tools manufacturer {{with expertise in}} materials technology {{and a range of}} products, including <b>industrial</b> <b>tooling</b> equipment for mining, machining solutions to advanced materials, and construction equipment. The company is organised in five business divisions. Globally, the company employs 47, 500 and has an annual turnover of 9.25 billion €. The company identifies its strategic strength as a technology leader in the premium segment of its sector—a segment characterised by high entry barriers. The division included in this case study is the materials technology division, which employs around 7000 people in Sweden. It produces advanced steel materials for further manufacturing by its customers and has an annual turnover of 1.5 billion €. The significant flows in the case are movement back and forth between offshore production sites and final distribution to customers. A common supply chain starts with products made in Sweden, which are shipped to their own production sites in China, then back to Sweden for final adaptation before being shipped out to the final customer. In the case of a final customer in China, the products in various manufacturing stages are shipped between continents several times, which obviously amplifies the impact of transport lead time. Deviation in lead time can also impact the levelling of production in production facilities in cases of MTO products. About 30 % of the orders can be delivered directly from stock, whereas 70 % are MTO. The transport services are purchased via a forwarder with regular allotments that are booked in advanced and modified if necessary. The Incoterm CPT (Carriage Paid To) is used. The company aims to control the flow from origin to destination, meaning that one way or another, the liner shipping leg of any transport always falls within the purview of the company. The transport lead time is {{a significant portion of the}} total lead time, which means that, especially for the MTO segment, its impact on the customers’ lead time is substantial. The annual volumes for the relevant flows are about 6000 TEUs.|$|E

40|$|Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) {{stands for}} a number of innovative, {{flexible}} forming pro-cesses in which sheet metal can be shaped into a wide variety of geometries without the need for expensive, dedicated tool sets. By means of a standard stylus, controlled by a 3 - or multi-axis CNC platform, sheet material is incrementally formed until the target shape is obtained. Over the past decade substantial R&D efforts have been invested to bring these innovative processes to a mature level, gradually bringing industrial valorisation within reach. Major shortcomings in the original process capabilities, such as limited forming angles, extreme thinning and low accuracy have largely been overcome through advanced work piece analysis techniques and the introduction of intelligent tool path strategies. While there is still space for improvements in these domains, today examples {{of a wide variety of}} part geometries with accuracies in the sub-millimetre range can be demonstrated, illustrating the improved mastering of the ISF processes. This allows to conclude that the technology is gradually becoming viable for industrial valorisation. The flexible nature of the ISF processes, especially the Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) variant, makes them particularly suitable for the manufacturing of small series or even unique sculptured sheet metal parts. This specifically opens perspectives for SMEs active in the fast and flexible supply of tailored parts and products. However, looking at the present state-of-the-art, a number of possible hurdles obstructing the industrial roll out of the ISF processes were identified: 1. For the basic ISF processes the range of materials that can be handled was typically limited due to formability constraints of the materials and high process forces resulting from processing high strength materials. 2. Integration of ISF with other sheet metal processes into hybrid processes offering the best of both worlds: economically adding features for customization of parts produced with other technologies or flexible production of small series. However this required appropriate solutions for process planning and flexible <b>industrial</b> <b>tooling.</b> 3. The ISF processes hold the potential to produce large, double curved parts, but the com-monly available machine tools for supporting the process do not provide such working range or come at a high investment cost. Now application labs provide access to infrastructure, knowledge and technological support to facilitate the take-up of ISF. The ISF-Light project intensively explored the valorisation opportunities with a large number of industrial partners, most of them are SMEs, while working on the most important remaining hurdles in a concentrated effort to enlarge the valorisation window. To overcome the identified remaining valorisation obstacles, the research efforts were concentrated on the use of two heat supported process variants (in order to allow the use of a wide range of light, high strength materials), the enlargement of working ranges compared to traditional ISF setups through the development of two large scale application lab facilities available for use by SMEs, and the integration of ISF processes in flexible sheet metal working environments in support of elimination of the geometric limitations imposed by the use of individual, stand-alone processes...|$|E
