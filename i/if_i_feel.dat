25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{retirement}} announcement, Napravnik became Sharp's assistant trainer, continuing to ride regularly. [...] After initially exercising the stable's race {{horses in the}} early months of her pregnancy, she moved over to ponying and other activities. [...] , she and Sharp currently hope to have two children fairly close together, and after that, Napravnik has not ruled out a return to race riding but has not made any firm decisions. As she explained in February 2015, [...] "I'm satisfied with the accomplishments that I've made. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like I really want to come back in a few years then I can do it. The greatest thing is I don't have to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The imprint {{will not}} publish books written by Riordan, [...] "whose role will {{be closer to}} curator". In an {{interview}} with the Iowa Gazette, Riordan said, [...] "instead of me writing all of the mythologies we are going to look for authors who already are writing about that stuff. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like I can recommend them ... we’re going to have them out here in the spotlight." [...] A focus will be placed on [...] "diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under-represented authors". Lurie expressed hopes that the imprint will help satisfy Riordan fans, without asking the author to write more than his usual two books a year.|$|E

30|$|This is {{the most}} {{difficult}} time of my life—I am a doer and I can make people do things, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can’t <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> have failed.|$|R

2500|$|Regarding her {{intake of}} food, Jasmuheen is quoted by the Correx Archives as saying: [...] "Generally not much at all. Maybe a few {{cups of tea}} {{and a glass of}} water, but now and then <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> a bit bored and I want some flavour, then I will have a mouthful of {{whatever}} it is I'm wanting the flavour of. So it might be a piece of chocolate or it might be a mouthful of a cheesecake or something like that." [...] In the aftermath of the 60 Minutes broadcast, Kathy Marks noted in The Independent, [...] "Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster".|$|E
2500|$|Sometime during August 2011, Parks was {{contacted}} by electronic musician Skrillex for orchestral arrangements. Parks elaborated in 2013, [...] "When Skrillex called me up, I'd {{never heard of}} him. I pretended I knew who he was. [...] "'Send me the piece, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> able, I'll do it.' I don't have any hobbies, you know. I love music; I do it [...] And he said, 'Oh, thank you, Mr. Parks. We will destroy the world.' I said, 'Okay...' I Google him and there he is, on YouTube, in front of 30,000 people, pouring beer onto a laptop computer, {{at which point the}} crowd jumps into the mosh pit and has an erection.…I have two things I can do: Run away from all this in horror because I’m so superior, or dig in and serve and try to bring hope to the hopeless. That can be done behind the curtain, and that’s where I’m very comfortable working.…I treat every job {{as if it were the}} very thing that will define me. Nothing is beneath me. I think that is evident to people who ask my best." [...] His arranging work was released in December 2011 as the iTunes-exclusive bonus track [...] "Skrillex Orchestral Suite by Varien" [...] on the Bangarang EP.|$|E
6000|$|... "But what <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{a sort of}} {{inspiration}} which convinces me that I do possess prophetic powers, {{at least to some}} extent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haven't {{you seen}} my pretty rooms--my piano--my pictures--my china--my flowers? I {{should be the}} most insensible {{creature}} living <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>feel</b> grateful to your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you study}} {{physiognomy}} as well," [...] he said. [...] "Well, Miss Granger, {{it is rather}} odd, considering all things, but I will say to you what I have never said to any one before. I believe that you are right. <b>I</b> shall rise. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> live <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> have it in me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear uncle," [...] replied Ned, with emotion, [...] "perhaps {{the best}} promise I can make is to {{assure you that}} I will {{endeavour}} to do, in all things and at all times, as you have taught me, ever since I was a little boy. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> succeed, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> assured that <b>I</b> shall do well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll see. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> safe by nine-thirty I'll send him. But if you're {{not back}} here by ten o'clock I'll be after ye." [...] This made them both laugh again.|$|E
6000|$|MR. ROBERTS (reaching {{his left}} hand toward THE PORTER'S, and {{pressing}} a half dollar into his instantly responsive palm). But there's nothing to prevent my looking <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> perfectly sure of the bonnet? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it," [...] she said, shuddering also, yet {{unable to}} deceive herself, [...] "what {{difference}} do I make by saying it? He must {{know it is}} so, whether I say it or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|C. Well, so <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it sometimes; but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could only}} <b>feel</b> {{that there was}} a shore, I would try to get my foothold. Oh, with all my heart! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{this the}} {{beginning}} of a campaign amongst the butterflies," [...] he enquired, [...] "because, <b>if</b> so, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it my duty, uncle, to address to you a few words of solemn warning. Miss Daisy Hyslop is hot stuff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in this weather, surely," [...] {{retorted}} Macnab, [...] "and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did <b>feel</b> coldish in the circumstances, couldn't I borrow Spooner's blanket-capote? {{it might}} fit me then, for I'd {{probably be a}} few sizes smaller." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With your help," [...] Deane remarked sarcastically, [...] "it {{seems to}} me very possible. By the bye," [...] he continued, [...] "with {{reference}} to that document, you must forgive me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> some slight uneasiness at times as to its safety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You beware, Andy," [...] admonished his cousin, {{waving a}} finger {{severely}} at him. [...] "Remember, as the commandant of the battalion, I can throw {{you into a}} dungeon cell <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> so inclined," [...] and Jack strutted around grandly {{in the privacy of}} the Rovers' sitting room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{put them}} in my pocket <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> too much dressed," [...] said Polly as she snapped on the bracelets, but after a wave {{or two of the}} fan she felt that it would be {{impossible}} to take them off till the evening was over, so enticing was their glitter.|$|E
60|$|I presume Mrs. Keeley will do Ruth Pinch. <b>If</b> so, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> secure about her, and of Mrs. Gamp I am certain. But a queer {{sensation}} {{begins in}} my legs, and comes upward to my forehead, when I think of Tom.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My own Constance,' he said, 'you are the dearest {{wife in the}} world; and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>feel</b> unhappy, {{believe me}} it is only because I do not {{see you in the}} {{position}} to which you are entitled.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> will <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> {{stronger}} {{in a week}} or two," [...] was the slow and thoughtful answer. And then Tom put his hand {{to the back of his}} head, as he had done so many times lately.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{agree with}} you, Mr. Glanville,' said the Bishop warmly. 'I will think this over. Her motive in not {{replying}} I can quite understand: your motive in coming I can also {{understand and appreciate}} in a brother. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> convinced {{that it would be}} a seemly and expedient thing I will come to Welland to-morrow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's safe enough, Dick. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{the roof}} giving way I'll jump and save myself," [...] and Tom began a wilder caper than ever. But {{suddenly}} George Granbury, who sat nearby, caught {{him by the}} foot, and he came down with a thump that threatened to split the stage top from end to end.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon you won't {{be able to}} do much of {{anything}} by the time I get through with you," [...] Skip replied, with an exasperating chuckle. [...] "This is jest about as much as I need to pay for the swell dinner we fellers want; an' when I see the owner I'll give it back to him, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Milius {{said the}} Weinsteins [...] "were really arrogant. They {{called me up}} and acted as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should <b>feel</b> privileged to come back and ruin my own work. I told that asshole Bob Weinstein he was lucky to have it the way it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I should hope, my lord,' Euphemia {{answered}} demurely, 'that Lady Hilda {{would know}} her own place too well to demean herself with {{such as your}} lordship's tutor. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>feel</b> sure of that, I should have to mention the matter seriously to my lady.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't mind {{telling you}} {{that while he was}} my mate I never missed {{brothers}} and sisters, or wanted anyone else; but since he cast me off, I'll be hanged <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> as forlorn as old Crusoe before Friday turned up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is only, ma'am,' Mr Sampson explained, in {{exceedingly}} low spirits, 'because, in a pecuniary sense, I am painfully {{conscious of}} my unworthiness. Lavinia is now highly connected. Can I {{hope that she}} will still remain the same Lavinia as of old? And is it not pardonable <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> sensitive, when I see a disposition on her part to take me up short?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] she answered, [...] "that I {{should like}} it if I may have plenty of {{cushions}} and a soft place for my head, so that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like it I can go to sleep. Really, these late nights are dreadful. I am almost glad that Lord Ronald has gone. At least {{there will be no}} excuse for us to sit up until daylight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{our last}} chance, sweetheart," [...] I said very slowly, [...] "and we dare not neglect it, but I {{will make a}} promise. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> my {{strength}} failing, when I know I can do no more, I {{will come back to}} you. Standing here you could reach my hand as the eddying current sweeps me round. Now, wish me good fortune, darling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But no, I {{have not}} {{actually}} bought the practice as yet, though I am indeed in treaty for it. And, my dear friend, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> continue to <b>feel</b> {{about the business}} as <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> at this moment--perhaps I may conclude never to go at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aint {{it enough}} to make a cove cry," [...] Bill sobbed, [...] "to find a chap doing things for him like that? I wish <b>I</b> may die <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should bust. It's too much, that's what it is, and it's all on one side; that's the wust of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{mean that}} I am like you, papa,' said Sophy. 'I think I might at least {{learn to be}} really like you, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> must <b>feel</b> miserable, not to be unkind and sulky! And then I should leave off even the being unhappy about nothing.' ...|$|R
