40|$|Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are the {{scientific}} approaches behind modern environmental policies and business decision support related to Sustainable Consumption and Production and a resource-efficient society. In the Communication on Integrated Product Policy (IPP), the European Commission had committed {{to produce a}} handbook on best practice in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan (SCP/SIP) confirmed that “(…) consistent and reliable data and methods are required to assess the overall environmental performance of products (…) ”. Finally yet importantly, the 2011 Communication on "A resource-efficient Europe – Flagship initiative under the Europe 2020 Strategy" takes a life cycle approach to reduce the environmental impacts caused by resource use, re-stating the necessity {{to work with a}} consistent analytical approach. Responding to these needs, the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (<b>ILCD)</b> <b>Handbook</b> provides governments and businesses with a basis for assuring quality and consistency of life cycle data, methods and assessments. This JRC Reference Report (JRC RR) is an umbrella document for the guidance documents of the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook.</b> This JRC RR provides overview information on the Handbook components and their interrelationship, as well as supporting documents and tools. For policy developers, contracting officers and scientific officers it provides guidance on referring to the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook</b> and its related components in policy and business context, such as in policies, for service contracts and for research contracts. The principle target audience of the technical guidance documents of the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook</b> themselves is the LCA practitioner as well as technical experts in the public and private sector dealing with environmental decision support related to products, resources, and waste management.

40|$|Quality and {{consistency}} of life cycle based decision support are essential {{in public policy}} and business context. Those {{can and should be}} supported by ‘critical review’ of underlying data and of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies themselves. A review assesses whether a LCA study or related data set meets pre-defined requirements. A review can help avoiding errors, ensuring that all options or method requirements have been appropriately taken into account, and last but not least increasing acceptance by stakeholders. Whilst requiring efforts, failing to perform a thorough review can cost significantly more in the long term than you initially save. The principle requirements for reviews are briefly addressed in the ISO 14040 series. While other LCA-based standards define some review requirements in more detail, information on how to conduct the reviews or what qualifications are required from reviewers is scarce. Therefore, more specific requirements and guidance on reviewing Life Cycle Inventory and Life Cycle Assessment studies are provided in the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (<b>ILCD)</b> <b>Handbook.</b> Distinctions are made for the necessary level of review depending on the application context through a set of review schemes for 12 different cases. Differentiations are made with respect to the intended audience of the study, the complexity and broadness of the assessment, and the necessary type of stakeholder involvement. The scope of review (“what”) and the method of review that shall be used to verify the fulfillment of the requirements (“how”) are specified in the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook.</b> For how to do the review examples are provided, e. g. evidence collection by means of available documentation, cross-checks, verification and review of data source, calculations. More details will be provided in the document “Review scope, methods and documentation for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ” that currently is under development. Last but not least the review can be {{only as good as the}} reviewers. Therefore, the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook</b> also provides requirements on the necessary qualifications of reviewers. For the ILCD Data Network, initially somewhat reduced "entry-level" requirements have been defined. All these ILCD review requirements conform to the LCA-related ISO standards. JRC.

30|$|The {{methodology}} {{was developed}} and tested on the energy datasets most relevant for the EU context, derived from GaBi (the reference database used to derive datasets for the ELCD), Ecoinvent, E 3 and Gemis. The criteria for the database selection {{were based on the}} availability of EU-related data, the inclusion of comprehensive datasets on energy products and services, and the general approval of the LCA community. The proposed approach was based on the quality indicators developed within the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (<b>ILCD)</b> <b>Handbook,</b> further refined to facilitate their use in the analysis of energy systems.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} the quality criteria, the {{analysed}} ELCD datasets showed a very good performance {{in the majority of}} the criteria, where several recommendations for improving have been detailed above. In the case of biofuels and although it fully complies with the methodology quality criterion, it would be advisable to harmonize the methodology recommended by the <b>ILCD</b> <b>handbook</b> and used in the biofuels ELCD datasets with the proposed by the EC in the framework of biofuels sustainability certification. E 3 database fully follows this methodology and {{can be used as a}} source of data. The EC Energy Transparency Platform is also a source of relevant information.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} be {{compliant}} with ISO 14044, section 4.2. 3.6 (ISO 2006 a, b), LCI datasets must include a data quality description of its time-related, geographic and technological representativeness {{as well as of the}} precision, completeness, consistency and uncertainty of the information. Under this framework, some guidelines have been developed to address the DQRs. For instance, in the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook</b> (European Commission JRC and Sustainability 2010 c), data quality scores rank the datasets based on six indicators (technological representativeness, geographical representativeness, time-related representativeness, completeness, precision/uncertainty, and methodological appropriateness and consistency) with data quality scores of 1 to 5 (high to low) assigned to each.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of the paper is to discuss {{the role of a}} new guidance document for life cycle assessment (LCA) in the construction sector available as an online InfoHub. Methods: This InfoHub derives from the EeBGuide European project that aimed at developing a guidance document for energy-efficient building LCA studies. The InfoHub is built on reference documents such as the ISO 14040 - 44 standards, the EN 15804 and EN 15978 standards as well as the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook.</b> The guidance document was filled with expertise and knowledge of several experts. The focus was put on providing scientifically sound, yet practical guidance. Results: The EeBGuide InfoHub is an online guidance document, setting rules for conducting LCA studies and giving instructions on how to do this. The document has a section on buildings - new and existing - and a section on construction products. It is structured according to the life cycle stages of the European standards EN 15804 and EN 15978, covering all aspects of LCA studies by applying provisions from these standards and the <b>ILCD</b> <b>handbook,</b> wherever applicable. The guidance is presented for different scopes of studies by means of three study types. For the same system boundaries, default values are proposed in early or quick assessment (screening and simplified LCA) while detailed calculation rules correspond to a complete LCA. Such approach is intended to better match the user needs in the building sector. Conclusions and recommendations: This paper {{can be viewed as a}} contribution to the ongoing efforts to improve the consistency and harmonisation in LCA studies for building products and buildings. Further contributions are now needed to improve building LCA guidance and to strengthen links between research, standardisation and implementation of LCA in the construction practice...|$|E

The six quality criteria indicators defined by the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook</b> have been included in the method. These indicators have, however, been redefined in order to facilitate their implementation, and to ensure the quality of the assessment whenever expert judgement was required. The quality criteria indicators can be applied to any type of LCA dataset.

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} areas of potential improvement of the European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD) electricity datasets. The revision is based on the data quality indicators described by the International Life Cycle Data system (<b>ILCD)</b> <b>Handbook,</b> applied on sectorial basis.

Results show that ELCD electricity datasets have a very good quality in general terms, nevertheless some findings and recommendations in order to improve the quality of Life-Cycle Inventories have been derived. Moreover, these results ensure the quality of the electricity-related datasets to any LCA practitioner, and provide insights related to the limitations and assumptions underlying in the datasets modelling. Giving this information, the LCA practitioner will be able to decide whether the use of the ELCD electricity datasets is appropriate based on the goal and scope of the analysis to be conducted. The methodological approach would be also useful for dataset developers and reviewers, in order to improve the overall Data Quality Requirements of databases.|$|E

40|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{is increasingly}} used in waste management to identify strategies that prevent or minimise negative impacts on ecosystems, human health or natural resources. However, {{the quality of}} the provided support to decision- and policy-makers is strongly dependent on a proper conduct of the LCA. How has LCA been applied until now? Are there any inconsistencies in the past practice? To answer these questions, we draw on a critical review of 222 published LCA studies of solid waste management systems. We analyse the past practice against the ISO standard requirements and the <b>ILCD</b> <b>Handbook</b> guidelines for each major step within the goal definition, scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation phases of the methodology. Results show that malpractices exist in several aspects of the LCA with large differences across studies. Examples are a frequent neglect of the goal definition, a frequent lack of transparency and precision in the definition of the scope of the study, e. g. an unclear delimitation of the system boundaries, a truncated impact coverage, difficulties in capturing influential local specificities such as representative waste compositions into the inventory, and a frequent lack of essential sensitivity and uncertainty analyses.
