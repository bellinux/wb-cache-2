500|$|Several Scandinavian {{actors were}} cast in major roles, {{including}} Pihla Viitala, Peter Stormare (who Arterton said had actually inspired her to start acting), Bjørn Sundquist, and Ingrid Bolsø Berdal. In addition, actors from Germany and Poland (including Thomas Mann, Rainer Bock, and Joanna Kulig) {{and other parts}} of the world were also cast. Viitala, a self-described [...] "big fan" [...] of Renner, said she was nervous at first, but found him [...] "extremely" [...] easy to approach, made a good connection, and enjoyed working with him. Wirkola said Berdal was chosen for her [...] "piercing" [...] eyes, adding: [...] "There are a lot of Norwegians in the film. Minor parts, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get great actors in small parts and Ingrid has a great physicality." [...] Stormare said he was only surprised at [...] "how smart Tom [...] is, and how broad this fantasy is and the span of his imagination," [...] his favourite aspect being how [...] "some of the witches are so sexy and cool." [...] He compared the film's production to being in Disneyland, saying it felt like a dream to him.|$|E
2500|$|Neville was {{employed}} by BBC One as a commentator and pundit during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. His commentary of the England–Italy match on 14 June attracted 445 complaints for his [...] "lack of emotion and 'monotone style'". He reflected {{on this in}} an online article by stating [...] "I played it {{back the next day}} and it did not sound like it was me commentating. I was trying to be somebody I wasn't, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do better than that".|$|E
2500|$|Elena {{suffered}} a serious injury when a bone detached itself from her knee. A medical specialist {{told her that}} her injury could be repaired through surgery. Her chances of ever again competing at the highest level would be negligible. In fact it could mean she would never be a gymnast again. Elena took plenty of rest and homeopathic treatments. Her resilience and spirit won through. [...] "When I was injured my coach believed in me and didn't give up on me. In my mind <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still be on the team. I kept going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{perfectly}} beastly! Can't {{it be done}} somehow? There must be a way. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> buy a small Gallery for {{ten thousand}} pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Trevor, [...] "there's no {{question}} of my getting out of it. <b>I</b> daresay <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> In fact, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> But I'm not going to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Wally! She says nothing, but {{she thinks}} that I am a {{castaway}} and a recreant. I am a recreant, I know;--but yet I think that <b>I</b> was right. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help myself." ...|$|R
2500|$|With Nanavati {{frequently}} away {{on assignments}} {{for long periods}} of time, Sylvia fell in love with Prem Bhagwan Ahuja, a Sindhi friend of Nanavati's. In her testimony in court, Prem's sister Mamie Ahuja, stated that Prem had agreed to marry Sylvia, provided she divorced her husband. However, this was contradicted by the letters written by Sylvia (admitted as Sylvia's testimony), where she expressed her desire to divorce Nanavati and marry Prem, but she doubted whether Prem had the same intentions. In a letter dated 24 May 1960, she wrote [...] "Last night when you spoke of your marrying me and the various other girls you might marry, something inside me snapped and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not bear the thought of your loving someone else…".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Marvin Gaye {{had fallen}} into a deep {{depression}} following the brain tumor diagnosis of his Motown singing partner Tammi Terrell, the failure of his marriage to Anna Gordy, a growing dependency on cocaine, troubles with the IRS, and struggles with Motown Records, the label he had signed with in 1961. At one point, Gaye attempted suicide at a Detroit apartment with a handgun, only to be saved from committing the act by Berry Gordy's father. During this time, Gaye began experiencing international success {{for the first time in}} his career following the release of [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] and subsequent hit singles such as [...] "Too Busy Thinking About My Baby", [...] "Abraham, Martin & John" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is". But Gaye was in no mood to celebrate: [...] "My success didn't seem real. I didn't deserve it. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done more. I felt like a puppet—Berry's puppet, Anna's puppet. I had a mind of my own and I wasn't using it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{had seen}} Russell Crowe in Romper Stomper {{and found him}} [...] "repulsive and scary, but captivating". The actor had read Ellroy's The Black Dahlia but not L.A. Confidential. When he read the script, Crowe was drawn to Bud White's [...] "self-righteous moral crusade". Crowe fit the visual preconception of Bud. Hanson put the actor on tape doing a few scenes from the script {{and showed it to}} the film's producers, who agreed to cast him as Bud. Guy Pearce auditioned like countless other actors, and Hanson felt that he [...] "was very much what I had in mind for Ed Exley." [...] The {{director}} purposely did not watch the actor in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, afraid that it might influence his decision. As he did with Crowe, Hanson taped Pearce and showed it to the producers, who agreed he should be cast as Ed. Pearce did not like Ed when he first read the screenplay and remarked, [...] "I was pretty quick to judge him and dislike him for being so self-righteous ... But I liked how honest he became about himself. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> grow to respect and understand him." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now. <b>I</b> {{wanted him}} to do it. Oh, never speak to me of others after that. Perhaps he saw I wanted it and did it to please me. But I meant--indeed I did--that I gave it to him with all my love. Sister, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear all the rest; but I have been unladylike.|$|R
6000|$|Eleanor was beckoning Jimmy, but {{the child}} went on. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "he thinks you nice, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell it {{by the way he}} looked at you. Perhaps you didn't see him, but I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A ---- bad job," [...] {{the other}} said, with an oath; [...] "about {{as bad as}} I ever had a hand in. Who {{would have thought that}} old cat would have held out against that? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have done it." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 20, Heshan Unamboowe was the {{youngest}} male athlete to compete on Sri Lanka's behalf at the London Games. He had not participated in any previous Summer Olympics. Unamboowe qualified for the games by using a universality place from the sport's governing body FINA because his fastest time of 57.47 seconds was 0.97 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] (FINA/Olympic Invitation Times) qualifying standard for his event, the men's 100 metre backstroke. The swimmer trained at Nunawading Swimming Club in Melbourne {{to prepare for the}} Olympics. Before the Games he said he was feeling [...] "excited" [...] but [...] "nervous" [...] and wanted to record a new personal best time: [...] "As a kid I used to watch all these world class swimmers at past Olympics games and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do something special, and now my dream has come true." [...] Unamboowe was drawn in first heat on 29 July, finishing second out of three swimmers, with a time of 57.94 seconds. He finished ahead of Zane Jordan of Zambia (58.77 seconds) but behind heat winner Barbados's Bradley Ally (56.27 seconds). Unamboowe finished 42nd out of 43 competitors overall, and did not advance into the semi-final after finishing 3.42 seconds behind the slowest swimmer who made the later stages. After his participation ended, he spoke of an pre-existing shoulder injury that was aggravated and underwent physiotherapy upon finding this in his right shoulder: [...] "All I wanted initially was to better the Sri Lanka record. But that did not come my way as I could not keep the pace in the second half. I swam the first 50m well but could not accelerate in the last 50m." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not hide}} {{the change in}} me, and Matteo soon noticed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I ever {{thank you}} for what you've done for me?" [...] she said. [...] "You've done me a great service. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't like it," [...] I pleaded. [...] "It hasn't got any {{interest}} for me, and art has. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do more in art," [...] and I {{reminded him that}} a successful painter gains large sums; that a picture of Meissonier's would sell for many thousand dollars.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must try}} to think it out, and if we can't--if you can't let me give up to you unless I {{do it for the}} same reason that you do; and if I can't let you give up for me, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> neva do that; then--we mustn't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do a great}} deal. If nothing else, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sing; {{and they}} have a great {{aptitude}} for singing, Mary was telling me. But that reminds me I must finish copying the hymn for next Sunday; Henry hindered me, and I have six copies more to do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{should like}} to know whether you {{consider}} yourselves American or English," [...] she broke out. [...] "If once <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> talk to you accordingly." ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{the manner}} and {{extent to which}} he took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards {{at the ends of}} hands, before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling that I had, {{respecting}} his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never bear to speak to him about her, that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never bear to hear him creak his boots at her, that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never bear to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same place with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo!" [...] said young Bingo. [...] "So you've got there? Good man! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> rely on you. I say, old crumpet, did {{my uncle}} seem {{pleased to see}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{he wants}} to get any out, he'd better call in {{somebody}} to rewrite it. You don't have to engage me if you don't want to. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make a good job of it. There's just one little twist the thing needs and you would have quite a different piece." ...|$|R
6000|$|She smiled. [...] "You {{forget the}} time of night!" [...] Her face grew wistful. [...] "I've been getting homesick for the {{mountains}} lately--and yet I like it here. I love this beautiful room. I adore your sister. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have a delightful time if only my guides weren't so anxious to have me convert the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "NOW I reckon {{the thing}} is clear to you at last. In the other case the moving and {{steering}} was done by turning a peg. We touch a button, the prince turned a peg. There ain't an atom of difference, you see. <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{depend on}} his memory, {{in a matter}} of this kind. It was plainly {{impossible}} that I could have been intoxicated. I passed on to the second question.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's a cure, it's a cure! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it. Dear sir, my grand system never failed--never. You've {{got your}} {{appetite}} back--you know you have; say {{it and make}} me happy.' ...|$|E
60|$|Boy. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it. I {{told you}} I'd have my dealing trick {{out of the}} priest. I took a hold of this, and Johneen made a snap at the onions.|$|E
500|$|Lochte said he {{was pleased}} with his {{performance}} at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships but feels that he can improve his times before the 2012 Olympics. [...] "Getting five gold medals is definitely great, but the times that <b>I</b> went, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go a lot faster," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are a lot of}} places in my races that I messed up on that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have changed and gone faster, but I guess I have a whole year to make sure I have those perfect swims." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can speak}} for that, ma'am," [...] said Cribb. [...] "You read the Sporting Chronicle for three weeks ago, ma'am. You'll see how he stood up to Ned Painter until his senses were beat out of him. I waited on him, ma'am, and <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> show you my {{waistcoat}} now--that would let you guess what punishment he can take." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In my {{old age and}} on my beam-ends," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Wiggett, [...] "I remembered them {{words of}} old Sol, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only find ’im my troubles were over. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> creep into ’is little harbour and lay snug. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that what Sol said he meant. I lost my leg saving ’is life, and he is grateful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn’t do that," [...] said Mrs. Cox. [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} disgrace, even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pay him out. As it is, Cox is always setting his family above mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} Queen, looking up. 'She {{wrote to me}} once from her convent; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do nothing for her but bring her enemies' notice on her; so I made no answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{tell you}} what to do about it, but I don't. It's {{possible}} there was only one man, but if so, he's dangerous. Anyhow, it's obvious that Kenwardine has no part in the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|S. Come, now, the {{situation}} is full of hope, and grace, and tender sentiment. If I had in the least poetic gift, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> improvise under such an inspiration (each girl nudges her sweetheart) something worthy to--to--Is there no poet among us? (Each youth turns solemnly his back upon the other, and raises his hands in benediction over his sweetheart's bowed head.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a strange}} apathy about him," [...] said Flora, [...] "but I believe it is chiefly for want of exertion. I should like to rouse him if papa would let me; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> by telling him how these Andersons are {{reckoning}} on his getting down. If he does, I shall be ready to run away, that I may never meet any one here again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss--Anderson," [...] he began, brokenly, with {{restraint}} let down, [...] "your father--doesn't understand. I've got to go.... And even if I am spared--I couldn't ever come back....
