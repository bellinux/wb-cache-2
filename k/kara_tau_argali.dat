5000|$|B. b. hemachalana (Hume, 1873) - The Himalayan eagle-owl. The {{range of}} B. b. hemachalana {{extends from the}} Himalayas and Tibet, westward to the Tian Shan system in Russian Turkestan, west to the <b>Kara</b> <b>Tau,</b> north to the Dzungarian Alatau, east to at least the Tekkes Valley in Xinjiang, and south to the regions of Kashgar, Yarkant and {{probably}} the western Kunlun Mountains. This bird is partly migratory, descending to the plains of Turkmenistan with colder winter weather, and apparently reaches northern Balochistan. This is a medium-sized subspecies, though is larger than other potentially abutting arid Asian eagle-owl races which share a somewhat similar yellowish ground colour. The male attains a wing chord length of 420 - 485 mm, while the femaleâ€™s wing chord is 450 - 505 mm. The bill measures 42 - 45 mm in length. 11 adult eagle-owls of this race from the Tibetan Plateau averaged 301 mm in tail length, 78 mm in tarsus length and scaled an average of 2.16 kg in mass. This race is physically similar to B. b. turcomanus but the background colour is more light yellowish-brown and less buff. The dark patterns on upper- and under-parts are some more expressed and less regular than in B. b. turcomanus and B. b. omissus and the general colour from the mantle to the ear tufts is a more consistent brownish colour than most other abutting races. B. b. hemachalana differs from B. b. yenisseensis by being much more yellow on the rump, under tail coverts, and outer tail feathers, rather than grayish or whitish, and the ground coloration of its body is more yellowish above, and is less whitish below. Dark longitudinal pattern on the under-parts cover the fore-belly.|$|R
