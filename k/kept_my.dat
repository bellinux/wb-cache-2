5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
25|$|I <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> {{money in}} a 'grouch bag'. This was a small chamois bag that actors used to wear around their neck to keep other hungry actors from {{pinching}} their dough. Naturally, you're going to think that's where I got my name from. But that's not so. Grouch bags were worn on manly chests long {{before there was a}} Groucho.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|Praise for {{the song}} was not universal. Rob Harvilla of Village Voice wrote that the track offered [...] "nothing terribly earth-shattering" [...] and thought that [...] "the {{contrast}} between Thom's dolphin-soothing calm and lyrics like 'I've seen hell upon this earth/The next one will be chemical/But they will never learn' might just ruin your lunch." [...] David Malitz of The Washington Post complained: [...] "It's a little too Sigur Ros-y and doesn't really go anywhere" [...] but acknowledged it [...] "till <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> interest for five and half minutes".|$|E

500|$|During {{his first}} game for the Cubs, Banks {{received}} a visit from Jackie Robinson that influenced his quiet presence in baseball. Robinson told Banks, [...] "Ernie, I'm glad to see you're up here so now just listen and learn...For years, I didn't talk and {{learned a lot about}} people". Later, when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that are caught once they open their mouths. Banks said, [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> mouth shut but tried to make a difference. My whole life, I've just wanted to make people better".|$|E
500|$|Hamilton was {{satisfied}} with his performance in the race, saying [...] "today was all about damage control: I came away with some points and <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> lead in the world Drivers' Championship." [...] Massa {{said that he had}} hoped to do better, but added [...] "I've managed to make up a point on my nearest rival so this is absolutely not a negative result." [...] Massa took threepoints from the race, compared to Hamilton's two, and narrowed the gap in the Drivers' Championship to onepoint with fourraces remaining. Kovalainen's second-placed finish closed the gap in the Constructors' Championship between Ferrari and McLaren from twelve to fivepoints.|$|E
500|$|During his {{theatrical}} days, Davidson maintained {{high standards}} of personal morality, observed strict teetotalism and gave regular Bible readings to the elderly in the towns in which he performed on tour. He later gave an account of an incident from November 1894 when he was performing in London. While walking along the Thames Embankment in a thick fog, he said, he encountered a 16-year-old girl {{who was about to}} throw herself into the Thames. After preventing her suicide attempt, Davidson learned that she had run away from home near Cambridge, was penniless and without shelter. He paid her fare home: [...] "Her pitiful story made a tremendous impression on me... I have ever since... <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> eyes open for opportunities to help that kind of girl." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr Boffin {{seemed a}} little less patient at this point {{than at any other}} of the negotiations. But he {{commanded}} himself, and said tamely enough: 'I think it must be <b>kept</b> from <b>my</b> old lady, Wegg.' ...|$|R

500|$|In the borderlands {{south of}} Tombstone {{there was only}} one {{passable}} route between Arizona and Mexico, a passage known as Guadalupe Canyon. In August 1881, 15 Mexicans carrying gold, coins and bullion to make their purchases were ambushed and killed in Skeleton Canyon. The next month Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border, where they killed five Cowboys, including Old Man Clanton, in Guadalupe Canyon. The Earps knew that the McLaurys and Clantons were reputed to be mixed up in the robbery and murder in Skeleton Canyon. Wyatt Earp said in his testimony after the shootout, [...] "I naturally <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> eyes open and did not intend that any of the gang should get the drop on me if I could help it." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Terri Schiavo's {{death in}} March 2005, {{her family and}} Michael Schiavo have clashed a number of times. Each side has also worked to promote their own causes related to the case. In April 2005, the {{families}} disagreed over Schiavo's burial. The Schindlers had wanted her body {{to be buried in}} Florida, while Michael Schiavo said {{at the time that he}} would cremate her body and then have her ashes buried in her home state of Pennsylvania. In June 2005, however, Schiavo's ashes were buried in Florida instead. The words [...] "I <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> promise" [...] were included on the marker, referring to his promise to follow what he said was her wish not to be kept alive artificially. The statement angered the Schindlers.|$|E
500|$|Cagney had {{demonstrated}} {{the power of}} the walkout in keeping the studios to their word. He later explained his reasons, saying, [...] "I walked out because I depended on the studio heads to keep their word on this, that or other promise, and when the promise was not <b>kept,</b> <b>my</b> only recourse was to deprive them of my services." [...] Cagney himself acknowledged the importance of the walkout for other actors in breaking the dominance of the studio system. Normally, when a star walked out, the time he or she was absent was added onto the end of an already long contract, as happened with Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis. Cagney, however, walked out and came back to a better contract. Many in Hollywood watched the case closely for hints of how future contracts might be handled.|$|E

500|$|Before the fight, sports writers {{considered}} Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, {{with his}} [...] "knockout punch" [...] and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances, despite having lost {{three of his}} last six fights. Gomez saw the fight {{as an opportunity to}} reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how [...] "his fight really is my last chance to set myself up for life and become known in every household in Britain". At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying [...] "Boxing <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> feet on the ground and gave me a focus. It's got me through the bad times and calmed me down. If it wasn't for boxing, I wouldn't have my beautiful wife and family". Gomez lives with his wife Alison and their three children in Manchester.|$|E
500|$|For the film, cinematographer Russell Carpenter used a 1.85 {{aspect ratio}} shot with Arri Alexa XT and M cameras, using the M for fight {{sequences}} and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, [...] "Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 {{was a good}} call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [...] going from standing full-size to falling {{through a crack in}} the floor." [...] Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, [...] "For a lot of recent comedies I've <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{starting}} filming {{or making}} an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: [...] "my own technique {{to get myself}} going was... to jump {{in the air and}} execute a few dance steps". His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in Private's Progress, a close-up was needed showing his character [...] "registering shock, fury, indignation and anything else I could stuff in"; he [...] "just looked into the camera and <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> mind blank. It's a trick I've used often since. In this way, the audience does the work". Terry-Thomas said [...] "I like to do my own stunts", which he did for films such as A Matter of WHO and Bachelor Flat. This included some dangerous work; for example, during Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, he ran along the roof of a moving train.|$|E
6000|$|... "If there's {{a vacant}} {{place for a}} chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it," [...] he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. [...] "The way you <b>kept</b> on <b>my</b> trail was a caution." ...|$|R

500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinched his fifth pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 31.049. He was joined on the grid's front row by Scott Speed. Marcos Ambrose qualified third, Martin took fourth and Stewart started fifth. Harvick, Newman, Greg Biffle, Bill Elliott and Bowyer completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Kurt Busch, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twelfth, while Jeff Gordon set the twentieth fastest time. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Dave Blaney, Mike Skinner, Max Papis and David Stremme. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "I had a talk with myself to do what I could today and don't freak out if it's not as good as what Mark [...] ran. I <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> emotions in check and drove the car with the right touch and feel, and that comes from being relaxed, so it went well." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] finished eighteenth {{in the ratings}} for the week of February 6 to February 12, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 14.9. The episode was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross said the episode was both touching and humorous. He added that in the scene where Bart runs a videotape in slow motion to show Lisa how [...] "you can actually pin-point the second when [...] heart rips in half", the audience does not really know [...] "whether you're shedding tears of laughter, empathy, or both—you just know that it's damn good any way you slice it." [...] The Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz named the episode one of his five favorites and highlighted Ralph's line [...] "and my doctor said I wouldn't have so many nosebleeds if I <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> finger out of there" [...] {{as one of the}} best lines in the history of the show. In a review of The Simpsons season four, Lyndsey Shinoda of Video Store cited [...] "Brother from the Same Planet" [...] and [...] "I Love Lisa" [...] among her [...] "personal favorites" [...] from the season.|$|E
