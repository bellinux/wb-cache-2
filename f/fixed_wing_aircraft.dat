5|$|Though {{several new}} <b>fixed</b> <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> and {{helicopters}} were {{inducted into the}} navy in the early 2000s, they {{were assigned to the}} existing squadrons with no new squadrons being commissioned until 2006. In January of that year, INAS 342, the first squadron to be equipped with UAVs, was commissioned. Later that year, the Sea Harrier training assigned to INAS 551 were detached and commissioned separately as INAS 552. However, the Sea Harriers were phased out in May 2016, and presently the operational status of the squadron is unknown. On 24 March 2009, for the first time, two squadrons—INAS 311 and INAS 350—were commissioned on the same day. INAS 311 is intended for maritime patrol and operates Do-228s, whereas INAS 350, a multirole helicopter squadron, operates Sikorsky SH-3s. In 2011–2012, another two UAV squadrons—INAS 343 and INAS 344—were commissioned. In 2013, a fighter plane and a multirole helicopter squadron—INAS 303 and INAS 322—were commissioned with MiG-29Ks and HAL Dhruvs. INAS 322 commissioned on 12 November 2013, equipped with the indigenously developed Dhruv helicopters, and is youngest Indian naval air squadron.|$|E

25|$|For {{take-off}} of <b>fixed</b> <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> Admiral Kuznetsov uses a ski-jump {{at the end}} of her bow. On take-off aircraft accelerate toward and up the ski-jump {{using their}} afterburners. This results in the aircraft leaving the deck at a higher angle and elevation than on an aircraft carrier with a flat deck and catapults. The ski-jump take-off is less demanding on the pilot, since the acceleration is lower, but results in a clearance speed of only 120–140km/h (75–85mph) requiring an aircraft design which will not stall at those speeds.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to helicopter development, many approaches {{have been tried}} to develop practical aircraft with {{vertical take-off and landing}} capabilities including Henry Berliner's 1922–1925 experimental horizontal rotor <b>fixed</b> <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and Nikola Tesla's 1928 patent and George Lehberger's 1930 patent for relatively impractical VTOL fixed wing airplanes with a tilting engines. In the late 1930s British aircraft designer Leslie Everett Baynes was issued a patent for the Baynes Heliplane, another tilt rotor aircraft. In 1941 German designer Heinrich Focke's began work on the Focke-Achgelis Fa 269, which had two rotors that tilted downward for vertical takeoff, but wartime bombing halted development.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the Canberra class amphibious vessels for the Royal Australian Navy has led to suggestions from some quarters that the RAN should procure {{a number of the}} F-35B STOVL version to operate from these ships.

In 2014 Defence Minister David Johnston said that the government was considering the purchase of F-35Bs to use aboard the ships. Tony Abbott directed that the team developing a new defence white paper consider the issue.
