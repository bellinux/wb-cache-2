5|$|One of {{the most}} famous cases of {{changing}} nationality for the Olympics was Zola Budd, a South African runner who emigrated to the United Kingdom because there was an apartheid-era ban on the Olympics in South Africa. Budd was eligible for British citizenship because her grandfather was born in Britain, but British citizens accused the government of <b>expediting</b> the citizenship process for her.|$|E
5|$|Following this, in 1972, the {{legislature}} {{added a new}} SR117, which extended this part of SR75 southwest to the Mexican border near Border Field State Park, to the state highway system, and a southerly extension of SR125 to the border at Otay Mesa to the state highway and Freeway and Expressway systems. Two years later, planning began {{for the construction of}} the Otay Mesa crossing and the construction of SR75 to connect it to I-5 and I-805. Later, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for the construction of SR75. The CPO later endorsed <b>expediting</b> construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve border traffic, thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that the funding for SR75 would not be available until at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate the construction of the crossing, even though there was no funding for the highway.|$|E
5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for <b>expediting</b> pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E

The watch was upgraded to a warning the next day.

Premier of Bermuda Michael Dunkley advised citizens to complete most preparations by the afternoon of October 16. Banks and businesses began closing that day, while schools and government offices were closed by October 17. One school functioned as a storm shelter, and 66people ultimately sought refuge there. Bus and ferry services were suspended on the evening of October 16. Bermuda's only daily newspaper, the Royal Gazette, did not go to print on October 17, but distributed the next day's edition for free.

40|$|To {{describe}} {{the policies and}} procedures for conducting <b>expedited</b> initial review GENERAL DESCRIPTION The Institutional Review Board (IRB) uses an <b>expedited</b> review process to review studies that meet the categories adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that involve no greater than “minimal risk. ” The <b>expedited</b> applicability criteria, including the definition of “minimal risk ” and federally mandated categories are attached. <b>Expedited</b> review procedures allow the IRB to review and approve studies that meet the criteria in the attached document without convening {{a meeting of the}} full IRB.

The <b>expedited</b> reviewers only approve research that meets the federal criteria for approval as specified in 45 CFR 46. 111 and 21 CFR 56. 111.

40|$|A {{statement}} of record {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an abstract that begins "This testimony discusses the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) processes for denying aliens entry at airports and other points of entry, including the <b>expedited</b> removal and credible fear processes. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 included a provision [...] <b>expedited</b> removal [...] for dealing with aliens who try to enter the United States by engaging in fraud or misrepresentation (e. g. falsely claiming to be a U. S. citizen or misrepresenting a material fact) or who arrive with fraudulent, improper, or no documents (e. g. visa or passport). The <b>expedited</b> removal provision reduces an alien's right to seek review of a determination of inadmissibility decision. The Act also allows <b>expedited</b> removal orders to be issued to aliens who have entered the United States without being inspected or paroled at a port of entry. INS and immigration judges implement the act's provisions on the <b>expedited</b> removal of aliens. ...|$|R

25|$|The post–World War II {{economic}} expansion and subsequent suburbanization {{had a profound}} impact on the physical development of the city's neighborhoods.

Between 1950 and 1990, over 155,000 residents left Center Township, resulting in urban blight and disinvestment. Since the 2000s, Downtown Indianapolis and surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment attributed to nationwide demographic trends, driven by empty nesters and millennials.
