The <b>grounds,</b> <b>remodelled</b> to a design by William Andrews Nesfield in 1861–2, contain 7.5 {{hectares}} (18 acres) of gardens including a modern woodland garden. A grade-II*-listed gateway now situated in the wall {{to the west of}} the hall formerly belonged to Roger Wilbraham's almshouses in Nantwich, which were demolished in 1872. The wrought-iron gate features a sun motif with scrolls; it stands in a moulded stone opening flanked by niches containing busts and surmounted by lions.|$|R

5000|$|The tower {{dates to}} the early 16th century, when it was built by Sir John Elphinstone as {{the seat of the}} barony of Elphinstone. The Elphinstone Estate was {{purchased}} for £16,000 by John Murray, son of the 3rd Earl of Dunmore, in 1754. [...] Two years later he inherited the earldom, and renamed the estate Dunmore after his title. Lord Dunmore built the famous Dunmore Pineapple elsewhere on the estate in 1761. The tower was extended at some point, although {{there is little evidence that}} it was occupied. In the 1820s the 5th Earl commissioned the building of Dunmore Park as the principal residence on the estate. The additions to the tower were demolished to allow construction of St Andrew's Episcopal Church, a private chapel completed around 1850. The tower was subsequently restored and the <b>ground</b> floor <b>remodelled</b> as a family burial vault.|$|R
5000|$|Burton Grange {{was bought}} as an annexe in 1953 and plans were {{initiated}} {{for a large}} scale conversion and enlargement of the main buildings, {{in view of the}} increase in student numbers. Burton Lea was acquired in 1954 and, on the strength of a possible grant of £30,000, the enlargement of Tetley Hall got under way. The first stage - the new dining room block, to accommodate 85-100 students, was opened by the University Chancellor H.R.H. The Princess Royal in July 1958. By 1962 the Woodhouse and Heathfield wings were completed and, with 160 students, Tetley was the largest women's hall in the University. About this time the university planned to demolish Moorfield Lodge and Moor Grange and replace them by a further purpose-built block to complement the Woodhouse and Healthfield wings on the other side. However a timely conservation order placed on both Victorian properties by Leeds City Council prevented this happening. After the extensions had been completed in 1962 the <b>grounds</b> were <b>remodelled</b> and landscaped, effectively uniting the houses and the new blocks together as a single community ...|$|R
5000|$|The old {{ballpark}} {{was used}} as-is until 1955, when Boston University reconfigured {{the stands and}} the <b>grounds.</b> The <b>remodel,</b> replaced all but the pavilion grandstand {{at the end of}} the right field line, which was retained as the seating core of a football, soccer, field hockey, and track-and-field stadium. The stadium was initially called [...] "Boston University Field" [...] and later renamed Nickerson Field. Along with the pavilion, the original outer wall was retained, though a portion of that wall along what is now Harry Agganis Way was replaced with wrought iron fencing in 2008. The stadium's ticket office was converted into the Boston University police station. The rest of the stadium structure was replaced by dormitories covering the former main grandstand; and the Case Physical Education Center, which houses Walter Brown Arena and Case Gym in the vicinity of what was the left field pavilion along Babcock Street. Of the demolished Jewel Box ballparks, Braves Field has the largest proportion of visible remnants still standing, as no other former ballpark has any portion of its seating still in use.|$|R

Not {{intended}} for a beginner, this book further defi nes, describes, and explicates the classic grounded theory (GT) method. Perspective III lays out various facets of theoretical coding as Glaser meticulously distinguishes classic GT from other subsequent methods. Developed {{many years after}} Glaser’s classic GT, these methods, particularly as described by Strauss and Corbin, adopt the grounded theory name and engender ongoing confusion about the very premises of grounded theory. Glaser distinguishes between classic GT and the adscititious methods in his writings, referring to <b>remodeled</b> <b>grounded</b> theory and its offshoots as Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) models...|$|R
40|$|Social Constructionism {{has been}} {{instrumental}} in <b>remodeling</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. In attempting {{to make sense of the}} social world, social constructionists view knowledge as constructed as opposed to created. This paper discusses how social constructionists construct knowledge and argues that social constructionism is concerned with the nature of knowledge and how it is created and as such, it is unconcerned with ontological issues. Society is viewed as existing both as a subjective and an objective reality. Meaning is shared, thereby constituting a taken-for-granted reality. Grounded theorists understand knowledge as beliefs in which people can have reasonable confidence; a common sense understanding and consensual notion as to what constitutes knowledge. If it is accepted that social constructionism is not based on a relativist perspective, then it is compatible with Grounded Theory methodology...|$|R
5000|$|The SOWEGA Building or Southwest Georgia Melon Growers Association Building (also {{known as}} The Watermelon Building) in Adel, Georgia at 100 South Hutchinson Avenue (US 41). It {{was built in}} 1930. It is three stories tall and made of red brick, built in a {{commercial}} style. It has a roof deck and a basement. It is made of concrete reinforced with steel. Terracotta trim accents the exterior. The base is finished in marble. It features unique green terracotta watermelons in terracotta lozenges in a broad diamond, which represent the SOWEGA trademark. The third floor was remodeled in the early 1960s and the <b>ground</b> floor was <b>remodeled</b> in 1988. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. [...] The Adel-Cook County Chamber of Commerce currently uses the building.|$|R
5000|$|The owners began remodelling {{the hotel}} again in 1923 to [...] "keep {{up with the}} Shanghai passion for nightly entertainment." [...] The <b>ground</b> floor was <b>remodelled,</b> and [...] "its grill-room soon earned distinction." [...] They {{commissioned}} architect Mr. A. Lafuente to design {{the dining room and}} ballroom. On Saturday, 22 December 1923, the new ballroom was opened formally with 350 invited guests. The North-China Herald described the ballroom: The light blue walls decorated with maidens and sylphs dancing in the open spaces, are surmounted by the plaster reliefs for the indirect lighting system suspended from the ceiling, while high on the marble pillars beautifully cast female figures appear to support the roof. Probably the most novel feature of the decorative scheme, excepting the incandescent mirrors was the peacock shell utilized by the orchestra.|$|R
5000|$|The Statue of Sir John Cordy Burrows was {{initially}} {{located at the}} southern end of the grounds of the Royal Pavilion, in front of Carlisle House, where it was unveiled on 14 Feb 1878. The statue is of white Sicilian marble and the plinth of grey granite. The inscription on the pedestal reads: [...] "Sir John Cordy Burrows Knt. Three Times Mayor Of Brighton" [...] and [...] "Erected By His Fellow Townsmen As A Mark Of Their Esteem 1878." [...] Burrows is depicted in his mayoral robes; at the base of the statue, the signature [...] "E.B. Stephens 1878" [...] appears. The monument was commissioned by the memorial committee and designed by Exeter sculptor Edward Bowring Stephens (1815-1882). The unveiling of the statue was accompanied by music that had been composed for the occasion, and sung by members of the Brighton Sacred Harmonic Society, the same group who had sung over his grave. Following the midday inauguration of the monument, there was an evening mayoral reception at the Brighton Dome. The statue was moved to its present location {{at the southern end}} of the southern enclosure of the Old Steine Gardens in 1984, when the Royal Pavilion <b>grounds</b> were <b>remodelled.</b> The Statue of Sir John Cordy Burrows was protected as a Grade II listed structure on 26 August 1999.|$|R
50|$|In 1989 SD Eibar {{promoted}} to Segunda División, but Ipurua {{was probably the}} most basic stadium in the division. Matters were {{complicated by the fact that}} the urban area of Eibar had spread westwards and severely restricted space to the north of the ground. The club received funding in 1998 from the local council and Liga de Fútbol Profesional and started a project to completely remodel Ipurua. In 1998, the original main stand was demolished and a new, full-length covered stand was constructed. This had a capacity of approximately 2,800, which would be over half of <b>remodelled</b> <b>grounds</b> capacity. In 1999, work started on refurbishing the end stands and in 2001, the narrow north terrace was roofed and 4 rows of seats were installed. Work was completed with the installation of a new drainage system and pitch.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th or early 19th century {{it was given}} a Flemish Bond brick face and the rear was {{extended}} with a catslide roof. A slate-roofed, single-level extension {{was added to the}} south prior to 1867. The front <b>ground</b> floor was <b>remodelled</b> sometime between 1900 and 1930, with a doorcase removed and a fascia and cornice added. Later in the 20th century, single-storey extensions were added to the north in the 1960s, and also to the rear (both with flat roofs) and the south, including a uPVC conservatory. The front of the building was also modelled, with a wider front door, fascia sign and plinth added across both the original frontage and the extensions, dividing the architectural features of the ground and first floors. A large amount of the pre-1840 fabric of the building, including first floor joinery, survives into the 21st century.|$|R

[...] As part of the renovation, the museum's facade was refreshed and the building's purpose made more prominent with a large light installation by Austrian artist Brigitte Kowanz of the word museum in Hebrew script. On the <b>ground</b> floor, the <b>remodeling</b> created a roomy and light foyer area and a spacious showroom hosting the [...] "Vienna. Jewish Museum. 21st Century" [...] permanent exhibition as well as the [...] "Nancy Spero - Installation of Memory" [...] murals. A big event space was created in the second floor and a small exhibition, [...] "From Aleph to Tav - From the beginning to the end", showcases the Jewish life cycle through museum items and everyday objects.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{is pressed}} red brick with Indiana Limestone courses {{above and below}} the second floor and above the fifth floor. Windows on the other floors have limestone sills. The southern (Galena Blvd.) elevation has ten windows per floor while the eastern (Broadway Ave.) elevation has four windows per floor. The east side originally had eight windows, but the 1906 and 1912 additions to {{the west side of the}} structure provided an additional two. Most floors have wood-framed double hung windows, while the sixth floor has arched windows. A decorative cornice adorns the top of the building with a dentil course. The cornice is mostly limestone, except for the area above the additions which is metal. A metal fire escape runs along two of the windows on the Galena Blvd. facade. The first floor was originally rusticated limestone before it was replaced with glass storefronts in 1937. The northern facade is blocked by an adjacent building on the first three floors. The remaining floors are undetailed brick, but do have double-hung windows matching the southern facade. There is also a faded paint advertisement on this side. Similarly, the western facade is blocked on the first two floors with windows and a faded painted sign. The <b>ground</b> floor was <b>remodeled</b> in 1966 to become a restaurant. The upper floors, which have hardwood floors, are accessed through a door on Broadway.|$|R
40|$|University {{teaching}} staff are employed {{because of their}} knowledge in their particular disciplines. Many {{do not have a}} qualification to teach at a higher education institution upon commencement of their academic career. In that group there are few who have the research experience required to assist at postgraduate level. This should be developed as one of the three core activities of higher education, in which they have to be involved. This study {{is the result of a}} problem that I encountered as a higher education practitioner. In keeping with my being a practitioner researcher within an action research paradigm, this report is written mainly in the first person. The study reports on how my personal theories grew over a period resulting in the need to constantly improve my own practice. These personal theories culminated in the development of an instrument (ADaM), to assess writing. ADaM was used primarily to facilitate reflection in post-graduate writing practice. In this study, there were three sets of workshops comprising 13 practical sessions each, where lecturers engaged with the process of reading, writing, computer-mediation and, to a limited extent, with the concept of mentorship. The purpose was to answer the research question: Can a writing assessment instrument be used to sensitise staff teaching post-graduates to reflect on the complex nature of producing and assessing academic writing? At two points during the 13 practical sessions, data was gathered through semistructured interviews. The data has been analysed using a form of grounded theory referred to as <b>remodeled</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. Since the analysis traversed both the quantitative and qualitative paradigms of research, it was necessary also to place the study within the third paradigm, referred to as mixed methods research. The analysis has been presented via a series of relationships generated first by open coding, then axial coding and concludes with selective coding. In addition, the comments of an independent coder were used to validate the analysis. In accordance with classic grounded theory, it was only after the analysis of the data and the emergence of a substantive theory that I referred to existing theory in the penultimate chapter as validation of my findings. The findings from the study, together with existing literature, allowed me to conclude that “Creating an awareness of writing assessment sensitises academics to their roles as HE practitioners particularly in the areas of writing and mentorship in post-graduate supervision...|$|R
