40|$|Fluorescein fundus {{photography}} is {{of value in}} the detection of early papilloedema (David, Heyman, and Hart, 1963; Miller, Saunders, and Ffytche, 1965). We have applied this technique to the serial study of patients with acute retrobulbar neuritis. This disorder is usually unilateral and the unaffected eye {{could be used as}} a control. Also, since papilloe-dema is not present at the onset of symptoms and the condition is self-limiting, it has been possible to follow in serial studies the evolution and resolu-tion of the disc oedema. Clinical papilloedema is detected in about half the patients with acute retrobulbar neuritis. Fluorescein photography might be expected to reveal abnormalities when there is no visible oph-thalmoscopic change and this has also been investi-gated. MATERUAL Ten patients were studied. They were unselected apart from having attended the hospital. They presented the characteristic clinical features of acute retrobulbar neuritis with pain, impaired visual acuity, and central scotoma. One patient developed a similar disturbance in the other eye while under observation. The age range was 20 to 47 years, with a mean of 29 years. There were seven females and three males. Three patients had clear evidence of associated disease of the nervous system indicating multiple sclerosis, and three others gave a history of neurological disturbance sugges-tive of demyelinating disease. The remaining four patients had no evidence of associated disease. METHOD Each patient was investigated after dilatation of the pupils with 5 % homatropine and 2 % cocaine. A Zeiss fundus camera with Zeiss-Siemens flash generator was used. Colour photographs of both discs were taken on Kodachrome II film at x 5 magnification.

40|$|Abstract. Filters between {{voltage source}} {{converter}} and the batteries in power {{system can be}} categorized into constant voltage source <b>excited</b> <b>filters.</b> The paper discusses {{the importance of the}} matched structure and parameters for power filters. The relation between matched structure and filter’s output characteristic is demonstrated and the design principle is introduced. The work above proved that even if the filters are designed for the same transfer function, so long as filter’s load resistance is different, their designed parameters are also different. Traditional power system filter seldom consider its both ends load matching characteristic. When the difference between filter's load characteristic and practical system equivalent impedance are large, the actual filtering effect becomes worse, current loss arises and even there may be the possibility of resonance. As the lack of energy resource and energy crisis is gradually becoming a serious problem, energy conservation is important. Constant voltage source excited circuit configuration model is established through the simulation and test.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} probability density functions of general transformations of random processes is considered in this thesis. A method of solution is developed in which partial differential equations satisfied by the unknown density function are derived. These partial differential equations are interpreted as generalized {{forms of the}} classical Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations and are shown to imply the classical equations for certain classes of Markov processes. Extensions of the generalized equations which overcome degeneracy occurring in the steady-state case are also obtained. The equations of Darling and Siegert are derived as special cases of the generalized equations thereby providing unity to two previously existing theories. A technique for treating non-Markov processes by studying closely related Markov processes is proposed and is seen to yield the Darling and Siegert equations directly from the classical Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations. As illustrations of their applicability, the generalized Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations are presented for certain joint probability density functions associated with the linear filter.

This manner of representing excitation requires that speech segments be classified accurately into voiced and unvoiced categories and the pitch period of voiced segments be known. it is now well recognised that such a rigid idealization of the vocal excitation Li often responsible for the unna-tural qualizy a. ssock#ed with synthesized speech. This paper describes {{a new approach to}} the excitation problem that does not require a priori knowledge of either the voiced-unvoiced decision or the pitch period. All classes of sounds are generated by <b>exciting</b> the LPC <b>filter</b> with a sequence of pulses; the amplitudes and locations of the pulses are determined using a non-iterative analysis-by-synthesis procedure. This procedure minimizes a perceptual-distance metric representing subjectively-important differences between the waveforms of the origi-nal and the synthetic speech signals. The disiance metric takes account of the finite-frequency resolution as well as the ditTerential sensitivity of the human ear to errors in the formant and inter-formant regions of the speech spectrum...|$|R
