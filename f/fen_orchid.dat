5000|$|Catfield fen {{also has}} {{important}} populations of many rare plants, of particular note are the <b>fen</b> <b>orchid,</b> the round leaved wintergreen, crested buckler fern and milk parsley. The latter being the foodplant of the Swallowtail butterfly.|$|E
50|$|Liparis loeselii, {{common names}} <b>fen</b> <b>orchid,</b> yellow widelip orchid, or bog twayblade, is {{a species of}} orchid. It is native to Europe, {{northern}} Asia, the eastern United States and eastern Canada. It grows in fens, bogs and dune slacks. It is a yellow flowering plant with glossy yellow-green leaves.|$|E
5000|$|The site {{supports}} a [...] "very {{large number of}} plant species" [...] on the wetter fen areas. Dominant species tend to be black bog rush Schoenus nigricans, saw sedge Cladium mariscus and purple moor grass Molinia caerulea, with species such as <b>fen</b> <b>orchid</b> Dactylorchis praetermissa, devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis, long-stalked yellow sedge Carex lepidocarpa, quaking grass Briza media, parnassus Parnassia palustris {{and a number of}} rare mosses also found in these areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} serves to protect an old-growth forest and a rich fen. The ancient forest is {{dominated}} by spruce and Scots pine, with birch, rowan and aspen growing in glades. The great amount of coarse woody debris creates good habitats for many species of fungi, such as Phellinidium ferrugineofuscum, Phlebia mellea and Fomitopsis rosea. The nature reserve {{also serves as a}} refuge for birds like black woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. In the rich <b>fen,</b> <b>orchids</b> like fragrant orchid, Dactylorhiza maculata ssp. fuchsii and Listera cordata grow.|$|R
50|$|Garner <b>Orchid</b> <b>Fen</b> Natural Area is an {{extension}} of the park.|$|R
5000|$|Cors Bodeilio, near Talwrn, is a {{national}} nature reserve and wetland of international importance. It is a mire in a shallow limestone valley, where fen species prosper. The site contains uncommon species, including <b>fen</b> pondweed, <b>orchids,</b> curlews, lapwings and snipes. [...] Cors Erddreiniog, also {{a national}} nature reserve and located north east of Tregaian, {{has been described as}} the [...] "Jewel in the crown of the Anglesey fens" [...] and is home to the bog myrtle, marsh gentian, southern damselfly and hen harrier.|$|R
50|$|Other orchids {{that are}} to be found in Rospuda Valley include: the western marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza majalis), lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus), early coralroot (Corallorrhiza trifida), the common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), Pugsley's marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza traunsteineri), marsh helleborine (Epipactis palustris), <b>fen</b> <b>orchid</b> (Liparis loeselii). In Rospuda Valley there are also other rare and {{protected}} plants including: dwarf birch (Betula humilis), Greek valerian (Polemonium caeruleum), English sundew (Drosera anglica), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), Turk's cap lily (Lilium martagon) etc.|$|E
5000|$|The undeveloped {{salt marsh}} area {{south of the}} Fabian Way and north Jersey Marine Beach is a {{designated}} biological Site of Special Scientific Interest {{and is one of}} the last remaining places of the Swansea Bay coastline that has remained unmodified by industrial development. The area contains sand dunes, a salt marsh and carr woodland. The burrows also contain a rare orchid - the <b>Fen</b> <b>Orchid,</b> Liparis loeselii. [...] The 1000 acre site was acquired by St. Modwen from BP in November 2009 and will be kept as a protected leisure destination.|$|E
50|$|On the coast, a great {{diversity}} of {{species such as}} seals, dolphins, sharks, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters can be found. There are also seabird colonies on the islands near the coast. Species {{which can only be}} found in Wales are the Radnor lily, spotted rock-rose and a type of fish, the gwyniad, only found in Lake Bala. The rare <b>fen</b> <b>orchid</b> (Liparis loeselii) {{is one of the most}} threatened species in northwestern Europe and has vanished from many places in Wales. The Welsh Government funds Natural Resources Wales (NRW), Plantlife, Bridgend County Borough Council and the Wales Biodiversity Partnership coastal ecosystem group to help reconstruct its natural habitat and secure the future of this threatened species.|$|E
50|$|The area of {{sand dunes}} and the pool at Kenfig are managed by Bridgend County Borough Council as Kenfig Pool National Nature Reserve, the area {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The reserve has a visitor and interpretation centre, {{and a car}} park. The dunes are home {{to a variety of}} rare and endangered species of plants and animals, including a high concentration of <b>fen</b> <b>orchid</b> (or Liparis loeselii). It makes up part of the largest active sand dune system in Europe. The current village, built further inland, is a continuation of the mediaeval one. Landmarks include ruins of Kenfig Castle, and a natural pool which attracts birdwatchers. It {{is one of the few}} places in Britain where the bittern can be seen during the winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} lies close to Sandemar Castle and the {{landscape}} is characterised by having {{been part of the}} manorial estate for a long time. The area is considered {{to be one of the}} foremost examples in Stockholm County of such a landscape. It includes coastal meadows rich in bird-life and a rich fen situated in the eastern part of the reserve. The fen is regularly tended to in order to preserve its special flora and fauna, which includes early marsh orchid, <b>fen</b> <b>orchid,</b> marsh helleborine and the carnivorous common butterwort. The coastal meadows contain stands of elder-flowered orchid and Fritillaria meleagris, and the flat meadows and shallow water is also an important habitat for birds. For the convenience of visitors, a bird watching tower has been built not far from the water's edge. The nature reserve is part of the EU-wide Natura 2000-network.|$|E
40|$|Gene {{flow and}} {{adaptive}} divergence are {{key aspects of}} metapopulation dynamics and ecological speciation. Long-distance dispersal is hard to detect and few studies estimate dispersal in combination with adaptive divergence. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate effective long-distance dispersal and adaptive divergence in the <b>fen</b> <b>orchid</b> (Liparis loeselii (L.) Rich.). We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) -based assignment tests to quantify effective long-distance dispersal at two different regions in Northwest Europe. In addition, genomic divergence between <b>fen</b> <b>orchid</b> populations occupying two distinguishable habitats, wet dune slacks and alkaline fens, was investigated by a genome scan approach at different spatial scales (continental, landscape and regional) and based on 451 AFLP loci...|$|E
40|$|Coastal dune slack {{wetlands}} {{exist at}} {{the interface between}} land and sea. They typically occur in the low-lying areas between dune ridges where the water table remains {{at or near the}} ground surface for {{some or all of the}} year. Like many wetland habitats, the hydro-ecological conditions provide a niche in which specially adapted species can exist. Notable dune slack species with European protection include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the <b>fen</b> <b>orchid</b> (Liparis loeselii). Dune systems are amongst the most dynamic of all habitats and dune wetlands can appear or disappear in timescales comparable to human lifespans as coastal processes deposit or erode the substrates upon which they form. It is these dynamic processes that create areas of bare sand suitable for development of early successional stages of dune vegetation whilst elsewhere in the dune system natural succession drives a progression towards more mature vegetation. Over time, anthropogenic pressures including afforestation, abstraction and addition of nutrients have resulted in a decline in the quality and extent of dune habitat such that the majority of humid dune slacks across Europe are now in unfavourable condition. Management to address these pressures and improve dune habitats is underway in many countries however the complex mix of natural and anthropogenic processes that influence dune wetlands is at times difficult to disentangle making it hard to identify the most suitable management practices at particular sites. Up to now effective management of these habitats has not been supported by a coordinated presentation of the relevant research. The establishment of multidisciplinary groups such as the UK Sand Dune and Shingle Network has proved effective in bringing together the range of expertise necessary to affect change. This special issue is the result of the second meeting of the network’s Sand Dune Hydrology Group which was held in Swansea in September 2013 with the intention of supporting effective habitat management through sound science...|$|E
