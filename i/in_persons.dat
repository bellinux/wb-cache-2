5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E

5|$|Mephedrone may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry {{to confirm}} {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalised patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma mephedrone concentrations {{are expected to be}} in a range of 50–100 μg/l <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/l in intoxicated patients and >500 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage.|$|E
5|$|Metformin may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning, or assist in a forensic death investigation. Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 1–4mg/l <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> receiving therapeutic doses, 40–120mg/l in victims of acute overdosage, and 80–200mg/l in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, {{men who have sex}} with men, and following disasters.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam may be {{quantified}} in blood or plasma to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma alprazolam concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 10–100 μg/L <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–300 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300–2000 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitation is usually performed using chromatographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the National Cancer Institute {{undertook}} a large study, using cancer case {{information from the}} Institute's SEER database. The published findings from the study revealed {{that there was no}} increased incidence of cancer <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> who may have received vaccine containing SV40. Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not. The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala City, Guatemalan trafficker Efrain Ortiz {{is shown}} being arrested, {{and the film}} {{indicates}} that he was later given a prison sentence of 95 years. Ortiz had two sons he had been using for waste collection and five daughters he had been committing incest with. Bilheimer accompanies IJM representatives Pablo Villeda, Amy Roth, and Gary Haugen as they and the local police arrest Ortiz; he is charged with exploitation of children and violence against women. Ortiz looks surprised as he is handcuffed. Haugen, President of IJM, went on to be named a Trafficking <b>in</b> <b>Persons</b> (TIP) Hero in the 2012 US DoS TIP Report.|$|E

5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{spent more}} than $6 million on actions related to the NAP-CHT in 2013. In September of that year, Kellie Leitch, Minister responsible for the Status of Women and Minister of Labour, announced {{that the government would}} give the Women's Support Network of York Region $200,000 to initiate a project aimed at eradicating human trafficking in the Regional Municipality of York, and she appealed to the NAP-CHT when making the announcement. In February 2013, the Toronto City Council decided to coordinate its anti-human-trafficking efforts with the NAP-CHT. That May, during a meeting of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly at United Nations Headquarters in New York City that was convened to discuss the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking <b>in</b> <b>Persons,</b> the Canadian delegation spoke about the NAP-CHT.|$|E
