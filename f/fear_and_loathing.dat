5000|$|A shameless inflater of a peril {{that was}} no peril at all (the Yellow Peril) into an absurd global conspiracy.He had not even the excuse (if [...] "excuse" [...] is the word) of his {{predecessor}} in this shabby lie, M.P. Shiel, who was a vigorous racist, sometimes exhibiting a hatred and horror of Jews and Far Eastern races. Rohmer's own racism was careless and casual, a mere symptom of the times. But he recognized other people's <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> <b>loathings,</b> <b>and</b> tapped directly into them with his saga of the fiendish, and seemingly deathless, Dr. Fu Manchu, whose millions of minions were ever biding their time, awaiting the order to inundate and subjugate the Western white races, and particularly the British Isles. Even more particularly, London, for {{at the heart of}} the Empire the teeming hordes of [...] "heathen Chinese" [...] swarmed like hyperactive rats around Limehouse Reach and Wapping Old Stairs, poised to flood the capital, turn its citizens into opium or cocaine addicts, and carry off the flower of British maidenhood to the stews of Shanghai.This nonsense was believed more or less seriously by just about all classes, even though, as the sociologist Virginia Berridge has determined, the ethnic Chinese population of the Limehouse area - indeed, the whole of London's East End - in the period 1900 through to the Second World War ran to a few hundred at most, the majority of whom were engaged in respectable professions such as cooking and laundering (clothes, not money). As for narcotics, this was, notably, the province of [...] "black" [...] immigrants rather than [...] "yellow" [...] (the well-heeded Chinese restaurant-owner Brilliant Chang notwithstanding) most of the actual drugs were coming from Germany, where cocaine production was virtually unregulated. And, so far as white slavery went, it was to Buenos Aires that most of the young girls travelled (dancers, usually lured by spurious advertisements in The Stage).Nevertheless, with Fu Manchu and his strange cohorts and even more bizarre [...] "pets" [...] (monstrous spiders, lizards, hamadryads, batrachians unknown to science, murderous lepidopterae, Venus fly-traps capable of digesting a man) Rohmer accomplished what all writers of popular fiction yearn for, but rarely achieve - the creation of a character who transcends mere popularity and becomes an entry in the dictionary.|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Animal House {{received}} mixed reviews from critics but several immediately recognized its appeal, and it has since been {{recognized as one of the}} best films of 1978. The film holds a 91% positive rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Its consensus states [...] "The talents of director John Landis and Saturday Night Lives irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, [...] "It's anarchic, messy, and filled with energy. It assaults us. Part of the movie's impact comes from its sheer level of manic energy. ... But the movie's better made (and better acted) than we might at first realize. It takes skill to create this sort of comic pitch, and the movie's filled with characters that are sketched a little more absorbingly than they had to be, and acted with perception". Ebert later placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978, the only National Lampoon film to have received this honor. In his review for Time, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "At its best it perfectly expresses the <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> <b>loathings</b> of kids who came of age in the late '60s; at its worst Animal House revels in abject silliness. The hilarious highs easily compensate for the puerile lows". Gary Arnold wrote in his review for The Washington Post, [...] "Belushi also controls a wicked array of conspiratorial expressions with the audience. ... He can seem irresistibly funny in repose or invest minor slapstick opportunities with a streak of genius". David Ansen wrote in Newsweek, [...] "But if Animal House lacks the inspired tastelessness of the Lampoon's High School Yearbook Parody, this is still low humor of a high order". Robert Martin wrote in The Globe and Mail, [...] "It is so gross and tasteless you feel you should be disgusted but it's hard to be offended by something that is so sidesplittingly funny". Time magazine proclaimed Animal House one of the year's best.|$|R

A Boston Globe review called it a [...] "dazzlingly inventive collection" [...] and added [...] "In Gwyn's expert hands, nothing, including good or evil, is ever so simple, and that's what makes this collection - part Flannery O'Connor, part Shirley Jackson, and wholly original - so brilliantly compelling." [...] A review of the book in the Star-News compared Gwyn's style with that of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver.|$|R

5000|$|At independence, Namibia was gravely divided as {{a result}} of a century of colonialism, dispossession, and racial discrimination, {{compounded}} by armed struggle and propaganda. For instance, SWAPO had been so demonised by the colonial media and by official pronouncements that most white people, as well as many members of other groups, regarded the movement with the deepest <b>fear,</b> <b>loathing,</b> <b>and</b> suspicion. One of Nujoma's earliest achievements was to proclaim the policy of [...] "national reconciliation", which aimed to improve and harmonise relations amongst Namibia's various racial and ethnic groups. Under his presidency, Namibia made steady if unspectacular economic progress, maintained a democratic system with respect for human rights, observed the rule of law, and worked steadily to eradicate the heritage of apartheid in the interests of developing a non-racial society. Nujoma successfully united all Namibians into a peaceful, tolerant and democratic society governed by the rule of law.|$|R

Loyalist C 18 are coming to beat you like a baiting bear,’ 2 read the headlines as they repeated a text circulated widely through social media. McVeigh (2009) argues that the media narrative about the experiences of Roma remains uncontested and consistent; I further suggest that such a discourse circulated in the media locates Roma as problematic and is visible in education contexts where practitioners engage with Roma young people...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the real mother tongues of Singapore, namely the Chinese 'dialects' and Singlish, the linguistic varieties which, respectively, arrived {{with the original}} immigrants to the rapidly developing British colony, and evolved in the dynamic multilingual ecology over the decades. Curiously these mother tongues have been regarded with <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> treated with <b>loathing</b> in the official language policies and accompanying prestige planning {{that have been developed}} and executed in Singapore since independence, being actively denigrated and discouraged in official discourse, viewed as not having a place in the globalization goals of the nation. Looking beyond the official line and census figures, actual linguistic practices of the community of speakers testify to the vitality of these varieties, in spite of the official sanctions; moreover, in spite of itself, the government does in fact allow itself the use of these mother tongues when certain contexts call for it. This paper suggests that an enlightened consideration of native 'dialects' and nativized Singlish and the plurilingual practices in which they are used, {{as well as of the}} question of intelligibility, must point policy makers in directions where <b>fears</b> are assuaged <b>and</b> spaces made for the natural existence and evolution of such varieties in multilingual ecologies. © John Benjamins Publishing Company. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
