5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental <b>floss</b> removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E
40|$|Canonical {{correlation}} {{analyses of}} a previous dental survey suggested that dental checkups, <b>flossing,</b> and tooth brushing could all be predicted from a single equation. Most theories and research {{about the influence of}} beliefs on behavior, however, suggest different behaviors will be best predicted by different behavior-specific measures. The current survey investigated influences on brushing, <b>flossing,</b> and dental checkups in a probability sample of adults in the Detroit tri-county area. Both behavior-specific variables, such as perceived benefits and costs of <b>flossing,</b> and general variables, such as gender, were included as predictors. Canonical correlation analysis indicated three equations were needed to predict the three oral health behaviors. <b>Flossing</b> frequency, for example, was best predicted by confidence in <b>flossing</b> ability and beliefs about the benefits of and barriers to <b>flossing.</b> The results suggest that even these closely related behaviors are best predicted using separate equations that include mostly behavior-specific predictors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Despite {{a long history}} of research on determinants of future behaviour in social and health psychology, promotion and maintenance of positive future behaviours still proves to be difficult. Moreover, research in this area is seldom conducted using a culture comparative approach, thus generalisability of the accumulated knowledge to different cultural groups is virtually unknown. This project will examine the effectiveness of different visual perspectives when considering a future positive dental health behaviour - <b>flossing.</b> Specifically, it will investigate the role of using one's own visual perspective or an observer's visual perspective when imagining oneself engaging or failing to engage in <b>flossing.</b> Participants will be of White British and East Asian ethnic origin to allow a comparative approach. Based on previous research with these two cultural groups, it is hypothesised that the strongest effects for collectivistic East Asians will be observed when an observer's perspective is applied to imagining not engaging in <b>flossing,</b> and the strongest effect for individualistic White British respondents will be observed when an observer's perspective is applied to imagining engaging in <b>flossing.</b> The project will test these hypotheses by manipulating the perspective and the content of visual imagery in relation to <b>flossing</b> and measuring subsequent <b>flossing</b> behavior...|$|R
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental <b>floss</b> in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E

Roo schemes to get Frank to sleep with her and Alf to catch them in bed together. Alf sacks Frank, but Ailsa employs him instead. Roo later announces that she is pregnant by Frank, and Alf believes her as he caught them having sex. Frank then agrees to marry Roo. <b>Floss</b> McPhee (Sheila Kennelly) has a vision that Bobby causes a car crash which kills Frank. When he buys a car with a similar registration number, Bobby vandalises it. Tom then buys him a new vehicle with another similar registration. Bobby warns Frank that Roo is using him but he refuses to listen. On his wedding day, Pippa convinces Frank not to drive his car because of Floss' vision. When he turns up to the ceremony, Roo changes her mind about marrying Frank and reveals that the baby is not his. Frank speeds off in his car and crashes off the road to avoid knocking Bobby down. He survives the accident and Bobby tells Frank that she loves him. He tells her that while he has no intention of reconciling with Roo, he still loves her.|$|E

40|$|Background Periodontal {{disease is}} a {{significant}} public health issue worldwide. Motivational techniques in combination with financial incentives are shown to lead to effective behavior change. The current study sought to examine whether a brief oral health promotion program (self-management cues that were based on self-efficacy and self-regulatory skills) in combination with an incentive (free dental treatment) {{would make a difference}} in the adoption of regular dental <b>flossing</b> in a population of Indian periodontal disease outpatients. Methods One hundred and twelve participants (n[*]=[*] 55 oral health promotion intervention group; n[*]=[*] 57 control group) were assigned to the intervention (self-management cues[*]+[*]incentive) or control groups, and follow-up assessments were performed three weeks later. <b>Flossing</b> frequency, behavioral intentions, and perceived self-efficacy served as dependent variables. Data were analyzed with mixed models, ANCOVAs, and path analyses. Results The intervention yielded effects on <b>flossing</b> frequency (p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01) and <b>flossing</b> intentions (p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01) at follow-up. Women developed stronger intentions than men. Moreover, by path analysis a sequential mediation chain was found that demonstrated an indirect effect of the intervention on <b>flossing</b> via self-efficacy and intentions: the intervention predicted changes in self-efficacy which, in turn, were associated with changes in intentions, predicting <b>flossing</b> frequency at follow up, while controlling for baseline behavior, gender, and age. Conclusions Combining incentives with minimal self-management cues has been found effective in improving interdental cleaning intentions and habits in periodontal disease patients, and the facilitating role of dental self-efficacy has been demonstrated...|$|R

25|$|In {{studying}} coin flipping, {{to observe}} the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, {{so that when the}} speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side.

40|$|Objectives: This {{investigation}} examined {{current practices}} of brushing, <b>flossing,</b> and periodic dental visits and {{their association with}} periodontal health status. Methods : Data were collected using face-to-face interviews and 40 -minute in-home dental examinations with a probability sample of adults 18 {{years of age or}} older, having at least one tooth, and living in housing units in the Detroit tricounty area. Complete examinations were performed on 319 individuals. Results : On average, subjects reported brushing their teeth about twice a day. About one-third of the population reported <b>flossing</b> at least once a day. Loss of periodontal attachment was related to frequency of brushing while subjects who exhibited acceptable <b>flossing</b> ability had less plaque and calculus, shallower pocket depths, and less attachment loss. Subjects reporting a periodic dental visit {{at least once a year}} had less plaque, gingivitis, and calculus than subjects reporting less frequent visits. In regression analyses, brushing thoroughness, <b>flossing</b> ability and frequency, and dental visit frequency were predictors of lower plaque, gingivitis, and calculus scores. In turn, these scores were predictors of shallower pocket depths and less attachment loss. Conclusions : Brushing, <b>flossing,</b> and periodic dental visits were correlated with better periodontal health. The behaviors appeared to be indirectly related to pocket depth and attachment loss through their associations with plaque, gingivitis, and calculus levels...|$|R
50|$|These {{processes}} will persist, causing greater damage, {{until the}} infectious bacterial agents (plaque) and local irritating factors (calculus) are removed. In order to effectively remove these {{at this stage}} in the disease process, brushing and <b>flossing</b> are no longer sufficient. This is due to several factors, the most important to note being the depth of the periodontal pocket. Brushing and <b>flossing</b> are effective only at removing the soft materia alba and biofilm in supragingival areas, and in pockets up to 3 mm deep. Even the best brushing and <b>flossing</b> is ineffective at cleaning pockets of greater depths, and are never effective in removing calculus. Therefore, in order to remove the causative factors that lead to periodontal disease, pocket depth scaling and root planing procedures are often recommended.|$|R
