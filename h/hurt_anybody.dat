500|$|Chandler's {{strategy}} in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could react to it, to launch a new one. He claimed Wetherby had used the state's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the state capitol and installing a $20,000 rug in his office. (An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire {{first floor of the}} capitol had cost one-tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said [...] "didn't <b>hurt</b> <b>anybody,</b> and people liked to hear it".) After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African mahogany paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone [...] "clear to Africa" [...] to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting Elizabethtown and Louisville, the state fairgrounds, and Freedom Hall as unnecessary.|$|E

Rockstar also released exclusive merchandise, limited editions and pre-order bonuses such as official soundtracks, a Piggsy figure, and a handheld voice changer. During {{the release of the}} first game, a former Rockstar employee admitted that the game almost caused a mutiny in the company, saying that the team [...] had [...] "already weathered plenty of controversy over GTA III and —we were no strangers to it—but Manhunt felt different. With GTA, we always had the excuse that the gameplay was untethered—you never had to <b>hurt</b> <b>anybody</b> that wasn't a [...] "bad guy" [...] in one of the missions. You could play completely ethically if you wanted, and the game was parody anyway, so lighten up". The game became available through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on May 14, 2013, and for the PlayStation 4 on March 22, 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Consistently {{cited as}} one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renown for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the {{opposition}} prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with {{his fingers through his}} face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking the ball into the end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was as the rumors suggested, he replied, [...] "I'm not so mean. I wouldn't ever go out to <b>hurt</b> <b>anybody</b> deliberately. Unless it was, you know, important—like a league game or something." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the key}} {{witnesses}} to testify {{on behalf of the}} prosecution was the Reverend Elizabeth Cobbs—Chambliss's own niece. Reverend Cobbs stated that her uncle had repeatedly informed her he had been engaged in what he referred to as a [...] "one-man battle" [...] against blacks since the 1940s. Moreover, Cobbs testified on November 16 that, on the day before the bombing, Chambliss had informed her he had in his possession enough dynamite to [...] "flatten half of Birmingham". Cobbs also testified that, approximately one week after the bombing, she had observed Chambliss watching a news article relating to the four girls killed in the bombing. According to Cobbs, Chambliss had informed her: [...] "It [...] wasn't meant to <b>hurt</b> <b>anybody</b> ... it didn't go off when it was supposed to." [...] Another witness to testify was a man named William Jackson, who testified as to his joining the Ku Klux Klan in 1963 and his becoming acquainted with Chambliss shortly thereafter. Jackson testified that Chambliss had expressed frustration as to his (Chambliss's) belief that the Klan was [...] "dragging its feet" [...] on the issue of racial integration, and of his eagerness to form a more virulent splinter group.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name is curious; it is not from the German Eidegenossen as has been supposed. Reguier de la Plancha {{accounts}} for it as follows: — [...] "The name huguenand was given {{to those of the}} religion during the affair of Amboyse, and they were to retail it ever since. I'll say a word about it to settle the doubts of those who have strayed in seeking its origin. The superstition of our ancestors, to within twenty or thirty years thereabouts, was such that in almost all the towns in the kingdom they had a notion that certain spirits underwent their Purgatory in this world after death, and that they went about the town at night, striking and outraging many people whom they found in the streets. But the light of the Gospel has made them vanish, and teaches us that these spirits were street-strollers and ruffians. In Paris the spirit was called le moine bourré; at Orleans, le mulet odet; at Blois le loup garon; at Tours, le Roy Huguet; and so on in other places. Now, it happens that those whom they called Lutherans were at that time so narrowly watched during the day that they were forced to wait till night to assemble, for the purpose of praying God, for preaching and receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that although they did not frighten nor <b>hurt</b> <b>anybody,</b> the priests, through mockery, made them the successors of those spirits which roam the night; and thus that name being quite common in the mouth of the populace, to designate the evangelical huguenands in the country of Tourraine and Amboyse, it became in vogue after that enterprise." ...|$|E
