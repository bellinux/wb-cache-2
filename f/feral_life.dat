2500|$|His early years: Gesar's {{mission as}} a divine {{emissary}} is to vanquish powerful demons on earth. Until his adolescence he {{is depicted as}} black, ugly, nasty, snotty and troublesome. His paternal uncle, or the king's brother Todong, banishes both son and mother to the rMa plateau, where he grows up living a <b>feral</b> <b>life,</b> with the child clothed in animal skins and wearing a hat with antelope horns. He comes first in a horserace whose trophy consists of the kingship of Ling. His victory marks his coming of age; as consecrated king, he proclaims himself [...] "the Great Lion, Wish-fulfilling Jewel, Subduer of Foes". He also assumes the name Gesar. Mounted on his miraculous steed Kyang Go Karkar, he subsequently wages military campaigns, together with 30 companions, against the frontier countries that represent evil.|$|E
60|$|It is {{probable}} that, but for powder and shot, the domestic goose of Europe, by occasionally taking to a <b>feral</b> <b>life</b> in thinly-settled countries, would ere this have become widely distributed over the earth.|$|E
60|$|In {{due time}} {{settlements}} were made; but the colonists {{of those days}} loved gold and adventure above everything, and, finding neither in the Banda, they little esteemed it. For two centuries it was neglected by its white possessors, while the cattle they had imported continued to multiply, and, returning to a <b>feral</b> <b>life,</b> overran the country in amazing numbers.|$|E
50|$|In the end, {{the team}} regrouped. With Feral dead, {{it was then}} speculated by Wolfsbane that the sisters were still base-line humans. Only their outward {{appearances}} had been changed back to their once feline forms. Wolverine agreed, as it explained why she would have lost so easily. It would appear that Romulus only reverted their physical forms back to their previous mutant forms, without actually granting them their mutant powers. <b>Feral's</b> <b>life</b> would come full circle; she was murdered cold-blooded by a feral mutant in a berserker state as she in a similar state did too much of her family in her youth, many years prior.|$|R

5000|$|Pauline Forster {{was born}} in Carlisle 1949, the Lake District, {{daughter}} of Jack Forster and Meg Arbury, the fourth of six siblings. They lived a <b>feral,</b> poverty stricken <b>life</b> until Pauline was 9 when they moved to Gloucestershire. Enterprising {{from an early age}} Pauline had her first market stall at 6.|$|R
60|$|Altogether, Don Anastacio in his ringlets was an ineffectual, colourless, effeminate person, {{a perfect}} {{contrast}} to his ugly, barrel- shaped, badly-dressed but robust-minded neighbour, Gandara. Yet he too had a taste in animals which distinguished him among his fellow- landowners, and even reminded one of Gandara in a ridiculous way. For just as Gandara was devoted to piebald horses, so Don Anastacio was devoted to pigs. It {{would not have been}} like him if these had been pigs for profit: they were not animals fit to be fattened for the market, and no person would have thought of buying such beasts. They were of the wild-pig breed, descended originally from the European animal introduced by the early Spanish colonists, but after two or three centuries of <b>feral</b> <b>life</b> a good deal changed in appearance from their progenitors. This feral pig was called barraco in the vernacular, and was about a third less in size than the domestic animal, with longer legs and more pointed face, and of a uniform deep rust-red in colour. Among hundreds I never saw one with any black or white on it.|$|E
50|$|The breed {{characteristics}} of Ossabaw Island hogs in both phenotype and genotype have {{been shaped by}} the pressures of <b>feral</b> <b>life</b> in an island habitat. They are small swine, less than 20 in tall and weighing less than 200 lb at maturity. This size {{is partly due to}} the phenomenon of insular dwarfism, and individuals kept in off-island farms may grow slightly larger in successive generations. They are also hardy and very good foragers, making them useful in extensive farming (as opposed to intensive pig farming).|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} {{development for}} Titus is his brief {{meeting with his}} [...] "foster sister" [...] a feral girl known only as 'The Thing', the daughter of Titus' wet-nurse Keda of the Bright Carvers. The Thing, being an illegitimate child, is exiled by the Carvers and lives a <b>feral</b> <b>life</b> in the forests around Gormenghast. Titus first meets her when he escapes from the confines of Gormenghast into the outside world. Titus is entranced by her wild grace, and sets out to meet her. He does so, and holds her briefly, but she flees him and is fatally struck by lightning. However, her fierce independence inspires Titus, and gives him courage to later leave his home.|$|E
500|$|Another theme found {{throughout}} {{the book is the}} hardship of life in the wild. Reviews have note how the story does not cover up the hardships of Clan life. School Library Journal commented on how the story describes the hardships and difficulties of a <b>feral</b> cat's <b>life</b> in detail and how there is no sugarcoating of the violence. Fantasy Book Review also wrote [...] "Erin Hunter does not spare the reader from the grim realities of living in the wild". Kirkus Reviews noted that doing so shows how the Clans are on the brink of survival.|$|R
5|$|A Japanese {{version was}} {{released}} for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 on 3 March 2016. <b>Feral</b> Interactive ported <b>Life</b> Is Strange for OS X, released on 16 June 2016, and Linux, released on 21 July 2016. That same day, {{the first episode}} was made indefinitely available for free on Linux, Windows, OS X, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Life Is Strange was included on PlayStation Plus {{for the month of}} June 2017, along with Killing Floor 2.|$|R
50|$|During those years, ISAR {{has tried}} to close zoos (Do Not Sanction the Existence of Zoos (Part I), Do Not Sanction the Existence of Zoos (Part II), petitioned against {{simulated}} abuse of animals (Campaign to End Simulated Abuse of Animals in Entertainment and Product Sales), opposed the shooting of <b>feral</b> cats (Outdoor <b>Life</b> or Outdoor Death), condemned celebrities who were cruel to animals (Celebrities and Animal Abuse). ISAR and other organizations succeeded in obtaining the issuance of a United States spay/neuter postage stamp and have fought for a similar United Nations stamp (Campaign for a U.N. Spay/Neuter Postage Stamp).|$|R

5000|$|Goats readily {{revert to}} the wild (become feral) if given the opportunity. The only {{domestic}} animal known to return to <b>feral</b> <b>life</b> as swiftly is the cat. [...] Feral goats have established themselves in many areas: they occur in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, the Galapagos and in many other places. When feral goats reach large populations in habitats which provide unlimited water supply and which do not contain sufficient large predators or which are otherwise vulnerable to goats' aggressive grazing habits, they may have serious effects, such as removing native scrub, trees and other vegetation which is required by {{a wide range of}} other creatures, not just other grazing or browsing animals. Feral goats are common in Australia. However, in other circumstances where predator pressure is maintained, they may be accommodated into some balance in the local food web.|$|E
5000|$|Clandestinos is a 2007 Spanish film {{directed}} by Antonio Hens {{about a young}} gay male coming out of jail, {{and the search for}} his boyfriend and later involvement in ETA. Xabi was abandoned as a child and his <b>feral</b> <b>life</b> led to many spells in reform schools. After being released this time, he meets Inaki, an older man who is involved in ETA terrorism and who becomes a true friend, teacher and lover to the youth. Unfortunately, Xabi is sent to a high security correctional facility after throwing a gasoline bottle at a policeman during a robbery, injuring him severely. Xabi, along with a young Mexican and a Moroccan named Driss, both of whom are to be deported, manage to escape and get to Madrid. They are the [...] "clandestinos" [...] of the title. Xabi looks for Inaki as he wants to join ETA, but cannot find him.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{characteristics}} of the Comet type {{are said to be}} shown in the Kaimanawa horses today, although the varied gene input has produced a wide range of sizes, colours, and body types among the wild horses. The Kaimanawa breed varies widely in general appearance, with heights ranging between [...] high. Any coat colour or pattern marking is acceptable. They are usually well-muscled. Their <b>feral</b> way of <b>life</b> has given them the ability to adapt quickly and live on very little, and they are usually sure-footed and tough. They have a medium-sized head in good proportion to their body, with wide variation in shape due to the different conformation of their ancestors. Kaimanawa horses have a short, deep neck with a thick throat area, straight shoulders, a deep girth, and a short to medium back. The hindquarters vary from sloping to well-rounded. The legs are long and well-muscled, with strong hooves, and hind hooves that are generally smaller than the front ones. All horses are considered to age a year on the first of August, regardless of their actual foaling date.|$|R

40|$|Sheep {{are thought}} to {{have been one of the}} first {{livestock}} to be domesticated in the Near East, thus playing an important role in human history. The current whole mitochondrial genome phylogeny for the genus Ovis is based on: the five main domestic haplogroups occurring among sheep (O. aries), along with molecular data from two wild European mou-flons, three urials, and one argali. With the aim to shed some further light on the phyloge-netic relationship within this genus, the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a Cypriot mouflon (O. gmelini ophion) is here reported. Phylogenetic analyses were per-formed using a dataset of wholeOvismitogenomes as well as D-loop sequences. The concatenated sequence of 28 mitochondrial genes of one Cypriot mouflon, and the D-loop sequence of three Cypriot mouflons were compared to sequences obtained from samples representatives of the five domestic sheep haplogroups along with samples of the extant wild and feral sheep.

The sample included also individuals from the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica hosting remnants of the first wave of domestication that likely went then back to <b>feral</b> <b>life.</b> The divergence time between branches in the phylogenetic tree has been calculated using seven different calibration points by means of Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood inferences. Results suggest that urial (O. vignei) and argali (O. ammon) diverged from domestic sheep about 0. 89 and 1. 11 million years ago (MYA), respectively; and dates the earliest radiation of domestic sheep common ancestor at around 0. 3 MYA. Additionally, our data suggest that the rise of the modern sheep haplogroups happened in the span of time between six and 32 thousand years ago (KYA). A close phylogenetic relationship between the Cypriot and the Anatolian mouflon carrying the X haplotype was detected. The genetic distance between this group and the other ovine haplogroups supports the hypothesis that it may be a new haplogroup never described before. Furthermore, the updated phylogenetic tree presented in this study determines a finer classification of ovine species and may help to classify more accurately new mitogenomes within the established haplogroups so far identified...|$|E
