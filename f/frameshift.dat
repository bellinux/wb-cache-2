5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} <b>frameshift</b> mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of <b>frameshift</b> mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. <b>Frameshift</b> mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the {{amino acid sequence}} of a protein through the genetic code. Sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond to a specific amino acid. The principle that three sequential bases of DNA code for each amino acid was demonstrated in 1961 using <b>frameshift</b> mutations in the rIIB gene of bacteriophage T4 (see Crick, Brenner et al. experiment).|$|E
5|$|It is {{plausible}} that ceratosaurians underwent BDR {{independent of the}} tetanurans, and therefore has no bearing {{on the issue of}} avian digit homology. In particular, as demonstrated by teratological analysis, the abbreviation (mesomelia) and loss of digits (hypophalangia) in the forelimb of Limusaurus is likely the result of a developmental anomaly that appeared exclusively in and persisted throughout the evolutionary lineage of ceratosaurians, and is unconnected to the pattern of digital reduction and <b>frameshift</b> that occurred in tetanurans. This is supported by the hands of the ceratosaurians Ceratosaurus, Berberosaurus, and Eoabelisaurus having plesiomorphic (i.e. more similar to the ancestral condition of theropods than to derived abelisaurs) metacarpal bones comparable to those of the more basal theropod Dilophosaurus. The divergent developmental pathways of ceratosaurians and tetanurans is associated with a difference in forelimb function; tetanurans utilized their hands for grasping, while the hands of ceratosaurians almost certainly played no role in predation.|$|E

40|$|Several viruses utilize {{programmed}} ribosomal <b>frameshifting</b> {{mediated by}} mRNA pseudoknots {{in combination with}} a slippery sequence to produce a well defined stochiometric ratio of the upstream encoded to the downstream-encoded protein. A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind <b>frameshifting</b> still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknot-like structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited <b>frameshifting.</b> Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were <b>frameshifted</b> but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the <b>frameshifted</b> ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length <b>frameshifted</b> product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced. Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account {{is a prerequisite for}} formulating correct <b>frameshifting</b> hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|Many viruses use {{programmed}} – 1 ribosomal <b>frameshifting</b> {{to express}} defined ratios of structural and enzymatic proteins. Pseudoknot structures in messenger RNAs stimulate <b>frameshifting</b> in upstream slippery sequences. The detailed molecular determinants of pseudoknot mechanical stability and <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency {{are not well}} understood. Here we use single-molecule unfolding studies by optical tweezers, and <b>frameshifting</b> assays to elucidate how mechanical stability of a pseudoknot and its <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency are regulated by tertiary stem-loop interactions. Mechanical unfolding of a model pseudoknot and mutants designed to dissect specific interactions reveals that mechanical stability depends strongly on triplex structures formed by stem-loop interactions. Combining single-molecule and mutational studies facilitates the identification of pseudoknot folding intermediates. Average unfolding forces of the pseudoknot and mutants ranging from 50 to 22 picoNewtons correlated with <b>frameshifting</b> efficiencies ranging from 53 % to 0 %. Formation of major-groove and minor-groove triplex structures enhances pseudoknot stem stability and torsional resistance, and may thereby stimulate <b>frameshifting.</b> Better understanding of the molecular determinants of <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency may facilitate the development of anti-virus therapeutics targeting <b>frameshifting...</b>|$|R

Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} <b>frameshift</b> mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or <b>frameshift</b> mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and <b>frameshift</b> mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E

40|$|Programmed − 1 ribosomal <b>frameshifting</b> is a {{mechanism}} of gene expression whereby specific signals within messenger RNAs direct {{a proportion of}} ribosomes to shift − 1 nt and continue translating in the new reading frame. Such <b>frameshifting</b> normally depends on an RNA structure stimulator 3 ^'-adjacent to a ‘slippery’ heptanucleotide shift site sequence. Recently we identified an unusual <b>frameshifting</b> mechanism in encephalomyocarditis virus, where the stimulator involves a trans-acting virus protein. Thus, in contrast to other examples of − 1 <b>frameshifting,</b> the efficiency of <b>frameshifting</b> in encephalomyocarditis virus is best studied {{in the context of}} virus infection. Here we use metabolic labelling to analyse the <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency of wild-type and mutant viruses.

Here, I summarize technical advances that {{have made it possible}} to identify programmed ribosomal <b>frameshifting</b> events in a systematic way.

25|$|<b>Frameshift</b> {{mutations}} {{are known}} to be a factor in colorectal cancer as well as other cancers with microsatellite instability. As stated previously, <b>frameshift</b> mutations are more likely to occur in a region of repeat sequence. When DNA mismatch repair does not fix the addition or deletion of bases, these mutations {{are more likely to be}} pathogenic. This may be in part because the tumor is not told to stop growing. Experiments in yeast and bacteria help to show characteristics of microsatellites that may contribute to defective DNA mismatch repair. These include the length of the microsatellite, the makeup of the genetic material and how pure the repeats are. Based on experimental results longer microsatellites have a higher rate of <b>frameshift</b> mutations. The flanking DNA can also contribute to <b>frameshift</b> mutations. In prostate cancer a <b>frameshift</b> mutation changes the open reading frame (ORF) and prevents apoptosis from occurring. This leads to an unregulated growth of the tumor. While there are environmental factors that contribute to the progression of prostate cancer, there is also a genetic component. During testing of coding regions to identify mutations, 116 genetic variants were discovered, including 61 <b>frameshift</b> mutations. There are over 500 mutations on chromosome 17 that seem to play a role in the development of breast and ovarian cancer in the BRCA1 gene, many of which are <b>frameshift.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{diseases}} have <b>frameshift</b> mutations as {{at least}} part of the cause. Knowing prevalent mutations can also aid in the diagnosis of the disease.

In Drosophila there is no modification at position 37 while in mammals yW is modified there. To explain this variability the idea of <b>frameshifting</b> potential has come about. This implies that cells use <b>frameshifting</b> as a mechanism to regulate themselves {{rather than trying to}} avoid <b>frameshifting</b> at all times.

40|$|Expression of the {{putative}} replicase of potato leafroll virus (PLRV) is regulated by - 1 ribosomal <b>frameshifting</b> {{in which a}} primary viral transcript has two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs).

Detailed comparison of our results with analogous mutants in the <b>frameshifting</b> region of the evolutionarily related beet western yellow virus, for which a crystal structure is available, unequivocally argues for the pseudoknot to be the structural motif necessary for the <b>frameshifting</b> function in PLRV transcripts.

40|$|Synthesis of Gag-Pol polyproteins of retroviruses {{requires}} ribosomes {{to shift}} translational reading frame {{once or twice}} in a − 1 direction to read through the stop codon in the gag reading frame. It is generally believed that a slippery sequence and a downstream RNA structure are required for the programmed − 1 ribosomal <b>frameshifting.</b> However, the mechanism regulating the Gag-Pol <b>frameshifting</b> remains poorly understood. In this report, we have defined specific mRNA elements required for sufficient ribosomal <b>frameshifting</b> in equine anemia infectious virus (EIAV) by using full-length provirus replication and Gag/Gag-Pol expression systems. The results of these studies revealed that <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency and viral replication were dependent on a characteristic slippery sequence, a five-base-paired GC stretch, and a pseudoknot structure. Heterologous slippery sequences from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and visna virus were able to substitute for the EIAV slippery sequence in supporting EIAV replication. Disruption of the GC-paired stretch abolished the <b>frameshifting</b> required for viral replication, and disruption of the pseudoknot reduced the <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency by 60 %. Our data indicated that maintenance of the essential RNA signals (slippery sequences and structural elements) in this region of the genomic mRNA was critical for sufficient ribosomal <b>frameshifting</b> and EIAV replication, while concomitant alterations in the amino acids translated from the same region of the mRNA could be tolerated during replication. The data further indicated that proviral mutations that reduced <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency {{by as much as}} 50 % continued to sustain viral replication and that greater reductions in <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency lead to replication defects.

Correlations of the structure with available in Vitro <b>frameshifting</b> data for PLRV pseudoknot mutants implicate sequence and length of a stem-loop linker as modulators of <b>frameshifting</b> efficiency. Although the sequences and overall structures of the RNA pseudoknots from PLRV and beet western yellow virus (BWYV) are similar, nucleotide deletions in the linker and adjacent minor groove loop abolish <b>frameshifting</b> only with the latter. Conversely, mutant PLRV pseudoknots with up to four nucleotides deleted in this region exhibit nearly wild-type <b>frameshifting</b> efficiencies.
