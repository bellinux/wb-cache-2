25|$|Faced {{with such}} a drastic social experiment, and stunned by its arrest once the President dies, humans are faced with {{complete}} annihilation, as the cold wave progresses down toward the ocean floor. Scientists <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> yet another threat: that of biological devolution, turning men and women into oversized mollusks. Decision-makers are incapable of finding a global solution, but coalesce into competing factions. Two engineers personify that trend: Whitt suggests moving civilization closer to the inner molten regions; Xavier, inventor of nuclear propulsion, wants spacecraft to resettle humans on another planet. While Whitt and his secretary dig into the seafloor, Xavier and his concubine Olivia (collectively dubbed X-O) make a solitary escape into the cosmos.|$|E

500|$|When Andros came to New York, {{he moved}} to {{stabilize}} the situation. [...] He befriended the Lenape sachems (chiefs), convincing them to act as mediators between the English and other tribes. [...] Peace appeared to be imminent when Bacon's Rebellion broke out in Maryland, resulting in {{an attack on the}} Susquehannock fort on the Potomac. [...] The surviving Susquehannocks sneaked out of the fort one night, some of them making their way east toward Delaware Bay. [...] In June 1676 Andros offered, in exchange for their moving into his jurisdiction, to protect them from their enemies among the Virginian and Maryland settlers. He also extended an offer given by the Mohawk for the Susquehannocks to settle among them. [...] These offers were well received, but Maryland authorities were unable to convince their Indian allies to make the peace offered by Andros, and organized them to march toward the Delaware, which would also fulfil the goal of strengthening the Maryland claim to the area. [...] Andros responded by urging the Susquehannocks to retreat into New York, where they would be beyond Maryland's reach, and delivering a strongly worded threat to Maryland, that it would either <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> his sovereignty over the Susquehannocks, or they would have to peacably take them back. [...] He also offered his services as a mediator, pointing out that the absence of the Susquehannocks now left Maryland settlements open to direct attack by the Iroquois.|$|E

A heavy debt is owed: “They will have to pay us wages, the wages of their sin” (as Romans [...] notes, the “wages of sin is death”).

In an emotional press conference on 14 February, he cited pain and hypothyroidism as the reasons for his premature retirement. Ronaldo admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that had blighted his career: [...] "It's very hard to leave something that made me so happy. Mentally I wanted to continue but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> that I lost to my body. The head wants to go on but the body can't take any more.

2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I think {{at this time of year}} you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might not have heard from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> that there are people that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that. But," [...] Amos insisted, [...] "for the most part, for a Tori record, it’s pretty upbeat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Talking {{about the}} title track [...] "Louder", Michele has said, [...] "It's a song that, no matter what, I can play in my car with the windows down. I feel like it shows off my voice as a singer, which is really {{important}} to me, because that’s what I do. I {{want to make sure}} that every song on my record is fun and enjoyable, but also, you hear my voice in them." [...] Michele also stated, [...] "I didn't want to find songs that I had to change myself for. I wanted to find songs that would only highlight my sound and were unique to me. I didn't want to fit any mold. I wanted it to be something that couldn't be replicated by anyone else. It was important to me that the album began with [...] "Cannonball" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Say So". I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> what I've been through this year. It was really difficult, which I think is represented in [...] "If You Say So" [...] and a song like [...] "Cannonball" [...] represents finding strength and hope. These are the two sides of my life right now. The grief, but also the search for strength and hope. I really wanted those two songs to bookend the album. Really let everyone know where I'm at." ...|$|E
2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>acknowledge</b> that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
