5|$|Nash {{caused the}} South Melbourne {{coaching}} staff concern when he fractured two <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> a match against Hawthorn {{two weeks before}} the final series. Normally this type of injury would require a player to miss six weeks of football but Nash, who kicked six goals in the match, missed just one week, returned for South's Semi-Final win against Richmond and was considered Best on Ground in South Melbourne's 1933 premiership win. In the Grand Final Nash played at centre-half-back, took thirteen marks and had twenty-nine kicks and dominated play.|$|E
5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child. The coat of arms in its current form was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the Bavarian state capital.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E
5|$|Schouler {{leaves the}} city to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for {{practicing}} dentistry without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 {{in addition to the}} original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).|$|E
5|$|Scully {{is deeply}} troubled by Pfaster's crimes, and has unsettling dreams and {{hallucinations}} about the case. In Washington, {{she has a}} counseling session with a social worker, during which she shares her anxiety about the investigation. After the session, Scully learns that someone from Minnesota had called for her. When she contacts Mulder, she learns that neither he nor Bocks made the call. Tracing a fingerprint to Pfaster from his arrest, Bocks and Mulder raid his apartment, finding one of the prostitute's <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his refrigerator. Meanwhile, after Scully arrives in Minneapolis, Pfaster forces her car off the road. He kidnaps Scully and takes her to his late mother's abandoned house. He ties and gags Scully, and keeps her in a dark closet.|$|E

5|$|When the Munich town {{administration}} {{developed a}} constitution of its council, a seal {{was necessary for}} the purposes of asserting the authenticity of town-council documents. Appearing on a document of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has a picture of a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. The monk as a sole heraldic figure can be found on a seal dating from the year 1304, and on flags of the city since the middle of the 14th century. Colourful representations of the town's coat of arms stem from the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
