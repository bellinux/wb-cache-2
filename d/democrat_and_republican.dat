Those who agreed, including U.S. Senators Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, and Don Nickles, and Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, were filmed in a scene that was entirely improvised.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{conceptual}} metaphors use of four (former) prominent American politicians in representing their worldviews. A {{review of the}} research regarding this topic shows that <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> arguably apply different cognitive models to structure their worldview via the use of metaphorical language. In thesis I will illustrate that each politician has his style regarding his metaphorical language-use. Although <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> show dissimilarities in their metaphorical language, the language of both <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> <b>Republicans</b> primarily represent the shared worldview of American exceptionalism...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the gender}} gap has varied over many years, {{women of all ages}} are {{more likely than men to}} {{identify}} as Democrats. Recent polls have indicated that 41% of women identify as Democrats while only 25% of women identify as Republicans and 26% as independents, while 32% of men identify as Democrats, 28% as Republicans and 34% as independents. Among ethnic minorities, women also are more likely than males to identify as Democrats. Also, American women that identified as single, living with a domestic partner, divorced, separated, or widowed are more likely than men in these categories to vote Democratic, in contrast to married Americans, which split about equally between <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> <b>Republican.</b> Again, women in these categories are significantly more likely than males in these categories to vote Democratic. The National Federation of Democratic Women is an affiliated organization meant to advocate for women's issues. The Woman's National Democratic Club works to promote the Democratic party. National women's organizations that support Democratic candidates are Emily's List, which aims to help elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates to office, and often but not always the National Organization for Women.|$|E
500|$|The Liberal Republican {{movement}} {{lasted from}} 1870 to 1875 {{and at times}} {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between party members, both <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> <b>Republican,</b> who adopted all or parts of the Liberal Republican reform agenda. President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Amnesty Act of 1872, a Liberal Republican platform, that gave amnesty to former Confederates. Another instance occurred when the Democratic Party reluctantly and chaotically melded with the Liberal Republican Party in the presidential election of 1872, in support of the reformer, Horace Greeley. [...] The height of the Liberal Republican era in the U.S. Congress was from the periods of 1873 to 1875 with 7 Liberal Republicans in the Senate and 4 Liberal Republicans in the House of Representatives.|$|E

2500|$|In 1962, Look {{magazine}} {{declared that}} Courtney's CSA had {{a staff of}} fifteen and an income of $133,000 in 1960 and $181,000 in 1961. The CSA also rated members of Congress. In 1962, it declared that {{there were only two}} 100 percent conservative Senators, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina (still a <b>Democrat)</b> <b>and</b> <b>Republican</b> John Tower of Texas, and three perfect House conservatives, James B. Utt of California, Clare Hoffman of Michigan, and Bruce Alger of Texas. Goldwater received an 88 percent rating, but Senate Republican Leader Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois garnered only a 64 percent rating. Over the years, Tower would lose his high standing with the most conservative Republicans as he steadily moderated his views. Alger's staunchly conservative views presumably contributed to his defeat for reelection by Democrat Earle Cabell in the Democratic landslide [...] of 1964.|$|E

Employing a method known as [...] "catch and release", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips {{from both sides of the}} aisle, <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> <b>Republican,</b> respectively, when in power.|$|E
