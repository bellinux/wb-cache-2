The fiber {{is produced by}} dissolving the polymer in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or aqueous sodium thiocyanate, metering it through a multi-hole spinnerette and coagulating the resultant filaments in an aqueous solution of the same solvent (wet spinning) or evaporating the solvent in a stream of heated inert gas (dry spinning).

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the uniformity and penetration of surface modification into textile materials including fiber, yarn and fabric treated by atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). Exposure to helium/oxygen plasma at atmospheric pressure made improvement in the wettability, dyeability, adhesion of single fiber, yarn and woven fabric. The results showed that such a plasma jet was possible and effective in penetration of surface modification into textile structure. It can treat the whole surfaces of a single fiber, yarn filament in the treated parallel <b>filament</b> <b>tow</b> uniformly. For porous fabrics, rapid and efficient treatment on both sides of the treated samples was found to be ensured. And the degree and depth of penetration depended on the penetration of active species in plasma jet, which was affected by plasma parameters and materials structure. The former included treatment time, power, gas temperature, jet-to-substrate distance. The latter included number of twisting and fabric pore size. These findings would have important effects on industrialization of textiles treated by atmospheric pressure plasma jet...|$|E

For this purpose, a comparative analysis is done on processability between 100 % staple CF and 60 weight% staple CF mixed with 40 weight% PVA fibers in carding, drawing and spinning process. The hybrid yarns are produced by varying twist level. The PVA fibers of the hybrid yarn are then dissolved using hot water treatment. The mechanical properties of yarns consisting of 100 % staple CF and hybrid yarns consisting of staple CF and PVA before and after hot water treatment are investigated. Furthermore, test specimen is also prepared by impregnating 100 % staple CF yarn and the hybrid yarns (after the dissolving of PVA) with epoxy resin. The results of the tensile test of the yarns in consolidated state reveals that the hybrid yarn produced with 80 T/m after hot water treatment exhibits approximately 75 % of the tensile strength of virgin <b>filament</b> <b>tow,</b> and {{it is expected that}} the hybrid yarns can be applied for the manufacturing of thermoset based composites for load bearing structures...|$|E

This material is classified in the advanced composite materials category which is being investigated for the replacement of contemporary materials for structural components in numerous applications. FMC’s are manufactured with diverse compositions for the fiber/ matrix combination which limits the information available on given combinations. The materials studied utilize a structure where continuous, oriented fiber materials are placed in a polymeric matrix. Additional filament reinforcement is added by Carbon or Kevlar <b>filament</b> <b>tows</b> embedded within the matrix. Specimens were tested under quasi- static monotonic tensile loading and tension-tension fatigue with varying frequencies dependant on the magnitude of the load.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the microwave filament processing project is to develop microwave techniques to manufacture continuous ceramic oxide filaments. Microwave processing uses the volumetric absorption of microwave power in oxide <b>filament</b> <b>tows</b> to drive off process solvents, to burn out organic binders, and to sinter the dried fibers to produce flexible, high-strength ceramic filaments. The technical goal is to advance filament processing technology by microwave heating more rapidly with less energy and {{at a lower cost}} than conventional processing, but with the same quality as conventional processing. The manufacturing goal is to collaborate with the 3 M Company, a US manufacturer of ceramic oxide filaments, to evaluate the technology using a prototype filament system and to transfer the microwave technology to the 3 M Company. Continuous ceramic filaments are a principal component in many advanced high temperature materials like continuous fiber ceramic composites (CFCC) and woven ceramic textiles. The use of continuous ceramic filaments in CFCC radiant burners, gas turbines, waste incineration, and hot gas filters in U. S. industry and power generation is estimated to save at least 2. 16 quad/yr by year 2010 with energy cost savings of at least $ 8. 1 billion. By year 2010, continuous ceramic filaments and CFCC`s have the potential to abate pollution emissions by 917, 000 tons annually of nitrous oxide and 118 million tons annually of carbon dioxide (DOE Report OR- 2002, February, 1994) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLaboratory {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine the growth and grazing capabilities of two heterotrophic dinoflagellates with different feeding modes (pallium feeder: Oblea rotunda, engulfment feeder: Oxyrrhis marina) when fed with the raphidophyte Fibrocapsa japonica. Both dinoflagellates readily ingest prey and exhibit positive growth when feeding on monocultures of Fibrocapsa japonica. Maximum growth rates at food saturation were 0. 54 d- 1 and 0. 72 d- 1 for O. rotunda and O. marina, respectively. Both dinoflagellates are thus able to grow faster than their prey, for which a maximum growth rate of 0. 45 d- 1 has been reported. In the case of Oblea marina, {{it was found that}} a rather high food concentration of 300 Fibrocapsa cells ml- 1 (corresponding to 142 µg C l- 1) is needed to sustain half-saturated growth. This is consistent with the quantification of behavioural aspects of the feeding process. In about 55 % of cases, a failure to attach the <b>tow</b> <b>filament</b> after prey encounter was recorded and in about 83 % of cases, F. japonica was able to escape from the attached <b>tow</b> <b>filament,</b> indicating that motility of F. japonica represent a quite effective defence mechanism against pallium feeding dinoflagellates.

40|$|Composites forming {{processes}} such as resin {{transfer moulding}} (RTM) typically involve a preforming step in which dry fabric material is deformed. Frictional forces in tool–fabric and fabric–fabric contacts determine the fabric deformation behaviour to a large extent. Previous investigations of the frictional behaviour of fibrous materials were mostly performed on a particular scale, i. e. microscopic (<b>filament),</b> mesoscopic (<b>tow),</b> or macroscopic (fabric). This study aims to provide a coupling between these scales by means of friction experiments on both carbon tows and carbon fabric in contact with metal counterfaces.

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} emissions {{targets are}} encouraging vehicle manufacturers to prioritise reduction of vehicle mass. The falling cost of carbon fibre is increasing {{the viability of}} lightweight carbon-based body panel systems across {{a broad range of}} production volumes. In the present work an automated process has been developed for the manufacture of random fibre preforms at medium volume production levels (30 - 50, 000 ppa). This thesis seeks to understand the influence of key microstructural parameters on the mechanical and physical properties of carbon fibre laminates produced by directed fibre preforming. The principal parameters studied are fibre length, <b>tow</b> <b>filament</b> count and laminate thickness. A statistical process simulation has been developed to predict preform density variation and the results are compared with experimental tensile properties. Experimental studies have shown that there is a notable reduction in areal density variation and consequently an increase in tensile properties with shorter fibres (115 mm to 6 mm) and thicker laminates (1. 5 mm to 4 mm for a constant volume fraction). Shorter lengths improved preform coverage and gave higher tensile strength, whilst thicker laminates reduced the presence of unreinforced areas which cause stress concentrations. Tow filamentisation has been induced by pneumatic means to reduce the mean filament count and maximise the mechanical performance when using inexpensive, 24 K bundles. By maximising the level of filamentisation both stiffness and strength can be increased by 20 % and 45 % respectively. An analytical stiffness model is presented to predict the effect of <b>tow</b> <b>filament</b> count on the in-plane elastic constants. Filament count and out-of-plane fibre orientation distributions are determined from optical microscopy and are incorporated into a multi-level Mori-Tanaka based model. Predictions are within 8 % of the experimental data for laminates containing large fibre bundles and 10 % for laminates with highly filamentised bundles. An expression for critical bundle length has been developed for more accurate strength prediction, {{based on the number of}} filaments within the bundle. Experimental results confirm that the critical tow length is proportional to the <b>tow</b> <b>filament</b> count. Directed fibre preforming has been benchmarked against other competing processes in respect of mechanical properties, weight saving potential and cost. A full-scale demonstrator component has been manufactured using a variety of carbon composite solutions, which can all provide 40 to 50 % weight saving for an equivalent bending stiffness to steel and greatly improved dent resistance. Directed fibre preforming has shown great promise for both semi-structural and structural components for medium volume applications, particularly when aligned fibres are introduced. The results from this work can be directly scaled for industrial application to provide a cost effective, lightweight alternative to steel.

40|$|Poor {{processability}} {{of fiber}} reinforced high performance polyimide thermoplastic resin composites {{is a well}} recognized issue which, in many cases, prohibits the fabrication of composite parts with satisfactorily consolidated quality. Without modifying the resin matrix chemistry, improved compression modeling procedures were proposed and investigated with the AS- 4 /LaRC-TPI 1500 High Flow Grade (HFG) prepreg system. Composite panels with excellent C-scans can be consistently molded by this method under 700 F and a consolidation pressure as low as 100 psi. A mechanism for the consolidation of the composite under this improved molding technique is discussed. This mechanism reveals that {{a certain degree of}} matrix shear and <b>tow</b> <b>filament</b> slippage and nesting between plies occur during consolidation, which leads to a reduction of the consolidating pressure necessary to offset the otherwise intimate inter fiber-fiber contact and consequently achieves a better consolidation quality.

Another extrusome found within the organism is rod-shaped taeniocyst which is distally located to nematocyst and was earlier mistakenly considered as a nematocyst-precursor. Together these organelles are forming taeniocyst-nematocyst complex that is thought to be the best synapomorphy for Polykrikos clade. Golgi-derived vacuoles are shared by both organelles and supply each with molecules needed for its growth along with participating in NTC articulation. Organelles are located in proximity, but lie within different membranes and are separated by a passage, called “chute”. The nematocyst is a larger organelle and lies posterior to taeniocyst.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in using discontinuous carbon fibre composites for semi-structural applications within the automotive industry. The main advantages of discontinuous fibres are low material costs, low wastage and low touch labour compared with processes using carbon fibre textiles. Directed Carbon Fibre Preforming (DCFP) is an automated process for producing complex 3 D preforms for liquid moulding. DCFP offers the potential for producing highly optimised structures, with local control over tow size, fibre length and volume fraction within the component. The execution of this is challenging however, as confidence in the current library of material properties is low and existing structural optimisation packages only consider a very limited number of design variables, which are restricted to more conventional composite materials. This thesis aims to establish a structural design tool to exploit the design freedom offered by the DCFP process. A large number of parameters associated with the fibre architecture can be controlled to meet a range of design criterions such as performance, weight and cost. The optimisation tool is capable of generating locally varied fibre areal mass and thickness maps that are suitable for manufacture by the robot controlled process. The developed model adopts a multi-scaled finite element approach. Meso-scale simulations are performed to establish size effects in discontinuous fibre composites, to quantify the level of stochastic variability and to determine the representative volume element for a given fibre architecture. A DCFP material database is generated to facilitate macro-scale modelling at the component level. The macro-scale model iteratively redistributes material in order to minimise the total strain energy of the model under prescribed loading conditions. The optimised model is segmented into areas of uniform areal mass, where the zone geometries are tailored to achieve representative material properties according to the meso-scale results, whilst ensuring the design is fit for manufacture. An automotive spare wheel well has been chosen as a demonstrator component, enabling two DCFP architectures to be compared against a continuous glass/carbon fibre NCF design. The first case offers a high performance (high specific stiffness) solution and the second offers a low cost option using high <b>filament</b> count <b>tows.</b> Following optimisation, results suggest that a 3 K 25 mm fibre length DCFP option can achieve a specific stiffness 52...|$|R

Small diameter PAN/CNT based carbon fibers have been processed using sheath-core and islands-in-a-sea (INS) fiber spinning technology. These methods resulted in carbon fibers with diameters of ~ 3. 5 μm and ~ 1 μm (for sheath-core and INS respectively). Poly (methyl methacrylate) {{has been used as}} the sheath or the sea component, which has been removed prior to carbonization. These fibers have been stabilized and carbonized using a batch process. The effect of stabilization has been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A non-isothermal extent of cyclization (Mcyc) from the DSC kinetics study was developed in order to obtain an unbiased method for determining the optimal stabilization condition. The results of Mcyc were found to be in good agreement with the experimental FTIR and WAXD observations. The carbon fiber fracture surfaces have been examined using SEM. Various test parameters that affect the tensile properties of the precursor fiber (both PAN and PAN/CNT), as well as carbon fiber have been studied. In an attempt to validate single <b>filament</b> tests, fiber <b>tow</b> testing has also been done using standard test methods.
