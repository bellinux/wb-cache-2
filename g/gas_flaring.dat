60|$|It was a {{bird's-eye view}} of creation, as {{interpreted}} by science, which, in language always clear and sometimes picturesque, he unfolded before us. He told us of the globe, a huge mass of flaming <b>gas,</b> <b>flaring</b> through the heavens. Then he pictured the solidification, the cooling, the wrinkling which formed the mountains, the steam which turned to water, the slow preparation of the stage upon {{which was to be}} played the inexplicable drama of life. On the origin of life itself he was discreetly vague. That the germs of it could hardly have survived the original roasting was, he declared, fairly certain. Therefore it had come later. Had it built itself out of the cooling, inorganic elements of the globe? Very likely. Had the germs of it arrived from outside upon a meteor? It was hardly conceivable. On the whole, the wisest man was the least dogmatic upon the point. We could not--or at least we had not succeeded up to date in making organic life in our laboratories out of inorganic materials. The gulf between the dead and the living was something which our chemistry could not as yet bridge. But there was a higher and subtler chemistry of Nature, which, working with great forces over long epochs, might well produce results which were impossible for us. There the matter must be left.|$|E
30|$|For most of {{the studies}} that were subject to this review, the <b>gas</b> <b>flares</b> are not relevant; they should be removed before {{performing}} any analysis. However, this operation was hardly ever done, or else, it was not mentioned explicitly in the publication. This phenomenon is present in at least 20 countries, notably Russia, Nigeria, Iran, Iraq and Algeria, and, especially for small countries (such as Qatar, Kuwait) it could lead to a misinterpretation of the results, since <b>gas</b> <b>flares</b> can be easily confused with small cities. It was calculated for the year 2000, that <b>gas</b> <b>flares</b> represented 3.2 percent of the worldwide light emanation, and in some regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. Nigeria) they accounted for even 30 % of the total illumination [5].|$|R

50|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>flaring</b> is {{generally}} discouraged as it releases toxic components {{into the atmosphere}} and contributes to climate change.

In fact, in western Europe 99% of associated gas is used or re-injected into the ground. <b>Gas</b> <b>flaring</b> in Nigeria releases large amounts methane, which has very high global warming potential. The methane is accompanied by carbon dioxide, of which Nigeria is estimated to have emitted more than 34.38 million tons in 2002, accounting for about 50% of all industrial emissions in the country and 30% of the total CO2 emissions. As flaring in the west has been minimised, in Nigeria it has grown proportionally with oil production. While the international community, the Nigerian government, and the oil corporations seem to agree that <b>gas</b> <b>flaring</b> need to be curtailed, efforts to do so have been slow and largely ineffective.|$|E
