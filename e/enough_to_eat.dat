5|$|There {{are some}} {{variations}} in the foods that are eaten around the different areas of Wales. These variations trace their roots back to medieval cooking. Ingredients were historically limited by what could be grown; the wetter climate in highland areas meant that crops were restricted to oats, whilst the more fertile lowland areas allowed the growth of barley or wheat.

Aged eight, Castro was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, although later became an atheist.

In 1945 he transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana.

25|$|Famines were {{familiar}} occurrences in Medieval Europe.

In England, the most prosperous kingdom affected by the Great Famine, there were famines such as in 1315–1317, 1321, 1351 and 1369.
