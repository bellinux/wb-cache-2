5|$|<b>Fumigation</b> and {{insecticide}} use: Fumigants and insecticides (e.g., K-Obiol® ULV 6 (Pyrethroid, Bayer, Germany), in France) can be {{used against}} B. rufimanus in storage facilities. <b>Fumigation</b> requires tightly sealed storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide, {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the <b>fumigation</b> of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the <b>fumigation</b> of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. The chemical was used to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most {{of the victims were}} Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli, and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by Testa. Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from the manufacturers. Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942–44, 56 metric tons (about 8 per cent of domestic sales) were sold to concentration camps. Auschwitz received 23.8 tons, of which 6 tons were used for <b>fumigation.</b> The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage (the product had a stated shelf life of only three months). Testa conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for <b>fumigation</b> purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of the chemical, and thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight.|$|E
50|$|There {{was another}} {{important}} outbreak in 1814 {{which started in}} Veracruz and extended to Mexico City, Tlaxcala and Hidalgo. This epidemic caused Viceroy Félix Calleja to take preventive measures like <b>fumigations</b> and vaccination, which were successful.|$|R
40|$|Dicarboximide {{fungicides}} {{were used}} in field treatments {{as well as in}} post-harvest <b>fumigations</b> on cold-stored table grapes. They proved to be highly effective against gray mould, a major disease during storage or transport of grapes, and a valuable alternative to sulphur dioxide within one month after harvesting. Residues of the fungicides were determined through gas-chromatographic analysis on grapes field-sprayed with dichlozolinate, iprodione, procymidone or vinclozolin, and on grapes exposed to post-harvest treatments with new smoke formulations of procymidone and vinclozolin. In most cases, residue levels were lower than those allowed by Italian sanitary laws. Post-harvest <b>fumigations</b> caused only a slight increase of residue levels as compared to field application...|$|R

5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer scheduled the phase {{out for the}} ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing <b>fumigation</b> they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E
5|$|Several {{times in}} 1912, amidst an {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in the Caribbean, Havana operated in violation of Cuban and U.S. quarantine rules. In July 1912, the liner prepared to depart Cuba without an inspection and <b>fumigation,</b> but faced the prospect of seven days quarantine in Havana before the ship {{would be allowed to}} depart. However, a compromise was worked out by the United States Marine Hospital Service which allowed Havana to depart after a one-day delay. In September of the same year, another inspection gaffe resulted in government prosecution of the Ward Line.|$|E
5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and <b>fumigation</b> will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E

5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; <b>fumigation</b> of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{refitted}} at Devonport Dockyard between 3 September and 20 October 1934 for {{service on the}} China Station with the 8th (later the 21st) Destroyer Flotilla and arrived there in January 1935. She {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in the Red Sea from September 1935 to May 1936 during the Abyssinian Crisis and made port visits in Mombasa and other East African ports before returning to Hong Kong. The ship was refitted there in October and toured Southeast Asia {{in the first quarter of}} 1937. Decoy required further repairs and <b>fumigation</b> in April–May after her return. In August 1938 she sailed for Tsingtao, carrying representatives to apologise for incidents where drunken sailors had insulted the Japanese flag. She remained in the Far East until the rise in tensions before World War II began prompted her recall in August 1939.|$|E
5|$|Many {{attempted}} {{methods of}} eradicating meat ants have proven unsuccessful. The first investigations {{were made in}} the 1930s to control meat ant populations in urban areas by <b>fumigation,</b> using carbon disulfide and calcium cyanide. Although these methods successfully eradicated some nests, they were rapidly reoccupied by those living in satellite or rival nests. However, the reoccupation of these nests by incipient colonies (young colonies beginning to develop) does not occur. This is because colony founding is often difficult and rare when most areas are nested by mature colonies. This behaviour has led to long-term maintenance and repeated treatments to ensure the nests are not resettled. In addition, not all nests can be treated, and some may remain undetected from pest controllers. In 1973, Greaves notes that the poor penetration of insecticides into all nest galleries may be the reason why nests are reoccupied, but owing to the nest structure, the insecticides have to be poured into each individual hole as no gallery connects to one another. Missing a single gallery can mostly lead to the reoccupation of the nest site. Greaves concludes that dieldrin is the most effective insecticide to control meat ants, capable of killing the ants quickly and being the most long-lasting chemical used.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the most efficacious {{remedies}} were: <b>fumigations</b> with sulphur for several evenings in succession while the grain was in blossom, lime and ashes strewn over them when wet with dew, liming and ploughing the soil {{into which they}} have burrowed, and sowing late in spring or early in autumn.|$|R

30|$|Park et al. (2014) used 48 to 158  g m−[*] 3 of EDN to {{fumigate}} Korean {{red pine}} logs with an approximate load factor of 50 %. Moisture {{content of the}} logs was 55.5 and 68.2 % for the winter and spring trials, respectively, while 3 -d average temperatures were 4.4 and 6.1  °C, respectively. The EDN used in that study had a 99 % purity in balanced air and was also manufactured by Draslovka and marketed by BOC Australia. These authors did not detect HCN during their <b>fumigations.</b> Differences between the current results and those of Park et al. (2014) {{may be explained by}} the sensitivity of the analytical instrument used to measure HCN, i.e. GC–MS (current study) vs. GC–FID (Park et al. 2014) and/or a higher purity of EDN reagent. Because Park et al. (2014) did not detect HCN, these authors concluded that EDN is not converted to HCN during low-temperature <b>fumigations.</b> The results of the current study are consistent with this conclusion.|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{risk characterization}} by the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) for methyl bromide indicated toxic effects at doses {{lower than those}} previously documented, {{and that there was}} unacceptable exposure for several uses (Nelson, 1992). Subsequently, DPR and others conducted off-site and worker air monitoring for methyl bromide field <b>fumigations.</b> In 1993, DPR issued recommendations (including buffer zones) to mitigate unacceptable methyl bromide exposure, based on initial monitoring data. DPR has updated its buffer zone and other mitigation recommendations as additional monitoring data was collected. Current buffer zones are set so that air concentrations measured at the specified distance are not likely to exceed 0. 21 parts per million t&pm). This concentration is a 24 -hour time-weighted average and provides a lOO-fold margin of exposure (100 times less than the no observed effect level in animal tests).

25|$|Researchers {{have also}} been experimenting with other methods, such as <b>fumigation,</b> injecting the mound, mound {{drenching}}, and surface dusting. Mound drenching entails pouring large volumes of toxic liquid into the mound. While this may affect {{a large portion of}} the mound, it is possible it may not reach the queen, thus preventing the destruction of the colony. Surface dusting is similar to mound drenching, except insecticides are applied on top of the mound and soak into the soil when wet. Mound injections use pressurising and injecting insecticides into the mound, but the queen may not be affected by this. Mounds can be eliminated effectively through <b>fumigation.</b> Broadcast treatment is sometimes used by spraying infected areas with agricultural equipment. Finally, spot treatment with insecticides can be used by drilling and injecting the mound with residual insecticide.|$|E
25|$|Medieval necromancy is {{believed}} to be a synthesis of astral magic derived from Arabic influences and exorcism derived from Christian and Jewish teachings. Arabic influences are evident in rituals that involve moon phases, sun placement, day and time. <b>Fumigation</b> and the act of burying images are also found in both astral magic and necromancy. Christian and Jewish influences appear in the symbols and in the conjuration formulas used in summoning rituals.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} are growing as new information is being discovered {{as to what}} is harmful to the environment. The desire to help the environment along with improving <b>fumigations</b> is a big concern and effects many people. Ongoing research to improve <b>fumigations</b> without harming the environment has shown great promise in advancing technology and lowering the cost in protecting commodities consumed by the consumer. Methyl Bromide (MB) has been the major fumigant used to control stored-product insects for many commodities for many years. There {{has been a lot of}} concern surrounding MB because of health and environmental drawbacks. These concerns have caused MB to be reduced by 2005. With the total phase out of MB becoming critical, there is much anticipation as what will be the alternative(s). The research presented in this thesis describes two different and very effective methods of controlling stored product insects. Although there are many other methods of fumigating this thesis analyzes two forms; Sulfuryl Fluoride and Heat. The first presented alternative in this paper will be heat treatments.

25|$|Intermodal {{containers}} are {{not strong}} enough for conversion to underground bunkers without additional bracing, as the walls cannot sustain much lateral pressure and will collapse.

25|$|Because {{specimens}} of P.furfuracea tend to bioaccumulate heavy metals like Cr, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Fe, Mn and Cu proportional to their concentration in airborne particulates, {{they may be}} used as a biomonitor of air quality, although it has been noted that both trace metal accumulation and major element accumulation is partly dependent on the hydration level of the specimen. Also, the species is sensitive to ozone concentrations: ozone <b>fumigation</b> results in biophysical, physiological, and structural impairment of specimens.|$|E
