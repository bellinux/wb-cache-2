40|$|The current opinion {{concerns}} {{only one}} of the compounds belonging to chemical group 29, 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene. 3 -Acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene is genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene to be not safe when used as a feed flavouring for all animal species. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene is mutagenic and therefore is considered not safe for the target species and for the consumer of animal products. In the absence of data, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considered it prudent to treat this compound under assessment as an irritant to the skin and eyes, as a skin sensitiser and as hazardous by inhalation. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene is mutagenic and therefore any exposure is considered not safe for the user. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that the application of 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene at 0. 05 Â mg/kg feed for all species does not pose a risk for the environment. Since this compound is used in food as flavouring, and its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Selenium is a {{trace element}} that is {{essential}} for vertebrates and involved in series of vital metabolic functions. Considering {{the purity of the}} L-selenomethionine (L-SeMet) under application and the metabolic pathways of SeMet, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers the use of L-SeMet as safe for all animal species, provided that the maximum total selenium level authorised in feed is respected. The use of in animal nutrition is expected to result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from other sources of SeMet. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals fed L-SeMet, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that dietary selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. In the absence of specific data, the additive should be considered as an irritant to skin and eyes, as a skin sensitiser and as potentially harmful by inhalation. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that the use of L-SeMet in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared with other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. L-SeMet is an efficient source of selenium for all species. This conclusion is derived from studies with laying hens and pigs for fattening and, in the case of ruminants, from literature describing the microbial incorporation of selenium from organic sources in the rumen. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> made some recommendations concerning (i) the specification, (ii) the use of the compound in premixtures, (iii) the use in water for drinking and (iv) risk reduction when handling the additive...|$|E
40|$|Chemical group 16 {{consists}} of aliphatic and alicyclic ethers, of which four are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> was unable to perform an assessment of 1, 5, 5, 9 -tetramethyl- 13 -oxatricyclo[8. 3. 0. 0. (4. 9) ]tridecane and theaspirane because of {{issues related to the}} purity of the compounds. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that: i) 1, 8 -cineole is safe at the high use level proposed by the applicant (5 mg/kg complete feed) for all animal species with a margin of safety of 5. 6 to 28. 2; ii) 2 -(2 -methylprop- 1 -enyl) - 4 -methyltetrahydropyran (Class II) is safe at a maximum of 0. 3 mg/kg complete feed for cattle, salmonids and non food producing animals and of 0. 5 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry. The absence of a margin of safety would not allow the simultaneous administration in feed and water for drinking of these substances. The total dose from all sources should not exceed that recommended when given in feed alone. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 16 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers it prudent to treat both compounds under assessment as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, and as skin sensitisers. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that the concentrations of the compounds belonging to CG 16 in the environment are not expected to exceed levels of concern when used in animal feeds at the levels considered to be safe to the target species. Since these compounds are used in food as flavourings, and their function in feed is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Hostazym C is {{an enzyme}} {{preparation}} of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase {{produced by a}} non-genetically modified strain of Trichoderma citrinoviride. The results of an in vitro chromosomal aberration test and of an in vivo comet assay indicate the presence of genotoxic activity in the product. The tolerance studies provided in target species did not indicate any adverse effect of the additive. However, due to the genotoxic hazard from the product, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> cannot conclude on {{the safety of the}} additive for the target species. The results obtained in a repeated-dose oral toxicity study did not indicate any concern for consumer safety. However, the identity and fate of the substance causing the genotoxic effect is unknown; therefore, the source of the risk to the consumer cannot be established. Thus, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for the consumer. The product should be considered a potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential skin and respiratory sensitiser. Due to the presence of genotoxic activity in the product, any level of exposure to the additive by any route is considered hazardous. No risks to the environment are expected to result from the use of the additive in feed, and, therefore, no further environmental risk assessment is required. Based on the results obtained in the efficacy studies, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that the additive {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in chickens for fattening at a dose of 500 CU/kg feed and in weaned piglets at 350 CU/kg. Conclusions on the efficacy can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} {{clinoptilolite of sedimentary origin}} contains {{at least}} 80 % clinoptilolite (hydrated calcium aluminosilicate) {{and a maximum}} of 20 % clay minerals. Regarding the limited database and partly controversial findings, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that 10 000 mg clinoptilolite/kg complete feed could be considered to be safe for all animal species. Clinoptilolite is essentially not absorbed and is excreted with the faeces. There is no evidence that clinoptilolite will be degraded during its passage through the gastrointestinal tract of target animals. The consumer is therefore not exposed to clinoptilolite {{as a result of its}} use in animal nutrition; consequently, no risk for the consumer will arise. With regard to the high dusting potential of the additive, and in the absence of data on its irritation and sensitisation potential, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers it prudent to treat the additive as an irritant to the skin and eyes, a dermal sensitiser and an inhalation toxicant. The use of clinoptilolite in animal nutrition does not pose a risk for the environment. Based on data on a large variety of compound feeds, the additive is considered to have the potential to be effective as an anticaking agent. No data were available to allow conclusions to be drawn on its efficacy as a pellet binder. However, as the physical properties required for an anticaking and a pellet-binding additive are similar, and the efficacy of clinoptilolite as an anticaking agent is proven, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers it likely that the additive also has the potential to be effective as a pellet binder...|$|E
40|$|Brilliant Blue FCF, an {{authorised}} food colourant, {{is intended}} {{to be used as a}} feed additive for dogs and cats without a maximum content. The applicant reported a typical inclusion level in feed for the target species. The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) considered Brilliant Blue FCF as safe for cats and dogs up to a maximum concentration of 278 and 334 mg/kg complete feed, respectively. Considering the large discrepancy between reported use and safe dietary levels of Brilliant Blue FCF, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> recommended the introduction of a maximum content of 300 mg/kg complete feed for cats and dogs. Brilliant Blue FCF should be regarded as an inhalation hazard. In the absence of data on skin and eye irritancy, it would be prudent to regard Brilliant Blue FCF as being potentially irritating to skin and/or eyes. Skin exposure of workers to Brilliant Blue FCF is not expected to cause skin sensitisation or local neoplasias. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> also considered Brilliant Blue FCF as effective in colouring feed for the target species...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to {{complete}} its former opinion on the maximum residue limits (MRL) of Clinacox 0. 5 % (diclazuril) for turkeys for fattening, chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying. The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) assessed the supplementary information supplied by the applicant on the diclazuril impurity/metabolite R 070016 {{and concluded that the}} compound is devoid of genotoxic activity. Consequently, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> {{is in a position to}} adopt the already proposed ADI for diclazuril (1. 7 mg diclazuril per person per day). The metabolic fate of diclazuril in chicken and turkey is qualitatively similar, diclazuril being the marker residue in tissues. At a zero withdrawal time, the theoretical consumer exposure to the total residues from both chickens and turkeys represents about 13 % of the ADI. Therefore, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that applying a withdrawal period of zero day would not compromise consumer safety. Consequently, no MRLs are required for chickens and turkeys for fattening...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} opinion on Biosprint, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> could not conclude on {{the efficacy of}} this additive when used in feed for cattle for fattening because of insufficient evidence. The European Commission has requested the European Food Safety Authority to re-evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} additive BiosprintÂ® when used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: gut flora stabilisers) in diets for cattle for fattening at a minimum dose of 4. 0 Ã 109 and a maximum dose of 9. 0 Ã 109 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs. In the present application, the results of two new efficacy studies performed in cattle for fattening were presented. Both showed significant improvements in final body weight, average daily gain and feed to gain ratio in BiosprintÂ®-treated animals. Taking into account the positive result from the initial application, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that BiosprintÂ® {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in cattle for fattening at the dose of 3. 6 Ã 1010 CFU/head per day approximately equating to 4 Ã 109 CFU/kg feedingstuffs...|$|E
40|$|Ferrous {{sulphate}} heptahydrate is safe when supplied up to {{a maximum}} iron content per kilogram complete feedingstuff of 450 mg for bovines and poultry, 500 mg for ovines, 600 mg for pets, and 750 mg for other species/categories, except horses and fish; for piglets up to one week before weaning a maximum of 250 mg Fe/day is considered safe. Because of insufficient data, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> {{is not in a}} position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin. Consumer exposure in the EU is not associated with a risk of excess iron intake to the general population. Therefore, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> does not foresee any concern for consumer safety resulting from the use of ferrous sulphate heptahydrate in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum iron content in complete feedingstuffs is respected. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is an irritant and corrosive to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract; thus, handling of the additive poses a hazard to the user/worker. Considering the high background concentration of iron and sulphur in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is an effective source of iron for all animal species and categories. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> recommends that the currently authorised maximum iron content in complete feed be reduced for bovines and poultry from 750 to 450 mg Fe/kg, and for pets from 1250 to 600 mg Fe/kg...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} formaldehyde is an {{aqueous solution}} containing 37 % formaldehyde and 14 % methanol. It {{is intended for}} use in all animal species at concentrations between 68 and 680 mg active substance/kg complete feed. Free and reversibly bound formaldehyde is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and joins the pool of endogenous formaldehyde. It is rapidly oxidised to formic acid further on to carbon dioxide and water. Formaldehyde is a carcinogen by inhalation. While local irritation is expected to strongly promote carcinogenesis, lower local concentrations of formaldehyde are known to produce DNA adducts. Therefore, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> deems it prudent not to consider the exposure to non-irritant concentration as totally riskless. Moreover, {{on the basis of}} the present knowledge, a causal association between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia cannot be ruled out. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> estimated the oral intake of formaldehyde of consumers from food of animal origin to be 4 mg per person per day. A reliable additional exposure of consumers to formaldehyde from supplementing feedingstuffs cannot be calculated. However, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that the proposed use of formaldehyde as a feed additive would not increase consumer exposure and consequently would not pose an additional risk for the consumer. A safe feed concentration for all animal species and categories could not be determined. Formaldehyde is a strong irritant, a potent skin and respiratory sensitiser. Measures should be taken to ensure that the respiratory tract, skin and eyes of any person handling the product are not exposed to any dust, mist or vapour generated by the use of formaldehyde. The use of formaldehyde in animal nutrition is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Formaldehyde in concentrations between 340 and 680 mg/kg feed (compound feed and/or feed material) has the potential to be an efficacious preservative...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine {{consists of}} synthetic R,S- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) and {{is intended to}} be used as a source of the essential trace element selenium for all animal species/categories. Based on data from tolerance studies in chickens and turkeys for fattening and piglets, the additive is considered as safe for all species/categories up to the maximum authorised total selenium level in complete feed. After being absorbed, HMSeBA is metabolised to selenomethionine; consequently, no residues of the compound itself occur in animal tissues and products. Compared with inorganic selenium sources, the use of HMSeBA in animal nutrition would result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from selenised yeast. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals supplemented with HMSeBA, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. The additive should be regarded as an eye irritant, but should not be classified as skin irritant or skin sensitiser. Inhalation exposure poses a hazard to users; the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes, therefore, that the formulation and conditions of use of the solid form of the additive should minimise user exposure by inhalation. The use of HMSeBA in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared to other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. Based on the response of plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and the plasma/liver concentration of selenium in chickens for fattening and pigs for fattening, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that HMSeBA is an efficaceous source of selenium for all animal species/categories. HMSeBA does not modify the quality of meat as measured by physico-chemical properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} Lenziaren is a polynuclear Fe(III) starch/saccharose complex {{intended to}} be used in food for adult cats to reduce phosphate absorption in the gastrointestinal tract in order to prevent chronic kidney disease. The recommended minimum and maximum levels are 0. 25 g and 1. 0 g per cat per day, equivalent to 5 Â  000 and 20 Â  000 mg/kg feed, respectively. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that Lenziaren is safe for adult cats at the maximum recommended dose. However, the consequences of chronic exposure have not been investigated. The additive is not genotoxic. No adverse effects were seen in a repeat-dose toxicity study in mice. Lenziaren had no adverse effects on reproduction and development at dose levels that were not toxic to the mother. A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 500 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day was identified for Lenziaren on the basis of maternal toxicity (diarrhoea and reduced body weight gain), which was seen in rabbits at an oral dose of 1 Â  000 mg/kg bw per day or greater. Similar effects were seen in rats, dogs and monkeys at higher doses in repeat-dose toxicity studies. No NOAELs were identified in these studies. Lenziaren is not regarded as an irritant to skin or eyes or as a skin sensitiser. Although some inhalation exposure is possible, it is not expected to be harmful to those exposed as a result of handling the additive. Based on the results of three in vivo efficacy studies, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that Lenziaren {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in cats at the highest recommended dose of 1 g/cat per day (equivalent to 20 Â  000 mg/kg feed). However, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> has some reservations regarding the value of its long-term use in healthy cats. The Panel concludes that there is a need for a post-market monitoring plan...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} physiological role {{of vitamin}} D in all vertebrates is in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. The classic clinical deficiency syndrome is rickets. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> notes that for turkeys for fattening, equines, bovines, ovines and pigs the maximum content for vitamin D 3 in feed {{does not provide}} any margin of safety, and that, except for pigs, the maximum content is above the upper safe level, according to National Research Council data when animals were fed a supplemented diet for more than 60 days. No safety concern was identified {{for the use of}} vitamin D 3 in chickens for fattening and fish. Not withstanding the long history of supplementing compound feed with vitamin D and the absence of publicly reported intolerances, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> is {{not in a position to}} draw final conclusions on the safety of vitamin D and considers the current maximum contents as temporarily acceptable. Any additional administration of vitamin D 3 via water for drinking represents a safety concern. Current nutritional surveys in 14 European countries showed that vitamin D intake is sufficiently below the upper safe limit. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> assumes that foodstuffs of animal origin were produced following current production practices, including vitamin D 3 supplementation of feed and concludes that the use of vitamin D in animal nutrition at the currently authorised maximum dietary content has not and will not cause the tolerable upper intake level to be exceeded. Vitamin D 3 is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is not a skin sensitiser. Inhaled vitamin D 3 is highly toxic; exposure to dust is harmful to persons handling the additive. No risk to the environment resulting from the use of vitamin D 3 in animal nutrition is expected. The vitamin D 3 under application is regarded as an effective dietary source of the vitamin in animal nutrition...|$|E
40|$|Chemical group 20 {{consists}} of aliphatic and aromatic mono- and di-thiols and mono-, di-, tri-, and polysulphides {{with or without}} additional oxygenated functional groups, of which 31 are currently authorised for use as flavours in food. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> was unable to perform an assessment of six compounds (methanethiol, methyl propyl disulphide, dipropyl trisulphide, 3 -mercaptobutan- 2 -one, 3 -(methylthio) butanal and 3 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -trithiane) because of {{issues related to the}} purity of the compounds. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that the following 25 compounds are safe for the target species at the proposed maximum dose level (0. 05 mg/kg complete feed) : 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde, methyl 3 -(methylthio) propionate, allylthiol, dimethyl sulphide, dibutyl sulphide, diallyl disulphide, diallyl trisulphide, dimethyl trisulphide, dipropyl disulphide, allyl isothiocyanate, dimethyl disulphide, 2 -methylbenzene- 1 -thiol, S-methyl butanethioate, allyl methyl disulphide, 3 -(methylthio) propan- 1 -ol, 3 -(methylthio) hexan- 1 -ol, 1 -propane- 1 -thiol, diallyl sulphide, 2, 4 -dithiapentane, 2 -methyl- 2 -(methyldithio) propanal, 2 -methylpropane- 1 -thiol, methylsulfinylmethane, propane- 2 -thiol, 3, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 2, 4 -trithiolane and 2 -methyl- 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -oxathiane. No safety concern for the consumer would arise from the use of these 25 compounds of CG 20 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species, with the exception of allyl isothiocyanate. Although additional exposure to this substance through its low use level in animal feeds would not substantially increase consumer exposure, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> notes that the estimated exposure of consumers is already higher than the acceptable daily intake (ADI). All compounds should be considered irritant to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as skin sensitisers. The proposed concentration of 0. 05 mg flavour/kg feed is not expected to cause detrimental effects to the environment, except for 2 -methylpropane- 1 -thiol, for which 0. 04 mg/kg is expected to be safe. Since all 25 compounds are used in food as flavourings and their function is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed was asked to issue a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety of Kokcisan 120 G for chickens for fattening, based on the new data provided by the applicant in the supplementary dossier. The chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in rats demonstrates that salinomycin sodium (SAL-Na) from Kokcisan is not carcinogenic and a LOEL of 1. 5 mg SAL-Na kg- 1 bw day- 1 could be derived based on marginal, mostly pharmacological effects in haematology and blood biochemistry. This LOEL is three {{times higher than the}} lowest NOEL derived from previously submitted short-term studies (0. 5 mg SAL-Na kg- 1 bw day- 1). By applying an uncertainty factor of 100, this NOEL can be taken to deduce an ADI of 0. 005 mg SAL-Na from Kokcisan kg- 1 bw day- 1 (0. 3 mg per 60 kg person and day). The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that the whole metabolites represent a risk which in a worst case is equal to an equivalent quantity of SAL-Na. Regarding the similarity of the metabolic fate of SAL-Na in chicken and rat, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that the ADI based on laboratory animals is a suitable basis for MRL calculation...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed was asked to issue an opinion on the safety of Zeolite (sodium aluminosilicate, synthetic) when used {{to reduce the risk}} of milk fever in dairy cows. In its former opinion on Zeolite, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> stated that Zeolite has the {{potential}} {{to reduce the risk of}} milk fever. Recent data confirm this conclusion, particularly for older cows with three or more calvings. Zeolite gradually prevents the decrease in serum calcium occurring after calving. Although only 500 g day- 1 Zeolite was shown to significantly reduce milk fever incidence, a dose range of 250 to 500 g day- 1 (approximately 25 to 50 g kg- 1 complete feed) may be realistic under field conditions. The use of doses higher than 500 g of Zeolite leads to a dramatic depression of feed intake. Even the effective dose reduces feed intake and induces hypophosphataemia; however, these effects are considered transient. Zeolite may reduce serum Mg but this is without physiological significance. Serum levels of copper and zinc as well as milk yield and composition are not affected by Zeolite treatment. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that (i) the observed side effects after a two-week treatment wit...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} review of (i) the zinc requirements of food-producing and pet animals, (ii) the zinc concentration of feed materials and (iii) the calculated background zinc concentration of complete feed supports {{the possibility of}} a considerable reduction of the currently authorised maximum concentration for total zinc in feed. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> developed, based on an approximation using zinc requirements and background data, potential new maximum contents, which could replace the current ones. The newly proposed total maximum contents are: 150 mg Zn/kg complete feed for piglets, sows, rabbits, salmonids, cats and dogs; 120 mg Zn/kg complete feed for turkeys for fattening; 100 mg Zn/kg complete feed for all other species and categories. The use of phytase in feeding piglets, pigs for fattening and sows would allow a further reduction of the newly proposed total maximum contents by 30 [*]% (from 150 to 110 mg Zn/kg feed for piglets and sows and from 100 to 70 mg Zn/kg feed for pigs for fattening). The newly proposed total maximum contents ensure health, welfare and productivity of the target species and do not affect consumer safety. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> expects that the introduction of the newly proposed total maximum contents, provided they are applied in feeding practices, would result in an overall reduction of zinc emissions from animal production of about 20 [*]%...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is {{the trade}} {{name for a}} feed {{additive}} based on viable spores of a strain of Bacillus subtilis. This species is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to establishing safety for the target species, consumers and the environment. This approach requires the identity of the active agent to be established and the absence of toxigenic potential and resistance to antibiotics of human or veterinary clinical significance to be demonstrated. EFSA considered these issues and reported the results in a previous opinion {{on the use of the}} product in chickens for fattening. The applicant is now requesting the authorisation of the additive in diets for turkeys for fattening and turkeys reared for breeding at a dose of 1 Ã 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs. In the course of the former assessment, safety for users was also examined. In the view of the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel,</b> the use with these additional avian species will not introduce hazards not already considered. Therefore, in the current assessment, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> has considered only the efficacy data for turkeys for fattening and turkeys reared for breeding. Based on results of three trials carried out in turkeys for fattening, the Panel concluded that B. subtilis PB 6 has the potential to improve the zootechnical performance parameters at the dose of 1 Ã 108 CFU/kg feed.

40|$|The {{additive}} EndofeedÂ® DC contains endo- 1, 3 (4) -beta-glucanase and endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase {{from the}} fermentation product {{produced by a}} non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. The applicant seeks the re-evaluation of the product and the extension of its use to pigs for fattening, minor poultry and porcine species. Tolerance trials in chickens for fattening, laying hens and pigs showed that the animals tolerated well 100 -fold the recommended dose. Therefore, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that the additive is safe for these target species. The conclusions reached on those species can be extrapolated to minor poultry species and to minor porcine species for fattening. In the absence of adequate studies, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> cannot conclude on the safety of EndofeedÂ® DC for the consumer. No specific studies were provided regarding the safety for the user. Therefore, EndofeedÂ® DC {{should be considered a}} potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential skin and respiratory sensitiser. The results obtained in efficacy studies performed in chickens for fattening, laying hens and pigs for fattening showed that the additive has the potential to improve the performance of the animals. The nominal dose at which the potential of the enzyme preparation is demonstrated is the recommended dose. The conclusions on the efficacy on the major poultry species and on pigs for fattening can be extrapolated to minor poultry species and minor porcine species for fattening, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{iron chelate}} of amino acids, hydrate, as source of iron is {{considered}} safe for all animal species/categories when used {{up to the}} currently authorised maximum content of total iron in complete feed, {{with the exception of}} bovines and poultry for which the maximum tolerated level is 450 mg/kg complete feed, and pets, for which the maximum tolerated level is 600 mg/kg complete feed. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> is not in the position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish. Consumption surveys include iron-containing foodstuffs of animal origin. Since the supplementation of animal feed with iron-containing compounds has not essentially changed during the last decades, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the iron levels in food of animal origin used in exposure scenarios originated from animals fed iron-supplemented diets. Since iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, will be used as a substitute for other iron compounds, its use in animal nutrition would not modify consumer exposure to iron. The additive should be considered as a skin, eye and respiratory irritant and, owing to its residual peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. Considering the high background concentration of iron in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Iron chelate of amino acids, hydrate, is an effective source of iron for all animal species and categories. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> recommends that the maximum iron contents in complete feed be reduced as follows: bovines and poultry, 450 mg Fe/kg; and pets, 600 mg Fe/kg...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} AGal-Pro, {{also named}} as Biogalactosidase BL and AlphaGal BL, is a preparation of alpha-galactosidase (galactosidase) {{produced by a}} genetically modified strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase (glucanase) produced by a non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. This product is authorised for use in chickens for fattening as a zootechnical additive, functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens reared for laying and to minor poultry species for fattening at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens for fattening at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening. The potential of the product to be efficacious when used in chickens for fattening was previously established at the dose ofÂ  50 U galactosidase and 285 U glucanase per kg feed. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that this conclusion applies to chickens reared for laying.

40|$|The {{additive}} AveMixÂ® XG 10 is {{an enzyme}} preparation of endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase (xylanase) and endo- 1, 3 (4) -beta-glucanase (glucanase), produced by two strains of Trichoderma reesei. This product is currently authorised {{for use in}} chickens for fattening, laying hens, minor poultry species and weaned piglets as a zootechnical additive, under the functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant is now seeking {{an extension of the}} authorisation to pigs for fattening and minor porcine species at a recommended dose of 4 000 XU (xylanase units) and 900 BGU (beta-glucanase units) per kg complete feed. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that, since the additive has been demonstrated to be safe for piglets at the recommended dose, this conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening and extrapolated to minor growing porcine species. Supplementation of diets for pigs for fattening with AvemixÂ® XG 10 at the recommended dose (4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg) resulted in a significantly higher body weight and daily weight gain in one trial and significantly improved feed to gain ratio in two trials. Therefore, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that AveMixÂ® XG 10 {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in pigs for fattening at this dose. Since the mode of action of xylanases and glucanases can reasonably be assumed to be the same in all porcine species, the conclusions on efficacy for weaned piglets and pigs for fattening can be extrapolated to include all minor porcine species for growing at 4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg complete feed...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to {{consider}} additional data provided by the applicant subsequent to its former opinion on the efficacy and safety of L-valine for all animal species. The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) assessed the supplementary information supplied by the applicant on the impurities of L-valine. It concluded {{that there are no}} safety concerns resulting from the use of the additive L-valine in all animal species with a minimum content in the dry matter of 98 % L-valine and unidentified impurities of less than 1 %.

40|$|Chemical group 1 (CG 1) {{consists}} of straight-chain primary aliphatic alcohols/aldehydes/acids, acetals and esters with esters containing saturated alcohols and acetals containing saturated aldehydes of which 86 are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> was unable to perform an assessment of ethyl oleate because of its insufficient purity. The following compounds {{are considered to be}} safe for all animal species at the use level proposed for feed flavourings: formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, oleic acid, decanol, dodecanol, decyl acetate and dodecyl acetate. The remaining substances are considered safe for all animal species at 5 mg/kg complete feed (with a margin of safety between 1 and 120) and at 25 mg/kg complete feed (ethyl acetate and hexyl acetate, with a margin of safety between 2 and 6); and at 1 mg/kg complete feed for pigs and poultry and 1. 5 mg/kg complete feed for all other species (ethylacrylate, ethyl hex- 3 -enoate, ethyl trans- 2 -butenoate, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, methyl isovalerate, hexyl isobutyrate, methyl 2 -methyl butyrate, pentyl isovalerate, butyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl isovalerate, ethyl 2 -methyl butyrate, hexyl 2 -methyl butyrate and methyl 2 -methylvalerate). No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of compounds belonging to CG 1 up to the highest safe level in feedingstuffs for all animal species. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers it prudent to treat all compounds under assessment as irritants to skin, eyes and respiratory tract and as skin sensitizers. No risk for the safety for the environment is foreseen. Since all 85 compounds are used in food as flavourings, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Enterococcus faecium is a {{technological}} additive intended {{to improve the}} ensiling process at a proposed dose of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. It is not expected {{that the use of}} E. faecium at the dose proposed would substantially increase the exposure to this species of animals given silage as part of their rations Therefore, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that use of this strain in the preparation of silage is safe for the target animals. Since the strain does not belong to the hospital-associated clade and does not express resistance to the antibiotics tested, use of this strain in animal nutrition is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. The material safety data sheet proposed indicates that preparations containing the strain may cause irritation upon contact with skin and eyes. The dustiness of the preparation tested indicated a potential for users to be exposed via inhalation. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent, the additive should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of the strain under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. Studies with laboratory-scale silos are described made using three samples of mixed forage of differing water-soluble carbohydrate content and representing material easy, moderately difficult and difficult to ensile. In each case, replicate silos containing treated forage were compared to identical silos containing the same but untreated forage. Because of the very limited responses to treatment in two of the three forage samples tested, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> is unable to conclude on the benefit of using the strain of E. faecium as a silage additive for all forage species...|$|E
40|$|The safety {{assessment}} of the additive {{is based on the}} separate consideration of its two constituents, bentonite and sepiolite. The currently authorised maximum contents for bentonite and sepiolite when used individually (20 Â  000 mg/kg complete feed) are considered safe for all animal species. In consequence, ToxfinÂ® Dry would be safe for all animals species and categories up to a maximum concentration of 20 Â  000 mg/kg complete feed. Bentonite and sepiolite, in common with other clays, are not absorbed to any measurable extent. Consequently, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumption of edible tissues/products of treated animals would expose the consumer to harmful amounts of residues of any chemical component derived from ToxfinÂ® Dry. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that there is no concern for the safety of consumers of food products derived from animals fed diets containing the additive. Dust generated from ToxfinÂ® Dry during normal handling has the potential to expose the whole of the respiratory tract of users to potentially harmful substances (bentonite, sepiolite and crystalline silica) for which no safe levels of exposure have been identified. Measures must be taken to limit exposure of users to dust. In the absence of data for sepiolite, it would be prudent to treat ToxFinÂ® Dry as a skin and eye irritant and a skin sensitiser. Bentonite and sepiolite are naturally occurring clays widely distributed in the environment. Therefore, it is not expected that the use of the additive in animal nutrition would adversely affect the environment. Since only one in vivo study in chickens has been provided, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that there is insufficient evidence to conclude on the efficacy of the additive as a substance for reduction of contamination of feed with mycotoxins...|$|E
40|$|Prostora Max is a feed {{additive}} {{based on a}} strain of Bifidobacterium animalis {{that has never been}} authorised in the EU. It is intended to be used in dogs at a proposed dose of 1. 0 x 109 colony-forming units (CFUs) /day {{in the form of a}} supplemental treat. The species B. animalis is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment, if its identity is confirmed and the absence of resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance demonstrated. However, the B. animalis strain is resistant to the antibiotic clindamycin. In the view of the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> the antibiotic resistance qualification of the B. animalis strain has not been met and the QPS approach cannot therefore be applied. Although the applicant, on the basis of a bioinformatic analysis, could exclude the presence of many known antibiotic resistance genes, the genetic basis of the resistance to clindamycin was not established. In the absence of information on the genetic basis of this resistance, the extent of the risk of horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria in the food chain and in the environment cannot be established. All the excipients of the additive are authorised for food or feed use or feed materials. The product is in a tablet form so exposure to the mucous membranes and respiratory system of users is unlikely. Some skin exposure might occur, as the cocoa butter would melt at body temperature, but skin exposure would be limited. Treatment with Prostora Max at least 1 x 109 CFUs/day had an effect on gastrointestinal-related parameters in dogs. In two studies this took the form of an improved faecal score. However, in one study this improvement was marginal and of questionable biological/practical value. Therefore, taking into consideration the results of all three studies assessed, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> cannot conclude on the efficacy of Prostora Max for dogs...|$|E
40|$|Clinacox 0. 5 % is a feed {{additive}} {{belonging to the}} category of coccidiostats that contains diclazuril as the active substance. It is already authorised as a coccidiostat at Community level for turkeys for fattening, chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying. EFSA has been requested by the European Commission to set maximum residue limits (MRLs) in chicken and turkey tissues. A specific and major diclazuril impurity and/or metabolite has been identified in rabbit fat {{which has not been}} found to occur in laboratory animals. It cannot be ruled out that the accumulation in fat of this lipophilic impurity/metabolite might occur in other species, including the chicken and turkey. The safety of this compound has not been established. Provided the safety issues relating to this impurity/metabolite are satisfactorily addressed then the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> would {{be in a position to}} complete the safety assessment for the consumer which provides the basis for MRLs...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus kefiri is {{intended}} to improve the ensiling process at a dose of 5 x 107 CFU/kg fresh material. This species is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strain has been established and no resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent and the high dusting potential of the preparation tested, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers it prudent to treat this additive as a skin and respiratory sensitiser. It is also considered an irritant. The results of three efficacy studies indicated that L. kefiri has the potential to improve the aerobic stability of silage from forages with dry matter content above 40 % at the inclusion level of 5 x 107 CFU/kg forage...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{delivered}} {{an opinion}} on 27 January 2004 on {{the safety of the}} enzyme preparation Finase produced by Trichoderma reesei, for the target species laying hens, turkeys for fattening and sows. Based on the data provided by the applicant, a safety assessment for laying hens could not be done at that time. Following that opinion, the applicant has submitted new tolerance data to support the extension of the authorisation to laying hens. A 24 week tolerance study carried out with layers with ten times the maximum recommended dose (10000 Phytase Units kg- 1) of Finase showed no evidence of negative effects on any of the production or egg parameters studied. Furthermore, Finase at ten times overdose did not negatively affect tibia development or alter weigth of liver, spleen or kidney. Blood parameters were not affected by treatment. Therefore, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that Finase is safe for laying hens...|$|E
40|$|Amaferm is the {{fermentation}} {{product of}} a non-pathogenic and non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus oryzae mixed with wheat bran as carrier. It is proposed {{to be used as}} feed additive to dairy cows and cattle for fattening at doses between 2 and 5 g head- 1 day- 1 in order to improve production performance. According to Regulation (EC) No 1831 / 2003, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) should deliver an opinion on the efficacy and the safety of the product Amaferm for the target animals, consumers, users and the environment. Amaferm {{has been shown to be}} capable of producing a positive effect on milk yield of dairy cows. However, evidence has only been provided for a dose of 3 g head- 1 day- 1 instead of the minimum recommended dose of 2 g head- 1 day- 1 claimed by the Applicant. However, only one out of four studies with cattle for fattening showed a persistent improvement of weight gain and feed conversion with Amaferm. Therefore, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers the data provided to be insufficient to draw final conclusions on efficacy of Amaferm in cattle for fattening kept under common production conditions...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or {{substances}} used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the compatibility of microbial feed additive Bacillus subtilis PB 6 with the coccidiostats maduramycin ammonium, monensin sodium, narasin and robenidine hydrochloride. The in vivo compatibility of the coccidiostats with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 was assessed {{as part of a}} larger trial in which performance characteristics were measured. A negative control group was included, while the other groups received the recommended dose of Bacillus subtilis PB 6 in the presence or absence of the tested coccidiostats at their maximum authorised levels. Intestinal samples from six birds per treatment group were analysed for aerobic spore formers. Heat treatment of the samples was included to distinguish spores from vegetative cells. No significant differences in numbers of bacilli were observed between the coccidiostat-treated groups and the group treated with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 alone. Consequently, the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> concludes that Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is compatible with maduramycin ammonium, monensin sodium, narasin and robenidine hydrochloride when added to diets for chickens for fattening...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority {{received}} {{a request from}} the European Commission to issue an opinion on the safety of Kokcisan 120 G for chickens for fattening based on the new data provided by the applicant in the supplementary dossier. Data submitted by the applicant on Kokcisan 120 G were previously reviewed by the <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> in May 2004 and found to be insufficient for conclusions to be reached on efficacy and safety. In response to this review the applicant has conducted further studies to address the inadequacies previously identified and the additional studies are reviewed in the following opinion. From the supplementary metabolic studies, it has been concluded that unchanged salinomycin represents less than 10 % of the total radioactivity in the excreta regardless of gender. The results presented identify more than 20 metabolites in chicken excreta, each representing less than 10 % of the total radioactivity. The metabolic profiles in chicken and rat excreta and tissues {{are found to be}} qualitatively similar. Kinetics study of total residues and SAL-Na residues in chicken tissues from animals dosed at maximum dose proposed was provided and Salinomycin sodium could be considered as a marker residue...|$|E
40|$|Danisco Xylanase G/L is {{an enzyme}} product (dry and liquid forms, respectively) of endo 1, 4 beta-xylanase {{produced}} by submerged fermentation of the {{genetically modified micro-organism}} Trichoderma reesei. The additive is intended for use in turkeys for fattening at a dose range of 1250 - 2500 U kg- 1 complete feedingstuffs. Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked {{to deliver an opinion}} on the efficacy and safety for the target animals, the consumer, user and the environment of the product Danisco Xylanase G/L. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that the safety aspects other than those related to the new target species are covered in the previous opinion and would not be affected by this extension of use. Therefore, the present opinion focuses only on the safety and efficacy of this enzyme preparation for the target species turkeys for fattening. Four experiments have been provided by the applicant to support the efficacy of the product. In two of them, significant improvements in weight gain and feed conversion were observed at the minimum recommended dose (1250 U kg- 1). The meta-analysis of the data from the four experiments supports the efficacy of the product at the minimum recommended dose...|$|E
40|$|Kokcisan Â® 120 G is a feed {{additive}} {{intended for the}} control of coccidiosis, a debilitating protozoal infection in poultry. In common {{with a number of}} other coccidiostats, the additive is due for evaluation to comply with statutory requirements agreed at EU-level. The European Commission asked the EFSA to evaluate the product Kokcisan Â® 120 G and advise the Commission on its efficacy and safety. Within EFSA this task was allocated to the Scientific Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (<b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel).</b> The data provided in the dossier proved insufficient to give conclusive answers to the several of the questions raised by the European Commission. Kokcisan Â® 120 G containing 12 % salinomycin sodium (SAL-Na) as active substance, added as coccidiostat at a level of 60 mg SAL-Na kg- 1 feed for chickens for fattening, is as effective as another SAL-Na as seen in field trials. However, a full assessment of the efficacy was not possible, as no up-to-date floor pen studies have been carried out. Studies on the occurrence of coccidial resistance against SAL-Na from Kokcisan Â® 120 G were not submitted, however the development of resistance against coccidiostats including SAL-Na is a well known phenomenon effectively counteracted in practice by rotation or shuttle programmes...|$|E

The European Food Safety Authority issued an opinion on the safety and efficacy of RovabioÂ® Excel as a feed additive for chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening, ducks, guinea fowl, quails, geese, pheasants and pigeons. The full description of the formulations, manufacturing processes, purity, stability and homogeneity of the product is given in that assessment. The <b>FEEDAP</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that the safety aspects, other than for the new target species, are covered in the previous assessment and would not be affected by the extension of use requested. The results of a tolerance study showed that 200 -fold the recommended dose was tolerated well by the sows when offered for a period of seven weeks, including gestation and lactation.
