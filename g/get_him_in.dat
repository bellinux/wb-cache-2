500|$|The idea Gough and Millar came up {{with for}} their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his [...] "... bare essence ...", {{discovering}} the reasons why Clark became Superman. In Smallville, Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always make the right decisions, and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself.

500|$|Ford {{continued}} to excel as a pass-rusher in 1951, when the Browns again {{advanced to the}} NFL Championship Game but lost to the Rams. He recovered four fumbles during the season and was named a first-team All-Pro by both the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). He was also named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game. Ford's dominating play allowed Brown to assign him to two offensive linemen, giving Cleveland the latitude to put four men {{on the line and}} use three linebackers in what is now known as the 4–3 defense. Cleveland's defensive coach Blanton Collier later recalled the thinking behind moving Ford: [...] "We knew we had to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> closer where his talents as a pass rusher could best be utilized. [...] So we moved both tackles in and dropped the linebackers off the outside. [...] It may have been the beginning of today's 4–3 defense." [...] Collier also noted that [...] "Len was very aggressive and had that touch of meanness in him that you find in most defensive players." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 2005 {{autobiography}} Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story, Michaels {{stated that}} it was Triple H's idea, while the sharpshooter spot had been suggested by Hart. [...] "We were talking things through, and Bret {{came up with this}} spot where I <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Sharpshooter and then he reverses it by pulling on my leg".

2500|$|The episode {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "dark, realistic, and, because it was shot on videotape and live-on-camera, very stagy.

[...] The Avengers Forever! website technically regards the episode as at least as good as any Cathy Gale episode, with some [...] "excellent camera work, including very creative special-effects", but spotted deficiencies in the [...] "repetitive use of certain music cues, and a slightly awkward sequence when Dr Keel's fiancée is shot." [...] They remarked that the episode shows a [...] "high degree of professionalism and skill: good writing, good acting, great direction (no surprise, really, with Don Leaver at the helm), and, in particular, a fine lead. Ian Hendry demonstrates exactly why Sydney Newman was so very anxious to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> front of television viewers: he is a natural. His acting is easy, smooth and captivating." ...|$|E
2500|$|Structure {{was what}} Allen {{brought to the}} {{screenplay}} for Bob Fosse's Cabaret. The producers hadn't wanted to film the stage script by Joe Masteroff and John Van Druten, and felt that not portraying the male lead as a homosexual was dishonest to the story. They {{wanted to go back}} to Christopher Isherwood's original novel Goodbye to Berlin of 1939, but the Berlin stories weren't structured in any linear fashion and Allen had to diagram the entire story. Allen and Fosse got along badly from the start: she found him [...] "so depressed that it took two hours just to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the frame of mind for work." [...] In Allen's opinion most of the humor from the original was lost; she believed Fosse didn't really like the lead character of Sally Bowles at all. She worked on the screenplay for ten months, but in the end Fosse and the producers were still unhappy with the final form, and having commitments elsewhere, Allen handed the script over to her friend Hugh Wheeler.|$|E
