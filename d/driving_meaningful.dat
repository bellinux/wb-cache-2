The majority (61 %) of participants chose IVR self-monitoring, while 39 % chose web. 56 % of those who selected web monitoring changed to IVR during the study versus no change in those who initially selected IVR. Self-monitoring declined in both modalities, but completion rates were higher in those who selected IVR. There were no associations between self-monitoring modality and weight or blood pressure outcomes.

40|$|International audienceDrivers {{typically}} depict different {{behavior with}} respect to various driving events. The modeling of their behavior enables an accurate estimation of fuel consumption during the truck design process and is also helpful for ADAS {{in order to give}} relevant advices. In this paper, we propose a learningbased approach to the automatic recognition of driving events,e. g., roundabouts or stops, which impact the driver behavior. We first synthesize and categorize <b>meaningful</b> <b>driving</b> events and then study a set of features potentially sensitive to the driver behavior. These features were experimented on real truck driver data using two machine-learning techniques, i. e., decision tree and linear logic regression, to evaluate their relevance and ability to recognize driving events...|$|R

40|$|Because of the {{increasing}} availability of spatiotemporal data, a variety of data-analytic applications have become possible. Characterizing driving context, where context may {{be thought of as}} a combination of location and time, is a new challenging application. An example of such a characterization is finding the correlation between driving behavior and traffic conditions. This contextual information enables analysts to validate observation-based hypotheses about the driving of an individual. In this paper, we present DriveContext, a novel framework to find the characteristics of a context, by extracting significant driving patterns (e. g., a slow-down), and then identifying the set of potential causes behind patterns (e. g., traffic congestion). Our experimental results confirm the feasibility of the framework in identifying <b>meaningful</b> <b>driving</b> patterns, with improvements in comparison with the state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate how the framework derives interesting characteristics for different contexts, through real-world examples.

40|$|This study {{concentrates}} {{on the role of}} cooperatives in Local Economic Development (LED) and the creation of sustainable jobs. In ascertaining this role, it was imperative that the study also examine the participant’s perceptions and attitudes as the drivers in attaining the sustainable livelihoods; where their desire, their beliefs and their perceived social norms are examined. In line with the examination of the participant’s perceptions and attitudes as the drivers in attaining the sustainable livelihoods, we have also identified the drivers or catalyst to really changing the behaviour and/or performance and really taking action. Motivation {{of this study is that}} the participants and LED officials will learn from the lessons that are identified. Lessons can be learned from our history in South Africa that through dedication and sustained motivation goals can be realised. Motivation and commitment are therefore important in strengthening the foundations of cooperative development towards job creation; where social capital is the driver of commitment and motivation and should be promoted as such. Through the cooperation that is inherent in cooperatives people pull together towards realising their dreams. The sustainable jobs are however not attainable at this stage of cooperative development but strong foundations are however being built to realise these goals in the near future. Unemployment is a big problem that policy makers are looking for solutions to, and hence the development of policy measures like the Cooperative Policy to address poverty through creation of cooperatives. These cooperatives collectively benefit the members and create a platform for mutual cooperation. Self-motivation and ‘Ubuntu’ need to be ingrained more in our culture and find a ‘new meaning’. There is a role for social capital and the unity that is within ‘Ubuntu’ to really be used as the undoubted asset that it is. Social capital can be seen as the driver of commitment and motivation. This can also be seen in the Mutual Incentives Theory’ (MIT) of motivations to participate developed by Birchall and Simmons, as meaningful participation can be motivated by three variables. These variables are shared goals, shared values and sense of community. These three variables are all integrated in social capital; where social capital could be seen as the common denominator. Such conclusions about the importance of social capital in <b>driving</b> <b>meaningful</b> participation in cooperatives should be widely acknowledged. The promotion of social capital in all its forms should be wide spread and it should form part of the basis for solutions to cooperative development...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{framework}} for conducting controlled driving behavior studies based on multiuser networked 3 -D virtual environments. The framework supports: 1) the simulation of multiuser immersive driving; 2) the visualization of surrounding traffic; 3) the specification {{and creation of}} reproducible traffic scenarios; and 4) the collection of <b>meaningful</b> <b>driving</b> behavior data. We use our framework to investigate the “rubbernecking” phenomenon, which refers to the slowing down of a driver due to an accident {{on the opposite side}} of the road, and its effect on the following drivers. The main contribution of the paper is the Scenario Markup Language (SML) framework, which is composed of: 1) the SML as a practical tool to specify dynamic traffic situations(e. g., an accident) and 2) the Scenario Control System to ensure the reproducibility of particular traffic situations, so that traffic engineers can obtain comparable data and draw valid conclusions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we specified the traffic accident scenario in SML and conducted a study about the rubbernecking phenomenon. We report on the results of our study from two viewpoints: 1) the reproducibility of the traffic accident situation (i. e., state variables of interest are recreated successfully in 78...|$|R
40|$|We {{interpret}} solar flares {{as events}} originating from active regions that {{have reached the}} Self Organized Critical state, by using a refined Cellular Automaton model with initial conditions derived from observations. Aims: We investigate whether the system, with its imposed physical elements,reaches a Self Organized Critical state and whether well-known statistical properties of flares, such as scaling laws observed in the distribution functions of characteristic parameters, are reproduced after this state has been reached. Results: Our results show that Self Organized Criticality is indeed reached when applying specific loading and relaxation rules. Power law indices obtained from the distribution functions of the modeled flaring events are in good agreement with observations. Single power laws (peak and total flare energy) as well as power laws with exponential cutoff and double power laws (flare duration) are obtained. The results are also compared with observational X-ray data from GOES satellite for our active-region sample. Conclusions: We conclude that well-known statistical properties of flares are reproduced after the system has reached Self Organized Criticality. A significant enhancement of our refined Cellular Automaton model is that it commences the simulation from observed vector magnetograms, thus facilitating energy calculation in physical units. The model described in this study remains consistent with fundamental physical requirements, and imposes physically <b>meaningful</b> <b>driving</b> and redistribution rules.

40|$|Cognitive, psycho-motor, and {{emotional}} regulation abilities {{of people with}} psychiatric diagnoses, particularly bipolar disorder, {{are assumed to be}} less efficient compared to the general population, and, as a consequence, may not be conducive to safe driving. This research aimed to investigate the lived experience of driving with a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder, as a study on this subject has not been located in the literature. Two focus groups were conducted during a bipolar day program in an independent psychiatric hospital in an Irish city (n = 18). Data was analysed using thematic analysis. Themes emerging from the data include; the meaning of driving as an essential instrumental activity of daily living, that bipolar disorder can impact driving behaviour, and that participants are able to make decisions to manage their driving effectively when unwell. An unexpected theme was the perceived discriminatory nature of the recommendations regarding the disorder in the Irish Road Safety Authority’s fitness to drive guidelines. The findings complement other research conclusions in that <b>driving</b> is highly <b>meaningful,</b> enabling engagement in many areas of occupation. Participants’ desire to collaborate with their treatment team while implementing their own strategies for managing their driving when unwell, {{can be viewed as a}} process of taking control in their recovery and minimising the effects of occupational disruption. Their perception of the fitness to drive guidelines as inequitable could be a result of a feeling that illness has long lasting influences on their life narrative...|$|R
40|$|In most vehicle domains {{within the}} {{transportation}} sector, traffic is increasing and vehicles {{are becoming more}} technologically advanced. In addition to this, drivers are faced with conflicting goals, such as punctuality, maintaining safety, minimizing fuel consumption, ensuring passenger comfort, etc. When accidents occur, the drivers' actions and mishaps are often in focus, even though the work environment, the organization behind the drivers, and the educational level may provide equally important explanations for incidents and actions. In this thesis, factors influencing operators' behaviour are acknowledged and attempts are made to understand how these factors affect vehicle operators in their daily work. Even though modern vehicles are equipped with new technology that supposedly aids drivers, studies of actual work typically reveal that these tools are not necessarily suited for their purpose. In a larger perspective, it is necessary not only to improve this technology, but to redesign how vehicle drivers perform their work. In practice, also traditional processes for development of technology affect how the operators work, although then simply {{a side effect of}} technology being introduced. Based on a deep understanding of the operators' work, the long-term goal here is to instead design new ways of working that allows the operators to use their skills to do <b>meaningful</b> <b>driving</b> tasks supported by technology. To acquire this understanding of how the operators work, a new method of information acquisition has been developed and tested within the rail and marine domains. These studies resulted with an understanding of what train and high-speed ferry operators are occupied with during their journeys, as well as insights into why they perform in certain manners and how they think and reason about these tasks...|$|R
40|$|Study Objective: To {{evaluate}} next-morning {{driving performance}} in adults younger than 65 years, after single and repeated doses of suvorexant 20 and 40 mg. Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4 -period crossover study. Setting: Maastricht University, The Netherlands. Participants: 28 healthy volunteers (15 females), aged 23 to 64 years. Interventions: Suvorexant (20 and 40 mg) for 8 consecutive nights; zopiclone 7. 5 mg nightly on day 1 and 8; placebo. Measurements: Performance on day 2 and 9 (9 h after dosing) using a one-hour standardized highway driving test in normal traffic, measuring {{standard deviation of}} lateral position (SDLP). Drug-placebo changes in SDLP > 2. 4 cm were considered to reflect <b>meaningful</b> <b>driving</b> impairment. Results: Mean drug-placebo changes in SDLP following suvorexant 20 and 40 mg were 1. 01 and 1. 66 cm on day 2, and 0. 48 and 1. 31 cm on Day 9, respectively. The 90 % CIs of these changes were all below 2. 4 cm. Symmetry analysis showed that more subjects had SDLP changes > 2. 4 cm than < - 2. 4 cm following suvorexant 20 and 40 mg on day 2, and following suvorexant 40 mg on day 9. Four female subjects requested that a total of 5 driving tests-all following suvorexant-stop prematurely due to self-reported somnolence. Conclusions: As assessed by mean changes in standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), there was no clinically meaningful residual effect of suvorexant in doses of 20 and 40 mg on next-morning driving (9 h after bedtime dosing) in healthy subjects < 65 years old. There may be some individuals who experience next-day effects, as suggested by individual changes in SDLP and prematurely stopped tests...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the available methodologies to field test driver night vision devices ranging from vehicle mounted cameras to head-mounted NVGs. As in flight trials, a formidable {{challenge is to}} collect meaningful performance measures. Night vision systems for land and air systems show many similarities. The technology is similar and the primary goals are the same, namely to aid navigation, obstacle avoidance, and target detection. Good situation awareness and acceptable workload are key. Land testing differs from flight testing in the environment & test routes and the mission & operator. Standardization of land vehicle testing is aided by the possibility to lay out a track, highly narrowing down the path to follow. The absence of external reference points makes air tracks harder to achieve. Aircraft testing by necessity contains some degree of free flight, the pilot determining the path to follow, while vehicle race tracks can pin-down the route to follow. Quantitative data regarding position and speed are therefore easier to interpret on the ground than in the air. Regarding the mission & operator, driving {{tends to be the}} sole task while multi-tasking is the norm in flight. Compared to test flights, driving is relatively safe and cheap. A series of systematic performance measures have through the years been developed and validated for track driving and highway driving. These performance measures can be split in two categories, visual perception measures and driving performance (vehicle handling). The visual perception measures include distance perception, geometric judgements, object detection while driving, and situation awareness. The driving measures include dynamic geometric control tasks, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. A particular challenge in The Netherlands is to collect <b>meaningful</b> <b>driving</b> performance measures in (off-road) terrain. Night time driving trials must by law take place on an enclosed area, limiting the available choices to just a few military camps, familiar to each military driver. Off the road subjective judgements therefore remain a primary source of information. The literature provides well described protocols to field-test a night vision device in a vehicle on flat terrain. Less information is available how to set up systematic field-tests in accidented terrain. This paper provides a starting point for those planning to field-test a night vision device in a land vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Estuaries {{are among}} the most {{productive}} ecosystems on the planet and provide many important functions to the benefit of humans. Estuaries, however, are also under multiple anthropogenic threats, such as habitat degradation, pollution, eutrophication, and trophic downgrading through overharvesting of marine predators. These threats to estuaries come with a heavy cost through the loss of key ecosystem functions and services. The purpose of my dissertation was to characterize how anthropogenic threats affect estuarine communities in Elkhorn Slough, an estuary that provides habitat to a great diversity of organisms but is under threat through extreme nutrient loading and habitat modification. In my first chapter I investigated how bottom-up (nutrients) and top-down (predation) forcing interact to influence seagrass beds. Using the recovery of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) I demonstrated that top predators can mediate the harmful effects of nutrient loading and eutrophication to eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds through the removal of crabs, which frees mesograzers to perform an important function: removing shade-causing algal epiphytes from seagrass leaves. I followed up on these results for my second chapter to develop a mechanistic understanding of eelgrass resilience in face of macroalgal blooms (Ulva spp.) that coincide with peak eelgrass production. Using a series of field experiments I demonstrated that sea otters can promote both eelgrass and Ulva at a seagrass-macroalgal ecotone, a process that benefits eelgrass resilience by enhancing Ulva's mesograzer assemblage that lowers the epiphyte load on eelgrass. For my third and final chapter I used a 40 year data set of fish, water quality, and climate indices to determine the long-term effects of hypoxia on two important ecosystem services: the provision of biodiversity and nursery function. My results demonstrated that anthropogenic nutrient loading and subsequent hypoxia negatively impacted fish diversity and the nursery function for English sole (Parophrys vetulus). Despite ever increasing nutrient inputs, hypoxia was highly variable in time and space, and was mediated by climate, specifically El Niño events that increase flushing through increased precipitation as well as suppressing upwelling that brings hypoxic water from the deep sea. The suppression of hypoxia through El Niño events was a consistent pattern across estuaries in the northeast Pacific, providing important insight as to how climate change will affect anthropogenic threats to ecosystem services provided by estuaries. My dissertation unravels some of the mysteries underlying ecosystem resilience in face of anthropogenic threats. Systems like Elkhorn Slough are critical for informing research and management as to how ecosystems function under intense stress. The rarity of available long-term data, along with the recovery of a foundation species - Zostera marina - and a model top predator - Enhydra lutris - made it possible to tease apart processes and mechanisms <b>driving</b> resilience over <b>meaningful</b> time scales. Furthermore, my dissertation highlights the importance of studying systems where resilience and recovery are occurring, as they will provide insight to inform management and policy in a world of increasing anthropogenic threats and changing climate...|$|R
40|$|Automated driving {{technologies}} {{promise a}} relief from stressful or frustrating driving situations. Fully-autonomous cars {{of the future}} are expected {{to take over the}} responsibilities of driving and allow the now inactive driver to perform much more engaging non-driving activities than ever before. However, the design space of the autonomous driving situation is uniquely different from traditional driving. For example, research on advanced driving automation systems have shown that the transfer of the driving task from the driver to the system can be experienced as a loss of autonomy and competency and may result in a feeling of being at the mercy of technology. Furthermore, the relationship with our cars is not only instrumental. The car is a personal artefact, an extension of the driver&rsquo;s body connoted with feelings of independence and power. The car&rsquo;s emancipation to an autonomous agent require a new basis of interacting with the inactive driver to facilitate a pleasurable and <b>meaningful</b> <b>driving</b> experience. On the other hand, the relief from the driving task provides a unique opportunity for new types of activities during the piloted journey, amongst them, new forms of in-situ entertainment and games that are grounded in the contextual specificity of the automotive, mobile situation. This leads to the research objectives: What type of activities can support autonomous driving as pleasurable and meaningful? How should they be implemented to compensate for the constraints and drawbacks of the autonomous driving situation, but also {{to take advantage of the}} unique affordances of this new technology? To answer those questions, I designed and developed three working prototypes with the goal to envision future autonomous driving as a pleasurable and meaningful activity. Based on a research-through-design approach, I explored the potentials of the design space of autonomous driving by systematically aligning the core-interactions of the prototypes with the contextual constraints of dense urban traffic. Furthermore, I studied the impact of the three prototypes on the driving experience in a simulator set up as well as in a series of in-car user studies. This exegesis introduces the three prototypes as design artefacts and reflects on the findings of the complementary user studies. In doing so, it articulates a novel frame for understanding autonomous driving as a future design challenge for contextual activities. This research contributes to the increasing importance of user experience and game design in the automotive domain. As such, the contribution is threefold: (1) As design artefacts, the prototypes articulate a desired future of driving experiences in autonomous cars. (2) As a contextual design practice, the research contributes intermediate knowledge in the form of novel ideation methods and implementation strategies of non-driving activities. (3) As a conceptual frame for understanding autonomous driving, I propose three motivational affordances of autonomous driving (that were tangible experiences of the prototypes) as targets for aligning non-driving activities. The three prototypes presented in this exegesis articulate a desired pleasurable vision of autonomous driving of the future. As an inspirational frame, the three prototypes are studied to gain experiential insights into the challenge of designing pleasurable and <b>meaningful</b> non- <b>driving</b> interactions in a future autonomous driving context...|$|R
