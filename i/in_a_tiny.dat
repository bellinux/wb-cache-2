5|$|Many, if {{not most}} Mauritians are unaware of the {{existence}} of such a graveyard in Mauritius. Each grave recalls the story of deportee life in an alien country, the result of mass deportation from Haifa by the British of refugees who escaped Nazi barbarity, only to find themselves in jail <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> British island colony where they died of disease instead of creating new lives for themselves in Palestine/Israel.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> nucleus {{at the center of the}} atom. Rutherford compared his findings to one firing a 15-inch shell at a sheet of tissue paper and it coming back to hit the person who fired it.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov, a {{conflicted}} former student, lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny,</b> rented room in Saint Petersburg. He refuses all help, {{even from}} his friend Razumikhin, and devises {{a plan to}} murder and rob an elderly pawn-broker and money-lender, Alyona Ivanovna. His motivation comes from the overwhelming sense that he is predetermined to kill the old woman by some power outside of himself. While still considering the plan, Raskolnikov makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Raskolnikov also receives a letter from his sister and mother, speaking of their coming visit to Saint Petersburg, and his sister's sudden marriage plans which they plan to discuss upon their arrival.|$|E

5|$|Streaks {{are common}} across Mars and new ones appear {{frequently}} on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark {{at first and}} get lighter with age. The streaks can start <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils. Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean Parliament is unicameral in nature, {{consisting}} of a single legislative body tasked with making laws. However, {{the notion of a}} second legislative chamber was considered on two separate occasions. In 1954, a constitutional commission headed by Sir George William Rendel rejected a proposal for a second chamber composed solely of minority representatives, citing its unsuitability <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> state like Singapore and arguing that it might end up being unnecessarily bureaucratic. It also asserted that such an upper House might potentially be detrimental to social cohesion. This issue was also considered by the Wee Chong Jin Commission, which rejected it on similar grounds.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter. It was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1905.

The two deliver freshly laundered clothing to the animals and birds in the neighbourhood. Potter thought the book would be best enjoyed by girls, and, like most girls' books of the period, it is set indoors with a focus on housework.|$|E
