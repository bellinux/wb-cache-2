5|$|The {{road to the}} Teutonic capital Marienburg now lay open, {{the city}} undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, Władysław hesitated to pursue his advantage. On 17 July, his army began a laboured advance, {{arriving}} at Marienburg only on 25 July, by which time the new Grand Master, Heinrich von Plauen, had organised a defence of the fortress. The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by Władysław on 19 September, has been ascribed variously to the impregnability of the fortifications, to high casualty figures among the Lithuanians, to Władysław's unwillingness to risk further casualties, or to his desire to keep the Order weakened but undefeated as to not upset {{the balance of power}} between Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation.|$|E

Now referred to as the Lohner 10.20A, the fuselage was again lengthened to 6.35m (20ft 10in), the I type struts were replaced with the more common twin struts with wire braces. The tail was completely redesigned with a fixed vertical fin and an even larger rudder.

25|$|Grey's Scouts were a Rhodesian mounted {{infantry}} unit {{raised in}} July 1975 and named after George Grey, a prominent {{soldier in the}} Second Matabele War.

The unit was disbanded on 11 November 1979 (following the conclusion of the Bush War in 1979) and then became a regiment of the Special Forces of Zimbabwe in June 1980. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> disbanded in July 1986 because of lack of resources.|$|E
25|$|Somma's first league {{start for}} Leeds {{came in the}} match against Doncaster Rovers, Somma {{received}} {{the man of the}} match award after putting in an impressive performance where he hit the crossbar and also had a goal ruled out for offside. Somma scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season against Preston North End. He scored his seventh goal of the season with a left footed volley against Middlesbrough. In November 2010, Somma entered contract negotiations with Leeds over extending his contract, signing a three-year deal on 9 November. In December 2010, after reports circulated in South Africa that Somma had joined Swansea City on loan, Leeds denied the story and said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> incorrect. After a spell out of the side, Somma came on as a substitute on 8 January against Arsenal. Leeds were 1–0 up when Robert Snodgrass scored a second half penalty, Arsenal equalised in the 90th minute when Cesc Fàbregas scored a penalty.|$|E

When asked about the video, Levine said: [...] "It was surprisingly not weird and surprisingly not sexual. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> comfortable.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the untrained pilots of the 31st Fighter Regiment, those of the 4th Fighter Regiment were able to claim three German high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft shot down before war broke out in June 1941. However, high-altitude combat of this sort was to prove to be uncommon on the Eastern Front where most air-to-air engagements were at altitudes well below [...] At these altitudes the MiG-3 was outclassed by the Bf 109 in all respects, and even by other new Soviet fighters such as the Yakovlev Yak-1. Furthermore, the shortage of ground-attack aircraft in 1941 forced it into that role as well, for which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> unsuited.|$|E
500|$|While the Beats {{continued}} to congregate at the Black Cat into the 1950s, {{in the years}} following World War II, more and more gay people began patronizing it. The varied crowds mixed and gay Beat poet Allen Ginsberg described the Black Cat as [...] "the best gay bar in America. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> open, bohemian, San Francisco...and everybody went there, heterosexual and homosexual....All the gay screaming queens would come, the heterosexual gray flannel suit types, longshoremen.

500|$|The Americans {{were pulling}} out of Southeast Asia as quickly as {{negotiations}} with the North Vietnamese would allow them. Ambassador Godley, stunned by the diplomatic developments, ruminated that [...] "We had led him (Souvanna) down the garden path. Let's face it, we were cutting and running... Once {{we were out of}} Vietnam the only way we could have protected Laos was with an Army corps. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> out of the question and we knew it. We were licked." [...] Souvanna then faced a dilemma, sign a separate agreement with the Pathet Lao on almost any terms, or continue the war with no prospect of success. Hanoi was also desirious to obtain a quick agreement with Vientiane. The sooner the fighting in Laos ceased, the sooner the Hanoi would obtain unimpeded use of the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

500|$|CMH {{distributor}} World's Fair promoted The Return of Dr. Octagon as {{the official}} sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst, and claimed that Thornton would tour {{in support of the}} album. Early news stories reported by outlets such as The Guardian, MTV2, MySpace, Remix Magazine, and The Washington Post endorsed the label's claims. Internet rumors began to spread that the album had been released without Thornton's authorization via {{what turned out to be}} an unsubstantiated piece of journalism by David Downs. In August, Thornton performed under the Dr. Octagon billing, but did not promote the album. According to Thornton, [...] "This ain't the record I did. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> new music. I was really pissed off about people wanting me to go out and tour and do these songs." [...] OCD originally intended to ship 50,000 units during the first year, but halted the plan due to the remarkably high volume of downloads received by the online remixes.|$|E
500|$|Kesha was {{inspired}} to write the song after continual rejection from the protagonist in the song, Stephen, who refused to call the singer. She told MTV [...] "I wrote [...] about this guy that I've been stalking since I was, like, 15, but he's a total loser, so I don't want to glorify him in any way, but I'm really excited for the song." [...] In February 2010, {{after the release of}} the song, Stephen attended one of the singer's concerts. Speaking to Total Access on 96.4FM The Wave, the singer recalled the experience saying [...] "he came to see my show at this huge gay bar in New York and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> off the chain. He gets up on stage, takes all his clothes off except his underwear and starts making out with a tranny. I was like, 'Wait a minute, have I been barking up the wrong genre of tree?'" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue {{had written a}} track for Hot Chip. He told NME, [...] "Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our {{management}} to us– <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> bizarre. It was {{the beginnings of a}} track– I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after Made in the Dark." [...] Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear. Goddard said, [...] "We've been telling lots of lies and rumours about it because we found it quite funny." ...|$|E

And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it.

500|$|The {{song was}} an early feature of Aerosmith's concerts and a {{frequent}} show closer, including for their first gig in 1970. [...] They wanted to record a live version of the song, but producer Jack Douglas persuaded them to record a studio version, which actually consisted of two {{different versions of the}} song. [...] The first part was slower, [...] "more groove-oriented", while the second was a spirited rocker. [...] To give the second part more of a live sound, Douglas overdubbed crowd noise from The Concert for Bangladesh, the 1971 benefit organized by George Harrison. [...] Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, who worked with Lou Reed and Alice Cooper, were brought in to record the guitar parts. [...] According to Hunter, [...] "We [...] wanted to keep the solos equal so we'd sit down... and go through the material so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> even... We didn't want it to look like there was a rhythm guitar player and a lead guitar player, because that's what we both did". [...] Hunter later elaborated: ...|$|E
