HDMI is a digital replacement for analog video standards.|$|E

25|$|On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed Apple Computer (now called Apple Inc.) {{along with}} {{administrative}} supervisor Ronald Wayne, whose {{participation in the}} new venture was short lived. Wozniak resigned from his job at Hewlett-Packard and became the {{vice president in charge}} of research and development at Apple. Wozniak's Apple I was similar to the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer, except the Apple I had no provision for internal expansion cards. With expansion cards the Altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in BASIC. In contrast, the Apple I was a hobbyist machine. Wozniak's design included a $25 microprocessor (MOS 6502) on a single circuit board with 256 bytes of ROM, 4K or 8K bytes of RAM, and a 40-character by 24-row <b>display</b> <b>controller.</b> Apple's first computer lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, and display, all components the user had to provide.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, AMD/ATI {{released}} its Radeon HD 5000 Series which included an AMD Eyefinity-branded <b>display</b> <b>controllers.</b> These <b>display</b> <b>controllers</b> allow users to use 3 or more monitors {{on a single}} video card, using at least one display port {{on the back of}} the card.|$|R

5000|$|Video <b>Display</b> <b>controllers</b> can {{be divided}} in several {{different}} types, listed here from simplest to most complex; ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the machine was a Motorola 68000 microprocessor running at , connected to 128KB RAM shared by the processor and the <b>display</b> <b>controller.</b> The boot procedure and some operating system routines were contained in an additional [...] ROM chip. Apple did not offer RAM upgrades. Unlike the Apple II, no source code listings of the Macintosh system ROMs were offered.|$|E
2500|$|The Model A had 16KB of user RAM, {{while the}} Model B had 32KB. A feature that the Micro shared with other 6502 {{computers}} {{such as the}} Apple and the early Commodore models was that the RAM was clocked {{twice as fast as}} the CPU, with alternating access given to the CPU and the video <b>display</b> <b>controller.</b> This gave the BBC Micro a fully unified memory address structure without speed penalties. To use the CPU at full speed (2MHz) required the memory system to be capable of performing four million access cycles per second. [...] Hitachi was the only company, at the time, that made a DRAM that went that fast. So for the prototype the only four 4816s in the country got hand-carried by the rep. Most competing microcomputers with memory-mapped display incurred CPU speed penalties depending on the actions of the video circuits (e.g. the Amstrad CPC {{and to a lesser extent}} the ZX Spectrum) or kept video memory completely separate from the CPU address pool (e.g. the MSX).|$|E
2500|$|In {{color mode}} (when lit {{primarily}} from the rear), the display does not use the common RGB pixel geometry for liquid crystal computer displays, in which each pixel contains three tall thin rectangles of the primary colors. Instead, the XO-1 display provides one color for each pixel. The colors align along diagonals that run from upper-right to lower left (see diagram on the right). To reduce the color artifacts caused by this pixel geometry, the color component of the image is blurred by the <b>display</b> <b>controller</b> as the image {{is sent to the}} screen. Despite the color blurring, the display still has high resolution for its physical size; normal displays [...] put about 588(H)×441(V) to 882(H)×662(V) pixels in this amount of physical area and support subpixel rendering for slightly higher perceived resolution. A Philips Research study measured the XO-1 display's perceived color resolution as effectively 984(H)×738(V). A conventional liquid crystal display with the same number of green pixels (green carries most brightness or luminance information for human eyes) as the OLPC XO-1 would be 693×520. Unlike a standard RGB LCD, resolution of the XO-1 display varies with angle. Resolution is greatest from upper-right to lower left, and lowest from upper-left to lower-right. Images which approach or exceed this resolution will lose detail and gain color artifacts. The display gains resolution when in bright light; this comes at the expense of color (as the backlight is overpowered) and color resolution can never reach the full 200 dpi sharpness of grayscale mode because of the blur which is applied to images in color mode.|$|E

50|$|For example, a VGA-signal, {{which is}} created by the <b>display</b> <b>controller,</b> is being transported over a VGA-cable to the display. Both ends of the cable end in a VGA connector.

But since all of this logic is usually found on the chip of a graphics processing unit and usually not available separately to the end-customer there is much confusion about these very different functional blocks.|$|E
