25|$|Round 1 – Caïna: {{this round}} {{is named after}} Cain, who killed his own brother in the first act of murder (Gen. 4:8). This round houses the Traitors to their Kindred: they have their necks and heads out of the ice and allowed to bow their heads, {{allowing}} some protection from the <b>freezing</b> <b>wind.</b> Here Dante sees the brothers Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti, who killed each other over their inheritance and their politics some time between 1282 and 1286. Camiscion de' Pazzi, a Ghibelline who murdered his kinsman Ubertino, identifies several other sinners: Mordred (traitorous nephew of King Arthur); Vanni de' Cancellieri, nicknamed Focaccia (a White Guelph of Pistoia who killed his cousin, Detto de' Cancellieri); and Sassol Mascheroni of the noble Toschi family of Florence (murdered a relative). Camicion is aware that, in July 1302, his relative Carlino de' Pazzi would accept a bribe to surrender the Castle of Piantravigne to the Blacks, betraying the Whites. As a traitor to his party, Carlino belongs in Antenora, the next circle down – his greater sin will make Camiscion look virtuous by comparison.|$|E

60|$|As for her passion, it grew almost unrestrainable in its confinement. Now {{she drifted}} like a rudderless vessel on a sea which raged {{continuously}} and knew no space of calm. And so little oil was poured upon the troubled waters, {{there were so}} few breaks in the storm-walls that rose black {{between her and the}} desired haven of her rest. Indeed, she began to doubt if even her poor power of charming him, as at first she had been able to do, with the sparkle of her wit and the half- unconscious display of her natural grace, was not on the wane, and if she was not near to losing her precarious foothold in his esteem and affection. The thought that he might be tiring of her struck her like a <b>freezing</b> <b>wind,</b> and for a moment turned her heart to ice.|$|E
60|$|In 1876, on {{the evening}} of December 29, an express train of the Lake Shore Railroad, broke through the bridge at Ashtabula, and plunged seventy-five feet down into the bed of the creek below. The train was of eleven cars with a hundred and fifty-six {{passengers}} on board, and the bridge was further strained by the weight of the two massive locomotives which drew it. The night was extremely cold, and a blinding snow storm was raging, while the <b>freezing</b> <b>wind</b> blew a gale. The wreck at once took fire, and with the cries of the wounded were now mingled the agonized prayers of those who saw themselves doomed to death in the blazing ruins which imprisoned them. Nearly every one on the train was hurt more or less severely; eighty persons perished in the fall or the fire, and five died after they were rescued.|$|E
60|$|But {{this loss}} of the candles brought home to them the steady {{lengthening}} of the nights. Scarcely seven hours of day remained now in the black, cold grip of the darkness. And through those seventeen hours of chill aggression they had no light but the red glow of the stove. She had {{to close the door}} of the hut and bar every chink and cranny against the icy air, that became at last a murderous, <b>freezing</b> <b>wind.</b> Not only did she line the hut with every scrap of skin and paper she could obtain, but she went out with the spade toiling for three laborious afternoons in piling and beating snow against the outer frame. And now it was that Trafford talked at last, talked with something of the persistence of delirium, and she sat and listened hour by hour, silently, for he gave no heed to her or to anything she might say. He talked, it seemed, to God....|$|E
5000|$|... 2007 Northern Hemisphere {{cold wave}} - All of Canada {{and most of}} the United States {{underwent}} a freeze after a two-week warming that took place in late March and early April.

50|$|Even though Priorat DOQ {{covers a}} small area, {{there are several}} {{different}} micro-climates present. Generally, the climate is more extreme than most continental climate areas, {{though there is a}} marked contrast between the valleys and the higher areas.

60|$|Though Ruth {{gave this}} mandate to her daughter, {{she did not}} the less neglect to {{exercise}} her own faculties in the same grateful office. While the children went, as they were ordered, to the outer gate, the matron herself ascended to the lower apartment of the block, and, from its different loops, she took a long and anxious survey of the limited prospect. The shadows of the trees, that lined {{the western side of}} the view, were already thrown far across the broad sheet of frozen snow, and the sudden chill which succeeded the disappearance of the sun announced the rapid approach of a night that promised to support the severe character of the past day. A <b>freezing</b> <b>wind,</b> which had brought with it the cold airs of the great lakes, and which had even triumphed over the more natural influence of an April sun, had however fallen, leaving a temperature not unlike that which dwells in the milder seasons of the year among the glaciers of the upper Alps.|$|E
60|$|She {{had set out}} at {{an early}} hour, but had lingered on the road, {{inclined}} by her indolence {{to believe that if}} she waited under a warm shed the snow would cease to fall. She had waited longer than she knew, and now that she found herself belated in the snow-hidden ruggedness of the long lanes, even the animation of a vindictive purpose could not keep her spirit from failing. It was seven o'clock, and by this time she was not very far from Raveloe, but she was not familiar enough with those monotonous lanes to know how near she was to her journey's end. She needed comfort, and she knew but one comforter--the familiar demon in her bosom; but she hesitated a moment, after drawing out the black remnant, before she raised it to her lips. In that moment the mother's love pleaded for painful consciousness rather than oblivion--pleaded to be left in aching weariness, rather than to have the encircling arms benumbed so that they could not feel the dear burden. In another moment Molly had flung something away, but it was not the black remnant--it was an empty phial. And she walked on again under the breaking cloud, from which there came now and then the light of a quickly veiled star, for a <b>freezing</b> <b>wind</b> had sprung up since the snowing had ceased. But she walked always more and more drowsily, and clutched more and more automatically the sleeping child at her bosom.|$|E

While Richmond tried to pick up the ball, Collingwood followed the instructions of coach Jock McHale by “marking on the chest, not out in front” and “kicking the ball off the ground wherever possible”.

Both goals came from mistakes by the Richmond backmen.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the issues}} facing climbers is the {{frequent}} presence of high-speed winds.

Climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window {{in the spring and}} fall when the Asian monsoon season is either starting up or ending and the winds are lighter. The air pressure at the summit is about one-third what it is at sea level, and by Bernoulli's principle, the winds can lower the pressure further, causing an additional 14 percent reduction in oxygen to climbers. The reduction in oxygen availability comes from the reduced overall pressure, not a reduction in the ratio of oxygen to other gases.|$|R
