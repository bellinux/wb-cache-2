Kenner, who had already released toys for the cartoon series, produced several tie <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> for the film, including Joker and the Phantasm (packaged unmasked, spoiling a pivotal plot point in the film). Batman & Robin Adventures Annual #1: Shadow of the Phantasm was a comic book sequel to the film. It was written by Dini and released in 1996. In 2015, a DC Collectibles action figure 2-pack featuring Batman and Phantasm was released.|$|E

5|$|Some common {{structures}} are shown <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> 3 and 4, {{along with their}} lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E

25|$|Each duplex {{sequencing}} read {{contains a}} fixed 5-nucleotide sequence (shown <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> in Black color) located upstream of the 12-nucleotide tag sequence. The reads are filtered {{out if they}} do not have the expected 5-nucleotide sequence or have more than nine identical or ambiguous bases within each tag. The two 12-nucleotide tags at each end of reads are combined and moved to the read header. Two families of reads are formed that originate from the two strands of DNA. One family contains reads with αβ header originating from strand 1 and the second family contains reads with βα header originating from strand 2 (Figure 2). Then the reads are trimmed by removing the fixed 5 bp sequence and 4 error prone nucleotides located at the sites of ligation and end repair. The remaining reads are assembled to consensus sequences using single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) assembly and duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly.|$|E
25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E
25|$|Compulsory figures {{formerly}} {{accounted for}} up to 60% of the score in singles figure skating, which meant that skaters who could build up a big lead <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> could win competitions {{even if they were}} mediocre free skaters. As television coverage of skating events became more important, so did free skating. Beginning in 1968, the ISU began to progressively reduce the weight of figures and introduced the short program in 1973. With these changes, the emphasis in competitive figure skating shifted to increasing athleticism. By the 1980s, some skaters began practicing quadruple jumps. Jozef Sabovcik of Czechoslovakia landed a quad toe loop at the 1986 European Championships which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later due to a touchdown with his free foot. At the 1988 World Championships, Kurt Browning of Canada landed the first quad toe loop which has remained ratified. Although it was expected that quads would soon become an important part of men's skating, it was a number of years before this happened. Japan's Midori Ito landed the first triple axel by a woman. Worth only 20% by 1989, figures were eliminated entirely from international competition in 1990.|$|E

Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15."

500|$|There {{are also}} {{significant}} differences <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> from various sources. John Erickson, in his Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies, gives {{a figure of}} 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942. Glantz, in his book When Titans Clashed, gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7 January 1942. The estimate of 400,000 German casualties by January 1942 reported in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia was published in 1973–78. [...] On the other hand, official Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Center between 1 October 1941 and 10 January 1942. However, this official report does not match unofficial reports from individual battalion and divisional officers and commanders at the front, who record suffering far higher casualties than was officially reported.|$|E

500|$|Thayer's close {{observation}} led him {{to notice}} what scientists such as Edward Bagnall Poulton {{were just beginning to}} describe. This was that many animals were [...] "painted" [...] the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity <b>in</b> <b>figures.</b> A canvas is flat, and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat. To make a body appear to have depth and solidity, the artist paints in shadows on the body itself. The top of an animal's back, facing the sky, remains bright, while it must become darker towards its underside. Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading, nature could and did make animals appear flat. He was so passionate about this [...] "concealing coloration" [...] theory that he called it his [...] "second child". Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars, but he had not realized that the phenomenon was widespread, and he championed Thayer's theory in a 1902 article in Nature.|$|E
500|$|Corrugated-waveguide filters, {{also called}} ridged-waveguide filters, {{consist of a}} number of ridges, or teeth, that {{periodically}} reduce the internal height of the waveguide as shown <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> 10 and 11. [...] They are used in applications which simultaneously require a wide passband, good passband matching, and a wide stopband. [...] They are essentially low-pass designs (above the usual limitation of the cutoff frequency), unlike most other forms which are usually band-pass. [...] The distance between teeth is much smaller than the typical λ/4 distance between elements of other filter designs. [...] Typically, they are designed by the image parameter method with all ridges identical, but other classes of filter such as Chebyshev can be achieved in exchange for complexity of manufacture. [...] In the image design method the equivalent circuit of the ridges is modelled as a cascade of LC half sections. [...] The filter operates in the dominant TE10 mode, but spurious modes can be a problem when they are present. [...] In particular, there is little stopband attenuation of TE20 and TE30 modes.|$|E
500|$|The trophy has the {{engraving}} [...] "FIFA World Cup" [...] on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup a plate {{was added to}} the bottom side of the trophy on which the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright.

In 2010, however, the name of the winning nation was engraved as [...] "2010 Spain", in English, not in Spanish. As of 2014, eleven winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners, with Spain on later occasions written in Spanish ("España"). FIFA's regulations now state that the trophy, unlike its predecessor, cannot be won outright: the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. Germany was the first nation to win the new trophy for the third time in 2014.|$|E
