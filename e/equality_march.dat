500|$|Gaga {{spoke at}} the 2009 National <b>Equality</b> <b>March</b> in Washington {{in support of the}} LGBT movement. She {{attended}} the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards accompanied by four gay and lesbian former members of the United States Armed Forces who had been unable to serve openly under the US military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy, which banned open homosexuality in the military. Gaga urged her fans via YouTube to contact their senators in an effort to overturn the policy. In September 2010, she spoke at a Servicemembers Legal Defense Network's rally in Portland, Maine. Following this event, The Advocate named her a [...] "fierce advocate" [...] for gays and lesbians. Gaga appeared at Europride, an international event dedicated to LGBT pride, in Rome in June 2011. She criticized the poor state of gay rights in many European countries and described gay people as [...] "revolutionaries of love". Gaga was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church Monastery so that she could officiate the wedding of two female friends. In June 2016, during a vigil held in Los Angeles for victims of the attack at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Gaga read aloud the names of the 49 people killed in the attack, and gave a speech. Later that month, Gaga appeared in Human Rights Campaign's tribute video to the victims of the attack. She has opposed the presidency of Donald Trump and criticized him for his military transgender ban. She publicly supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 presidential {{election}} campaign, Senator Barack Obama advocated a full {{repeal of the}} laws barring gays and lesbians from serving in the military. Nineteen days after his election, Obama's advisers announced that plans to repeal the policy might be delayed until 2010, because Obama [...] "first wants to confer with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his new political appointees at the Pentagon to reach a consensus, and then present legislation to Congress". As president he advocated a policy change to allow gay personnel to serve openly in the armed forces, stating that the U.S. government has {{spent millions of dollars}} replacing troops expelled from the military, including language experts fluent in Arabic, because of DADT. On the eve of the National <b>Equality</b> <b>March</b> in Washington, D.C., October 10, 2009, Obama stated in a speech before the Human Rights Campaign that he would end the ban, but he offered no timetable. Obama said in his 2010 State of the Union Address: [...] "This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are." [...] This statement was quickly followed up by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Michael Mullen voicing their support for a repeal of DADT.|$|E

5000|$|Bathing and sunbathing in {{the nude}} (including topless) is legal on Danish beaches. Nudity and toplessness in other public outdoor places is {{generally}} also legal, unless it is involves [...] "offensive conduct" [...] or is likely to cause public outrage. The public outrage law is rarely used in practice, but in 1972 audience members were convicted of being nude in the Royal Danish Theatre. In December 2007, {{a group of women}} and men calling themselves Topless Front swam topless in public swim baths to promote topless <b>equality.</b> In <b>March</b> 2008, after a campaign by the group, Copenhagen's Culture and Leisure Committee voted to allow topless bathing in its swimming pools. After the Committee had voted, it was revealed that no laws had existed against topless bathing, effectively making the vote unnecessary. However, some public baths had (and have) restricted it themselves. Public breastfeeding is supported by the vast majority of both sexes in Denmark, is entirely legal and accepted almost all places, except for a few private cafés and restaurants that have restricted it.|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} the legislative journey toward <b>equality</b> which in <b>March</b> 2014 saw the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 giving lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people (LGBT) almost parity with heterosexuals before the law. The major focus is {{the exploration of}} key legislation {{that has been in}} place and the impact this has had on the LGBT community, particularly gay men; a history that is sometimes forgotten. Lesbians have not been subject to the law {{in the same way as}} gay men although it is clear that the impact of legislation against men has had consequences for women in terms of for example, inheritance, marriage and indeed the way they lived their lives. I will consider why lesbians have been almost invisible before the law and how their behaviour was policed. A theme of the work is that legislation not only defines legality but it also seems to be important in terms of setting out a state's attitude to equality and particular groups. It can signal the move from state homophobia to state recognition. At the same time the changing of attitudes, relationships of power and inequality take more to shift than legislation alone can achieve. Finally, I will consider if the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 is a step in the right direction on the road to LGBT equality. Have the latest developments in legislation brought genuine equality and choice within a traditionally patriarchal society or will the LGBT community become just another consumer group with the ‘pink pound’, now to be sold ‘gay weddings’...|$|R
50|$|On February 11, 2015, two {{conservative}} groups, the Alabama Policy Institute and the Alabama Citizens Action Program, filed {{a lawsuit}} asking the Alabama Supreme Court to order the state's probate judges to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The suit targeted all the state's probate judges, but identified only four of them by name. On February 13, Equality Alabama filed an amicus brief asking the Alabama Supreme Court to dismiss the Alabama Policy Institute's lawsuit. It argued that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a specific injury they had suffered and were seeking improperly to {{assume the role of}} state officials. The Court gave the four named defendants until February 18 to file briefs, allowing the plaintiffs until 10 am February 23 to respond. One defendant, Judge Davis, argued that the lawsuit assumed no probate judge was subject to Granade's orders and could not apply to him now that he was a defendant in Strawser. Judges Alan King and Tommy Ragland offered arguments much like those of <b>Equality</b> Alabama. On <b>March</b> 3, the court ruled in a 7 to 1 decision that the plaintiffs had standing and that Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage does not violate the U.S. Constitution. It ordered all probate judges to conform to Alabama law and deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The court asked Judge Davis, since he was subject to Granade's orders, to explain by March 5 whether he was required to issue licenses to same-sex couples in addition to those he had already issued to the Strawser plaintiffs as required by the federal court. On that date, Davis asked the court for additional 10 days to respond. On March 11, the court rejected Davis' request for an extension and ordered him not to issue any additional marriage licenses to same-sex couples.|$|R
