5|$|The King Charles Spaniel and {{the other}} types of toy spaniels were {{crossbred}} with the Pug in the early 19th century {{to reduce the size}} of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> flat face.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of the}} head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|Her next film, Ragat'e Anak (For The Sake of Children), {{dealt with}} the lives of two {{part-time}} prostitutes in a cemetery in Tulungagung, East Java. The documentary was included in Pertaruhan (At Stake), a compilation of works produced by the Kalyana Shira Foundation. In August 2006, Ucu released a short story compilation, Dunia di Kepala Alice (The World in Alice's <b>Head),</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> novel, Being Ing. On 4 June 2009, the Tulungagung government shut down the prostitution district {{as a result of}} the documentary; in response, Ucu said that she regretted the decision.|$|E

5|$|In {{iconographic}} {{representations of}} the myth of Shiva vis-à-vis Vishnu, Sharabha form has been built around Narasimha but substantially embellished with wings to represent Kali and Durga to denote the female powers (shaktis) of Shiva; Sharabha is also shown with a bird <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> serpent in his beak head.|$|E
5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third avatar Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main {{difference in the}} anthropomorphic form portrayal {{is that the first}} two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and the bottom half as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E

5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on its <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Zarudny and Härms {{described}} a subspecies, rubripersonatus, from Baluchistan in 1902. This was {{described a}}s having a deeper reddish orange skin on the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> yellow-tipped dark bill. This has rarely been considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill colouration suggests intermixing of subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey differs in coloration from South American {{squirrel monkey}}s. While South American squirrel monkeys {{tend to be}} primarily greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap {{at the top of}} the <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E

5|$|The Murray cod {{is a large}} grouper-like {{fish with}} a deep, {{elongated}} body that is round in cross section. It has a broad, scooped <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large mouth lined with pads of very small, needle-like teeth. The jaws of the Murray cod are equal, or the lower jaw protrudes slightly.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the <b>head),</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> black band {{on the upper}} back. The wing coverts and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has mostly}} pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. It {{differs from the}} house sparrow in its {{slightly}} darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.|$|E

5|$|Two other waders can be {{confused}} with the ruff. The juvenile sharp-tailed sandpiper is a little smaller than a juvenile female ruff and has a similar rich orange-buff breast, but the ruff is slimmer with a longer neck and legs, a rounder <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> much plainer face. The buff-breasted sandpiper also resembles a small juvenile ruff, but even the female ruff is noticeably larger than the sandpiper, with a longer bill, more rotund body and scaly-patterned upperparts.|$|E
5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti or Vaikuntha Vishnu is a four-headed {{aspect of}} the Hindu god Vishnu, mostly found in Kashmir (northern part of the Indian subcontinent). The icon {{represents}} Vishnu as the Supreme Being. He has a human head, a lion head, a boar <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> demonic head. Sometimes, even three-headed aspects of Vishnu where the demonic rear head is dropped are considered to represent Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though iconographical treatises describe him to eight-armed, he is often depicted with four. Generally, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing but sometimes he is depicted seated on his vahana (mount) Garuda.|$|E
5|$|Class II {{stones are}} {{carefully}} shaped slabs dating after {{the arrival of}} Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.|$|E
