25|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} of the torture chamber of the papal palace at Avignon, used during the Inquisition, {{has been described as}} ingenious. The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of Acoustics, specifically designed to muffle the screams and cries of the tortured. The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect the screams of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior. A chamber located above the main torture chamber had a dungeon with a hole near {{the middle of the floor}} through which, according to accounts, the tortured bodies of the prisoners were thrown into a cavity. The chamber where the victims were being burnt was of circular construction and resembled the furnace of a <b>glass-house</b> with a funnel-like chimney at the top.|$|E
500|$|The House is {{surrounded}} by [...] of gardens and approached by a tree-lined drive of mature sweet chestnut, walnut and cherry trees. There is a walled sunken garden and kitchen garden has raised vegetable beds, a <b>glass-house</b> and box knot garden. Many of the walls, gatepiers and the balustrade are from the 16th century but have been revised in the subsequent centuries. The old tennis court has been converted to a formal lawn with herbaceous borders. There is also a stone summerhouse which is early Jacobean.|$|E
2500|$|On New Years Day 2006, the Oakville winery {{experienced}} a major flood from the Napa River. The following month, on February 2, 2006, the Oakville winery was devastated by a fire which destroyed the dairy barn, the original structure on the property. At {{the time of}} the fire, the Duncan Family decided to rebuild the Oakville winery from the ground up. The rebuild began in 2007 and was completed in October 2008. President and CEO David Duncan said {{at the opening of the}} new Silver Oak Oakville winery, [...] "Though the fire was devastating, it presented us with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We were able to take 35 years of experience in winemaking and hospitality and apply it to create an ideal space for making our Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and entertaining our guests." [...] David Duncan said, [...] "The new winery is a winemaker's dream. We incorporated all the technological advancements of recent years into the winery's design but made sure we could accommodate changes down the line." [...] The rebuild included using some 550 tons of reclaimed stone from a 115-year-old dismantled mill in Coffeyville, Kansas, installing 1,464 solar panels to generate solar power for the facility, elevating the property 4.5 feet above the flood plain and moving their iconic water tower 12 feet. The Duncan Family was able to salvage the two stained glass windows in the original winery that had been created by local artist Diane Peterson in the theme of the Napa Valley. With the rebuild of the winery, they asked Diane Peterson to create two new stained glass windows. [...] Together, the windows represent the four seasons. In the tasting room, adjacent to the new tasting bar, built from white oak which had previously been a barn in Missouri, is a <b>glass-house</b> library displaying Silver Oak wines dating back to the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The complex {{consists}} of several buildings and <b>glass-houses,</b> {{such as the}} Cactus Pavilion and the Pavilion Victoria (which features a collection of orchids, carnivorous plants and giant white water lily Victoria-Seerosen).

50|$|The {{nurseries}} {{which are}} about 300 {{feet above the}} lower lawns, consist of eight <b>glass-houses</b> {{and a series of}} terraces for introduction and breeding of exotic plants. The <b>glass-houses</b> are utilized for growing Begonias, Ferns, Cacti, Succulents, Orchids and Bulbous plants for providing a continuous supply of potted plants to be grouped periodically in the conservatories. The terraces are utilised for growing plants for cut flowers, seed and also for trial purposes.|$|R
50|$|Jovanovitch's formal {{schooling}} began 2 {{years later}} at Newtown Infants School, {{and then at}} Mona Vale Infants School when his parents moved to Warriewood where they owned a house and farmland.

60|$|In a <b>glass-house</b> {{the workmen}} often fling {{in a small}} {{quantity}} of fresh coals, which seems to disturb the fire, but very much enlivens it. This seems to allude to a gentle stirring of the passions, that the mind may not languish.|$|E
60|$|On {{the sandy}} shore, {{opposite}} the <b>Glass-house</b> village in Chelmsford, at the Great Bend where we landed to rest us and gather a few wild plums, we discovered the Campanula rotundifolia, a new flower to us, the harebell of the poets, which {{is common to}} both hemispheres, growing close to the water. Here, in the shady branches of an apple-tree on the sand, we took our nooning, where {{there was not a}} zephyr to disturb the repose of this glorious Sabbath day, and we reflected serenely on the long past and successful labors of Latona.|$|E

60|$|The {{fourth year}} of his {{residence}} as a mechanic in London was {{the year of the}} Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of this huge <b>glass-house,</b> then unexampled in the world's history, he worked daily. It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and industries. Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the movement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity. Yet for him, too, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of getting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies had been witnessed, and people were flocking thither {{from all parts of the}} globe, he received a letter from Car'line. Till that day the silence of four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken.|$|E
6000|$|The {{height of}} the Tenerife Pike, once held the loftiest in the world, is 12,198 feet, in round numbers 12,200. Thus it stands nearly at the {{altitude}} of Mont Blanc (15,784 feet) above the Chamounix valley, a figure of 12,284 feet. The slope from the base is 1 in 4.6. The direct distance from Orotava on the map measures 10.5 miles; along the road 18, according to the guides. The terminal chimney and outlet for vapours which would erupt elsewhere, rises 520 feet from its pedestal, the central Rambleta, and its ascent generally occupies an hour. One visitor has reduced this montagne pelée to 60-70 feet, and compares it with the dome of a <b>glass-house.</b> From below it resembles {{nothing so much as}} a cone of dirty brown cassonade, and travellers are justified in calling it a sugarloaf. I can hardly rest satisfied with Von Buch's description. 'Teyde is a pointed tower surrounded by a ditch and a circular chain of bastions.' ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the evening}} of his {{presentation}} day his Excellency the Fantaisian Ambassador and suite honoured the national theatre with their presence. Such a house was never known! The pit was miraculously over-flown before the doors were opened, although the proprietor did not permit a single private entrance. The enthusiasm was universal, and only twelve persons were killed. The Private Secretary told Popanilla, {{with an air of}} great complacency, that the Vraibleusian theatres were the largest in the world. Popanilla had little doubt of the truth of this information, as a long time elapsed before he could even discover the stage. He observed that every person in the theatre carried a long black glass, which he kept perpetually fixed to his eye. To sit in a huge room hotter than a <b>glass-house,</b> in a posture emulating the most sanctified Faquir, with a throbbing head-ache, a breaking back, and twisted legs, with a heavy tube held over one eye, and the other covered with the unemployed hand, is in Vraibleusia called a public amusement.|$|E

It is situated behind the University Medical Centre, and includes a garden area of about 1 ha of which about 1000 m2 is occupied by <b>glass-houses.</b> Since 1988, the Hortus no longer has an educational function, but the property is still owned and supported by the university.|$|R
50|$|After the owner's death {{several months}} later, Catherine II {{purchased}} his palace and ordered architect Fyodor Volkov to {{transform it into}} her summer townhouse. Volkov was responsible for many improvements in the grounds, including {{the construction of the}} theatre in the east wing and the church in the west wing. In the garden, he designed the Admiralty Pavilion, gardener house, orangery, <b>glass-houses,</b> bridges, and ironwork fences. The sculpture named the Venus Tauride (now in the Hermitage Museum) was kept in the palace {{from the end of the}} eighteenth century until the mid-nineteenth, and derives its name from it.|$|R
60|$|To divide {{a little}} this incumbrance among my friends, I caused {{a number of}} similar tubes to be blown at our <b>glass-house,</b> with which they furnish'd themselves, so that we had at length several performers. Among these, the {{principal}} was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbor, who, being out of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which the experiments were rang'd in such order, and accompanied with such explanations in such method, as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following. He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, {{in which all the}} little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicely form'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he went thro' the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd up some money. In the West India islands, indeed, it was with difficulty the experiments could be made, from the general moisture of the air.|$|E
60|$|And {{then this}} dance {{to which she}} was going! The thought of {{what she would do}} there troubled her. Would anyone ask her to dance? Would Charley think of her when he had so many grown-up girls, girls quite grown up, all around him? It would be very sad if at this London party it should be her fate to sit down the whole evening and see others dance. It would suffice for her, she thought, if she could stand up with Linda, but she had an idea that this would not be allowed at a London party; and then Linda, perhaps, might not like it. Altogether she had much upon her mind, and was {{beginning}} to think that, perhaps, she might have been happier to have stayed at home with her mamma. She had not quite recovered from the effect of her toss into the water, or the consequent excitement, and a very little misery would upset her. And so she walked on with her Napoleonic companion, from whom she {{did not know how to}} free herself, through one <b>glass-house</b> after another, across lawns and along paths, attempting every now and then to get a word with Linda, and not at all so happy as she had hoped to have been.|$|E
60|$|That {{the first}} of these is true may be {{gathered}} from this, That Heat is a property of a body arising from the motion or agitation of its parts; and therefore whatever body is thereby toucht must necessarily receive some part of that motion, whereby its parts will be shaken and agitated, and so by degrees free and extricate themselves from one another, and each part so moved does by that motion exert a conatus of protruding and displacing all the adjacent Particles. Thus Air included in a vessel, by being heated will burst it to pieces. Thus have I broke a Bladder held over the fire in my hand, with such a violence and noise, that it almost made me deaf for the present, and much surpassed the noise of a Musket: The like have I done by throwing into the fire small glass Bubbles hermetically sealed, with a little drop of Water included in them. Thus Water also, or any other Liquor, included in a convenient vessel, by being warmed, manifestly expands it self with a very great violence, so as to break the strongest vessel, if when heated it be narrowly imprisoned in it. This is very manifest by the Sealed Thermometers, which I have, by several tryals, at last brought to a great certainty and tenderness: for I have made some with stems above four foot long, in which the expanding Liquor would so far vary, as to be very neer the very top in the heat of Summer, and prety neer the bottom at the coldest time of the Winter. The Stems I use for them are very thick, straight, and even Pipes of Glass, with a very small perforation, and both the head and body I have made on purpose at the <b>Glass-house,</b> of the same metal whereof the Pipes are drawn: these I can easily in the flame of a Lamp, urged with the blast of a pair of Bellows, seal and close together, so as to remain very firm, close and even; by this means I joyn on the body first, and then fill both it and a part of the stem, proportionate to the length of the stem and the warmth of the season I fill it in with the best rectified Spirit of Wine highly ting'd with the lovely colour of Cocheneel, which I deepen the more by pouring some drops of common Spirit of Urine, which must not be too well rectified, because it will be apt to make the Liquor to curdle and stick in the small perforation of the stem. This Liquor I have upon tryal found the most tender of any spirituous Liquor, and those are much more sensibly affected with the variations of heat and cold then other more flegmatick and ponderous Liquors, and as capable of receiving a deep tincture, and keeping it, as any Liquor whatsoever; and (which makes it yet more acceptable) is not subject to be frozen by any cold yet known. When I have thus filled it, I can very easily in the forementioned flame of a Lamp seal and joyn on the head of it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{estate was}} {{acquired}} by Maria Somes (1816-1911), the widow of Joseph Somes {{who had died in}} 1845. He had been a former Governor of the New Zealand Company, MP for Dartmouth and a major ship owner. She was a philanthropist, and employed at least 20 staff on the estate; the daughter of the estate carpenter later recalled that [...] "it was a happy time and a happy house in Mrs. Somes' days". When the estate was advertised for sale in 1912 after her death, it was described as having woodlands, shady walks, <b>glass-houses,</b> and a walled kitchen garden.|$|R
50|$|The work {{involved}} many repairs, from replanting the Box (Buxus) edging {{and replacing}} the gravel walks, to reglazing the cold frames and repairing the magnificent Victorian wood-framed, brick-based <b>glass-houses.</b> The team {{were determined to}} use plants that the Victorian head gardener would have had available, so there were many hours of scouring old and modern catalogues and many disappointments. However, the required plants were found eventually. The programme displayed the various tools and techniques of Victorian gardening, and this was where Harry came into his own. He had used many of both and therefore could produce many of the tools from various cobwebbed corners of the service buildings and demonstrate how they were used.|$|R

50|$|Hooker {{succeeded in}} convincing the British {{government}} that botanists should be appointed to their expeditions. While his works were in progress his herbarium received large and valuable additions {{from all parts}} of the globe, and his position as a botanist was thus vastly improved. He was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order and a Knight Bachelor in 1836, and in 1841 he was appointed director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, on the resignation of William Townsend Aiton. Under his direction the gardens expanded from 10 to 75 acre, with an arboretum of 270 acre, many new <b>glass-houses</b> were erected, and a museum of economic botany was established. He was engaged on the Synopsis filicum with John Gilbert Baker when he contracted a throat infection then epidemic at Kew. He died in 1865 and is buried at St. Anne's Church, Kew.|$|R
40|$|Crude {{extracts}} {{and active}} principles from medicinal plants have shown potential role in controlling plant diseases in <b>glass-houses</b> {{as well as}} in fields as one of the safest and ecofriendly methods. The effect of nor-securinine (an alkaloid) isolated from Phyllanthus amarus has been seen against spore germination of some fungi (Alternaria brassicae, A. solani, Curvularia pennisetti, Curvularia sp., Erysiphe pisi, Helminthosporium frumentacei) as well as pea powdery mildew (Erysiphe pisi) under glasshouse conditions. The sensitivity of fungi to nor-securinine varied considerably. Nor-securinine was effective against most of the fungi. H. frumentacei was more sensitive even at the lowest concentration (1, 000 µg/ml). Likewise conidia of E. pisi were also inhibited in partially or completely appressorium formation. Pre-inoculation treatment showed greater efficacy than post-inoculation in inhibiting powdery mildew development on pea plants in a glasshouse. Maximum inhibition occurred at 2000 µg/ml...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the area was {{extensively}} covered in <b>glass-houses</b> and market gardens. Gravel extraction has also long been a major industry in the Lea Valley, leaving a legacy of pits now used for recreation and an important wildlife habitat. In 1959-60 all of the church's houses and land were converted to stock or bank investments. No rectory has existed — the benefice before becoming the present vicarage serving four churches in the wider area was a perpetual curacy — a relevant fact for the purposes of chancel repair liability that therefore cannot exist. In the 1960s and 1970s, the population of the town increased, partly by an extensive programme of clearances and redevelopment in the town centre, and partly by the development of housing estates on the outskirts, such as Roundhills and Ninefields.|$|R
