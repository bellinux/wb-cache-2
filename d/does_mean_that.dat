The decision <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Philip's name {{can be added}} to official memorials to the victims. One to her specifically has already been established at Dutchess Community College, where her mother works as a computer programmer. The family buried an urn full of ashes from Ground Zero at a cemetery near their home. Six months after the appeals court decision, in July 2008, the family was officially notified by the city that Philip had been added to the victims' list.|$|E
25|$|On Jefferson's {{isolated}} mountaintop, sex {{took place}} {{as part of}} a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not share our current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his concubine, she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} various {{influenza}} strains to show species-selectivity is {{largely due to}} variation in the hemagglutinin genes. Genetic mutations in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single amino acid substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to receptors on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types. This doesn't mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.|$|E

25|$|What {{is notable}} {{is that the}} {{majority}} of these urban areas are in the upper reaches of either the Trent itself, {{as is the case with}} Stoke, or the tributaries. For example, Birmingham lies at the upper end of the Tame, and Leicester is located towards the head of the Soar. Whilst this is not unique for an English river, it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> there is an ongoing legacy of issues relating to urban runoff, pollution incidents, and effluent dilution from sewage treatment, industry and coal mining. Historically, these issues resulted in a considerable deterioration in the water quality of both the Trent, and its tributaries, especially the Tame. To bring clean water to the West Midlands, Birmingham Corporation created a large reservoir chain and aqueduct system to bring water from the Elan Valley.|$|E
25|$|The {{generally}} hot {{climate of}} the Barossa Valley usually means that the grapes become ripe very easily {{with high levels of}} sugars and low levels of acids. Winemaking in the Barossa Valley often utilizes the process of acidification in order to add balance to the wine. The high alcohol levels from the fermented sugars may be offset by various winemaking practices including reverse osmosis and adding water to the must. Historically, winemakers in the Barossa Valley have utilized very short maceration periods that limit {{the amount of time that}} the wines spends in contact with the skin. Often the wine is racked off the skins into oak wine barrels before fermentation is even completed. While this <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> supplemental tannins might need to be added, this short maceration often leaves the wines with a smooth mouthfeel. The extensive use of oak is also a characteristic of Barossa Valley winemaking with American oak, with its more aggressive dill and coconut aroma notes, often used more than French oak.|$|E

The best known playa in the park is the Racetrack, known for its moving rocks.|$|E

60|$|There {{is a new}} {{safeguard}} of the self-respecting dramatist {{which no}} amount of improvising for or against will explain away. Plays are now not merely acted, they are published and read, and will be read more and more. This does not mean, as some say, {{that they are being}} written for the study--they were never being written more deliberately, more carefully, for the stage. It <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> they are tending more and more to comply with fidelity to theme, fidelity to self; and therefore are more and more able to bear the scrutiny of cold daylight.

6000|$|And here I {{must ask}} your {{attention}} to the idea, and, more than idea,--the fact, involved in that infinitely misused term, [...] "Providentia," [...] when applied to the Divine Power. In its truest sense and scholarly use, it is a human virtue, [Greek: Promêtheia]; the personal type of it is in Prometheus, and all the first power of [Greek: technê], is from him, {{as compared to the}} weakness of days when men without foresight [...] "[Greek: ephyron eikê panta]." [...] But, so far as we use the word [...] "Providence" [...] as an attribute of the Maker and Giver of all things, {{it does not mean that}} in a shipwreck He takes care of the passengers who are to be saved and takes none of those who are to be drowned; but it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> every race of creatures is born into the world under circumstances of approximate adaptation to its necessities; and, beyond all others, the ingenious and observant race of man is surrounded with elements naturally good for his food, pleasant to his sight, and suitable for the subjects of his ingenuity;--the stone, metal, and clay of the earth he walks upon lending themselves at once to his hand, for all manner of workmanship.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{a critic}} will not respect Balzac's good work the less for contemning his bad work. He will easily {{account for the}} bad work historically, and when he has {{recognized}} it, will trouble himself no further with it. In his view no living man is a type, but a character; now noble, now ignoble; now grand, now little; complex, full of vicissitude. He will not expect Balzac to be always Balzac, and will be perhaps even more attracted {{to the study of}} him when he was trying to be Balzac than when he had become so. In 'Cesar Birotteau,' for instance, he will be interested to note how Balzac stood {{at the beginning of the}} great things that have followed since in fiction. There is an interesting likeness between his work in this and Nicolas Gogol's in 'Dead Souls,' which serves to illustrate the simultaneity of the literary movement in men of such widely separated civilizations and conditions. Both represent their characters with the touch of exaggeration which typifies; but in bringing his story to a close, Balzac employs a beneficence unknown to the Russian, and almost as universal and as apt as that which smiles upon the fortunes of the good in the Vicar of Wakefield. It is not enough to have rehabilitated Birotteau pecuniarily and socially; he must make him die triumphantly, spectacularly, of an opportune hemorrhage, in the midst of the festivities which celebrate his restoration to his old home. Before this happens, human nature has been laid under contribution right and left for acts of generosity towards the righteous bankrupt; even the king sends him six thousand francs. It is very pretty; it is touching, and brings the lump into the reader's throat; but it is too much, and one perceives that Balzac lived too soon to profit by Balzac. The later men, especially the Russians, have known how to forbear the excesses of analysis, to withhold the weakly recurring descriptive and caressing epithets, to let the characters suffice for themselves. All this does not mean that 'Cesar Birotteau' is not a beautiful and pathetic story, full of shrewdly considered knowledge of men, and of a good art struggling to free itself from self-consciousness. But it <b>does</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Balzac, when he wrote it, was under the burden of the very traditions which he has helped fiction to throw off. He felt obliged to construct a mechanical plot, to surcharge his characters, to moralize openly and baldly; he permitted himself to [...] "sympathize" [...] with certain of his people, and to point out others for the abhorrence of his readers. This is not so bad in him as it would be in a novelist of our day. It is simply primitive and inevitable, and he is not to be judged by it.|$|E
