25|$|A strong-motion {{seismograph}} at El Centro {{recorded the}} earthquake {{and provided the}} first {{example of such a}} recording made very close to a fault rupture in a major earthquake. This gave a detailed record of the different types of shaking associated with the earthquake. It is often used in design of <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>structures</b> today, particularly for the time history analysis method.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the study was the {{investigation}} of the behaviour of structures subject to earthquakes. After. describing and analysing seismic movements, useful concepts for <b>earthquake-proofing</b> <b>structures</b> are lintroduced. Then, the dynamic behaviour of systems with n degrees of freedom was studied in order to evolve the theoretical computation of seismic behaviour, a typical application being reticulated structures. The next stage was showing the computational procedure for seismic spectra and the natural frequencies of buildings, an attempt being made to define earthquake-proofing criteria for a special type of reinforced-concrete construction.. The last matter dealt with is elastoplastic behaviour of structures, a study of increasingly growing importance...|$|R

These rents reflect earthquake risk generally and {{the interaction between the}} earthquake–resistant quality of construction and the risk aversion of households. We find that housing rents are substantially lower in risky areas than in safer areas, even after controlling for other possible effects, and that the rent of an apartment built prior to the Building Standard Law being amended is discounted more substantially in risky areas than those built after this date. In addition, according to a cost–benefit analysis based on these estimation results, investment in <b>earthquake–proof</b> <b>structures</b> is profitable for landlords who own older wood–framed apartment buildings in relatively risky areas given the current level of the government subsidy introduced in 2002...|$|R
5000|$|The convent {{opened in}} 1899, after four nuns in 1884 {{had arrived in}} Hamilton to provide the settlers' {{children}} with Christian education. It was the first the three-storeyed building in Hamilton. By 1938 however, the original building was declared unsafe {{and was replaced by}} the current building which was built in 1939 and officially opened by then Bishop of Auckland, James Michael Liston. The building was a hostel for students of Sacred Heart Girls' College, until closing in 2011. In 2012, a community group protested against a plan to demolish the building {{and replace it with a}} modern diocesan centre. Reports claimed that it would be too expensive to <b>earthquake-proof</b> the <b>structure.</b> The building that has housed thousands of school girls for several decades was marked for demolition in 2013. Euphrasie House was ranked as a [...] "category B" [...] building by the Hamilton City Council. In 2017 it was demolished.|$|R
