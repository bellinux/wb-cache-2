The resistive elements dissipate energy (irreversibly into heat) and the reactive elements store and release energy (reversibly, neglecting small losses).

5000|$|A useful concept used in heat {{transfer}} applications once {{the condition of}} steady state heat conduction has been reached, is the representation of thermal transfer by {{what is known as}} thermal circuits. A thermal circuit is the representation of the resistance to heat flow in each element of a circuit, as though it were an <b>electrical</b> <b>resistor.</b> The {{heat transfer}}red is analogous to the electric current and the thermal resistance is analogous to the <b>electrical</b> <b>resistor.</b> The values of the thermal resistance for the different modes of heat transfer are then calculated as the denominators of the developed equations. The thermal resistances of the different modes of heat transfer are used in analyzing combined modes of heat transfer. The lack of [...] "capacitative" [...] elements in the following purely resistive example, means that no section of the circuit is absorbing energy or changing in distribution of temperature. This is equivalent to demanding that a state of steady state heat conduction (or transfer, as in radiation) has already been established.|$|R
50|$|If one connects two <b>electrical</b> <b>resistors</b> in parallel, one having {{resistance}} x (e.g., 60 Ω) and one having resistance y (e.g., 40 Ω), {{then the}} effect {{is the same as}} if one had used two resistors with the same resistance, both equal to the harmonic mean of x and y (48 Ω): the equivalent resistance in either case is 24 Ω (one-half of the harmonic mean). However, if one connects the resistors in series, then the average resistance is the arithmetic mean of x and y (with total resistance equal to the sum of x and y). And, as with the previous example, the same principle applies when more than two resistors are connected, provided that all are in parallel or all are in series.|$|E

5000|$|A theory {{suggested}} by {{a spokesman for}} the Royal Air Force Museum London in 1977 was that Chad was probably an adaptation of the Greek letter Omega, used as the symbol for electrical resistance; his creator was probably an electrician in a ground crew. Life suggested that Chad originated with REME, and noted that a symbol for alternating current, a sine wave through a straight line, resembles Chad, that the plus and minus signs in his eyes represent polarity, and that his fingers are symbols of <b>electrical</b> <b>resistors.</b> The character is usually drawn in Australia with pluses and minuses as eyes and the nose and eyes resemble a distorted sine wave. Similarly, The Guardian noted in 2000 that several readers had told them that [...] "Mr. Chad" [...] was based on a diagram representing an electrical circuit. One correspondent said that in 1941 at RAF Yatesbury a man named Dickie Lyle drew a version of the diagram as a face when the instructor had left the room, and wrote [...] "Wot, no leave?" [...] beneath it. This idea was repeated in a submission to the BBC in 2005 that included a story of a 1941 radar lecturer in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire drawing the circuit diagram, and the words [...] "WOT! No electrons?" [...] being added. The RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association says that the image came from a diagram of how to approximate a square wave using sine waves, also at RAF Yatesbury and with an instructor named Chadwick, and was initially called Domie or Doomie, the latter name also being noted by Life as used by the RAF. As alternatives to Chatterton or Mr Chadwick as the origin of the name Chad, REME claimed that the name came from their training school, nicknamed [...] "Chad's Temple", the RAF claimed it arose from Chadwick House at a Lancashire radio school, and the Desert Rats claimed it came from an officer in El Alamein.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{evaporation}} of binary alloys {{occurs in}} a number of practical applications, as e. g. in the fabrication of <b>electrical</b> <b>resistors</b> by use of a Cr-Ni alloy. The chemical composition of the alloy determines the physical properties of the deposited film.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cause of}} the {{anomalous}} mole fraction effect (AMFE) in calcium-selective ion channels is studied. An AMFE occurs when the conductance through a channel is lower {{in a mixture of}} salts than in the pure salts at the same concentration. The textbook interpretation of the AMFE is that multiple ions move through the pore in coordinated, single-file motion. Instead of this, we find that at its most basic level an AMFE reflects a channel's preferential binding selectivity for one ion species over another. The AMFE is explained by considering the charged and uncharged regions of the pore as <b>electrical</b> <b>resistors</b> in series: the AMFE is produced by these regions of high and low ion concentration changing differently with mole fraction due to the preferential ion selectivity. This is demonstrated with simulations of a model L-type calcium channel and a mathematical analysis of a simplistic point-charge model. The particle simulations reproduce the experimental data of two L-type channel AMFEs. Conditions under which an AMFE may be found experimentally are discussed. The resistors-in-series model provides a fundamentally different explanation of the AMFE than the traditional theory and does not require single filing, multiple occupancy, or momentum-correlated ion motion...|$|E
