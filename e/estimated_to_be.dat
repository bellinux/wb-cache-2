5|$|As a {{small but}} rapidly intensifying hurricane, Janet passed just south of Barbados on September22, {{becoming}} the first hurricane to strike the island in 57years, since the 1898 Windward Islands Hurricane. Maximum sustained winds {{on the south side}} of the island were <b>estimated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> between 110–120mph (180–190km/h). The strong winds knocked out communication lines, preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island, though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio. Electric power was later restored, allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm. Sugar cane, the island country's main source of revenue, was severely damaged, with losses <b>estimated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in excess of $1million. Poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds. An estimated 8,100homes were damaged by the hurricane. The destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways, and the Seawell Airport was forced to close. Heavy rains peaked at 4in (100mm) and a storm surge of 7ft (2.1m) swept away low-lying houses along the coast. An estimated 2,000people were left homeless due to the hurricane. Property damage on Barbados was <b>estimated</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> $5million, and at least 57people were killed.|$|E

40|$|For {{decentralized}} fusion problems, ellipsoidal intersection {{has been}} proposed as an efficient fusion rule that provides less conservative results {{as compared to the}} well-know ovariance intersection method. Ellipsoidal intersection relies on the computation of a common estimate that is shared by the <b>estimates</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fused. In this paper, an algebraic reformulation of ellipsoidal intersection is discussed that circumvents the computation of the common estimate. It is shown that ellipsoidal intersection corresponds to an internal ellipsoidal approximation of the intersection of covariance ellipsoids. An interesting result is that ellipsoidal intersection can be computed with the aid of the Bar-Shalom/Campo fusion formulae. This is achieved by assuming a specific correlation structure between the <b>estimates</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fused...|$|R
