5|$|Another {{conduit for}} the {{transfer}} of knowledge is the International Conference on <b>Emergency</b> Medicine, a conference held every two years for worldwide <b>emergency</b> physicians by the International Federation for <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (IFEM). In 2012, the conference took place in Dublin, Ireland. The organization was founded in 1991 by four national <b>emergency</b> physician organizations: the American College of <b>Emergency</b> Physicians, the British Association for <b>Emergency</b> Medicine, the Canadian Association of <b>Emergency</b> Physicians, and the Australasian College for <b>Emergency</b> Medicine. The conference rotated between the founding members until 2010, when it was held in Singapore. Many new members have been accepted since the mid-1990s, when the IFEM decided to open up membership to other nations' <b>emergency</b> medicine organizations; the conference will rotate to them as well. For instance, in 2014 the conference will be hosted in Hong Kong and in 2016 it {{will be held in}} Cape Town, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} {{conferences}} on international <b>emergency</b> medicine as well, {{including the one}} that the World Association for Disaster and <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (WADEM) has held every two years since 1987. However, WADEM focuses more on disaster medicine than <b>emergency</b> medicine system development, {{and many of its}} member physicians are not specialists in <b>emergency</b> medicine. Additionally, the European Society for <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM also publishes The European Journal of <b>Emergency</b> Medicine, develops recommendations for <b>emergency</b> medicine standards for European countries, and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in San Marino. The Asian Society for <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (Asian Society), which was founded in 1998, holds its own biennial conference. In addition to that, the Asian Society, like the EuSEM, develops curriculum recommendations for Asian countries.|$|E
5|$|Two {{international}} <b>emergency</b> medicine conferences {{were launched}} in the 1980s, the International Conference on <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (ICEM) and the World Association for Disaster and <b>Emergency</b> Medicine Conference (WADEM). ICEM was founded by the International Federation of <b>Emergency</b> Medicine, while WADEM was started by an organization of the same name. Additionally, in the 1990s various national and regional <b>emergency</b> medicine organizations began supporting {{the development of the}} specialty in other countries, including the American College of <b>Emergency</b> Physicians, the European Society for <b>Emergency</b> Medicine, and the Asian Society of <b>Emergency</b> Medicine.|$|E
40|$|Pediatric oncologic <b>emergencies</b> are {{potentially}} life-threatening acute complications related to primary malignant disease or its treatment.

5|$|A {{total of}} 411 <b>emergency</b> workers died {{as they tried}} to rescue people and fight fires. The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) lost 343 firefighters, {{including}} a chaplain and two paramedics. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) lost 23 officers. The Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) lost 37 officers. Eight <b>emergency</b> medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics from private <b>emergency</b> medical services units were killed.|$|E
5|$|According to the Philippine Red Cross, 26,845 {{families}} necessitated <b>emergency</b> assistance. Government {{agencies were}} ordered to arrest profiteers, hoarders and looters.

5|$|After such {{training}} is completed, or even without any EMS training, working in or visiting other nations {{is one way}} physicians can participate in international <b>emergency</b> medicine. Some physicians choose to pursue their careers overseas, while others opt for shorter trips. For example, a team of U.S. physicians spent seven months helping establish a new <b>emergency</b> department and <b>emergency</b> residency program in Hangzhou, China.|$|E

5|$|Alabama Governor Robert J.

States of <b>emergency</b> were also declared in Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma because of the flooding and tornadoes. Following the tornado outbreak on the evening of April 27, President Barack Obama granted a federal <b>emergency</b> declaration for the state of Alabama, giving federal assistance, including search and rescue assets, to the affected region.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing <b>emergency</b> medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in <b>emergency</b> medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary <b>emergency</b> skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} <b>emergency</b> medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in <b>emergency</b> medicine.|$|E
5|$|An {{ambulance}} is {{a vehicle}} for transportation, from or between places of treatment, {{and in some instances}} will also provide out of hospital medical care to the patient.

5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, <b>emergency</b> {{medicine}} can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by <b>emergency</b> departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. <b>Emergency</b> departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. <b>Emergency</b> medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the <b>emergency</b> {{medicine}} systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some practitioners {{to focus on}} developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international <b>emergency</b> medicine as a subspecialty began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals {{had taken place in}} the late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing <b>emergency</b> medicine abroad. One was the contrast between the EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as <b>emergency</b> medicine.|$|E

5|$|Combined <b>Emergency</b> Service – {{these are}} full service <b>emergency</b> service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as {{airports}} or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any <b>emergency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive <b>emergency</b> medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning <b>emergency</b> medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International <b>Emergency</b> Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of <b>emergency</b> medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to <b>emergency</b> medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to <b>emergency</b> medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting <b>emergency</b> medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international <b>emergency</b> medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the best practices and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{opportunities}} in <b>emergency</b> medicine {{are not available}} in many countries, and even when present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program in <b>emergency</b> medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in <b>emergency</b> medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization {{of the program is}} modeled on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of <b>Emergency</b> Medicine of South Africa and <b>Emergency</b> Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of <b>emergency</b> medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E
