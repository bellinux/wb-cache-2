5|$|Goodison Park {{is unique}} {{in the sense that}} a church, St Luke's, {{protrudes}} into the site between the Goodison Road Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand only yards from the corner flag. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church. The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> funeral service held there.|$|E

5|$|In short, an Indian cannot today gain a {{right of}} {{occupancy}} simply by occupying public land, as the Indians did in Cramer. Under current law, that occupancy could {{not be viewed as}} undertaken with the implied consent of the government, as was the occupancy in Cramer. We therefore conclude that any individual occupancy rights acquired by the Danns must <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> inception prior to November 26, 1934, the date that the lands in question were withdrawn from entry by Executive Order No. 6910.|$|E
5|$|Rehabilitation is {{available}} to some confiscated slow lorises. Organizations such as the International Animal Rescue (IAR) run sanctuaries that offer lifelong care to slow lorises that <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> teeth removed, while also providing education and awareness programs to local people to help end domestic trade. By collaborating with authorities, healthy slow lorises are released back into the wild. However, identification is critical because authorities still manage all slow lorises {{as if they were}} from one species, resulting in species being released into the wrong locations and increasing confusion in taxonomy and conservation.|$|E

Stennis. More recently, older ships <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve safety for both crew members and aircraft.|$|E

The entire 1938–39 Oregon team was enshrined in the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, and Anet, Dick, Gale, Hobson, Johansen, and Wintermute were inducted as individuals. The University of Oregon Athletic Hall of Fame selected the team and Hobson as part of its inaugural class of inductees in 1992. Dick and Gale (1993), Wintermute (1994), and Anet and Johansen (1996) were also inducted in later years. All five of the team's starters <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> numbers retired by the university.

5|$|Malvern Theatres, {{housed in}} the Winter Gardens complex in the town centre, is a provincial centre for the arts. The first Malvern Drama Festival, {{which took place in}} 1929, was {{dedicated}} to Bernard Shaw and planned by Sir Barry Jackson. A number of works <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> first performances at Malvern, six by Shaw including In Good King Charles's Golden Days, the 1929 English première of The Apple Cart, and the world première of Geneva in 1938. In 1956 Malvern held a Shaw centenary week. In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was set up, and extensive refurbishment was undertaken. J B Priestley presided over the opening ceremony of the first summer season. In 1998, a further £7.2 million major redesign and refurbishment took place with the help of contributions from the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), administered by the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport.|$|E

Others are endangered or <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> range severely reduced. Associated changes in habitat and the introduction of reptiles, snakes and other mammals led to the extinction of bird species, including large birds such as eagles.

Harris played with the Islanders for eight seasons before being traded to the Los Angeles Kings, while Potvin and DiPietro spent their entire NHL careers with the Islanders. Tavares {{has been with the}} team since being drafted and currently serves as their team captain. Only two players, Potvin and Bryan Trottier (1974), have played over 1000 games with the Islanders, though eight others have played at least 1000 games in the NHL. Five draft picks have gone on to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame: Potvin, Clark Gillies (1974), Trottier, Mike Bossy (1977), and Pat LaFontaine (1983). All, except LaFontaine, along with Bob Nystrom (1972) <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> uniform number retired by the team.|$|E

The tributaries Twomile Run, Huling Branch, and Middle Branch above the acid mine drainage <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> pH levels measured at 5.9, 5.7, and 5.5, respectively.

Tropical cyclone names are retired by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in a meeting in January or February. Those typhoons that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms. Several names were removed or altered naming list for various reasons other than retirement.
