40|$|Contact electrification, {{a surface}} {{property}} of bulk dielectric materials, {{has now been}} observed at the molecular scale using conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM). Conducting AFM measures the electrical properties of an organic film sandwiched between a conducting probe and a conducting substrate. This paper describes physical changes in the film caused by {{the application of a}} bias. Contact of the probe leads to <b>direct</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and the applied electric field results in both Maxwell stresses and electrostriction. Additional forces arise from charge injection (contact charging). Electrostriction and contact charging act oppositely from the normal long-range Coulomb attraction and dominate when a charged tip touches an insulating film, causing the tip to deflect away from the film at high bias. A bias-induced repulsion observed in spin-coated PMMA films may be accounted for by either mechanism. In self-assembled monolayers, however, tunnel current signals show that the repulsion is dominated by contact charging. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} current knowledge concerning incidence, risk factors, {{and mechanisms}} of perioperative nerve injury, with focus on local anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity. Perioperative nerve injury {{is a complex}} phenomenon and {{can be caused by}} a number of clinical factors. Anesthetic risk factors for perioperative nerve injury include regional block technique, patient risk factors, and local anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity. Surgery can lead to nerve damage by use of tourniquets or by <b>direct</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> on nerves, such as traction, transection, compression, contusion, ischemia, and stretching. Current literature suggests that the majority of perioperative nerve injuries are unrelated to regional anesthesia. Besides the blockade of sodium channels which is responsible for the anesthetic effect, systemic local anesthetics can have a positive influence on the inflammatory response and the hemostatic system in the perioperative period. However, next to these beneficial effects, local anesthetics exhibit time and dose-dependent toxicity to a variety of tissues, including nerves. There is equivocal experimental evidence that the toxicity varies among local anesthetics. Even though the precise order of events during local anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity is not clear, possible cellular mechanisms have been identified. These include the intrinsic caspase-pathway, PI 3 K-pathway, and MAPK-pathways. Further research will need to determine whether these pathways are non-specifically activated by local anesthetics, or whether there is a single common precipitating facto...|$|E

Inflammatory stress strongly induces COX- 2 in RMICs. To explore the <b>direct</b> effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> on the expression and activity of COX- 2, cultured RMICs were subjected to varying amounts of pressure over time using a novel pressure apparatus. COX- 2 mRNA and protein were induced following 60 mmHg pressure for 4 and 6 h, respectively. COX- 1 mRNA and protein levels were unchanged. PGE 2 production in the RMICs was increased when cells were subjected to 60 mmHg pressure for 6 h and was prevented by a selective COX- 2 inhibitor. Pharmacological inhibition indicating that pressure-induced COX- 2 expression is dependent on p 38 MAPK and biochemical knockdown experiments showed that NF-κB might be involved in the COX- 2 induction by pressure. Importantly, terminal deoxyneucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling and methylthiazoletetetrazolium assay studies showed that subjecting RMICs to 60 mmHg pressure for 6 h does not affect cell viability, apoptosis, and proliferation. To further examine the regulation of COX- 2 in vivo, rats were subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) for 6 and 12 h. COX- 2 mRNA and protein level was increased in inner medulla in response to 6 - and 12 -h UUO. COX- 1 mRNA and protein levels were unchanged. These findings suggest that in vitro application of pressure recapitulates the effects on RMICs found after in vivo UUO.

Methods: We used phosphoproteomic techniques to detect phosphorylation changes in chondrocytes under periodic <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and combined the results with the quantitative proteomic data to further explore the underlying mechanisms. Data were obtained by phosphorylation inhibition, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay. Results: From phosphoproteomic analysis, a total of 1073 phosphorylated proteins and 2054 phosphopeptides were identified. The number of significant differentially expressed proteins and phosphopeptides was 97 and 108, respectively (ratio &#x 3 e; 1. 20 or &#x 3 c; 0. 83 at p&#x 3 c; 0. 05).

While <b>mechanical</b> <b>stresses</b> and bacterial products can directly alter the endothelial and epithelial barriers in the lungs, {{a growing body of}} evidence suggests that synergistic interactions between low levels of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and bacterial products in the lungs can cause or exacerbate acute lung injury. New approaches to disrupting these synergistic interactions between <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> and innate immunity have the potential to reduce the incidence or improve the outcome of acute lung injury in humans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: We {{wanted to}} {{investigate}} filaggrin expression in normal conjunctiva and in conjunctiva exposed to {{different degrees of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> <b>stress</b> results in parakeratinization of the conjunctiva. If filaggrin is expressed in the milder forms of parakeratinization, it might {{be used as a}} sensitive marker of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress.</b> Methods: Immunohistochemical staining using antibodies to filaggrin was performed on paraffin sections of normal human conjunctiva, and on conjunctiva with different degrees of <b>mechanical</b> conjunctival <b>stress.</b> Results: Filaggrin was not expressed in the normal conjunctiva, nor in conjunctiva with milder forms of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stress.</b> Intense staining of filaggrin was seen in the conjunctiva of a patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and marked expression of filaggrin was found in the conjunctival epithelium of a patient with moderate dysplasia of the conjunctiva. Conclusion: Filaggrin is not a sensitive marker of mechanical stress; it is, however, expressed in some moderate and severe forms of parakeratinization of the conjunctiva...|$|R
