5|$|Minnesota's state {{government}} cannot operate without appropriations under law, as {{mandated by the}} Minnesota Constitution.

Before the shutdown, a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget, based on recommendations from state agencies.|$|E
5|$|The common raven {{evolved in}} the Old World and crossed the Bering land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which {{examined}} the DNA of common ravens from across the world, <b>have</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the birds fall into at least two clades: a California clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across {{the rest of the}} Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.|$|E

5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration <b>have</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> it does not raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories {{for the sale of}} goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E
5|$|Though {{large parts}} of the {{building}} are in ruins, excavations <b>have</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> al-Rahba went through at least eight undated construction phases probably starting from the early Ayyubid period. For the most part, each phase utilized different architectural techniques and fortification concepts, and none of the phases affected the entire extent of the building at one time. One common theme of the phases was the restoration or strengthening of al-Rahba's western and southeastern sides, which faced the desert plateau and were the most exposed areas of the fortress. In contrast, the northern side facing the population centers remained largely unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees {{to show signs of}} disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses <b>have</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> A.luteobubalina is closely related to A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals <b>have</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} originated {{over the}} southwestern Caribbean Sea, where, on October 17, {{a broad and}} immature low pressure system was noted. The hurricane forecast center in Jacksonville, Florida issued its first advisory on the storm late on October 20, following ship reports of winds approaching and exceeding gale-force. Contemporary reanalyses of the storm <b>have</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> it organized into a tropical depression on October 18, then drifted toward the east, turning north-northeastward as it strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day. Due to low environmental air pressures and the large size of the cyclone, intensification was gradual as the storm approached Jamaica, eventually making landfall {{on the eastern side}} of the island, just west of the Morant Point Lighthouse, at 13:00 UTC on October 21. The system came ashore with a central pressure of , suggesting maximum winds of 60 mph (100 km/h). After emerging into the waters between Jamaica and Cuba, the storm slowed in forward speed, continued to intensify, and curved northwestward toward southeastern Cuba. The storm attained the equivalent of Category 1 hurricane status on the current-day Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale early on October 22, while meandering just off the coast of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The main {{factor in}} the {{continued}} decline of the Javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they {{are believed to have}} healing properties. Historically, the rhinoceros' hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom. Because the rhinoceros' range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money. When the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora first went into effect in 1975, the Javan rhinoceros was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection; all international trade in the Javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal. Surveys of the rhinoceros horn black market <b>have</b> <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> Asian rhinoceros horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African rhinoceros horn.|$|E
