40|$|Many {{practical}} learning systems {{aggregate data}} across many users, while learning theory traditionally considers a single learner who trusts {{all of their}} observations. A {{case in point is}} the foundational learning problem of prediction with expert advice. To date, there has been no theoretical study of the general collaborative version of prediction with expert advice, in which many users face a similar problem and would like to share their experiences in order to learn faster. A key issue in this collaborative framework is robustness: generally algorithms that aggregate data are vulnerable to manipulation by even a small number of dishonest users. We exhibit the first robust collaborative algorithm for prediction with expert advice. When all users are honest and <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> our algorithm matches the performance of pooling data and using a traditional algorithm. But our algorithm also guarantees that adding users never significantly degrades performance, even if the additional users behave adversarially. We achieve strong guarantees even when the overwhelming majority of users behave adversarially. As a special case, our algorithm is extremely robust to variation amongst the users...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we test the notion {{fundamental}} to Bourdieu’s theories on distinction that people use cultural preferences to identify similar others to establish social ties with, {{and to avoid}} people with dissimilar tastes. We study social network formation among adolescents using a set of data on 1409 secondary school students (age 14 - 17) in the Netherlands (Ganzeboom et al. 2005 - 2006). In this data set students named their best friends in their classroom and {{were also asked to}} report on their cultural preferences, highbrow and popular, both their own and those of their par-ents. The results indicate that {{students are more likely to}} choose each other as friends when they <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> <b>tastes</b> in culture. Both highbrow and popular culture turn out to affect the formation of ties among adolescents and the two are about equally important. The effect of similarity in cul-tural taste is partly due to similarity in parents ’ education and parents ’ cultural participation, but adolescents ’ own similarity in highbrow and popular culture lead to friendship formation as well. A remarkable finding is that on top of adolescents ’ own cultural tastes, similarity in parents ’ educa-tion and culture increase the likelihood of social ties among adolescents. I...|$|E

Now Online shopping has opened the doors of globalization as it facilitate all {{the information about the}} product from anywhere around the world and it can be accessed 24 / 7. Therefore organizations have changed their selling and buying strategy. An even consumer preferences also has changed in terms of choices, quality, services, selling and buying.

Therefore, consumers are showing very enthusiastic behavior to buy and sell their chosen product. Keeping these benefits in their mind consumers are acting very smart and showing lots of interest to do online shopping, why because its saves time, easy payment and it will display many options to choose best of the best of his choice of product.

30|$|It is thus {{important}} {{to be able to}} measure and understand the underlying mechanisms of the social spreading of content. The influence of users sending purchase recommendations to their friends has been studied in [3]. This study shows that this type of explicit viral marketing contributes only marginally to the total sales, and that users can become resilient when they are exposed to too many recommendations from friends or simply too many of their friends’ actions. It is shown in [4] that users with high numbers of friends need more exposure of their friends’ actions before doing the same actions themselves (for example watching a video or buying an item), thus leading to an apparent resilience effect. The authors correct this effect by taking into account the visibility of the actions of friends to compute the exposure, as the visibility of friends’ actions depends on the way the website displays it to its users. Another aspect of the social interactions is the homophily, which should not be confounded with influence of friends [5]. In the latter case, a user consumes a good because of the behavior of another user, while in the case of homophily the users happen to consume the same good because they <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> <b>tastes.</b> These two effects are distinguished using statistical matching of users in [6, 7]. In [8], the influence of friends is distinguished from homophily by randomizing the timing of users’ actions.|$|E
40|$|Binary {{mixtures}} of taste stimuli {{were applied to}} the tongue of the hamster and {{the reaction of the}} whole corda tympani was recorded.

The molarity of each chemical with approximately the same effect on the activity of the nerve as 0. 01 M NaCl was selected, and an established relation between stimulus concentration and response allowed estimation of the effect of a "mixture" of two concentrations of one chemical. Each mixture elicited a response that was smaller than the sum of the responses to its components. However, responses to some mixtures approached this sum, and responses to other mixtures closely approached the response to a "mixture" of two concentrations of one chemical. Responses of the former variety were generated by {{mixtures of}} an electrolyte and a nonelectrolyte and the latter by mixtures of two electrolytes or two nonelectrolytes. But, beyond the distinction between electrolytes and nonelectrolytes, the whole-nerve response to a mixture could not be predicted from the known neural or psychophysical effects of its components. 07065 /PHS HHS/United States 07524 /PHS HHS/United States 5 SO 7 /SO/PHSPO CDC HHS/United States 7411114 PMC 222859...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{enormous}} {{recent efforts}} in detecting {{the mechanism of}} the social relation formation in online social systems, the underlying rules between the common interests and social relations are still under dispute. Do online users befriend others who <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> <b>tastes,</b> or do their tastes become more similar after they become friends? In this paper, we investigate the correlation between online user trust formation and their common interests, measured by the overlap rate ρ and taste similarity θ respectively. The trust relation creation time is set as the zero timestamp. The statistical results {{before and after the}} trust formation for an online network, namely Epinions, show that, the overlap rate ρ increases greatly before the trust formation, while it would increase smoothly after the creation of the trust relation. Com-paring with the empirical results, two null models are presented by shuffling the temporal behaviors of online users, which suggests that the accumulation of the common interests can result in the trust formation. Furthermore, we investigate the taste similarity θ of the common interests, which can reflect the users ’ preference on their common interests. The empirical results show that the taste similarity θ is rapidly increased around the day when users trust the others. That is, the similar tastes on the common interests among users lead to the trust formation. Finally, we report that the user degree can also influence the effect of the taste similarity θ on user trust formation. This work may shed some light for deeply understanding the evolution mechanism of the online social systems...|$|E
