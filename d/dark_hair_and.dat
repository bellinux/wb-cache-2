5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first Bleach {{character}} he introduced, was {{originally intended to}} be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> softer eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing the glasses. During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time. In later chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. According to Kubo, Ichigo, along with Orihime Inoue, are the most arduous characters to sketch. While illustrating one of Ichigo's scenes, Kubo found it awkward to draw him with a cheerful smile.|$|E

25|$|Alan George Hurst (born 15 July 1950 at Altona, Victoria) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in twelve Tests and eight ODIs between 1975 and 1979. A muscular, broad-shouldered man with a shock of <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> a big moustache, Alan Hurst fit the {{archetype}} of Australian fast bowler, 1970s style.|$|E
25|$|In the American {{mass media}} {{as well as}} popular culture, Hispanic is often {{incorrectly}} used to describe a subject's race or physical appearance. In general, Hispanics are assumed to have traits such as <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> eyes, and brown or olive skin. Many others are viewed as physically intermediate between whites, blacks and/or Amerindians.|$|E
25|$|This dance {{has evolved}} into several {{variations}} to tell stories of other combat such as David vs. Goliath, but the most common alternative relates to the Conquest of Mexico called Dance of the Marquis, Tastoanes or Comanches. In general, those playing the Spanish wear masks, while those playing the indigenous do not. Cortes is usually portrayed with abundant masses of <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> beard due to the historical descriptions of the first Europeans seen by the indigenous.|$|E
5000|$|Though Lucy is {{specifically}} {{described as being}} [...] "golden haired", she, Susan, and Peter are depicted in the illustrations with <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> while Edmund is usually blond. By contrast, {{in the most recent}} film adaptions Edmund is played by British actor Skandar Keynes, who is of both Lebanese and Turkish ancestry; he therefore is depicted as having <b>darker</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> eyes than all of his siblings.|$|R

50|$|Because of Carter Hall's {{return from}} the dead prior to Infinite Crisis, it has been stated that Katar Hol's soul {{dissipated}} from the Limbo/Realm of the Hawk God and is now deceased. Carter Hall currently inhabits a reconstructed version of Katar Hol's post-Zero Hour body, which mostly resembles Carter Hall, but with <b>darker</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> a more barbaric frame.|$|R
25|$|In {{painting}} and drawing, Conrad figures {{in a small}} contemporary manuscript sketch of his ship sailing to Tyre in the Annals of Genoa, and various illustrations to Scott's The Talisman. There is an imaginary portrait of him, c. 1843, by François-Édouard Picot for the Salles des Croisades at Versailles: it depicts him as a handsome, rather pensive man in his forties, wearing a coronet and fanciful pseudo-medieval costume. He is shown with <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> beard; {{it is more likely}} that, like his father and at least two of his brothers, he was blond.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} the {{transformation}} of Onibaba is the anime and manga Kurozuka. In this series the Noh story of the Onibaba is portrayed, with the Onibaba masquerading as a beautiful woman with a slender body and long <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> with powers similar to a vampire. The difference between the Noh story and the series is that instead of the two priests escaping, one of the men, a feudal lord, {{falls in love with}} the Onibaba in her beautiful form and is transformed into a vampire by the Onibaba and her vampiristic powers.|$|E
25|$|Turtledove depicts his {{nations as}} being {{analogous}} to real European nations, including {{as far as}} possible actual linguistic relationships. For example, the Derlavaian analogs of the Germanic nations are the Algarvic nations of Algarve, Sibiu, and Lagoas, but to confuse things somewhat, each uses names drawn from a different Romance language. In addition, {{the vast majority of the}} individuals belonging to each language group share the same hair and eye color; Algarvic peoples have red hair and green eyes, Kaunian peoples have blond hair and blue eyes, and the Unkerlantic peoples and most others have <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> eyes.|$|E

25|$|The New York Daily News {{published}} the letter {{a week later}} (after agreeing with police to withhold portions of the text) and Breslin urged the killer to surrender himself. The dramatic article made that day's paper the highest-selling edition of the Daily News to date—more than 1.1 million copies were sold. Police received thousands of tips based on references in the publicized portions of the letter, all of which proved useless. All the shooting victims to date had long <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> thousands of women in New York acquired short cuts or brightly colored dyes, and beauty supply stores had trouble meeting the demand for wigs.|$|E
25|$|Hardin {{eventually}} {{adapted to}} prison life. While there, he read theological books, becoming {{the superintendent of}} the prison Sunday School, and studied law. He was plagued by recurring poor health, especially when the wound he had received from Sublett became re-infected in 1883, causing him to be bedridden for almost two years. In 1892, Hardin was described as 5 feet 9 inches tall and 160 pounds, with a fair complexion, hazel eyes, <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> wound scars on his right knee, left thigh, right side, hip, elbow, shoulder, and back. During Hardin's stay in prison, his first wife, Jane, died, on November 6, 1892.|$|E
25|$|Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid or Negroid {{features}} may not {{be recognized}} as such in the United States {{in spite of the}} ethnic and racial diversity of most Hispanic American populations. Hispanics who do not look like the stereotypical Hispanic may have their ancestral status questioned or even challenged by others. Actors Martin Sheen, Alexis Bledel and Cameron Diaz, for example, are Hispanic even though they may be presumed not to be so because, being white, they do not fit the stereotype. If Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid features are to be considered Hispanic, they have stereotypical Mediterranean/Southern European appearance - olive skin, <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> dark eyes.|$|E

25|$|The Out-of-Africa model {{proposes that}} modern humans {{originated}} in Africa and migrated north to populate Europe and Asia. These migrants most likely had a functional MC1R variant and, accordingly, <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> skin as displayed by indigenous Africans today. As humans migrated north, {{the absence of}} high levels of solar radiation in northern Europe and Asia relaxed the selective pressure on active MC1R, allowing the gene to mutate into dysfunctional variants without reproductive penalty, then propagate by genetic drift. Studies show the MC1R Arg163Gln allele has a high frequency in East Asia and {{may be part of}} the evolution of light skin in East Asian populations. No evidence is known for positive selection of MC1R alleles in Europe and {{there is no evidence of}} an association between MC1R and the evolution of light skin in European populations. The lightening of skin color in Europeans and East Asians is an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|Michael has {{brown eyes}} and thick, <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> is tall. He is {{extremely}} handsome, nice, funny, smart, and manly, despite staying cooped up writing songs or on his computer the whole day. Michael is romantic and talented. Though he often clashes with his younger sister, Michael and Lilly are in fact close siblings and friends. He used to have his own webzine called Crackhead but had to disband it after an editorial that stated the merits of Linux over Windows, which caused a loss in advertisers and funds. Shortly after this, Michael decided to start a band called Skinner Box (name suggested by Mia), which refers to an experiment by the behavioural psychologist B. F. Skinner into proving {{the existence of a}} 'conditioned response', {{with the use of a}} specially designed box that held animals (such as rats and monkeys, in the experiment) until release, which could only be activated by pressing a lever. He started it with a few friends, including Boris Pelkowski.|$|E
500|$|William A. Spinks Jr., the {{youngest}} of five children, was born July 11, 1865, in the then-small township of San Jose, California, to struggling farmer William Sr. and wife Cynthia J.

500|$|Gaiman crafted the new {{character}} from an initial image of [...] "a man, young, pale and naked, imprisoned {{in a tiny}} cell, waiting until his captors passed away... deathly thin, with long <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> strange eyes." [...] Gaiman patterned the character's black attire on a print of a Japanese kimono {{as well as his}} own wardrobe. Gaiman wrote an eight-issue outline and gave it to Dave McKean and Leigh Baulch, who drew character sketches. Berger reviewed the sketches (along with some drawn by Gaiman) and suggested Sam Kieth as the series' artist. Mike Dringenberg, Todd Klein, Robbie Busch, and Dave McKean were hired as inker, letterer, colorist, and cover artist, respectively. McKean's approach towards comics covers was unconventional, for he convinced Berger that the series's protagonist did not need to appear on every cover.|$|E
500|$|Thorpe {{was reading}} law, but his primary {{interests}} at Oxford were political and social. From his earliest undergraduate days he {{drew attention to}} himself by his flamboyant behaviour; according to Thorpe's biographer Michael Bloch QC, his [...] "pallid appearance, <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> eyes and angular features, gave him a diabolonian air". [...] He was quick to seek political office, initially in the Oxford University Liberal Club (OULC) which, despite the doldrums affecting the Liberal Party nationally, was a thriving club with over 800 members. Thorpe {{was elected to the}} club's committee {{at the end of his}} first term; in November 1949 he became its president. Outside Oxford, Thorpe showed a genuine commitment to Liberalism in his enthusiastic contributions to the party's national election campaigns, and on reaching his 21st birthday in April 1950, applied to have his name added to the party's list of possible parliamentary candidates.|$|E
500|$|René Pérez Joglar, who {{performs}} {{as the lead}} singer of Puerto Rican alternative hip hop band {{under the name of}} Residente, appears as a featured artist on the track [...] "Gordita". He explained the conception of the song, in which he raps about the fact that [...] "he liked Shakira better when — early in her career: she was chubbier, had <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> was a rock chick", by saying that [...] "I told her (Shakira) {{it was a good idea}} to make fun of yourself. That way the haters can't say anything, because you already said it". British rapper Dizzee Rascal appears as a featured artist on the English version of [...] "Loca". He said that he felt [...] "honoured" [...] that Shakira chose him for the song, by saying that [...] "She's a bit of a trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale. You'd expect her to use an American rapper (for the song), but she chose me. It meant a lot".|$|E

5000|$|One {{example that}} {{researchers}} presented was that after an Italian colleague {{returned from a}} two-week vacation in Italy, his friends noticed that his <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> eyes were lighter than they had remembered. This happened because his categorization as Italian caused them to remember him with <b>darker</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> eyes than he actually had. Thus, while there was no actual change in his <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> eye color, their memory of his features had been shifted to match what the stereotype of an Italian looks like, rather than his actual appearance [...]|$|R
