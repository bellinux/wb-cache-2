5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a <b>growing</b> <b>population</b> of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and <b>growing</b> <b>population</b> of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the city}} of Galveston was a booming {{metropolis}} with a population of 37,000. Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas, and one of the largest cotton ports in the nation, in competition with New Orleans. Between 1838 and 1842, 18 newspapers were started to serve the island's rapidly <b>growing</b> <b>population</b> (The Galveston County Daily News is the sole survivor). A causeway linking the island with the mainland was finished in 1860, which paved the way for railroad expansion.|$|E
5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a <b>growing</b> <b>population</b> of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E

40|$|Determining how complex {{traits are}} genetically {{controlled}} {{is a requirement}} {{if we are to}} predict how they evolve and how they might respond to selection. This requires understanding how distinct, and often more simple, life history traits interact and change in response to environmental conditions. In order to begin addressing such issues, we have been analyzing the formation of the developmentally arrested dauer larvae of Caenorhabditis elegans under different conditions. We find that 18 of 22 previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting dauer larvae formation in <b>growing</b> <b>populations,</b> assayed by determining the number of dauer larvae present at food patch exhaustion, can be recovered under various environmental conditions. We also show that food patch size affects both the ability to detect QTLs and estimates of effect size, and demonstrate that an allele of nath- 10 affects dauer larvae formation in <b>growing</b> <b>populations.</b> To investigate the component traits that affect dauer larvae formation in <b>growing</b> <b>populations</b> we map, using the same introgression lines, QTLs that affect dauer larvae formation in response to defined amounts of pheromone. This identifies 36 QTLs, again demonstrating the highly polygenic nature of the genetic variation underlying dauer larvae formation. These data indicate that QTLs affecting the number of dauer larvae at food exhaustion in <b>growing</b> <b>populations</b> of C. elegans are highly reproducible, and that nearly all can be explained by variation affecting dauer larvae formation in response to defined amounts of pheromone. This suggests that most variation in dauer larvae formation in <b>growing</b> <b>populations</b> is a consequence of variation in the perception of the food and pheromone environment (i. e. chemosensory variation) and in the integration of these cues...|$|R

5|$|Gyeongju has a {{small but}} <b>growing</b> <b>population</b> of non-Koreans. In 2007, there were 4,671 foreigners living in Gyeongju. This number {{corresponds}} to 1.73% of the total population, {{more than double the}} figure from 2003. The growth was largely in immigrants from other Asian countries, many of whom are employed in the automotive parts industry. Countries of origin whose numbers have risen include the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The number of residents from Japan, the United States, and Canada fell significantly in the 2003â2007 period.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Desert Archaic Culture {{were the}} {{earliest}} known inhabitants of the region; an archaeological site found along the river dates back 3,000 years. Mormon pioneers led by Brigham Young were the first European American settlers, arriving in July 1847 and establishing farms and settlements along the river and its tributaries. The <b>growing</b> <b>population,</b> needing water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use in an arid climate, dug ditches and canals, built dams, and installed pumps to create a highly regulated river.|$|E
5|$|Palatial squares were {{developed}} for the prosperous middle classes. Italianate and Grecian villas, made with Bath Stone and sitting in their own gardens, were built {{in areas such as}} Clifton Down. At the same time, hundreds of acres of working class and artisan homes were built, especially in the south and east of the city. To support the <b>growing</b> <b>population,</b> public service buildings such as the Beaufort Hospital (now Glenside), schools such as Clifton College and public houses such as the Mauretania Public House were constructed.|$|E
40|$|In the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans, {{the appropriate}} induction of dauer larvae development within <b>growing</b> <b>populations</b> {{is likely to}} be a primary determinant of genotypic fitness. The underlying genetic architecture of natural genetic variation in dauer formation has, however, not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report extensive natural genetic variation in dauer larvae development within <b>growing</b> <b>populations</b> across multiple wild isolates. Moreover, bin mapping of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the genetically divergent isolates N 2 and CB 4856 reveals 10 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting dauer formation. Comparison of individual ILs to N 2 identifies an additional eight QTLs, and sequential IL analysis reveals six more QTLs. Our results also show that a behavioural, laboratory-derived, mutation controlled by the neuropeptide Y receptor homolog npr- 1 can affect dauer larvae development in <b>growing</b> <b>populations.</b> These findings illustrate the complex genetic architecture of variation in dauer larvae formation in C. elegans and may help to understand how the control of variation in dauer larvae development has evolved...|$|R

5|$|Synthetic nitrogen, {{along with}} mined rock phosphate, {{pesticides}} and mechanization, have greatly increased crop yields {{in the early}} 20th century. Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced {{as a part of}} the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world.
