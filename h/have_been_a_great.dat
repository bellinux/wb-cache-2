5|$|Jefferson Davis {{served in}} many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. As a politician, {{he served as}} a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, {{although}} he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported slavery. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> challenge for any leader, Davis's performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.|$|E

25|$|His {{opponent}} Roy Jenkins {{believed that}} he would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> chancellor – with youthful memories of the unemployment of the 1930s and adult experience of the lower levels of the postwar era Macleod thought unemployment higher than 300,000 was too high, and so would have had trouble adjusting to the new economic realities of the 1970s – but still would have been a better chancellor than Barber. He was already ill and old for his years, so would probably not have succeeded Heath as party leader, but might have prevented Thatcher from doing so.|$|E
25|$|A {{friend who}} was a vest-maker offered to teach her the trade, and to help her to get work, and this enabled her to carry out her plan of going to New York. She took a small room in the city, and went home only for Sundays, as the {{communication}} between Williamsburg and New York was very slow in those days, and the journey could not be made in leas than three hours. Two rooms were always kept ready for her in her parents' house, and those Sundays at home must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> rest and pleasure to her, though her family felt so little sympathy in her literary work that she rarely mentioned it at home.|$|E
25|$|The early labyrinthodonts possessed well {{developed}} internal gills {{as well as}} primitive lungs, derived from the swim bladders of their ancestors. They could breathe air, which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> advantage for residents of warm shoals with low oxygen levels in the water. There was no diaphragma and the ribs in many forms were too short or spaced too closely to aid in expanding the lungs. Likely air was inflated into the lungs by contractions of a throat sac against the skull floor like in modern amphibians, {{which may be the}} reason for the retention of the very flat skull in later forms. Exhalation with the aid of the ribs probably evolved only in the line leading to amniotes. Many aquatic forms retained their larval gills in adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Parks' {{court case}} was being slowed down in appeals through the Alabama courts {{on their way}} to a Federal appeal and the process could have taken years. Holding {{together}} a boycott for that length of time would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> strain. In the end, black residents of Montgomery continued the boycott for 381 days. Dozens of public buses stood idle for months, severely damaging the bus transit company's finances, until the city repealed its law requiring segregation on public buses following the US Supreme Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that it was unconstitutional. Parks was not included as a plaintiff in the Browder decision because the attorney Fred Gray concluded the courts would perceive they were attempting to circumvent her prosecution on her charges working their way through the Alabama state court system.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, but it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> year.|$|E
500|$|Many {{resistance}} {{people in}} Norway had been shocked {{when they found}} out that Andersen had been allowed to serve in NOR.I.C.1. Leading saboteur Max Manus wrote shortly after the war in his book Det vil helst gå godt: [...] "It was one hell of a risk to send a man with Gulosten's reputation and history out on secret military missions. It would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> embarrassment if Fritt Folk had been able to publish that Gulosten made a career in King Håkon's armed forces".

500|$|The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum was {{dedicated}} on 20 October 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years {{of conflict and}} compromise had {{changed the nature of}} the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. [...] "I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy," [...] he said in 2000. [...] "It could and should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> project." [...] Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, {{producers}} James Jacks and Sean Daniel {{decided to}} update the original Mummy film for the 1990s. Universal Studios gave them the go-ahead, {{but only if they}} kept the budget around $10million. Jacks remembers that the studio [...] "essentially wanted a low-budget horror franchise"; in response, Jacks and Daniel recruited horror filmmaker/writer Clive Barker on board to direct. Barker's vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who {{turns out to be a}} cultist trying to reanimate mummies. Jacks recalls that Barker's take was [...] "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism", and that, [...] "it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> low-budget movie". After several meetings, Barker and Universal lost interest and parted company.|$|E
500|$|Simon {{assembled}} {{and led the}} initial team of writers, consisting of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Simon has been credited as [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Ken Levine says he [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that Simon's [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon saw The Simpsons {{as a chance to}} solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> radio show. If you just listen to the sound track, it works." [...] The music for all 13 episodes was composed by former Oingo Boingo member Richard Gibbs, who would depart the show {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

500|$|Benigno called [...] "The Most Wonderful Day of the Year" [...] a [...] "perfectly {{pleasant}} {{opening that}} the Gleeks sing while they decorate their tree". Canning deemed it [...] "the episode's most successful song" [...] {{and added that}} it [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> tone setter {{if the rest of}} the episode hadn't focused on heartbreak, hate and grinches". Harper said that the song [...] "got the episode off on the right holiday foot", and Stack gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that its performance [...] "almost felt like the beginning of a real holiday musical. It was a little cheesy but also kind of charming and sweet." [...] The next song, [...] "We Need a Little Christmas", Benigno declared [...] "fun but too short". He added, [...] "If there's one thing this number teaches us, it's that Mercedes is being woefully misused on this show and can carry a number as well, if not better than she can finish one." [...] Stack said that the [...] "little taste" [...] included in the show [...] "sounded promising", and Harper [...] "totally loved this song".|$|E
500|$|A review {{published}} in The Times {{shortly after the}} book's publication {{described it as a}} [...] "very charming philosophical tale", and in his paper the historian and lecturer Bob Barker praised the novel for being [...] "remarkable for its cool yet vivid style". Critic Orville Prescott, writing in The New York Times, although admitting that the novel was [...] "beautifully written" [...] and [...] "a triumph of delicate and suggestive mystification", nevertheless concluded that the story was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "vexatious". He ended his review with the words: [...] "One feels constantly that shining truths are about to be revealed; that there is something important, something significant, hidden in these pages. But it is never made clear, while the ridiculous details remain all too conspicuously in view." [...] Prescott was just as critical of Rexroth's preface to the first American edition, describing it as a [...] "pretentious introduction of uncommon density". Writing in The Independent in 1993, shortly after the 100th anniversary of Read's birth, critic Geoffrey Wheatcroft commented that Read may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> novelist [...] "but The Green Child is the kind of book to write {{if you are going to}} leave just the one novel behind: singular, odd, completely original".|$|E
500|$|Baxter's biggest {{clashes with}} {{academic}} staff were over governance issues. He had {{a preference for}} industry-style organisation, with clear lines of authority. In 1957, he created a committee of deans, chaired by himself, that met every Wednesday. This became the vice-chancellor's advisory committee in 1960. Through this he created an administrative mechanism which set the university free from the traditional constraints. He did away {{with the election of}} deans by the faculty, replacing it with one in which deans were appointed by the University Council on his recommendation. This provided for more efficient administration, but violated the academic tradition of a dean being primus inter pares among academic colleagues. This aroused the ire of academic staff, and in the end a compromise was reached whereby each faculty elected a chairman who was responsible for academic matters, while the council appointed a dean {{who was in charge of}} administrative matters. This proved to be quite successful, and was retained by Baxter's successors. Ronald Hartwell characterised Baxter's administration as [...] "unusual, undemocratic and unacademic". His successor, Rupert Myers, declared that: [...] "History will show Sir Philip Baxter to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> educational administrator who built a fine university and made many beneficial changes in the ways universities handled their business and interacted with governments and the community." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1,183runs {{and take}} 142wickets; {{he was only}} the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000runs and take 100wickets in an English season {{as part of a}} touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232runs at an average of 38.66. [...] Wisden said of Trumble's batting that season, [...] " [...] played so {{consistently}} well as {{to make it clear that}} if he had not been a bowler he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> batsman". Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but Wisden stated that he [...] "bowled quite as well as in 1896" [...] and [...] " [...] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantage...he was deadly". Australia won the Second Test by 10wickets and with the other Tests finishing in draws, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5wickets for 60runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).|$|E
500|$|On October 7, Trump {{announced}} on Larry King Live that he formed an exploratory committee {{to explore a}} Reform Party presidential bid. Trump planned to use the committee, not to raise money—he would personally fund his campaign—but to advise him on political matters {{in preparation for a}} run. In the interview with Larry King, Trump was optimistic about his chances indicating a [...] "very strong possibility" [...] of victory. He referenced a non-scientific National Enquirer poll of 100 individuals, showing him in first place against his Democratic and Republican counterparts. [...] When pressed, Trump identified Oprah Winfrey as his ideal choice for a running mate, describing her as [...] "somebody that is very special," [...] and that if she agreed to run, [...] "she'd be fantastic [...] [...] [...] she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman." [...] Oprah's spokesperson later responded [...] "at this point in time [...] [...] [...] Oprah is not running." [...] Trump labeled Rudy Giuliani the greatest Mayor of New York and spoke admirably of Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, saying that Reagan had a demeanor that contributed to a phenomenal spirit in the nation. [...] Trump argued that President Bill Clinton could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> president, but destroyed his legacy with the Lewinsky scandal. [...] As for the Reform Party, Trump offered praise for both Perot and Ventura, and attacked potential primary opponent Buchanan as someone [...] "enamored" [...] with Adolf Hitler, based on Buchanan's thesis that Hitler presented no military threat to the United States ahead of World War II.|$|E
500|$|Viking Invasion {{received}} [...] "favorable" [...] reviews, albeit {{slightly less}} than the original Medieval: Total War, according to Metacritic. Reviewers felt the new gameplay features for the Vikings {{were the most important}} enhancement of the expansion pack, with Eurogamer commending the Vikings' raiding system as something that fixes what [...] "the original Medieval lacked". ActionTrip praised the new campaign as being a challenge for players: [...] "even on the normal difficulty setting, Viking Invasion is a very challenging game", a view shared by other critics. The pre-battle screen was commended by GameSpot, calling it a [...] "handy new feature." [...] GameSpot also praised the new additions to the original campaign, mentioning they have [...] "made castle sieges more interesting". The main criticism for Medieval: Total War – Viking Invasion was the graphics, with both ActionTrip and Eurogamer stating that they were [...] "starting to feel a little bit creaky". A lack of new multiplayer options was considered by GameSpot to be [...] "unfortunate", mentioning that [...] "a multiplayer campaign option would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> new feature". Overall, the expansion was received well by critics in the industry. IGN concluded by saying fans [...] "won't be disappointed with the Viking Invasion", while Actiontrip finished stating; [...] "the graphics are beginning to look old" [...] but the challenge made the expansion [...] "worth it". The review by GameSpot finished by saying [...] "overall, the expansion is a great addition to Medieval", and Eurogamer concluded with praising the addition it made to Medieval: Total War: [...] "It's a worthy expansion pack to a truly excellent game".|$|E
