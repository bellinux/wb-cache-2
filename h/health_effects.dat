5|$|Nonfatal <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> {{in the long}} term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some <b>health</b> <b>effects,</b> such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog.

5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
5|$|A July 1966 {{report by}} the New York Academy of Medicine Committee on Public Health cautioned that New York City's air-pollution problem made it {{susceptible}} to acute and lethal episodes and recommended a reduction of air pollution.

40|$|Equipe MICROCARDThe {{study of}} {{micronutrient}} and phytochemical (MaP, i. e., non-energy nutrients) bioavailability has been mainly studied through a reductionist and pharmacological approach. This {{has led to}} associate one <b>health</b> <b>effect</b> to one MaP. However, human interventional studies have given conflicting and disappointing results about MaP supplementation. This is because the <b>health</b> <b>effect</b> {{is the result of}} the synergetic action of numerous MaPs supplied by foods and/or diets at nutritional doses. A food is not a drug. Therefore, there is a need for more holistic approach to study MaP bioavailability, then their <b>health</b> <b>effect</b> to achieve general recommendations. This paper aims to hypothesize for such a paradigm shift in this topic and to lay new foundations for research in MaP bioavailability...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered adverse <b>health</b> <b>effects</b> {{from exposure to}} radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no <b>health</b> <b>effects.</b> An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
