5|$|Telopea speciosissima, {{commonly}} known as the New South Wales waratah or simply waratah, is a large shrub in the plant family Proteaceae. It is endemic to New South Wales in Australia and is the <b>floral</b> <b>emblem</b> of that state. No subspecies are recognised, but the closely related Telopea aspera was only recently classified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>floral</b> <b>emblem</b> for {{its home}} state of New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has {{featured}} prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T.oreades and T.mongaensis which are more tolerant of cold, shade, and heavier soils.|$|E

5|$|The type genus, Lily (Lilium), has a {{long history}} in {{literature}} and art, and a tradition of symbolism as well as becoming a popular female name, and a <b>floral</b> <b>emblem,</b> particularly of France (fleur-de-lis). The cultivation of lilies has been described since at least the ninth century, when Charlemagne ordered it to be grown at his imperial palaces. However, the name 'lily' has historically been applied {{to a wide variety of}} plants other than the Lilium genus.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the Tudor rose, the nation's <b>floral</b> <b>emblem,</b> and the Three Lions {{featured on the}} Royal Arms of England. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England {{around the time of}} the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace. It is a syncretic symbol in that it merged the white rose of the Yorkists and the red rose of the Lancastrians—cadet branches of the Plantagenets who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the Rose of England. The oak tree is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The Royal Oak symbol and Oak Apple Day commemorate the escape of King Charles II from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father's execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first {{appeared}} in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I. Following the death of King Alexander III in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the seal of the Guardians of Scotland who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent interregnum. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the Union Flag. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the thistle, the nation's <b>floral</b> <b>emblem</b> (celebrated in the song, The Thistle o' Scotland), the Declaration of Arbroath, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern tartan that often signifies a particular Scottish clan and the royal Lion Rampant flag. Highlanders can thank James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, for the repeal in 1782 of the Act of 1747 prohibiting the wearing of tartans.|$|E
