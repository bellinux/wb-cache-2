5|$|The Geneva Conference {{opened on}} 8 May 1954, {{the day after}} the {{surrender}} of the garrison. Ho Chi Minh entered the conference on the opening day with the news of his troops' victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlines.</b> The resulting agreement temporarily partitioned Vietnam into two zones: the North was administered by the communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam while the South was administered by the French-supported State of Vietnam. The last units of the French Union forces withdrew from Indochina in 1956. This partition was supposed to be temporary, and the two zones were meant to be reunited through national elections in 1956. After the French withdrawal, the United States supported the southern government, under Emperor Bao Dai and Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, which opposed the Geneva agreement, and which claimed that Ho Chi Minh's forces from the North had been killing Northern loyalists and terrorizing people both north and south. The North was supported by both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Soviet Union (USSR). This arrangement proved tenuous and escalated into the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War), eventually bringing 500,000 American troops into South Vietnam.|$|E

Several groups of people seem to take a bit more abuse than others on the site, including PETA, Catholic priests, the French, and Duke University, according to Curtis. The site has also become somewhat well known for including [...] "NSFW" [...] (Not Safe For Work) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlines</b> of links that contain images or videos of a sensitive nature, and in 2007, attempted to file a trademark of the phrase.

Over the next two days, at least 16 other alligator gar, [...] the largest measuring , were found in ponds in public parks in Hong Kong. Nearby residents reported the alligator gar had been released into the ponds by aquarium hobbyists, and had lived there for several years. [...] However, after a complaint made by a citizen who falsely identified alligator gar as crocodiles, the use of terms like [...] "horrible man-eating fish" [...] had begun appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlines</b> of some major local newspapers. [...] Officials with Leisure and Cultural Services in Tak Wah Park removed all the alligator gar from the ponds because they were concerned the large, carnivorous fish might harm children. [...] It {{is not unusual for}} the large sharp teeth and outward appearance of alligator gar to precipitate unreasonable fear in those unfamiliar with the species. Sensationalized reports have contributed to the misconception of predatory attacks by alligator gar on humans even though none of the reports have been confirmed.|$|E
40|$|China {{weathered}} {{the global financial}} crisis better than most, thanks to a large and timely stimulus. This stimulus, however, was mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of off-budget infrastructure spending and thus not visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> fiscal data. We construct a time series for the augmented fiscal deficit and debt—augmented to include off-budget activity—that better illustrates the counter-cyclical role of fiscal policy.

40|$|Many {{central banks}} often focus on {{underlying}} measures of inflation when assessing inflation trends. This paper compares {{the accuracy of}} underlying measures of inflation relative to <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> rates by using Australia data. It is found that the underlying measures did have smaller errors <b>in</b> predicting <b>the</b> long-term trend <b>in</b> inflation than <b>the</b> quarterly <b>headline</b> rate due to <b>the</b> volatility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> rate. As compared to <b>the</b> year-ended <b>headline</b> rate, <b>the</b> statistical test results, however, support only the measure of market prices excluding volatile items, not the others. There is some weak evidence of the weighted median measure outperforming <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sub-period after 1993. With respect to directional accuracy, the test statistics cannot reject the null hypothesis of an equal probability correctly predicting the moving direction of the inflation trend, though <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> rates have a higher probability. ...|$|R

500|$|In mid-1932 Nordisk folkereisning i Norge {{was forced}} to confirm that even though Quisling {{remained}} in the cabinet, he would not {{become a member of}} the party. They further stated that the party programme had no basis in fascism of any kind, including the National Socialism model. This did not dampen criticism of Quisling, who remained constantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlines,</b> although he was gradually earning a reputation as a disciplined and efficient administrator. After he was attacked in his office by a knife-wielding assailant who threw ground pepper in his face on 2 February 1932, some newspapers, instead of focusing on the attack itself, suggested that the assailant had been the jealous husband of one of Quisling's cleaners; others, especially those aligned with the Labour Party, posited that the whole thing had been staged. In November 1932, Labour politician Johan Nygaardsvold put this theory to Parliament, prompting suggestions that charges of slander be brought against him. No charges were brought, and the identity of the assailant has never been confirmed. Quisling later indicated it was an attempt to steal military papers recently left by Swedish Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Kleen. The so-called [...] "pepper affair" [...] served to polarise opinion about Quisling, and government fears grew concerning reasonably open Soviet elements in Norway who had been active in promoting industrial unrest.|$|E

Jackson also joined criticism of the British National Party (BNP) in the midst of the 2009 controversy surrounding party leader Nick Griffin's appearance on the panel show Question Time. He accused the BNP of [...] "hijacking" [...] military symbols, saying [...] "the BNP is claiming that it has a better relationship with the Armed Forces than other political parties. How dare they use the image of the Army, in particular, to promote their policies?" [...] He elaborated that it was not a party political issue, but an issue of the armed forces' reputation. Griffin retaliated by calling Jackson and Sir Richard Dannatt [...] "war criminals". A disagreement between Jackson and then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth made headlines in 2009, when Ainsworth stated that the UK could only manage a small increase to troop numbers in Afghanistan, saying that the Army had pushed [...] "too hard" [...] when it was engaged in operation in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Jackson countered by saying that the UK should play a decisive role and that the drawdown of troops from Iraq meant the UK had the capability for a larger increase.|$|E
