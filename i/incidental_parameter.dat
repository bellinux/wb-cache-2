We develop analytical and jackknife bias corrections for nonlinear models with both individual and time effects. Under asymptotic sequences where the time-dimension (T) grows with the cross-sectional dimension (N), the time effects introduce additional <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> bias. As the existing bias corrections apply to models with only individual effects, we derive the appropriate corrections for the case when both effects are present. The basis for the corrections are general asymptotic expansions of fixed effects estimators with incidental parameters in multiple dimensions. We apply the expansions to conditional maximum likelihood estimators with concave objective functions in parameters for panel models with additively separable individual and time effects. These estimators cover fixed effects estimators {{of the most popular}} limited dependent variable models such as logit, probit, ordered probit, Tobit and Poisson models. Our analysis therefore extends the use of large-T bias adjustments to an important class of models. We also analyze the properties of fixed effects estimators of functions of the data, parameters and individual and time effects including average partial effects.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I study a fixed effects model of dyadic link {{formation}} for directed networks. I discuss inference on structural parameters {{as well as}} a test of model specification. In the model, an agent's linking decisions depend on perceived similarity to potential linking partners(homophily). Agents are endowed with potentially unobserved characteristics that govern their ability to establish links (productivity) and to receive links (popularity). Heterogeneity in productivity and popularity is a structural driver of degree heterogeneity. The unobserved heterogeneity is captured by a fixed effects approach. This allows for arbitrary correlation between an observed homophily component and latent sources of degree heterogeneity. The linking model accounts for link reciprocity by allowing linking decisions within each pair of agents to be correlated. Estimates of structural parameters related to homophily preferences and reciprocity can be obtained by ML but inference is non-standard due to the <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> problem (Neyman and Scott 1948). I study t-statistics constructed from ML estimates via a naive plug-in approach. For these statistics it is not appropriate to compute critical values from a standard normal distribution because of the <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> problem. I suggest modified t-statistics that are justified by an asymptotic approximation that sends the number of agents to infinity. For a t-test based on the modified statistics, critical values can be computed from a standard normal distribution. My model specification test compares observed transitivity to the transitivity predicted by the dyadic linking model. The test statistic corrects for <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> bias that is due to ML estimation of the null model.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} dynamic panel {{models with}} a factor error structure that is {{correlated with the}} regressors. Both short panels (small T) and long panels (large T) are considered. With a small T, consistent estimation requires either a suitable formulation of the reduced form or an appropriate conditional equation for the first observation. Also needed is a suitable control for {{the correlation between the}} effects and the regressors. Under the factor error structure, the panel system implies parameter constraints between the mean vector and the covariance matrix. We explore the constraints through a quasi-FIML approach. The factor process is treated as parameters and it can have arbitrary dynamics under both fixed and large T. The large T setting involves <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters</b> because the number of parameters (including the time effects, the factor process, the heteroskedasticity parameters) increases with T. Even though an increasing number of parameters are estimated, we show that there is no <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters</b> bias to affect the limiting distributions; the estimator is centered at zero even scaled by the fast convergence rate of root-NT. We also show that the quasi-FIML approach is efficient under both fixed and large T, despite non-normality, heteroskedasticity, and <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters.</b> Finally we develop a feasible and fast algorithm for computing the quasi-FIML estimators under interactive effects. ...|$|R
40|$|Estimations of {{nonlinear}} panel {{models that}} include individual specific fixed effects are {{complicated by the}} <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters</b> problem, that is, the asymptotic bias in the estimation of typical fixed effects panel models generally results in inconsistent estimates. In this paper, I characterize the leading term of a large-T expansion of the biases in the nonlinear least square estimator (NLSE) and estimators of the average partial effects in panel fractional response models. The resulting estimator after analytical bias correction is robust to the <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters</b> bias and reduces the bias order from O(T− 1) to O(T− 2). I also examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator using a new data generating process in which panel fractional response variables are collapsed from repeated, clustered cross-sectional binary probit choices. A proof showing the generated data satisfies the identification assumption at the cluster level has been given. Simulation results suggest that, in the static case, the bias corrected estimator performs comparably to the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE), which is the standard approach in the literature, for 8 or more periods, while in the dynamic case, the bias corrected estimators are substantially superior to those QMLE’s.

40|$|Abstract. I discuss {{an issue}} arising in {{analyzing}} data from astronomical surveys: accounting for measurement uncertainties in {{the properties of}} individual sources detected in a survey when making inferences about {{the entire population of}} sources. Source uncertainties require the analyst to introduce unknown “incidental ” parameters for each source. The number of parameters thus grows with the size of the sample, and standard theorems guaranteeing asymptotic convergence of maximum likelihood estimates fail in such settings. From the Bayesian point of view, the missing ingredient in such analyses is accounting for the volume in the <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> space via marginalization. I use simple simulations, motivated by modeling the distribution of trans-Neptunian objects surveyed in the outer solar system, to study the effects of source uncertainties on inferences. The simulations show that current non-Bayesian methods for handling source uncertainties (ignoring them, or using an ad hoc <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> integration) produce incorrect inferences, with errors that grow more severe with increasing sample size.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters on economic and econometric applications of Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison. The first two chapters study the <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> problem mainly under a linear autoregressive (AR) panel data model with fixed effect. The first chapter investigates the problem from a model comparison perspective. The major finding in the first chapter is that consistency in parameter estimation and model selection are interrelated. The reparameterization of the fixed effect parameter proposed by Lancaster (2002) may not provide a valid solution to the <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> problem if the wrong set of exogenous regressors are included. To estimate the model consistently and to measure its goodness of fit, the Bayes factor {{is found to be}} more preferable for model comparson than the Bayesian information criterion based on the biased maximum likelihood estimates. When the model uncertainty is substantial, Bayesian model averaging is recommended. The method is applied to study the relationship between financial development and economic growth. The second chapter proposes a correction function approach to solve the <b>incidental</b> <b>parameter</b> problem. It is discovered that the correction function exists for the linear AR panel model of order p when the model is stationary with strictly exogenous regressors. MCMC algorithms are developed for parameter estimation and to calculate the Bayes factor for model comparison. The last chapter studies how stock return's predictability and model uncertainty affect a rational buy-and-hold investor's decision to allocate her wealth for different lengths of investment horizons in the UK market. The FTSE All-Share Index is treated as the risky asset, and the UK Treasury bill as the riskless asset in forming the investor's portfolio. Bayesian methods are employed to identify the most powerful predictors by accounting for model uncertainty. It is found that though stock return predictability is weak, it can still affect the investor's optimal portfolio decisions over different investment horizons.

This model works sufficiently well, although complications arise due to a growing vector of <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters.</b> The bootstrap is shown to be a useful tool for studying uncertainties of the estimates of the structural parameters. This model is further extended to include driver characteristics. In a Poisson model with similar, but simpler structure, estimates of the structural parameter in the presence of <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters</b> are studied. The profile likelihood, bootstrap and the delta method are compared for deterministic and random <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters.</b> The same asymptotic properties, up to first order, are seen for deterministic as well as random <b>incidental</b> <b>parameters.</b> The search for suitable methods that work in complex model structures leads us to consider Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In the area of MCMC, we consider particularly the question of how and when to claim convergence of the MCMC run in situations where it is only possible to analyse the output values of the run and also how to compare different MCMC modellings. In Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, different proposal functions lead to different realisations. We develop a new convergence diagnostic, based on the Kullback-Leibler distance, which is shown to be particularly useful when comparing different runs. Comparisons with established methods turn out favourably for the KL. In both models, a Bayesian analysis is made where the posterior distribution is obtained by MCMC methods.
