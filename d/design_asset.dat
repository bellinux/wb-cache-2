40|$|Abstract—Granular Computing {{has emerged}} as a unified and {{coherent}} framework of designing, processing, and interpretation of information granules. Information granules are formalized within various frameworks such as sets (interval mathematics), fuzzy sets, rough sets, shadowed sets, probabilities (probability density functions), to name several the most visible approaches. In spite of the apparent diversity of the existing formalisms, there are some underlying commonalities articulated in terms of the fundamentals, algorithmic developments and ensuing application domains. In this study, we introduce two pivotal concepts: a principle of justifiable granularity and a method of an optimal information allocation where information granularity is regarded as an important <b>design</b> <b>asset.</b> We show that these two concepts are relevant to various formal setups of information granularity and offer constructs supporting the design of information granules and their processing.

Internal exchanges represent border crossings necessitating changes of vehicles, while the coordination with neighboring systems represents intermodal operations. For a given demand, the model determines departure times of the services such that throughput time of the demand in the system is minimized. The model {{is an extension of}} the design-balanced capacitated multicommodity network design model that we denote service network design with asset management and multiple fleet coordination to emphasize the explicit modeling of different vehicle fleets. Data from a real-world problem addressing the planning of new rail freight services across borders serves to illustrate the capabilities of the formulation.

The initial finding was that stocks with high (low) earnings/price ratios have higher (lower) risk-adjusted realized returns, already controlled by the capital asset pricing model's beta.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the era of}} {{advanced}} methodologies and practices of system modeling, {{we are faced with}} ever growing challenges of building models of complex systems that are in full rapport with reality. These challenges are multifaceted. Human centricity becomes of paramount relevance in system modeling and because of this models need to be customized and easily interpretable. More and more visibly, experimental data and knowledge of varying quality being directly acquired from experts have to be efficiently utilized in the construction of models. The quality of data and ensuing quality of models have to be prudently quantified. There are ongoing and even exacerbated challenges to build intelligent systems, modeling multifaceted phenomena, and deliver efficient models that help users describe and understand systems and support processes of decision-making. We have to become fully cognizant that processing and modeling has to be realized with the use of entities endowed with well-defined semantics, namely information granules. Human do not perceive reality and reason in terms of numbers but rather utilize more abstract constructs (information granules), which are helpful in setting up a certain cognitive perspective and ignore irrelevant details when dealing with the complexity of the systems. To make this study self-contained, we briefly recall the key concepts of granular computing and demonstrate how this conceptual framework and its algorithmic fundamentals give rise to granular models. We discuss several representative formal setups used in describing and processing information granules including fuzzy sets, rough sets, and interval calculus. Key architectures of models dwell upon relationships among information granules. We demonstrate how information granularity and its optimization can be regarded as an important <b>design</b> <b>asset</b> to be exploited in system modeling and giving rise to granular models. With this regard, an important category of rule-based models along with their granular enrichments is studied in detail...|$|E
40|$|The project {{commenced}} with {{a literature}} review {{of national and}} international guides, publications and research papers, which also enabled the identification of knowledge gaps and areas where further detail was required. A crash analysis was undertaken to demonstrate the relationship between motorcycle crashes, travel period, vehicle configuration (i. e. motorcycle only and multiple vehicle crashes involving a motorcycle), road geometry, road layout (e. g. intersection type) and crash types. For comparative purposes, vehicle crashes at the same location were also analysed. Explanations of why, and how, road infrastructure elements influence motorcycle crash risk were researched and are provided within this report. This primarily involved identifying how the design and condition of road infrastructure elements can influence either {{the likelihood of a}} crash occurring or the resulting severity of a crash. Where a number of elements that would increase the likelihood or severity of a crash were present concurrently, the proportionate increase in risk was demonstrated using the AusRAP model. The study has built up a compendium of treatments, presented {{in such a way that}} engineering decisions to manage these elements can be justified, even if outside of existing design warrants, and asset management and maintenance practice. The research highlights that motorcycles should be identified as an individual road user group and considered as a ‘design vehicle’ during road design and asset management and maintenance practices. It is concluded that motorcycle crash risk can be managed, but requires changes in practice, in <b>design,</b> <b>asset</b> management funding and routine maintenance performance contracts. One example is in the identification of road sections and/or routes that pose the highest crash risk to motorcyclists, so that they can be managed and maintained appropriately. In addition, the author advocates proactive motorcycle specific network safety assessments and road safety audits, as well as fine-tuning in design parameters for roads carrying significant volumes of motorcyclists (e. g. horizontal geometry, sight lines, lane and shoulder width, intersection types, intersection quality and controls). It is also suggested that the range and detail of mitigation measures be expanded...|$|E
40|$|Desalination {{provides}} a supply alternative for potable water for many communities, along with possible defenses against security threats potentially affecting clean water supplies. The {{economic and financial}} life-cycle costs associated with building and operating the Southmost desalination facility (near Brownsville, TX) in South Texas are investigated using the spreadsheet model DESAL ECONOMICS?. Primary data key to this analysis include actual initial construction costs, annual continued costs (i. e., for source-water acquisition and transport, pretreatment, purification, and delivery), capital replacement expenses, and desalination-process parameters. The input data used reflect the unique location and quality of source water, process-flow <b>design,</b> <b>asset</b> selection and configuration, management structure, local cost rates, and employed operational methods unique to the Southmost facility. Thus, the specific results are only applicable to the Southmost facility for a specific time, but do provide useful information and insight into life-cycle costs for public and commercial desalination facilities in a more general sense. Annuity equivalent costs are reported (on both a $/acre-foot (ac-ft) and $/ 1, 000 gallons of finished water basis, f. o. b. (free on board) municipal delivery point) for seven individual operational/expense areas, {{as well as for}} the entire desalination facility. Results are also presented across different cost types, categories, and items. The baseline results are deterministic, but are expanded to include sensitivity analyses of useful life, initial construction costs, annual energy costs, and production efficiency rate, amongst others. The current estimated total annual life-cycle costs (in 2006 dollars) to produce and deliver desalinated water to a point in the municipal delivery-system infrastructure for the Southmost facility are $ 769. 62 /ac-ft {$ 2. 3619 / 1, 000 gal. }. These baseline estimates apply to the Southmost facility and are sensitive to changes in the production efficiency level, and costs incurred for energy, chemicals, initial construction, etc. Also, results indicate significant outlays, beyond those of Initial Construction, are involved with desalination. For the Southmost facility, when a commitment was made to build a facility for $ 26. 2 million, an implicit commitment for another $ 39. 1 million (basis 2006 dollars) was also made for Continued and Capital Replacement costs. Investigation into life-cycle costs during the design and planning stages of a desalination facility can assist with determining the least-cost asset configuration to adopt and operational methods to employ. Also included are modifications to certain key data-input parameters that provide ?modified results? which facilitate a more fair basis of comparing facilities and/or technologies. The modified results, which are considered appropriate to use when comparing to similarlycalculated values (for other facilities or technologies), are $ 615. 01 /ac-ft/yr {$ 1. 8874 / 1, 000 gal. /yr} (basis 2006 dollars) ...|$|E

40|$|Both internationally and in Ireland, {{the role}} science {{plays in the}} {{advancement}} of economic and technological endeavours cannot be undervalued. Nevertheless, in developed countries, established trends of decreasing student numbers are a continual point of concern. In response, efforts to influence student subject choices, guided toward the sciences and in particular physics, are commonplace. Modern research positions, underscore the key capacity of interest and engagement as key affective and cognitive constructs that can mediate subject selection. Furthermore, the quality and content of instruction are denoted as the largest determinants of the former constructs. The given context affords the necessity and opportunity to examine pedagogical methodologies that augment interest and engagement situated in the science classroom. This study examines hooks. Hooks represent an area of instruction that has been traditionally understudied in educational literature, yet, are central aspects of instructional frameworks and colloquially present in teachersâ toolkits. Based on the limited literature, they {{can be defined as}} a short instructional method utilised at the beginning of instruction to augment interest, engagement and attention among the student body. Employing a Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology, in which both theory and design are advanced in light of practical findings resultant from authentic classroom contexts, this research sets out to explore nascent research areas, including the design, construction and implementation of hooks, a bespoke instructional method/tool grounded in the requirements of all stakeholders in the science classroom. In line with the DBR process, a theoretically informed design; the physics video hook artefact was systematically placed in the naturalistic classroom context using three iterations of interventions, coupled with appropriate data collection tools over a period of four years. In sum, 43 interventions were enacted with 12 teachers and their respective students. The results obtained indicate that the implementation of hooks resonated more so with teachersâ pragmatic classroom requirements rather than the theoretical derivations of hook based pedagogies. Placing the video hook design artefact {{at the start of the}} lesson as an all-encompassing hook, proved ineffective in terms of the predicted hook impact of attention, interest and engagement. The hook required integration into the wider pedagogy as teacher participants employed a variety of teaching methods with the design artefact to promote inquiry, consolidation of learning and revision. With this, the study theoretically forwards the xiv previous definition of hooks to accommodate âpara-hooksâ, a hook that is not used as an introductory moment within instruction. Emergent with this finding was the key role of developing studentsâ prior knowledge as the âhingeâ around which the desired hook reaction of interest, engagement and attention could be created. The contribution aligns with modern theories pertaining to the formation of knowledge gaps through discrepancy, a fundamental <b>design</b> <b>asset</b> of the hooks. Legitimating findings, students indicated that the phenomena displayed in the video hooks were the most interesting aspects of their respective lessons. The study ends with implications and recommendations derived from these conclusions...|$|E
