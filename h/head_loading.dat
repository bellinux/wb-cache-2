Signals, which {{do not apply to}} the mini (i.e., READY and SEP CLOCK), are {{disabled}} and pulled high when the mini is selected. Signals to the drives from the 1771 are TTL-buffered with separate buffers for mini and maxi connectors. The STEP output is stretched by IC37 to about 16 microseconds before going to the drives. The HLD (head load) output does not go directly to the drives but rather enables the drive select lines through IC10 pin 1. Thus, the actual drive select signal to the drive is the coincidence of a latched drive selection (done at port 34H) and HLD from the 1771. <b>Head</b> <b>loading</b> time is determined by counters IC36 and 27. Timeout is controlled by the count loaded into lC3's by IC53. Signals DRQ, HLD, and INTRQ (or EOJ) are available at input port 34H (rC9). Various control signals are assigned to output port 34H and are latched by rcs 24 and 41.|$|E
5000|$|After 20 {{years of}} discussions, Bavaria and Prussia signed a treaty on 28 October 1891 that {{authorised}} {{the construction of}} the Glan Valley Railway. The Lauterecken-Odernheim section was opened in October 1896. Closing the gap to Staudernhiem was delayed because local landowners attempted to obtain high prices for the sale of their land for the railway. Accordingly, the missing section was opened in December 1896. The line between Kaiserslautern and Staudernheim was opened over its whole length on 1 July 1897. In the course of the opening of the line, the station underwent a major expansion. In this context, it received, among other things, an additional eight sets of points, three terminal tracks with a total length of 1500 m, a [...] turntable with a diameter of 16.07 m, 297 m-long sidings, a <b>head</b> <b>loading</b> ramp and a side loading ramp, which was about 200 m long. In {{the eastern part of the}} station precinct, there was also a watering point for the steam locomotives of the Palatinate Railway. While in the meantime political circumstances had changed, the construction of a strategic railway from Homburg to Bad Münster was still supported. The Odernheim-Bad Münster am Stein section was finally opened in 1904, which made the Odernheim-Staudernhein section into a feeder service. While the Glan Valley Railway was duplicated from Homburg to Bad Munster, the connecting line from Stdaudernheim remained as a single track. [...] As part of the modernisation of the Nahe Valley Railway, the mechanical signalling systems at the station were decommissioned around 1980. Passenger services on the Glan Valley Railway were discontinued on the Homburg-Glan-Munchweiler section in 1981, on the Altenglan-Lauterecken-Grumbach section in 1985 and on the Lauterecken-Grumbach-Staudernheim section on 30 May 1986. The Lauterecken-Grumbach-Staudernheim section was officially closed on 1 July 1996.|$|E
5000|$|Village Administration: The {{village is}} headed by the Village Council President and almost all issues {{regarding}} the village administration have been under his authority. The President with his Village Council Members have exercised all matters of the village administration with regards to law and orders, and village development projects. But in certain social issues, some NGOs like YMA and MHIP play very important role which may reduce the burdens of the village council members. In respect to governmental administration, the Block Development officer has headed to direct the government servants for its functional machinery. Transport & Communication: By 1992, truckable road passed through the village en route from Champhai to Biate. The road was, therefore, surfaced after 6 years of its construction. Before 1990, the village had only a jeepable road and all the movements of goods and passengers are only done with Jeeps and other light vehicles. <b>Head</b> <b>loading</b> and animal carriages were the main transportation means commonly used for local goods during that time. MST Bus services have been available from 1992 to present for passengers and goods transportation. This has brought about a big leap/change in the village economy. From 2000 A.D. onwards, Sumo services have been available from Khawbung to Champhai. Three sumo-services are constantly available. A new decade of 2010 A.D. has brought about a new facet in its transportation system since one sumo-service has been added from Khawbung to Aizawl thrice in a week. The sumo-services not just make easy passengers movements but also bring out blessings for small shopkeepers. One large Bus service is also available from Khawbung to Champhai. Bulk or heavy transportation is mainly done through Tripper, 407, 409 and Pick-up motors at local to national level. These are available at/from the village. [...] Other means of communication include Postal Services, Telephone Services, Mobile Services, Internet Services, etc. Postal service is an aged means of communication available in the village. It is a headquarter of Sub-post office. The service include both postage and financial facilities. [...] The village has experienced telephone services a decade only. BSNL launched the first telephone service on May 24, 2001. In 2015, less than 70 households have landline connections out of the total households 462 which accounted for 46.2% while {{there were more than}} 280 previously. The improper functioning of BSNL landline and its higher tariff, most landline connections have been disconnected. World Land-Line (WLL) Service was also launched on November 25, 2007. The service has been available from remote villages of the eastern corner of Mizoram and the western slopes of Len Tlang in Myanmar. Though this new world of telephone services drains money to some extent. Mobile services are available only from 2009 with tower transmitters at the village. At the time of our field study, the total number of mobile handsets is 960 (provisional) and 1320 Sim-cards are in use. The reason why the imbalance in number of handsets and sim-cards is due to bad mobile signal. Two years before, mobile signal could only be detected from Biate Reliance Tower. Actually the first mobile service is provided by BSNL which started functioning on 26 June 2009 and followed by Reliance mobile service on November 10, 2009. Since its inception, Reliance company has preceded the BSNL mobile service on the basis of server maintenance. We may say that Reliance service is more reliable than that of the BSNL for Khawbung villagers. In 2010, Airtel tower was constructed and started functioning. Mobile services have provided better security for the village. Examples are — in the case of forest fires, information can be given earlier than before; emergency measures can be easily taken at night time when the village young boys were undergone for shutting-down forest fires in the jungle and watchmen also used mobile phones promptly for reporting when stolen bikers were trying to have passed through the village. For those stolen bikers, the village is the main route to enter Myanmar. So, mobile service strengthens the village security. No proper internet service provider has been entered the village except Community Information Centre (CIC) at BDO complex in 2005. But the authorized provider now stopped their service and all their equipment has been now turned into toys. However, mobile service providers make internet service available at present which can be accessed through handsets and PCs. Here, Reliance provider has provided adequate connection-speed which is, sometimes, little faster than that of Cybercafes in Aizawl. With the help of this internet connection, the websites of Khawbung Higher Secondary School, Mizo Hlakungpui Mual and Khawbung PHC were also uploaded. Several individuals and the students of Khawbung HSS are the beneficiaries of these mobile internet services. This advancement makes the village changing into a global village. At 10:15 pm on January 3, 2015, BSNL Broadband was started functioning and internet could be accessed with higher speed since then.|$|E

40|$|When a pile is {{installed}} in a layer of soft and compressible soil, the pile would be subjected to skin friction as the consequence of the relative settlements between the soil and the pile. Negative skin friction (NSF) is mobilized when soil settles more than the pile while positive skin friction (PSF) occurs vice versa. The location where NSF changes to PSF is called the neutral plane {{which is also the}} position where the relative movement is zero. This paper presents the results of a series of axis-symmetric coupled-consolidation finite element modeling of a wish-in-place pile embedded in a consolidating ground. Geometric non-linearity technique is adopted and the pile-soil interface is assumed to follow a bi-linear Coulomb type frictional behavior. Attempts have been made to study the effects of the soil's compressibility, pile <b>head</b> <b>loading</b> and pile end-bearing type on the development of skin friction and neutral plane with time. It is found that NSF is fully mobilized near the ground surface. In the case of floating piles, the neutral plane locates at about 65 % of the pile embedment length in long term regardless the soil's compressibility. The plane moves upward when a pile <b>head</b> <b>loading</b> is applied. The amount of dragload can be substantial compared to the pile <b>head</b> <b>loading.</b> 90 % of the neutral plane's final position is reached when only 50 % average degree of consolidation is complete, regardless the soil's compressibility and the magnitude of pile head load. For fixed-end piles, neutral plane always locates at the pile toe in long term. However, the position is not reached instantly when surcharge is placed in the case of loaded piles. © 2010 American Institute of Physics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|A set of {{formulas}} for {{the dynamic}} stiffness of a pile (spring and dashpot coefﬁcients) {{to use in}} inertial interaction analysis is proposed, utilising elastodynamic solutions. The method is based on solving a Lagrangian system of coupled equations for the pile and the soil motions {{for a range of}} vibration frequencies and also by considering the vertical, radial and angular stresses on the pile–soil interface. The solution extensively uses Bessel functions of the second kind and results are compared with ﬁnite-element models and ﬁeld pile load tests.

A formula is also proposed for estimation of the active length of a pile in a two-layered soil. A speciﬁc depth is introduced beyond which soil layering does not have any appreciable effects on dynamic stiffness. It is commonly (rather arbitrarily) assumed that the ﬁrst natural frequency of soil strata differentiates radiation (geometric) damping from hysteretic (material) damping for both types of interactions of the pile–soil system.

Methods: This is a comparative study using the F-Scan pressure platform (F-Mat; Texscan® Boston, MA) on a sample of children attending a podiatric clinic. Pressure measurements and temporal parameters were measured in 61 children between the ages of 5 and 16 years. Associations between joint hypermobility and hallux valgus angle also were investigated.

An aluminum femoral phantom and C 57 BIJ 6 femora were tested under compression with different loading directions. Both tests, with the aluminum phantom and the murine bones, showed and quantified the linear dependence of stiffness on loading direction: a 5 ' change in loading direction resulted in almost 30 % change in stiff ness.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the possible effects of age-related intracranial changes on the potential outcome of diffuse axonal injuries and acute subdural hematoma under rotational <b>head</b> <b>loading.</b> Methods: A simulation-based parametric study was conducted using an updated and validated finite element model of a rat head. The validation included a comparison of predicted brain cortex sliding with respect to the skull. Further, model material properties were modified to account for aging; predicted tissue strains were compared with experimental data in which groups of rats in 2 different lifecycle stages, young adult and mature adult, were subjected to rotational trauma. For the parameter study, 2 age-dependent factors-brain volume and region-specific brain material properties-were implemented into the model. The models young adult and old age were subjected to several injurious and subinjurious sagittal plane rotational acceleration levels. Results: Sequential analysis of the simulated trauma progression indicates that an increase in acute subdural hematoma injury risk indicator occurs at an early stage of the trauma, whereas an increase in diffuse axonal injury risk indicators occurs at a later stage. Tissue stiffening from young adult to mature adult rats produced an increase in strain-based thresholds accompanied by a wider spread of strain distribution toward the rear part of the brain, consistent with rotational trauma experiments with young adult and mature adult rats. Young adult to old age brain tissue softening and brain atrophy resulted in an increase in diffuse axonal injuries and acute subdural hematoma injury risk indicators, respectively. Conclusions: The findings presented in this study suggest that age-specific injury thresholds should be developed to enable the development of superior restraint systems for the elderly. The findings also motivate other further studies on age-dependency of head trauma...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the result of}} detailed back-analysis, using three-dimensional finite-element analysis, of the instrumented piled-raft foundation in monitoring site. The piled-raft foundation is a composite foundation structure that consisting of piles, raft and surrounding soils acting as a whole system. To check the reliability of soil taking load under the raft and obtain a reasonable value of load proportion taken by piles for the soil conditions in Hong Kong, a piled-raft foundation was partially instrumented in the monitoring site. The pile <b>head</b> <b>loading,</b> raft-soil contact pressure of specified area and settlement at raft top for selected locations were being monitored. Comparisons of overall settlement, differential settlements and the load carried by the piles show reasonably good agreement. Followed by a 3 D finite element modeling of the entire piled-raft foundation of the monitored site, the analysis includes a pile-soil slip interface model. The numerical analysis is performed to give insights to (1) load transfer behavior of the piled-raft foundation (2) effects of pile reduction on pile load ratio. Combined the observation from site monitoring and analysis results from the numerical analysis, the proportion of load shared between piles and raft is revealed as 7 : 3. The lower limit of pile ratio is proposed as 0. 67 for the site after the parametric study by removing piles strategically. In spite of the settlement-reducing purpose of the piles, the design of piled-raft foundation still concentrate on providing adequate axial capacity, with settlement requirement treated as a secondary issue. The significance {{of the study is}} that it provides factual evidence of soil taking the load under the raft, and the economical benefits of piled-raft foundation as a reduction of piles will save more than 2 million of the construction budgets. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the effects of single bored or jacked piles on an adjacent tunnel in sand. This is conducted by means of centrifuge model tests. Model piles were loaded close to a model tunnel in-flight of 75 g. The model tunnel is equivalent to a tunnel of 7. 5 m external diameter at prototype scale {{at a depth of}} 26. 3 m. It is instrumented with stain gauges and leaf springs for the measurement of tunnel lining behaviour and tunnel deformation. Back-analyses of the measured bending moments in the tunnel prior to being affected by an adjacent pile shows that the tunnel flexibility ratio is approximately 10. This tunnel is considered to be flexible, which is typical for most tunnels in the field. Field evidence shows that construction of bored piles close to tunnels in London Clay has only a very small effect. The centrifuge tests in this study show that the loading impact from the bored piles on the tunnel is rather limited. Even when the pile <b>head</b> <b>loading</b> is increased to the failure load (defined by a failure criterion of 10 % of pile diameter), the induced bending moment increases by less than 40 % of the pre-existing maximum bending moment and the associated tunnel deformation is less than 0. 1 % of tunnel diameter. These observations suggest the possibility of constructing bored piles very close to flexible tunnels. Contrary to bored piles, jacked piles cause a much greater impact on the tunnel. When the model jacked pile is installed adjacent to the tunnel, the induced bending moment at the tunnel near shoulder is increased by almost 100 %. Even worse, the value is increased to over 400 % at the crown if the pile is installed directly above the tunnel. The measured bending moment in the tunnel lining was found to be proportional to the estimated radial stress at the critical location of the tunnel.

40|$|Abstract. A {{low head}} {{hydropower}} station {{is in the}} southwest of China, its Francis turbine ran well at a rated power and rated net head, but the turbine produced severe abnormal vibration and noise at higher head than the rated <b>head,</b> full <b>load</b> and overload. By analyzing, characteristic points on vibration conditions are inside the area of channel vortices on runner performance curve. CFD analysis indicates that unstable vortices exist between runner blades. The two results demonstrate that the vibration and noise of Francis turbine are caused by runner channel vortices at higher head than the rated <b>head,</b> full <b>load</b> and overload...|$|R
40|$|Power head is {{the main}} motive {{mechanism}} of rotary drilling rig. High axial pressure and high frequency {{is one of its}} typical working conditions. Axial loading test is a key point in power head performance tests. Overall design, system theoretical analysis and simulation of power <b>head</b> axial <b>loading</b> system were carried out. The bond graph model and state equations of power <b>head</b> axial servo <b>loading</b> system were built on the basis of bond graph theory. Hydraulic system simulation model was constructed and axial steady-state and dynamic loading simulation was made by use of hydraulic simulation software. The maximum axial steady-state load is up to 450 kN and the dynamic frequency is 20 Hz, both of which can meet the technical requirements. The simulation validates the feasibility of the scheme about power <b>head</b> axial <b>loading</b> system and it provides theory and practice guidance for perfecting the loading system.  </p...|$|R
