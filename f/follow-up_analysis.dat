40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{expected}} value of sample information (EVSI) from prospective trials {{has previously been}} modeled {{as the product of}} EVSI per patient, and the number of patients across the relevant time horizon less those “used up” in trials. However, this implicitly assumes the eligible patient population to which information from a trial can be applied across a time horizon are independent of time for trial accrual, <b>follow-up</b> and <b>analysis.</b> MethodsThis article demonstrates that in calculating the EVSI of a trial, the number of patients who benefit from trial information should be reduced by those treated outside as well as within the trial over the time until trial evidence is updated, including time for accrual, <b>follow-up</b> and <b>analysis.</b> ResultsAccounting for time is shown to reduce the eligible patient population: 1) independent of the size of trial in allowing for time of <b>follow-up</b> and <b>analysis,</b> and 2) dependent on the size of trial for time of accrual, where the patient accrual rate is less than incidence. Consequently, the EVSI and expected net gain (ENG) at any given trial size are shown to be lower when accounting for time, with lower ENG reinforced in the case of trials undertaken while delaying decisions by additional opportunity costs of time. ConclusionsAppropriately accounting for time reduces the EVSI of trial design and increase opportunity costs of trials undertaken with delay, leading to lower likelihood of trialing being optimal and smaller trial designs where optimal...|$|R

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{feelings}} of self-disgust may have a functional role in the genesis of depression by partially mediating the cross-sectional relationship between dysfunctional thoughts and depressive symptoms. However, there are many outstanding issues regarding these hypothesised associations. First, {{it is not yet}} clear whether self-disgust is a temporal antecedent, concomitant, or consequence of depressive experience. Second, it is not known whether the hypothesised mediation sequence is valid over time. Third, the relative contribution of disgust towards different aspects of the self has not yet been examined. In the present longitudinal study, participants completed measures of dysfunctional cognitions, self-disgust and depressive symptoms at baseline, and at six and 12 -month <b>follow-ups.</b> <b>Analysis</b> showed that self-disgust is best considered as antecedent to depressive symptoms; the hypothesised mediation model was partially supported, but is too simplistic; and disgust towards physical aspects of the self, rather than behaviour, was more important as a temporal predictor of depressive symptoms. The current results help elucidate the role of self-disgust as an antecedent of depressive experience...|$|R

50|$|One common {{approach}} to handle outliers in data analysis is to perform outlier detection first, {{followed by an}} efficient estimation method (e.g., the least squares). While this approach is often useful, one must keep in mind two challenges. First, an outlier detection method that relies on a non-robust initial fit can suffer from the effect of masking, that is, a group of outliers can mask each other and escape detection. Second, if a high breakdown initial fit is used for outlier detection, the <b>follow-up</b> <b>analysis</b> might inherit some of the inefficiencies of the initial estimator.|$|E

For this process, urine must be collected in a reliable fashion, and if urine samples are inadequate, the urinary tract can be assessed via instrumentation.
