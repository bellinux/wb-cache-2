Four different dot blot hybridization assay systems were evaluated.

40|$|Bloodstream {{infections are}} {{potentially}} life-threatening and require rapid identification and antibiotic susceptibility {{testing of the}} causative pathogen {{in order to facilitate}} specific antimicrobial therapy. We developed a prototype DNA microarray for the identification and characterization of three important bacteremia-causing species: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The array consisted of 120 species-specific <b>gene</b> <b>probes</b> 200 to 800 bp in length that were amplified from recombinant plasmids. These <b>probes</b> represented <b>genes</b> encoding housekeeping proteins, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Evaluation with 42 clinical isolates, 3 reference strains, and 13 positive blood cultures revealed that the DNA microarray was highly specific in identifying S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa strains and in discriminating them from closely related gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains also known to be etiological agents of bacteremia. We found a nearly perfect correlation between phenotypic antibiotic resistance determined by conventional susceptibility testing and genotypic antibiotic resistance by hybridization to the S. aureus resistance <b>gene</b> <b>probes</b> mecA (oxacillin-methicillin resistance), aacA-aphD (gentamicin resistance), ermA (erythromycin resistance), and blaZ (penicillin resistance) and the E. coli resistance <b>gene</b> <b>probes</b> blaTEM- 106 (penicillin resistance) and aacC 2 (aminoglycoside resistance). Furthermore, antibiotic resistance and virulence <b>gene</b> <b>probes</b> permitted genotypic discrimination within a species.

To compare their relative efficiencies, these two sets of probes were radiolabeled with 32 P and were applied to 74 strains of E. coli with known enterotoxin profiles and to 156 previously unexamined E. coli isolates. The enterotoxigenic bacteria Vibrio cholerae O 1, Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 (NAG), Yersinia enterocolitica, and E. coli harboring the plasmid vectors of the polynucleotide <b>gene</b> <b>probes</b> were examined for further evaluation of probe specificity. The two classes of probes showed a perfect concordance in their specific detection and differentiation of enterotoxigenic E. coli. In the analysis of six strains, the signal strength on autoradiography after hybridization with oligonucleotides was weaker than that obtained after hybridization with polynucleotide probes. The probes did not hybridize with DNA from V. cholerae O 1, V. cholerae non-O 1 (NAG), or Y. enterocolitica.

The <b>gene</b> <b>probe</b> consisted of a 406 -base-pair, completely internal fragment covering 71 % of the structural gene with PstI linkers added to the ends. Six copies of this 415 -base-pair PstI fragment were cloned into plasmid pBR 322, which yielded large amounts of the probe DNA. One hundred forty-one V. parahaemolyticus strains were tested with the <b>gene</b> <b>probe,</b> and the results were compared with those of phenotypic assays for the thermostable direct hemolysin.

Hybridizations were conducted under relatively low-stringency (52 degrees C, no formamide, 5 x SSC) and high-stringency (52 degrees C, 50 % formamide, formamide, 5 x SSC) conditions (1 x SSC is 0. 15 M NaCl plus 0. 015 M sodium citrate). Under conditions of relatively low stringency, the Gottfried and OSU <b>gene</b> 9 <b>probes</b> demonstrated broad cross-reactivity and were useful in the detection of homologous and heterologous serotypes of group A rotaviruses.

40|$|Abstract Background Microarray is a {{high-throughput}} {{technology to}} study expression {{of thousands of}} genes in parallel. A critical aspect of microarray production is the design aimed at space optimization while maximizing the number of <b>gene</b> <b>probes</b> and their replicates to be spotted.

The user feeds the following inputs: type of source plates to be used, number of <b>gene</b> <b>probes</b> to be printed, number of replicates and number of pins {{to be used for}} printing. The solutions are stored in a text file. The choice of a design solution to be used will be governed by the spotting chemistry to be used and the accuracy of the robot.

While {{one of the}} reiterated DNA regions, pFR 2503, is {{closely linked to the}} B. japonicum common and genotype-specific nodulation genes in strain USDA 424, the other, pMAP 9, is located next to a Tn 5 insertion site in a host-range extension mutant of B. japonicum USDA 438. The DNA cloned in pFR 2503 and pMAP 9 are reiterated 18 to 21 times, respectively, in the genomes of B. japonicum serocluster 123 strains. <b>Gene</b> <b>probes</b> from the reiterated regions share sequence homology, failed to hybridize (or hybridized poorly) to genomic DNA from other B. japonicum and Bradyrhizobium spp. strains, and did not hybridize to DNA from Rhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium fredii, Rhizobium leguminosarum biovars trifolii, phaseoli, and viceae, or Agrobacterium tumefacians.

40|$|Nucleic acid {{hybridization}} (<b>gene</b> <b>probe)</b> and polymerase {{chain reaction}} (PCR) techniques {{have been used to}} detect viral nucleic acid in water. However, <b>gene</b> <b>probe</b> and PCR may not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious viruses. This study evaluated the ability of <b>gene</b> <b>probe</b> to detect viable poliovirus 1 (polio 1), from sterile and nonsterile groundwater, and the ability of PCR to detect infectious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) from tap and wastewater. The plaque forming (BGM cells), and the tissue culture infectious dose fifty (TCID₅₀) (PLC/PRF/ 5 cells) procedures were used to detect infectious polio 1 and HIV- 1, respectively. Detection of polio 1 by <b>gene</b> <b>probe</b> and cell culture was similar in nonsterile water and in filter sterilized water, but not in autoclaved water. These results suggest that in some natural waters, detection of polio 1 by <b>gene</b> <b>probe</b> may correlate to detection by cell culture procedures. Although detection of infectious HIV- 1 by cell culture decreased gradually, until no virus could be found, detection by PCR remained positive throughout the study. Therefore, it was concluded that the use of PCR to assess the risk associated to the presence of HIV- 1 in polluted waters, may not be adequate. The enteric adenovirus types 40 (Ead 40) and 41 (Ead 41) are considered the second most important cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, but their role as waterborne pathogens is uncertain. This study compared the survival of Ead 40 and Ead 41 with polio 1, and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in different types of water. The Enteric adenoviruses survived longer in tap and sea water than either polio 1 or HAV, but only slightly better in wastewater. These results suggest that the enteric adenoviruses may survive for prolonged periods in water, representing a potential route of transmission. This study evaluated also the concentration of Ead 40 by the filter adsorption-elution method. With negatively-charged filters, recovery efficiencies of 22, 36, and 38 % were obtained from secondary sewage, tap and sea water, respectively. Using electropositive filters, Ead 40 was recovered from tap water with an efficiency of 26. 5 %. These results show that Ead 40 can be concentrated, from water, with an efficiency comparable to that of other enteric viruses...|$|E

The {{temporal}} and spatial pattern of replication of chorion gene clusters in follicle cells during oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila nasuta was examined by [3 H] thymidine autoradiography and by in situ hybridization with chorion <b>gene</b> <b>probes.</b> When pulse labelled with [3 H] thymidine, the follicle cells from stage 10 - 12 ovarian follicles of both Drosophila melanogaster and, Drosophila nasuta often showed intense labelling at {{only one or two}} sites per nucleus. In situ hybridization of chorion <b>gene</b> <b>probes</b> derived from Drosophila melanogaster with follicle cell nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila nasuta revealed these discrete [3 H] thymidine labelled sites to correspond to the two amplifying chorion gene clusters. It appears, therefore, that in spite of evolutionary divergence, the organization and programme of selective amplification of chorion genes in ovarian follicle cells have remained generally similar in these two species.
