5|$|The killings shocked both Northern Ireland and Ireland and put {{a serious}} strain on Anglo-Irish relations. The Irish Times {{reported}} that on the night following the attack, the British ambassador Sir Arthur Galsworthy was summoned to hear the Government of Ireland's strong feelings regarding {{the murder of the}} three band members. The government held the view that the British Government had not <b>done</b> <b>enough</b> to stop sectarian assassinations in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Haiko, {{the family moved to}} a rented house in Porvoo where, in August 1917, Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia, her only son and the heir to the dynasty. The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not <b>done</b> <b>enough</b> to help the Romanovs.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{treaties}} were signed, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, acting {{in his capacity}} as US Indian agent, visited La Pointe. He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the Ojibwa and Dakota. Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du Flambeau or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not <b>done</b> <b>enough</b> to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E

Dodger management felt Stengel had not <b>done</b> <b>enough</b> with the talent {{he had been}} given, and he was fired during the 1936 World Series between the Yankees and Giants. Stengel was paid for one year left on his contract, {{and he was not}} involved in baseball during the 1937 season. Stengel had invested in oil properties, as advised by one of his players, Randy Moore, a Texan; the investment helped make the Stengels well to do, and they put the profits in California real estate. Stengel considered going in the oil business full-time, but Braves president Bob Quinn offered him the Boston managerial job in late 1937, and he accepted.|$|E
5|$|The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II is a bestselling 1997 non-fiction {{book written}} by Iris Chang about the 1937–1938 Nanking Massacre, the {{massacre}} and atrocities {{committed by the}} Imperial Japanese Army after it captured Nanjing, then capital of China, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It describes the {{events leading up to}} the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities that were committed. The book presents the view that the Japanese government has not <b>done</b> <b>enough</b> to redress the atrocities. It {{is one of the first}} major English-language books to introduce the Nanking Massacre to Western and Eastern readers alike, and has been translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and {{immediately}} after World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 194647 and Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs {{in the next two}} Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had <b>done</b> <b>enough</b> to tour England with The Invincibles in 1948, his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.|$|E

5|$|In any case, Brown had <b>done</b> <b>enough</b> to {{be chosen}} to tour England with the Invincibles in 1948, {{although}} Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination. Brown made a strong start in the tour matches preceding the Tests. In the fifth fixture, which was against Cambridge University, Brown top-scored with 200 in an innings victory. In the following match against Essex, Brown combined with Bradman in a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes, ending with 153 as Australia scored a world-record 721 runs in one day. Australia proceeded to another innings victory, and Brown completed his third century in as many innings with 108 against Oxford University. He preceded to add a fourth century {{in less than three}} weeks, with 122 against Nottinghamshire, and made an unbeaten 81 against Hampshire. In contrast, middle-order batsman Neil Harvey had struggled in the initial stages of his first tour of England, failing to pass 25 in his first six innings. Thus, Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle order, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.|$|E

He went on to play in all five matches of the series. Panesar was selected for the first Test, but his bowling did not impress and he was dropped {{for the remainder of}} the series, leaving Swann as England's only slow bowler.|$|E
