6000|$|... 'I see! Kally, my dear, we are {{connections}} now, you know, and I {{have heard}} of Mr. White's plan.

I've given the old set the go-by--I'm trying to live up to your standard. It would be <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were here to help me. When I was a kid it was always easier to be good for awhile after I'd talked things over with you. I've got the best mother a fellow ever had, but you and I were such chums, weren't we, Avis? I thought I'd just break down in there tonight and put a damper on everything by crying like a baby. If anybody had spoken about you, I should have. Hello!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The distinction, however, {{seems to}} be that the warriors of the past went in for tournaments, which were at least {{dangerous}} for themselves, while the Futurists go in for motor-cars, which are mainly alarming for other people. It is the Futurist in his motor who does the [...] "aggressive movement," [...] but it is the pedestrians who go in for the [...] "running" [...] and the [...] "perilous leap." [...] Section No. 4 says, [...] "We declare that the splendour of the world has been enriched with a new form of beauty, the beauty of speed. A race-automobile adorned with great pipes like serpents with explosive breath.... A race-automobile which seems to rush over exploding powder is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace." [...] It is also much <b>easier,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have the money. It is quite clear, however, that you cannot be a Futurist at all unless you are frightfully rich. Then follows this lucid and soul-stirring sentence: [...] "5. We will sing the praises of man holding the flywheel of which the ideal steering-post traverses the earth impelled itself around the circuit of its own orbit." [...] What a jolly song it would be--so hearty, and with such a simple swing in it! I can imagine the Futurists round the fire in a tavern trolling out in chorus some ballad with that incomparable refrain; shouting over their swaying flagons some such words as these: ...|$|E
5000|$|Side Slide/Butter Slide - Position {{yourself}} {{directly behind}} the boat with a palms-down grip. Rotate the board sideways without turning on edge - the board should slide. As you slide sideways, lean back so the boat doesn't pull you forward. It makes it much <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> pull the handle {{and place it on}} your hip while you turn sideways. You should lean away from the boat just a little.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS) in D, method {{chaining}} {{is particularly}} <b>easy.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> write x.toInt (...)and {{the type of}} [...] {{does not provide a}} [...] member function, then the compiler looks for a free function of the form toInt(x);This enables chaining methods in a fluent way like this x.toInt (...)

It looks easy enough, {{but it is not}} <b>easy</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't know how to do it. It is like rowing; it looks the easiest thing in the world until you try, and then you find that it is not easy at all." ...|$|R

It is <b>easy</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are a blind old beggar {{who knows the}} path. And by the way, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have aught to eat I should be glad of a bite and a sup, since in Amada food has been scarce for this last month, and to-night there is little left." ...|$|R
50|$|When a Janitor finds you, he {{will blow}} his whistle and proceed to chase you {{wherever}} you go until you outrun him or lose him by hiding. If he catches up to you, he will repeatedly hit you with his bat until you are dead. The Janitor finds you much <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> make loud noises (running, opening doors etc..) and whether you are hiding in the dark or light won't affect how easily you can be discovered as he wields a flashlight {{in his left hand}} at all times.|$|E
5000|$|Laser {{rangefinders}} may {{be effectively}} used in various sports that require precision distance measurement, such as golf, hunting, and archery. Some {{of the more}} popular manufacturers are Opti-logic Corporation, Bushnell, Leupold, LaserTechnology, Trimble, Leica, Newcon Optik, Op.Electronics, Nikon, and Swarovski Optik.Many rangefinders come with advanced features, such as ARC (angle range compensation), multi distance ability, slope, JOLT (Vibrate when target is locked), and Pin-Seeking [...] [...] ARC Can be calculated by hand using the rifleman's rule, but it's usually much <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> let a rangefinder do it when you are out hunting. In golfing where time is most important, a laser rangefinder comes useful in locating distance to flag. Many hunters in the eastern U.S. don't need a rangefinder, although many western hunters need them, due to longer shooting distances and more open spaces.|$|E
5000|$|In London, his {{comments}} in an NBC interview {{in which he}} referred to [...] "disconcerting stories" [...] over security concerns regarding readiness of the London 2012 Olympic Games were widely viewed as undiplomatic by the British press and leading politicians. British Prime Minister David Cameron defended the Olympic security preparations: [...] "We are holding an Olympic Games {{in one of the}} busiest most active bustling cities anywhere in the world. Of course it's <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere. I visited Naypyidaw recently, in Burma, they've got six-lane highways and no cars on them. This is a busy, bustling city so inevitably you're going to have challenges." [...] While Cameron's aides stated he didn't intend a jibe at Romney or Salt Lake City, the British press seized upon the [...] "middle of nowhere" [...] remark, construing it as an allusion to Utah where Romney had managed the Olympics in 2002.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, really, sir. I'm {{making any}} number of observations, and they all confirm my theory. Human nature is {{consistently}} underrated in business, people do themselves out of {{an awful lot of}} pleasure and profit by that. Of course, you must be perfectly genuine and open, but that's <b>easy</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> feel it. The more human and generous you are the better chance you've got in business." ...|$|R

5000|$|Early on in MC Solaar's career it was {{important}} for him to share the struggles and the different hardships for Black people that migrated to France and tried to make a living. Most of his music was dedicated to enlightening the population of a specific deeper message that connected to him in his life. [...] "... he addresses the conditions under which Black people have migrated to and settled in France. In the piece 'Leve-toi et rap,' he describes his Chadian parents' migration from Senegal to a Parisian suburb, the main stages of his teenage years and how he finally came to discover rap." [...] In an interview MC Solaar described the feeling of making a song and the thought process while just writing any part of lyrics that go into his music. [...] "I write quickly, because of the music, he tells me. It's much <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have the music, the rhythm, but I am fast. First, I have taken in [...] "everything". Do you never write before the music? Ah. I used to, he admits. But when I met the music, I changed." ...|$|E
5000|$|There is, in the Buddhist view, nothing uniquely wicked {{about sexual}} offenses or failings. Those {{inclined}} {{to develop a}} guilt-complex about their sex-life should realize that failure in this respect is neither more, nor, on the other hand, less serious than failure {{to live up to}} any other precept. In point of fact, the most difficult precept of all for nearly everybody to live up to is the fourth — to refrain from all forms of wrong speech (which often includes uncharitable comments on other people's real or alleged sexual failings!)...What precisely, then, does the Third Precept imply for the ordinary lay Buddhist? Firstly, in common with all the other precepts, it is a rule of training. It is not a [...] "commandment" [...] from God, the Buddha, or anyone else saying: [...] "Thou shalt not..." [...] There are no such commandments in Buddhism. It is an undertaking by you to yourself, to do your best to observe a certain type of restraint, because you understand that it is a good thing to do. This must be clearly understood. If you don't think it is a good thing to do, you should not undertake it. If you do think it is a good thing to do, but doubt your ability to keep it, you should do your best, and probably, you can get some help and instruction to make it <b>easier.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> feel it is a good thing to attempt to tread the Buddhist path, you may undertake this and the other precepts, with sincerity, in this spirit.|$|E
