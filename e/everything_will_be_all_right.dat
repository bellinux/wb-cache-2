500|$|The afterlife {{experienced}} by the survivors is shown during season six. In [...] "The Substitute", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of European History. In [...] "Dr. Linus", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger (Jon Gries), who is on life support. At school, he is shown to have {{a close relationship with}} his star pupil, Alex, and befriends a substitute teacher, John Locke. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus. [...] Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his affair and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to Yale University will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a recommendation letter. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices Desmond Hume waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he was only trying to help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he [...] "has a few things to work out". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a [...] "real good number two", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds [...] "And you were a great number one, Hugo." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{meditation}} {{was not a}} major aspect of the Confucian life until the Neo-Confucian era. At this time Buddhism and Daoism had begun to expand into China and started to influence some aspects of Chinese culture. Even though there are some similarities, {{there are also some}} fundamental differences. Confucian meditation, unlike Daoist and Buddhist meditation, does not require the stopping of rational thought, but instead relies upon disciplined attention to one's current situation and mental phenomena. Its purpose is to develop as an individual in order to find full realization. (Johnston 2006) As Zhu Xi notes in on Things at Hand: [...] "Whenever you have to attend to your daily affairs, or undertake any matter, always spend some time in meditation and <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right" [...] (Zhu Xi, 4:25).|$|R

He warned [...] "the day will come when we purge our country of them".In that same interview, after being told about the kidnapping of a Sunni parliament member, Mashhadani replied with [...] "Why kidnap this Muslim woman? Instead of Tayseer, why not kidnap Margaret or Jwan?", Margaret referring to Assyrian Christians and Jwan referring to Kurds.In late July 2006 at a speech before a UN-sponsored conference on transitional justice and reconciliation in Baghdad he said [...] "Just get your hands off Iraq and the Iraqi people and Muslim countries, and <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right."

60|$|Another {{more popular}} {{school of thought}} holds to an entirely {{contrary}} opinion. The whole trouble, they say, comes from the sad collapse of Germany. These unhappy people, having been too busy for four years in destroying valuable property in France and Belgium {{to pay attention to}} their home affairs, now find themselves collapsed: it is our first duty to pick them up again. The English should therefore take all the money they can find and give it to the Germans.
