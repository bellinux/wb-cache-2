40|$|The {{significance}} of blood monocytes {{as a source}} of osteoclast precursors was investigated during 1 alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol-stimulated bone resorption in mice. Animals were given three injections of tritiated thymidine at 8 hourly intervals in order to label blood monocytes. The proportion of labelled monocytes was then compared with the proportion of labelled nuclei in osteoclasts, the formation of which was provoked by daily injections of 1 alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol, beginning 48 hours after the first injection of isotope. Although more than 60 % of blood monocytes were labelled during the period of peak osteoclast formation, labelling of osteoclast nuclei in the metaphyseal <b>endosteum</b> of the femur never exceeded 8 %. These results suggest strongly that the majority of osteoclast nuclei were derived from a source of unlabelled precursors, and that very few osteoclasts were derived directly from blood monocytes. Although few labelled osteoclasts were found, the proportion of labelled spindle shaped cells in the metaphyseal <b>endosteum</b> rose gradually to 16 %. It is likely, therefore, that labelled mononuclear cells, possibly blood monocytes, were attracted to the <b>endosteum</b> where they formed a population of tissue macrophages.

We studied the microanatomic partitioning of transplanted normal and α 4 integrin-deficient Lin−kit+ cells in trabecular and compact bone before and after irradiation and present robust quantitative data on both. We found that (1) the microanatomic distribution of normal highly enriched progenitor cells is random in nonirradiated recipients based on area distribution analyses, (2) in contrast, in irradiated hosts normal cells distribute preferentially near the <b>endosteum,</b> (3) the overall cell seeding efficiency was higher in trabecular versus compact bone both before and after irradiation, and (4) α 4 integrin-deficient cells not only lodge with reduced overall efficiency confirming previous data, but fail to preferentially partition themselves into endosteal regions in irradiated hosts, as normal cells do.

40|$|Intramedullary nails {{are used}} to {{stabilise}} fractures of the proximal femur. The nail acts by transferring loads from the proximal fraction {{to the rest of}} the femoral shaft. The way in which this occurs depends to a large extent on the design of the distal end of the nail. This is not dissimilar to the situation with regard to load shedding (or load transfer) from the femoral component of a total hip replacement. A finite element model of a fractured femur with either a neck or a subtrochanteric fracture is set up to investigate the effects of nail length, nail distal stiffness and material stiffness on the structural behaviour of the system. Specifically what is considered is the influence of these parameters on the stress across the fracture and the normal pressure that the nail exerts on the <b>endosteum</b> of the femoral diaphysis. It is found that a longer nail could produce higher contact stress between the tip of the nail and the <b>endosteum.</b> Also, this contact stress is reduced when the distal region of the nail is made more flexible either by incorporating longitudinal slots or by using a material with a lower modulus of elasticity...|$|E
40|$|In {{the bone}} marrow, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in {{specific}} niches near osteoblast-lineage cells at the <b>endosteum.</b> To investigate {{the regulation of}} these endosteal niches, we studied the mobilization of HSCs into the blood-stream in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). We report that G-CSF mobilization rapidly depletes endosteal osteoblasts, leading to suppressed endosteal bone formation and decreased expression of factors required for HSC retention and self-renewal. Importantly, G-CSF administration also depleted a population of trophic endosteal macrophages (osteomacs) that support osteoblast function. Osteomac loss, osteoblast suppression, and HSC mobilization occurred concomitantly, suggesting that osteomac loss could disrupt endosteal niches. Indeed, in vivo depletion of macrophages, in either macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (Mafia) transgenic mice or by administration of clodronate-loaded liposomes to wild-type mice, recapitulated the: (1) loss of endosteal osteoblasts and (2) marked reduction of HSC-trophic cytokines at the <b>endosteum,</b> with (3) HSC mobilization into the blood, as observed during G-CSF administration. Together, these results establish that bone marrow macrophages are pivotal to maintain the endosteal HSC niche and {{that the loss of}} such macrophages leads to the egress of HSCs into the blood. © 2010 by The American Society of Hematology...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} chemokine profiles and their functional roles in the early phase of fracture healing in mouse models. METHODS: The expression profiles of chemokines were examined during fracture healing in wild-type (WT) mice using a polymerase chain reaction array and histological staining. The functional effect of monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) on primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells (mBMSCs) was evaluated using an in vitro migration assay. MCP- 1 -/- and C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR 2) -/- mice were fractured and evaluated by histological staining and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). RS 102895, an antagonist of CCR 2, was continuously administered in WT mice before or after rib fracture and evaluated by histological staining and micro-CT. Bone graft exchange models were created in WT and MCP- 1 -/- mice and were evaluated by histological staining and micro-CT. RESULTS: MCP- 1 and MCP- 3 expression in the early phase of fracture healing were up-regulated, and high levels of MCP- 1 and MCP- 3 protein expression observed in the periosteum and <b>endosteum</b> in the same period. MCP- 1, but not MCP- 3, increased migration of mBMSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Fracture healing in MCP- 1 -/- and CCR 2 -/- mice was delayed compared with WT mice on day 21. Administration of RS 102895 in the early, but not in the late phase, caused delayed fracture healing. Transplantation of WT-derived graft into host MCP- 1 -/- mice significantly increased new bone formation in the bone graft exchange models. Furthermore, marked induction of MCP- 1 expression in the periosteum and <b>endosteum</b> was observed around the WT-derived graft in the host MCP- 1 -/- mouse. Conversely, transplantation of MCP- 1 -/- mouse-derived grafts into host WT mice markedly decreased new bone formation. CONCLUSIONS: MCP- 1 /CCR 2 signaling in the periosteum and <b>endosteum</b> is essential for the recruitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells in the early phase of fracture healing...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Bone repair {{requires}} {{the mobilization of}} adult skeletal stem cells/progenitors to allow deposition of cartilage and bone at the injury site. These stem cells/progenitors are believed to come from multiple sources including the bone marrow and the periosteum. The goal {{of this study was}} to establish the cellular contributions of bone marrow and periosteum to bone healing in vivo and to assess the effect of the tissue environment on cell differentiation within bone marrow and periosteum. Results show that periosteal injuries heal by endochondral ossification, whereas bone marrow injuries heal by intramembranous ossification, indicating that distinct cellular responses occur within these tissues during repair. Next, lineage analyses were used to track the fate of cells derived from periosteum, bone marrow, and <b>endosteum,</b> a subcompartment of the bone marrow. Skeletal progenitor cells were found to be recruited locally and concurrently from periosteum and/or bone marrow/endosteum during bone repair. Periosteum and bone marrow/endosteum both gave rise to osteoblasts, whereas the periosteum was the major source of chondrocytes. Finally, results show that intrinsic and environmental signals modulate cell fate decisions within these tissues. In conclusion, this study sheds light into the origins of skeletal stem cells/progenitors during bone regeneration and indicates that periosteum, <b>endosteum,</b> and bone marrow contain pools of stem cells/progenitors with distinct osteogenic and chondrogenic potentials that vary with the tissue environment...|$|E
40|$|Using histochemistry and {{electron}} microscopy, {{the reduced}} bone formation which {{occurs in the}} hypokinetic, orthostatically treated adult rat has been studied. The two major changes noted occurred in the osteoblast population, indicated by a reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and reduced numbers of gap junctions between cells. These results were most noticeable in the periosteum and <b>endosteum</b> of the long bones. Changes in osteoblasts lining the surface of trabecular bone were not as evident. These {{results indicate that the}} cells lining the surfaces of weight bearing bones are most affected by hypokinesia and this reduction in cellular activity may be a mechanically induced effect...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the bone}} marrow (BM), hematopoietic {{progenitor}} cells (HPCs) are localized in poorly oxygenated niches where they interact with the surrounding osteoblasts (OBs) through VLA 4 /VCAM- 1 engagement, and are exposed to interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), stem cell factor (SCF), and chemokines such as CXCL 12 (OB factors). Umbilical cord (UC) is more highly oxygenated that the BM microenvironment. When UC-HPCs {{are exposed to the}} 2 % to 3 % O 2 concentration found in the bone <b>endosteum,</b> their survival is significantly decreased. However, engagement of VLA- 4 integrins on UCB-derived CD 34 + cells reduced cell death in 2 % to 3 % O 2 conditions, which was associated with an increase in phospho-Ser 473 AKT and an increase in phospho-Ser 9 GSK 3 b. Consistent with the role of GSK 3 b in destabilizing beta-catenin, there was more cytoplasmic beta-catenin in UC-HPCs exposed to 2 % to 3 % O 2 on fibronectin, compared with suspension culture. UC-HPCs cultured at 2 % to 3 % O 2 with OB factors showed an increase in nuclear beta-catenin and persistence of a small pool of CD 34 + 38 − HPCs. CFU assays followed by surface phenotyping of the plated colonies showed improved maintenance of mixed lineage colonies with both erythroid and megakaryocytic precursors. These studies provide a biologic perspective for how UC-derived HPCs adapt to the bone <b>endosteum,</b> which is low in oxygen and densely populated by osteoblasts...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) {{participate in}} multiple {{stages of the}} fetal skeletogenic program from promoting cell condensation to regulating chondrogenesis and bone formation through endochondral ossification. Here, we show that these pleiotropic functions are recapitulated when recombinant BMPs are used to augment skeletal tissue repair. In addition to their well-documented ability to stimulate chondrogenesis in a skeletal injury, we show that recombinant BMPs (rBMPs) simultaneously suppress the differentiation of skeletal progenitor cells in the <b>endosteum</b> and bone marrow cavity to an osteoblast lineage. Both the prochondrogenic and antiosteogenic effects are achieved because rBMP inhibits endogenous β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling. In the injured periosteum, this repression of Wnt activity results in sox 9 upregulation; consequently, cells in the injured periosteum adopt a chondrogenic fate. In the injured <b>endosteum,</b> rBMP also inhibits Wnt signaling, which results in the runx 2 and collagen type I downregulation; consequently, cells in this region fail to differentiate into osteoblasts. In muscle surrounding the skeletal injury site, rBMP treatment induces Smad phosphorylation followed by exuberant cell proliferation, an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, and chondrogenic differentiation. Thus different populations of adult skeletal progenitor cells interpret the same rBMP stimulus in unique ways, and these responses mirror the pleiotropic effects of BMPs during fetal skeletogenesis. These mechanistic insights may be particularly useful for optimizing the reparative potential of rBMPs while simultaneously minimizing their adverse outcomes. © 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|E
40|$|An optical {{coherence}} tomography {{study for}} imaging the round window niche and the promontorium tympani Tympanosclerosis may involve the tympanic membrane, the ossicles, and the oval and round window niche, respectively. The surgical treatment of the obliterated oval window niche is most challenging. Beside stapesplasty, vibroplasty coupling the floating mass transducer (FMT) onto the round window niche and into a new, so-called third window is indicated. In the latter situation, drilling a hole into the promontorium is necessary to couple the FMT close to the membranous <b>endosteum.</b> Damage of the membranous inner ear must be avoided. The question was whether OCT is useful to identify the <b>endosteum</b> and to provide microanatomical information of the round window niche. OCT was carried out on human temporal bone preparations, in which a third window was drilled leaving the membranous labyrinth and the fluid-filled inner ear intact and the overhang of the round window niche was removed. An especially equipped operating microscope with integrated OCT prototype (spectral-domain-OCT) was used. The OCT images and 3 D reconstructions demonstrate the usefulness of OCT to measure the drilling cavity, to visualize the inner ear structures, and to obtain microanatomical information of the round and oval window niche.
