5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process <b>for</b> <b>interpreting</b> and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework <b>for</b> <b>interpreting</b> the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device <b>for</b> <b>interpreting</b> tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology. The T3 was later marketed internationally {{with the help of the}} UK Trade & Investment's passport initiative– a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.|$|E

Frustrated by his lack of progress and the brutality of the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him the Loom of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and chaos in the future, with Sloan responsible <b>for</b> <b>interpreting</b> the code.|$|E

The first part focuses on the definition: the community interpretations and the profession that we can meet in the community interpreting. There is a comparison of the community <b>interpreting</b> <b>for</b> the deaf and the community <b>interpreting</b> <b>for</b> foreigners and migrants, this involves a comparison of the ethical codes of both target groups. Briefly we are going to introduce a history of <b>interpreting</b> <b>for</b> the deaf. This thesis provides information about a supplier of community interpreting in the Czech Republic, that is the register of social services and The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

50|$|Compilers are not {{the only}} translators used to {{transform}} source programs. An interpreter is computer software that transforms and then executes the indicated operations. The translation process influences the design of computer languages which leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation.

25|$|Depending on {{the type}} of the input data, the {{approach}} <b>for</b> <b>interpreting</b> a gesture could be done in different ways.

25|$|The Ten Commandments, {{also known}} as the Decalogue, are a set of biblical laws {{relating}} to ethics and worship, which play a fundamental role in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Despite the striking divergence of meaning here between the Septuagint and later texts, nearly identical consonantal Hebrew source texts can be reconstructed.
