2500|$|The USAAF's Aircraft Warning Corps {{provided}} {{air defense}} warning with information centers that networked an area's [...] "Army Radar Stations" [...] which communicated radar tracks by telephone. [...] The AWC information centers also integrated visual reports processed by <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> Corps filter centers. [...] AWC information centers notified air defense command posts of the [...] "4 continental air forces" [...] for deploying interceptor aircraft which used command guidance for ground-controlled interception. [...] The USAAF inactivated the aircraft warning network in April 1944.|$|E
2500|$|At noon {{the advance}} on the II Corps front had been {{stopped by the}} local German {{defenders}} and their artillery. The arrival of the British advance further north on the green line, [...] beyond the Steenbeek on the XIX Corps front at about [...] {{took a long time}} to be communicated to the British divisional headquarters because of mist, slow going by runners, cut signal cables and poor reconnaissance results from contact-patrol aircraft, caused by troops being unwilling to light flares while overlooked by German defences. Around [...] Gough ordered all XIX Corps troops to advance to the green line, in support of the three brigades which had reached it. Delays persisted and a German force approaching from behind the Broodseinde–Passchendaele ridge was not seen by British aircraft. A message from a <b>ground</b> <b>observer</b> did not reach 15th Division headquarters until [...] and rain began soon after, cutting off the view of advanced British troops by artillery observers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the period}} after [...] (Operation Beach Party), 52 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Fourth Balloon Wing, {{developed}} a III Wing practice of co-operation during artillery observation, by having balloon observers direct preliminary ranging, until shells were landing {{close to a}} target, then handing over to the aeroplane observer for the final corrections of aim. When the air observer had ranged the guns, the balloon observer took over again. The new method economised on aircrew and {{had the advantage of}} telephone communication between the ground and the balloon, since aircraft wireless could only transmit. Air co-operation with Royal Engineer sound ranging was also practised. A line of microphones were connected to a receiving station further back and activated by a forward observer. Air observers routinely sent [...] "NF" [...] by wireless and a position report when German batteries were seen to be firing and since German shelling often cut off the <b>ground</b> <b>observer</b> from contact with the rear, the sound-ranging station was equipped with a wireless receiver and used receipt of [...] "NF", to activate the sound ranging apparatus. The device could also be used to identify the position of German artillery, when the air observer was unable accurately to indicate the position of the guns; balloon observers also assisted the ranging section, by reporting gun flashes.|$|E

40|$|The hazards from di use {{laser light}} re ections o water clouds, ice clouds, and fog and from {{possible}} specular re ections o ice clouds were assessed with the American National Standards (ANSI Z 136. 1 { 1986) for the free-electron-laser parameters under {{consideration for the}} Segmented E cient Laser Emission for Non-Nuclear Electricity (SELENE) Program. Di use laser re ection hazards exist for water cloud surfaces less than 722 m in altitude and ice cloud surfaces less than 850 m in altitude. Specular re ections from ice crystals in cirrus clouds are not probable; however, any specular re ection is a hazard to <b>ground</b> <b>observers.</b> The hazard to the laser operators and any <b>ground</b> <b>observers</b> during heavy fog conditions is of such signi cant magnitude that the laser should not be operated in fog...|$|R

50|$|The Aircraft Warning Service (AWS) was a {{civilian}} {{service of the}} United States Army <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> Corps instated during World War II to keep watch for enemy planes entering American airspace. It became inactive on May 29, 1944.|$|E
5|$|Initially, <b>ground</b> <b>observers</b> {{confirmed}} that pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure GNSS Flight Recorders that record the position {{every few seconds}} from GPS satellites. These recording devices now provide the proof that the turn-points have been reached.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the initial}} and most {{important}} uses of RFC aircraft was observing artillery fire behind the enemy front line at targets {{that could not be}} seen by <b>ground</b> <b>observers.</b> The fall of shot of artillery fire were easy enough for the pilot to see, providing he was looking {{in the right place at}} the right time; apart from this the problem was communicating corrections to the battery.|$|R
50|$|The {{results were}} mixed. Observing {{artillery}} fire, even from above, requires training and skill. Within artillery units, <b>ground</b> <b>observers</b> received mentoring {{to develop their}} skill, which was not available to RFC aircrew. There were undoubtedly some very skilled artillery observers in the RFC, but there were many who were not {{and there was a}} tendency for 'optimism bias' - reported on-target rounds that weren't. The procedures were also time consuming.|$|R
50|$|The NSSCC had a room {{dedicated}} as {{a filter}} center for monitoring communications and obtaining observations. The filter center had displays listing the orbiting and decayed satellites and a projector {{system that could}} show the motion of one satellite over the earth. The displays were devised by A/3C Peter P. Kamrowski. The center was manned by a Duty Controller and his assistants. The center was designed by Senior Controller 1st Lt Cotter, based on his earlier experience as a volunteer member of the USAF <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> Corps (the <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> Corps filter centers were in turn based on United Kingdom aircraft tracking centers developed during World War II to track Nazi aircraft).|$|E
5000|$|Organisations {{similar to}} the ROC were formed {{elsewhere}} during the Second World War, including the <b>Ground</b> <b>Observer</b> Corps, (USA), the Aircraft Identity Corps, (Canada), and the Volunteer Air Observers Corps, (Australia). However, unlike the Royal Observer Corps, most of these organisations had been disbanded {{by the end of}} the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the combat}} death of most World War I aces, the {{circumstances}} of Schoen's are well known.

50|$|In {{a typical}} HALO exercise, the {{parachutist}} will {{jump from the}} aircraft, free-fall {{for a period of}} time at terminal velocity, and open their parachute at an altitude as low as 600 meters. The combination of high downward speed, minimal forward airspeed, and the use of only small amounts of metal helps to defeat radar and reduces the amount of time a parachute might be visible to <b>ground</b> <b>observers,</b> enabling a stealthy insertion.|$|R
25|$|However, another {{analysis}} of this combat shows that the Regia Aeronautica pilots claimed a total of 17 aircraft on 20 April and claimed to have downed 15 Spitfires in this engagement; although Italian <b>ground</b> <b>observers</b> claimed to have seen 14 aircraft crash into the sea or onto land, only one Spitfire, flown by Flg Off Drecki of 145 Sqn, was heavily damaged. In return, three C.205Vs were lost. There is also a possibility that Bf 109s of I./JG77 were involved in this engagement.|$|R
50|$|Enemy {{artillery}} can {{be detected}} in two ways, either by direct observation of the guns from the air or by <b>ground</b> <b>observers</b> (including specialist reconnaissance), or from their firing signatures. This includes radars tracking the shells in flight to determine their place of origin, sound ranging detecting guns firing and resecting their position from pairs of microphones or cross-observation of gun flashes using observation by human observers or opto-electronic devices, although the widespread adoption of 'flashless' propellant limited {{the effectiveness of the}} latter.|$|R
