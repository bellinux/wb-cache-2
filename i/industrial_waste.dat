5|$|Delhi's {{municipal}} water supply is {{managed by the}} Delhi Jal Board (DJB). , it supplied 650million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> water is 70MGD. A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad {{produces}} around 4,500tonnes {{of solid}} waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased <b>industrial</b> <b>waste,</b> air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E

40|$|This {{article has}} focused on the {{relatively}} low priority accorded <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> compared to human wastes by the public health community in the period from 1876 through 1932. The critical reason for this prioritization was the potential for acute health effects from human wastes as compared with the belief that <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> had only indirect effects. State departments of health normally only responded to <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> when they endangered the potable nature of water supplies or interfered with water and sewage treatment processes. Within the public health community, however, a relatively small group of interdisciplinary professionals argued for attention to the indirect health effects of <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> and their impacts on the total stream environment. In conjunction with other groups interested in clean streams [...] such as sportsmen and manufacturers who required high quality process water [...] they pushed for a broader state legislative mandate in regard to pollution control. Some states created new bureaus or boards with responsibility for <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> and the larger stream environment but the attack on industrial pollution remained limited in this period. The final significant development regarding industrial pollution and public health concerned the formulation by Streeter-Phelps of the Public Health Service of a theory of stream purification with a set of general quantitative indicators. This application was of particular importance in regard to the high-oxygen consuming nature of organic <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> and the wide variety of effluents that existed. <b>Industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> constituted what Harvey Brooks, in his essay "Science Indicators and Science Priorities" calls a very "messy" research problem [...] one that does "not lend itself to elegant and widely applicable generalizations.

5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E

5|$|The detainees at Omarska had {{one meal}} a day. The food was usually spoiled {{and the process}} of getting the food, eating and {{returning}} the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were often accompanied by beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, the detainees were in very poor physical condition. He witnessed them eating a bowl of soup and some bread and said that he had the impression they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, the detainees drank water from a river that was polluted with <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were the detainees apprised of any concrete charges against them.

5|$|Used as a waste {{repository}} {{during the}} first half of the 20thcentury and cut off from the Columbia River by levees, the slough became one of Oregon's most polluted waterways. Early attempts to mitigate the pollution, which included raw sewage and <b>industrial</b> <b>waste,</b> were unsuccessful. However, in 1952 Portland began sewage treatment, and over the next six decades the federal Clean Water Act and similar legislation mandated further cleanup. State and local governments, often assisted by community volunteers, undertook projects related to public health, natural resources, and recreation in a region with many homes, industries, businesses, and roads. The businesses and industries in the watershed employ about 57,000people, which is also frequented by more than 150bird species and 26fish species and animals including otters, beaver, and coyotes. One of the nation's largest freshwater urban wetlands, Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, shares the lower slough watershed with a sewage treatment plant, marine terminals, a golf course, and a car racetrack. Watercraft able to portage over culverts and levees can travel the entire length of the slough. The 40 Mile Loop and other hiking and biking trails follow the waterways and connect the parks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Now-a-days {{disposal}} of different wastes produced from different Industries {{is a great}} problem. These materials pose environmental pollution in the nearby locality because {{many of them are}} non-biodegradable. In recent years, applications of <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> have been considered in road construction with great interest in many industrialised and developing countries. The use of these materials in road making is based on technical, economic, and ecological criteria. India has a large network of industries located {{in different parts of the}} country and many more are planned for the near future. Several million metric tons <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> are produced in these establishments. If these materials can be suitably utilised in highway construction, the pollution and disposal problems may be partly reduced. Keeping in mind the need for bulk use of these solid wastes in India, it was thought expedient to test these materials and to develop specifications to enhance the use of these <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> in road making, in which higher economic returns may be possible. The possible use of these materials should be developed for construction of low-volume roads in different parts of our country. A review of various <b>Industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> for use in the construction of highway has been discussed in this paper. The waste materials are fly ash, blast furnace slag, cement kiln dust phosphogypsum, waste plastic bags, foundry sand and colliery sand, which are the <b>industrial</b> <b>wastes</b> posing problems in the disposal and being deposited near the industries in India...|$|R
