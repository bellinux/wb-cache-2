40|$|Abstract—Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{architectures}} {{are gaining}} popularity and importance for applications ranging from massive-scale Internet content delivery to mobile social networks. Such P 2 P systems must provide <b>directory</b> <b>services</b> for locating peers with the desired content and <b>services.</b> These <b>directory</b> <b>services</b> are themselves decentralized, such as with distributed hash tables (DHTs), which allow for efficient locating of objects without any centralized directory. Being a distributed system over a diverse set of untrusted nodes, however, such <b>directory</b> <b>services</b> must be resilient to adversarial behavior. Otherwise, the entire P 2 P {{system can be}} crippled by manipulating or simply denying access to resources. We propose Repu-tation for <b>Directory</b> <b>Services</b> (ReDS), a framework for using reputation management to enhance the security of finding information in distributed systems. While previous reputation systems have addressed several specific applications of P 2 P networks (e. g., by iden-tifying peers who share bad files), <b>directory</b> <b>services</b> form the backbone of P 2 P systems and have unique properties with respect to reputation that make them worth investigating. In this extended abstract, we motivate our investigation of ReDS and describe preliminary results that show its effectiveness in the Salsa P 2 P system.

40|$|<b>Directory</b> <b>services</b> {{provide a}} {{mechanism}} to describe internal resources that can be dynamically discovered and used, and are increasingly being adopted by organizations. Despite being {{in an era of}} extensive interorganizational collaboration, relatively little attention has been given to extending <b>directory</b> <b>services</b> across organizational boundaries. In particular, resources described using <b>directory</b> <b>services</b> are either (a) constrained by description possibilities or (b) cannot be widely understood due to idiosyncratic description mechanisms. Thus, current <b>directory</b> <b>services</b> approaches are not well suited for the information requirements of groups of individuals spanning organizational boundaries: communities of interest (COIs). A COI is a virtual community that benefits from electronic communication, especially by the ability to provide structured descriptions of relevant resources. This paper describes a new approach to support COIs through <b>directory</b> <b>services</b> by enabling autonomous entities to provide structured, evolutionary descriptions of members and resources while retaining directory services' core strength: structured, semantically coherent descriptions of resources. The requirements architecture is derived, a walkthrough of the architectural elements is given, and a research prototype is briefly described...|$|R
