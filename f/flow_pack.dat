This massive frac will increase the history production rate by 4 – 5 times. The fracture half-length that could be achieved using the proposed design length ranging between, 600 and 800 ft. The fracture conductivity achieved by using the proposed model, ranging between 10, 000 and 20, 000 ft (md) depends on the proppant type used. Coarse proppant type is preferred (12 – 18); medium strength will give high conductivity. The amount of proppant required to achieve this design is ~ 360, 000 Lb. In most of the cases the frac height will propagate downward toward the carbonate layer. In order to avoid propagating the frac toward the carbonate layer, very small frac design should be used (~ 40, 000 Lb of proppant). This small frac size will not increase the productivity from well as required and the production rate is expected to drop rapidly after the fracture.

Acetone-water containing hydroxypropyl celloluse (HPC) and disintegrant was used as the crystallization system. In this study croscarmellose sodium (Ac-Di-Sol) was employed as disintegrant. The agglomerates were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD), and scanning electron microscopy and were evaluated for <b>flow,</b> <b>packing</b> and tableting properties and drug release. The growth of particle size and the spherical form of the agglomerates resulted in formation of products with good <b>flow</b> and <b>packing</b> properties. The improved compaction properties of the agglomerated crystals were due to their fragmentation occurred during compression. DSC and XRPD studies showed that naproxen particles, crystallized in the presence of HPC and Ac-Di-Sol did not undergo structural modifications. The dissolution rate of naproxen from tablets made of naproxen-(Ac-Di-Sol) agglomerates was enhanced significantly because of including the disintegrant in to the particles. This was attributed to an increase in the surface area of the practically water insoluble drug is exposed to the dissolution medium.
