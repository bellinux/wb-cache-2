30|$|Therefore, the two {{connections}} are relayed if {{and only if}} the above inequality holds. The paper [12] proposed an RTT-based random-walk algorithm RBRW for SSID. Yang and Zhang [12] presented a technical proof and showed that the algorithm RBRW can resist intruders’ evasion from detection, such as chaff-perturbation and time-jittering. Chaff-perturbation is a tool that allows intruders to insert some meaningless packets (chaff) which can make intruders escape from detecting methods. These chaffed packets are meaningless, and they must be excluded from the connection before they arrive at the victim host at the end. Time-jittering means that intruders can hold any packets for a random amount of time to evade detection. In practice, intruders do not perform time-jittering to the Echo packets. If the send packets are held by an intruder for certain amount of time and then release, it will not affect the number of RTTs because the corresponding echo packet also has the same delay. The timestamp difference between the <b>delayed</b> <b>Send</b> and Echo packets is thus not changed.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{kidney disease}} is a common situation, it is {{accompanied}} by a significantmorbidity/mortality and despite the development of substitution renal functions methods (SRFM) and transplantation, the prognosis is unfavorable. Aim: The aim of the present review is the assessment of the necessity for sending to theNephrology Team (NT) in the early stage of RF. Results: Lately, it has been documented that the timely sending to the NT, can significantlyimprove the survival of patient with kidney disease. On the contrary, the <b>delayed</b> <b>sending</b> has asa result not only the non timely measure uptake for the delay of the loss of renal function, butalso the later therapy for the uremic complications. According to Eadington (1996) the sending is considered as a delayed, when the provision ofhealthcare services could be improved with the timely contact with the Nephrology Services. Both in Europe and North America, the <b>delayed</b> <b>sending</b> comes up to the 30 - 40 % of people whoare inducted in dialysis. The benefit from the early sending to the NT, it is important and consists of the regimens forthe delay of the kidney disease development,, timely information for the patient about theSRFM, timely vascular preparation or other kind of accessibility, non-urgent dialysis initiation,patients’ training, lower financial cost, less hospitalization days, transplantation preparation andlower mortality. Conclusions: Optimal sending is the timely sending since it makes possible the diagnosis, thedelay of the development of KD and the prevention of the complications. Furthermore, givestime for the appropriate medical and psychological preparation of the patient and the initiation ofdialysis in the appropriate time. The measures which should be adopted include the improvement training and communication ofhealthcare workers and services interference, as well as the enactment of guidelines...|$|R
