5|$|The {{end of the}} Permian saw a major {{turnover}} in fauna during the Permian–Triassic extinction event: probably the most severe mass extinction event of the phanerozoic. There was a protracted loss of species, due to multiple extinction pulses. Many of the once large and <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> died out or were greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The mammals {{represent}} the only living Synapsida, which {{together with the}} Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that produced the non-mammalian Dimetrodon. At {{the end of the}} Carboniferous period, this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split-off several <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> of non-mammalian synapsids—sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles—before giving rise to the proto-mammals (Therapsida) in the early Mesozoic era. The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been among the dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million years ago to the present.|$|E

25|$|Cuba's {{population}} is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins. Intermarriage between <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> is widespread, and consequently {{there is some}} discrepancy in reports of the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami determined that 62% of Cubans are black, the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population, 65.05%, was white.|$|E

25|$|Many {{research}} {{studies have been}} conducted concerning the effect of schemata on individuals' perceptions of others. It has been found that preschoolers are aware of gender schemata and are capable of pointing out behaviours which are inconsistent with them. In a Canadian study, participants were asked to rate various <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> based on how well a given characteristic applied to them. The results confirmed that participants were quicker to assign a rating if the given characteristics fit the schema for that group.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the middle}} class belong to <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> which overlap with each other. Overall, middle-class persons, {{especially}} upper-middle-class individuals, are characterized by conceptualizing, creating and consulting. Thus, college education {{is one of the main}} indicators of middle-class status. Largely attributed to the nature of middle-class occupations, middle class values tend to emphasize independence, adherence to intrinsic standards, valuing innovation and respecting non-conformity. Politically more active than other demographics, college educated middle class professionals are split between the two major parties.|$|E

Metzger was also involved in strengthening ties between Israeli and Diaspora standards of kashrut in order to make them more standardized and consistent.|$|E

25|$|Insect visitation is {{the likely}} method of pollen {{transfer}} {{due to the}} spatial separation of the anthers and stigma, which would make self-pollination unlikely. Abe reported V. rotundifolia flowers on Nishino-shima Island were visited by flies, honey bees, beetles, butterflies, and ants {{though most of the}} visitors were ants. <b>Diverse</b> <b>groups</b> of pollinators visit the flowers in search of the 0.5 µl/flower nectar reward. Due to this wide range of visitors, it is unlikely the plant would require a specialist insect to mediate successful pollination.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{attempts}} {{being made in}} a few communities to teach the dialect in a classroom setting; however, as every year passes by, fewer and fewer in these particular communities speak the dialect. There is still a weekly radio program in the dialect whose audience is made up mostly of these <b>diverse</b> <b>groups,</b> and many Lutheran and Reformed congregations in Pennsylvania that formerly used German have a yearly service in Pennsylvania German. Other non-native speakers of the dialect include those persons that regularly do business with native speakers.|$|E

There is also a growing population of young professionals and increasing signs of gentrification. These <b>diverse</b> <b>groups</b> live together with little discord, and Brunswick is well known as a successful example of multiculturalism.|$|E
