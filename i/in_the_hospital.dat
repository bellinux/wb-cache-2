5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> and to eat the corpses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E

40|$|Conflicts and {{conflict}} management <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{that have a}} complex organizational structure {{has now become a}} subject of growing significance. This study has the aim of revealing the reasons causing organizational conflicts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals,</b> as well as establishing some suggestions of solution regarding organizational conflict management. <b>In</b> distinguishing <b>the</b> reasons of organizational conflicts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospıtals,</b> <b>the</b> study datum have been obtained by inquiring about hospital personnel’s opinions on the organizational conflict, through the questionnaire forms answered by 641 health personnel working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> under <b>the</b> Ministry of Health. <b>In</b> regard of <b>the</b> conflict reasons, lack of communication, lack of balance between the authorities and responsibilities, inadequate definition of <b>the</b> duties, deficiency <b>in</b> participating into decision-making, insufficient promotion possibilities, under-estimation of the works and efforts by the concerned authorities, dissatisfaction about <b>the</b> job, shortage <b>in</b> in-services training, failure in application of an effective team-work, etc. reasons are seen as the principal ones among the reasons of organizational conflicts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals...</b>|$|R

5|$|R v Baillie, {{also known}} as the Greenwich Hospital Case, was a 1778 {{prosecution}} of Thomas Baillie for criminal libel. The case initiated the legal career of Thomas Erskine. Baillie, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Greenwich Hospital for Seamen, a facility for injured or pensioned off seamen, had noted irregularities and corruption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> which was formally run by the Earl of Sandwich. After his official reporting of the problems failed to bring about reform <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> Baillie published a pamphlet that was critical of the hospital's officers, alleging that Sandwich had given appointments to pay off political debts; Sandwich ignored the pamphlet but ensured that Baillie was indicted for criminal libel. Baillie hired five barristers, including Erskine, then newly called to the Bar, and appeared before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench on 23 November 1778.|$|E

5|$|A {{hospital}} {{had originally been}} installed at Alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late 19th century. During its time as a federal penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital staff were U.S. Public Health Service employees assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs. Prisoners in ill health were often kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> most famously, Stroud and Al Capone, who spent years in it.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the results of Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) conducted in three referral hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria over a two-year period and to report the outcomes and the lessons learned. MPDRS panels were constituted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three <b>hospitals,</b> and beginning from January 2015, we conducted monthly MPDSR <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three <b>hospitals</b> using a nationally approved protocol. Data on births and deaths and causes of deaths as identified by the MPDSR panels were collated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals.</b> <b>The</b> results show that over a 21 -month period (January 1, 2015 -September 30, 2016), maternal mortality ratio (MMR) remained high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Although there was a trend towards an increase in MMR in Lagos Island Maternity Hospital and Gbagada General Hospital, and a trend towards a decline in Ajeromi Hospital, none of these trends were statistically significant. Eclampsia, primary post-partum haemorrhage, obstructed labour and puerperal sepsis were the leading obstetric causes of death. By contrast, delay <b>in</b> arrival <b>in</b> <b>hospital,</b> <b>the</b> lack of antenatal care and patients' refusal to receive recommended treatment were the patients' associated causes of death, while delay in treatment, poor use of treatment protocols, lack of equipment and lack of skills by providers to use available equipment were the identified facility-related causes of death. Failure to address the patients and facility-related causes of maternal mortality possibly accounted for the persistently high maternal mortality ratio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals.</b> We conclude that interventions aimed at redressing all causes of maternal deaths identified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reviews will likely reduce the maternal mortality ratios <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals...</b>|$|R
