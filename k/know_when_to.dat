5|$|The {{pressure}} from the ice caused Endurance to start to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the {{pressure from}} the ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he {{was put in charge}} of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said {{that it is important to}} <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi wanted it to have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; {{he said that it}} is important to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Gerd Heidemann {{was born}} in Hamburg in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents {{remained}} apolitical, but Heidemann, like many other young boys, joined the Hitler Youth. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur and Keystone news agencies, {{as well as some}} local Hamburg papers. He had his first work published in Stern in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked, such as the search for identity of the German writer B. Traven. Although he was an excellent researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> stop investigating, which led to other writers having to finish off the stories from large quantities of notes.|$|E

Focus can be designation of a goal by a higher-level commander, by a peer unit detecting a target, or by intelligence systems that feed information to the swarming units.

25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> remove a man like that from the firing -line.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E

500|$|Acknowledging the show's critics, Scott Miller {{wrote in}} 2001 that [...] "some people can't see past the {{appearance}} of chaos and randomness to the brilliant construction and sophisticated imagery underneath." [...] Miller notes, [...] "Not only did many of the lyrics not rhyme, {{but many of the}} songs didn't really have endings, just a slowing down and stopping, so the audience didn't <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> applaud.... The show rejected every convention of Broadway, of traditional theatre in general, and of the American musical in specific. [...] And it was brilliant." ...|$|E

Two of Phil's interceptions were rebounds {{that had nothing to}} do with the quarterback. On the interception on fourth and 14 at the end, he was trying to make a play.

Patrick Varine of The Observer-Dispatch referred it to as a [...] "hacky mid-'90s R" [...] song, and its slow tempo was compared to ballads by American singer Ciara. According to Mariel Concepcion of Billboard, the song sees Hilson tapping into her vulnerable side.|$|E
500|$|Davies is an {{admitted}} procrastinator {{and often}} waits hours or days for concepts to form before he commits {{them to the}} script. In The Writer's Tale, he describes his procrastination by discussing his early career: at the time, his method {{of dealing with the}} pressures of delivering a script was to [...] "go out drinking" [...] instead. On one occasion in the mid-1990s, he was at the Manchester gay club Cruz 101 when he thought of the climax to the first series of The Grand. As his career progressed, he instead spent entire nights [...] "just thinking of plot, character, pace, etc" [...] and waited until 2:00am, [...] "when the clubs used to shut", to overcome the urge of procrastination.

He said: [...] "I am quite convinced that Simpson killed himself because he just did not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>to</b> stop. All his racing life he had punished his frail body, pushing it to the limits of endurance with his tremendous will-power and single-mindedness and, on Mont Ventoux, he pushed it too far, perhaps the drug easing the pain of it all." [...] Saunders {{went on to say that}} Simpson was not alone in the taking of drugs in professional cycling and that the authorities ignored their use. His opinion was that Simpson did not take drugs to gain an unfair advantage, but because [...] "he was not going to be beaten by a pill".|$|E
