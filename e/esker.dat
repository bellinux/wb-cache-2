40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to map the {{distribution}} of till-covered <b>eskers</b> in the inland of Västerbotten County in northern Sweden. The top layers of big <b>eskers</b> along the valleys of Öre River, Ume River and Vindel River were investigated through shallow digging. Findings were investigated through field assessment and soil analysis and many locations with till-covered <b>eskers</b> have been identified in Västerbotten's inland in this survey. The till covering the <b>eskers</b> has probably been transported only short distances and has its origins in glacifluvial material. The pattern is not consistent and there are areas where till does not cover the <b>eskers.</b> This can be explained trough irregular till deposition or that the till has been washed away or alternatively that the upper layer that is interpreted as glacifluvial material actually is till that has only been transported for very short distances. The findings of till-covered <b>eskers</b> in Västerbotten means that the traditional view of the <b>eskers</b> originating from the last deglaciation (Weichsel 3) may need to be reviewed. Where overlaying till has been found on top of <b>eskers</b> it means that the <b>eskers</b> must have originated in an earlier glaciation than the last. Only one layer of till could be discerned on the <b>eskers</b> in the survey, so an explanation could be that the till formed during Weichsel 3 and that the <b>eskers</b> formed earlier by the deglaciation of Weichsel 2, but dating the layers in till-covered <b>eskers</b> is difficult. No transition zone between till-covered to not till-covered <b>eskers</b> was found in this study...|$|R
50|$|<b>Eskers</b> are {{critical}} to the ecology of Northern Canada. Several plants that grow on <b>eskers,</b> including bear root and cranberries, are important food for bears and migrating waterfowl; animals from grizzly bears to tundra wolves to ground squirrels can burrow into the <b>eskers</b> to survive the long winters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eskers</b> Provincial Park is {{a provincial}} park in British Columbia, Canada. The park {{comprises}} roughly 3979 ha and {{was created in}} 1987. Located west of Nukko Lake, which lies northwest {{of the city of}} Prince George, it protects an area of the 40 km Stuart River <b>Eskers</b> Complex. <b>Eskers</b> are winding ridges of gravel formed by the glaciers which once covered the British Columbia Interior.|$|R
25|$|Postglacial rebound {{changes the}} tilt of ground. In lakes, this means that shores sink in the {{direction}} {{farther away from the}} former maximum depth of ice. When the lake rests against an <b>esker,</b> water pressure increases with the increases depth. The <b>esker</b> may then fail under the load and burst, creating a new outflow. Lake Pielinen in Finland is an example of this.|$|E

2500|$|Long, sinuous glacial {{deposits}} {{are called}} <b>eskers.</b> [...] <b>Eskers</b> {{are composed of}} sand and gravel that was deposited by meltwater streams that flowed through ice tunnels within or beneath a glacier.

25|$|A {{park was}} {{constructed}} on the site, {{in the middle}} of which a “cone” was built. The contaminated soil from the edges of the former dump was placed in this cone. The cone {{has been described as a}} “layered cake”, which has various layers insulating the “delicacies” of the core of the cone. The cone can be seen clearly on maps as a circle between the Roihupelto metro depot and the Ring I highway. It is 20 metres high, but it appears even higher due to the natural slopes of the <b>esker</b> below.|$|E
25|$|After {{the retreat}} {{of the ice}} sheet that covered the region after the last ice age, the river found itself rerouted by an <b>esker</b> onto a plain uniquely ribbed by the ridges of other eskers, where it formed a {{succession}} of rapids and wide bays (called fjärdar), which the river inundates during the spring floods. This particular hydrography, along with the park's proximity to the ecological frontier {{between the north and}} the south, has favored the development of a fauna and flora of great biodiversity. The park possesses coniferous, mixed, and broadleaf forests, some of which quite ancient, spared by the logging industry because of their inaccessibility. These forests constitute the ideal environment for numerous species, in particular birds, with critical densities of woodpeckers and owls.|$|E
40|$|Although glacial landsystems {{produced}} under warm/wet based {{conditions are}} very common on Earth, even here, observations of subglacial landforms such as <b>eskers</b> emerging from extant glaciers are rare. This paper describes {{a system of}} sinuous ridges emerging from the in situ but now degraded piedmont terminus of a Late Amazonian-aged (∼ 150 Ma) glacier-like form in the southern Phlegra Montes region of Mars. We believe {{this to be the}} first identification of martian <b>eskers</b> that can be directly linked to their parent glacier. Together with their contextual landform assemblage, the <b>eskers</b> are indicative of significant glacial meltwater production and subglacial routing. However, although the <b>eskers</b> are evidence of a wet-based regime, the confinement of the glacial system to a well-defined, regionally significant graben, and the absence of <b>eskers</b> elsewhere in the region, is interpreted as evidence of sub-glacial melting as a response to locally enhanced geothermal heat flux rather than climate-induced warming. These observations offer important new insights to the forcing of glacial dynamic and melting behaviour on Mars by factors other than climate...|$|R
50|$|Kame deltas form in {{association}} with other glacial features such as, kettles and <b>eskers.</b> Kettle lakes can form in between kame deltas. <b>Eskers</b> are remnants of old stream sediment flows, that are exposed after the glacier has melted.

25|$|During {{the last}} ice age, Sweden was covered with an ice sheet, which withdrew from the region about 10000 years ago. The glacier {{left behind in the}} region many eskers and moraines, such as the <b>esker</b> Enköpingsåsen. When the glacier withdrew, the soil had been so {{compressed}} by its mass that the entire zone situated to the east of Avesta found itself at sea level. During this maritime period, sediments deposited themselves on the bedrock, which explains why that region even today has superior fertility to that {{of the rest of the}} country. It is the reason why the line of separation between the north and the south (the Limes Norrlandicus), which passes not far from the park, is so visible in the region: the zone to the north of the limes was not covered with these sediments.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of {{horizontal and vertical}} motion changes the tilt of the surface. That is, locations farther north rise faster, an effect that becomes apparent in lakes. The bottoms of the lakes gradually tilt away {{from the direction of}} the former ice maximum, such that lake shores on the side of the maximum (typically north) recede and the opposite (southern) shores sink. This causes the formation of new rapids and rivers. For example, Lake Pielinen, which is large (90 x 30km) and oriented perpendicularly to the former ice margin, originally drained through an outlet in the middle of the lake near Nunnanlahti to Lake Höytiäinen. The change of tilt caused Pielinen to burst through the Uimaharju <b>esker</b> at the southwestern end of the lake, creating a new river (Pielisjoki) that runs to the sea via Lake Pyhäselkä to Lake Saimaa. The effects are similar to that concerning seashores, but occur above sea level. Tilting of land will also affect the flow of water in lakes and rivers in the future, and thus important for water resource management planning.|$|E
25|$|Clara (Clóirtheach or An Clárach in Irish) {{is a town}} on the River Brosna in County Offaly and is the 10th largest town in the {{midlands}} of Ireland. The {{town has}} a population of 3,242 (2011 census), however a number of well populated housing estates lie outside the town boundary making the actual population higher. Clara has plenty of local services including churches, banks, credit union, schools, supermarkets, shops, garages, pubs, nightclubs and restaurants. It has its own Garda(police) and fire station while the Midlands regional hospital is located just eleven kilometres away in Tullamore. Clara has a strong association with sport. The GAA club looks after Gaelic football and hurling from under 8 to senior level. Clara also has a successful soccer club. The town has two swimming pools and a successful pitch and putt club. Clara's power lifting club has won a number of national and international awards. A golf driving range is located in the town also with the <b>Esker</b> Hills golf club located just outside the town.

40|$|AbstractThe Dorsa Argentea are an {{extensive}} assemblage of ridges {{in the southern}} high latitudes of Mars. They have previously been interpreted as <b>eskers</b> formed by deposition of sediment in subglacial meltwater conduits, implying a formerly more extensive south polar ice sheet. In this study, we undertake the first large-scale statistical analysis of aspects of the geometry and morphology of the Dorsa Argentea in comparison with terrestrial <b>eskers</b> in order to evaluate this hypothesis. The ridges are re-mapped using integrated topographic (MOLA) and image (CTX/HRSC) data, and their planar geometries compared to recent characterisations of terrestrial <b>eskers.</b> Quantitative tests for esker-like relationships between ridge height, crest morphology and topography are then completed for four major Dorsa Argentea ridges. The following key conclusions are reached: (1) Statistical distributions of lengths and sinuosities of the Dorsa Argentea {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial <b>eskers</b> in Canada. (2) Planar geometries across the Dorsa Argentea support formation of ridges in conduits extending towards the interior of an ice sheet that thinned towards its northern margin, perhaps terminating in a proglacial lake. (3) Variations in ridge crest morphology are consistent with observations of terrestrial <b>eskers.</b> (4) Statistical tests of previously observed relationships between ridge height and longitudinal bed slope, similar to those explained by the physics of meltwater flow through subglacial meltwater conduits for terrestrial <b>eskers,</b> confirm the strength of these relationships for three of four major Dorsa Argentea ridges. (5) The new quantitative characterisations of the Dorsa Argentea may provide useful constraints for parameters in modelling studies of a putative former ice sheet in the south polar regions of Mars, its hydrology, and mechanisms that drove its eventual retreat...|$|R
