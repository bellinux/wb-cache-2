5|$|GJ 3634 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.95. Thus, despite its proximity at 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years) {{away from the}} Earth, it cannot be seen with the unaided <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> star is of a similar distance from Earth as planet-bearing 51 Pegasi, which lies {{at a distance of}} 14.7 parsecs (47.95 light years).|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth.

5|$|The eyes {{can focus}} independently, and are {{specialized}} with a duplex retina that contains {{two types of}} visual cells for both day and night vision, and a tapetum lucidum which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark.

5|$|Though Vamei {{was officially}} {{designated}} as a tropical storm, its intensity is disputed; some agencies classify it as a typhoon, based on sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) {{and the appearance of}} an <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> storm brought flooding and landslides to eastern Peninsular Malaysia, causing $3.6million in damage (2001USD, $ USD) and five deaths.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} {{different aspects}} of the <b>Eye.</b> <b>The</b> juxtaposed deities often stand for the procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E

5|$|In {{his next}} title defense, Hughes fought Gil Castillo at , {{defeating}} the former Middleweight contender via TKO. Hughes started the match {{with a big}} slam {{and then began to}} attack from Castillo's guard with elbows and punches. Hughes easily avoided any submission attempts and looked far stronger than Castillo. As he passed to half guard, Castillo was bleeding above his left <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> challenger's only offense was a weak triangle choke that went nowhere. The round ended with Hughes on top, ground-and-pounding his opponent. Between rounds doctors ruled that the resulting cut was too severe to continue, and Hughes was declared the winner due to stoppage.|$|E
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Alpha Andromedae, is {{a binary}} star that {{has also been}} counted {{as a part of}} Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colorful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its color visible to the naked <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the <b>eye,</b> <b>the</b> vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds were}} first {{detected}} from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972.

The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, even when they were not visible to the naked <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E

The fight was declared a no-contest and Santos retained the welterweight championship by default.

5|$|The Coma Star Cluster {{represents}} Berenice's sacrificed tresses {{and as a}} {{naked eye}} object has been known since antiquity, appearing in Ptolemy's Almagest. It doesn't have a Messier or NGC designation, but is in the Melotte catalogue of open clusters (designated Melotte 111) and is also catalogued as Collinder 256. It is a large, diffuse open cluster of about 50 stars ranging between magnitudes five and ten, including several of Coma Berenices' stars which are {{visible to the naked}} <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> cluster is spread over a huge region (more than five degrees across) near Gamma Comae Berenices. It has such a large apparent size because it is relatively close, only 288 light-years away.|$|E
