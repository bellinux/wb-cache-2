5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters, Hayes wished to award them by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take. Immediately, Hayes's call for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party. Senators of both parties were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments and turned against Hayes. Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who fought Hayes's reform efforts at <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day in Springfield, Lisa's {{class at}} the Springfield Elementary School {{construction}} paper mailboxes for the Valentine cards {{they are about to}} receive. When Ralph does not get any cards and breaks down in tears, Lisa hastily gives him a card out of sympathy. Ralph immediately cheers up, and develops a romantic interest in her. Ralph begins to annoy Lisa at <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b> Lisa tries to escape the situation by telling Ralph she is not ready to be romantic, but Ralph uses his position as Chief Wiggum's son to get her tickets to Krusty the Clown's upcoming 29th Anniversary Special, as well as a leading part for himself in a President's Day pageant in which Lisa also stars. Ralph receives the role of George Washington opposite Lisa as Martha Washington.|$|E

50|$|Towns and sanctums also {{periodically}} produce novices <b>every</b> so many <b>turns</b> (<b>every</b> other <b>turn</b> for towns, and <b>every</b> fourth <b>turn</b> for sanctums). These {{are trained}} as Swordsmen or Archers {{to fight for}} their player, to attack monsters summoned by the enemy, to capture towns, or ultimately to capture the enemy Sanctum. These units can stack in groups of up to eight, and individuals or entire groups can be affected by various spells.|$|R
5|$|The hostility {{between rival}} Spanish factions in Trujillo continued, and Vasco de Herrera {{was unable to}} unite the colonists behind him. He decided the best option would be to found a new town, and {{possibly}} abandon Trujillo. Cerezeda opposed him at <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> believing this {{would lead to the}} ruin of the Spanish enterprise in Honduras. Natives working the mines near Trujillo rebelled against their excessive tax burden, killing several Spaniards. Vasco de Herrera seized this opportunity as an excuse to launch a punitive expedition, but instead marched inland in an attempt to found another colony. The Nahuas of Papayeca rebelled against the excessive cruelty of Andrés de Cereceda under their leader Picecura, and fled to the wilds. In 1531, Vasco de Herrera attempted to bring them back to their settlements.|$|E
5|$|Despite this success, Berger {{still had}} to {{negotiate}} with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the Waffen-SS at almost <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b> In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by Generaloberst Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) {{on a number of issues}} around Waffen-SS recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the Waffen-SS would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it did not want to see any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, arms and hands, and he was in critical condition. He was immediately taken to a field hospital, before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On the drive back he lost consciousness at almost <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.|$|E
60|$|So {{they went}} on their way. Now they looked at <b>every</b> <b>turning</b> when they should have met with the villains; but whether they heard of Mr. Great-heart, or whether they had some other game, they came {{not up to the}} pilgrims.|$|R
6000|$|As {{they made}} their way back to the house, John {{examined}} the marks at <b>every</b> <b>turning,</b> and added to those that were not sufficiently conspicuous to catch the eye at once. When they had gained the cellar, and replaced the boards, the woman said: ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they left}} the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was {{in search of the}} Parsonage, and <b>every</b> <b>turning</b> {{expected}} to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.|$|R
5|$|The game is turn-based. Each turn {{represents}} one week, and travelling between cities takes {{a number of}} turns depending on {{the proximity of the}} destination city. Many cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Some specialty cacao beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards {{take the form of a}} high price for the chocolates or a new recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in Days of Ruin {{is for the}} player to use their military force to defeat the enemy's force. Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, {{there are two ways}} to defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. <b>Every</b> <b>turn,</b> units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across the different types of terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as submerging a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those in the visual range of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrain of}} the province, while picturesque at almost <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> has limited the {{potential}} for expansion of agriculture in an already very small province.|$|E
5000|$|Eugene J. Fisher, Distinguished Professor of Catholic-Jewish Studies at St. Leo University, and Executive Secretary for Catholic-Jewish Relations at the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He [...] "holds the {{distinction}} of playing {{a central role in}} <b>every</b> <b>turning</b> point in Catholic-Jewish relations for the last three decades." ...|$|R
50|$|In the sequel, companions are introduced, which act {{similar to}} treasures {{but have a}} certain effect {{activated}} <b>every</b> four <b>turns.</b> For example, Mother Goose gives a health potion <b>every</b> four <b>turns</b> (unless the player has the cap of ten health potions, where Mother Goose will wait until the player uses one potion), and Skeletrox upgrades tiles to form better gems.|$|R
60|$|GREAT-HEART. Then said Mr. Great-heart, They be {{the three}} that set upon Little-faith heretofore. Well, said he, {{we are ready}} for them; so they went on their way. Now, they looked at <b>every</b> <b>turning,</b> when they should have met with the villains; but whether they heard of Mr. Great-heart, or whether they had some other game, they came {{not up to the}} Pilgrims.|$|R
25|$|Remington Rand, however, {{continued}} {{a policy}} of harassment and obstruction toward the union. It often violated the contract in small ways (forcing the union to file time-consuming and costly grievances), harassed union leaders, and generally contested the union at <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{practical}} exam covers {{everything that}} should have been learned: looking in the inside mirror, then the wing mirror and then over one's shoulder at <b>every</b> <b>turn</b> (twice per turn), driving onto and on the motorway, knowing what is under the bonnet, what all the lights on the dashboard mean, etc.|$|E
25|$|Hagatha von Taterbugs, a gleefully disgusting HIV {{positive}} drag queen with borderline {{personality disorder}} who hangs {{out in public}} restrooms and drinks urine/fecal matter. Her trashy exploits and long history of atrocities have shocked and astounded even Madge and Cheryl. Cheryl despises Hagatha and undercuts her at <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'Stop thief! Stop thief!' The cry {{is taken}} up by a hundred voices, and the crowd {{accumulate}} at <b>every</b> <b>turning.</b> Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, 'Stop thief! Stop thief!' ...|$|R
25|$|Many other {{denominations}} {{volunteered to}} help. In 1871, John H. Stout, {{sponsored by the}} Dutch Reformed Church, {{was sent to the}} Pima reservation in Arizona to implement the policy. However Congress, the church, and private charities spent less money than was needed; the local whites strongly disliked the Indians; the Pima balked at removal; and Stout was frustrated at <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, {{it is more important to}} place pieces in versatile locations rather than to try to form mills immediately and make the mistake of concentrating one's pieces in one area of the board. An ideal position, which typically results in a win, allows a player to shuttle one piece back and forth between two mills, removing a piece <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the group}} keeps {{trying to escape}} out of the realm, they end up {{ultimately}} running into dead ends at <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b> Suddenly, thanks to Henry inspiring the New Yorkers to toss coins into the Bethesda fountain, a portal opens, and Hook, Snow, David, Zelena, and Jekyll escape and find themselves in New York City, {{right in front of}} the fountain, where they renuite with Emma, Regina, Henry, and Violet.|$|E
5000|$|In some turn-based games, not all turns are alike. The {{board game}} Imperium Romanum II (1985), for instance, {{features}} a [...] "Taxation and Mobilization" [...] phase in <b>every</b> third <b>turn</b> (month), {{which does not}} occur in the other turns. In the board game Napoleon (1974), <b>every</b> third player <b>turn</b> is [...] "night turn" [...] where combat is not allowed.|$|R

40|$|Machining {{planning}} {{is an important}} task which directly affects {{the cost of a}} product. Computer aided methods are increasingly being developed and used to assist in the planning task. We describe a new concept, the Maximum Turnable State of a part. The concept is intuitive and relates to an intermediate state of <b>every</b> <b>turned</b> part. By using this idea in machining planning, efficiency can be increased. We describe the concept, study the mathematical, geometrical and computational aspects of the problem and give examples...|$|R
25|$|TriGo uses a triangular-grid goban, {{where each}} stone has {{up to six}} liberties. To {{compensate}} for this, there are several rule changes: ko and superko are limited in scope, komi is not used, and after the first stone is placed, <b>every</b> <b>turn</b> consists of placing two stones. After both players have passed a turn, the score is counted (the sum of captured stones and territory), {{and in the case}} of a draw the player passing first wins.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese vanguard {{ascended the}} Balana pass, {{capturing}} stockades at <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b> Despite being {{separated from the}} main body of the army, they continued to advance and soon entered an area of relatively flat land called the Danture tract. By nightfall they had reached Gannoruwa, where they spent the night on the western bank of the Mahaveli River—still separated from the main army, which lagged behind in order to bury the dead and because of its slow baggage train.|$|E
25|$|I can’t {{tell you}} how pleased I was to see this place again. In a moment one goes over the years; every shrub, <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> every peep of the house has a little history in it. The weather is {{delightful}} and the place looks beautiful. The trees are all so grown and there a thousand pretty sheltered spots, which near the sea in this season is very pleasant. The birds sing, the flowers blow, and make me for moments forget the world and all the villainy and tyranny going on in it.|$|E
