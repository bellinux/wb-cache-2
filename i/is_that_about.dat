5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E
25|$|One other {{explanation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 40,000 of Hidalgo's volunteer troops abandoned the effort {{after the battle}} with efforts to recruit more from the local area failing and there was disagreement among the ranks and leadership {{as to what to}} do next.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 12 million Africans {{arrived in}} the Americas from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Of these, an estimated 645,000 were brought {{to what is now}} the United States. The usual estimate <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 15% of slaves died during the voyage, with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself in the process of capturing and transporting indigenous peoples to the ships.|$|E

25|$|Another concern <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> {{one third}} of the world's soil-bound carbon is in taiga and tundra areas. When the {{permafrost}} melts, it releases carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, both of which are greenhouse gases. The effect has been observed in Alaska. In the 1970s the tundra was a carbon sink, but today, it is a carbon source. Methane is produced when vegetation decays in lakes and wetlands.|$|E
25|$|In 1891 the Corporation of the City of London made a {{statistical}} survey which it published ancillary to the National Census taken in that year. 37,694 persons {{lived in the}} City, but the daytime occupation was 310,384. In fact on 4 May 1891 1,186,094 entries to the City were made, i.e., many people entered more than once. Separate statistical information <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 50,000 persons arrived at Waterloo daily, of whom about 12,000 proceeded to the City by some means.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{independent}} account on primal therapy studied 32 {{patients who}} entered therapy at The Primal Institute in 1975 and 1976. The study concluded, [...] "The main result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 40% of the primal patients achieve a satisfactory result within 15 to 25 months." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{result of}} breast cancer's high {{visibility}} is that statistical results {{can sometimes be}} misinterpreted, such as the claim that one in eight women will be {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} during their lives—a claim that depends on the unrealistic assumption that no woman will die of any other disease before the age of 95. [...] This obscures the reality, which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> ten times as many women will die from heart disease or stroke than from breast cancer.|$|E
2500|$|There is no ethnic {{registration}} in Sweden, so the Jewish population {{can only}} be roughly estimated. The Official Council of Swedish Jewish Communities estimation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 20,000 pass the halakhic criteria. Of those about 7,000 {{are members of a}} congregation. Stockholm has the largest community and boasts a primary school, kindergarten, [...] library, a bi-monthly publication (Judisk Krönika) and a weekly Jewish radio program, but Gothenburg, Malmö, Uppsala, Borås, Helsingborg, and Lund all have Jewish communities as well. Synagogues can be found in Stockholm (which has 2 Orthodox and 1 Conservative synagogue), Göteborg (an Orthodox and a Conservative synagogue), Malmö (an Orthodox synagogue) and in Norrköping (although the Norrköping community is too small to perform regular services).|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} of scholars <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 15–20% {{of the white}} population remained loyal to the British Crown. Those who actively supported the king were known {{at the time as}} [...] "Loyalists", [...] "Tories", or [...] "King's men". The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it. Loyalists were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties, often connected to the Church of England, and included many established merchants with strong business connections across the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston. There were 500 to 1000 black loyalists who were held as slaves by patriots, escaped to British lines and joined the British army. Most died of disease but Britain took the survivors to Canada as free men.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first known}} pornographic film {{of any kind}} {{appears to have been}} made in 1908. [...] Between 1908 and the advent of public {{theatrical}} screenings in the United States in 1970, about 2,000 hardcore pornographic films were made (with roughly 500 of these made prior to 1960). The best estimate <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 10 percent of all hardcore [...] "stag films" [...] made prior to 1970 contain some sort of homosexual activity. This ranges from an innocuous hand on a shoulder, thigh or hip to hardcore anal and oral sex (and much more). Nevertheless, nearly all the extant works depict homosexual sex {{in the context of a}} heterosexual hegemony. Most depict homosexual sex occurring during heterosexual intercourse (essentially making the sex act bisexual in nature).|$|E
2500|$|... 1979 saw the crossed-flag emblems on {{the nose}} and fuel door revert to those seen on the '77 model. Three popular {{features}} introduced on the '78 pace car replicas made it into this year’s production: the new bucket seats, {{the front and rear}} spoiler package, and the glass roof panels. The new lightweight “high back” seats were made standard equipment. The new seats had better side bolster, provided easier access to the rear storage area, and the seat pair resulted in a weight reduction of about 24pounds. The bolt-on front and rear spoilers were offered as an option and nearly 7,000 cars were ordered so equipped. Functionally, the spoilers decreased drag by about 15% and increased fuel economy by about a half-mile per gallon. A bigger hit were the glass mirror-tint roof panels, now a regular option, with nearly 15,000 cars so fitted despite their costing $365. All T-tops were now wired into the standard anti-theft alarm system. Tungsten-halogen high-beam headlights became standard as did an AM-FM radio, {{and for the first time}} a cassette tape player could be added as a $234 option. Heavy duty shock absorbers could now be ordered without the full Gymkhana suspension. An auxiliary electric engine cooling fan was first installed, but only on L-82 equipped cars with air conditioning. Rocker panels and rear window trim were painted black. Output for all engines increased due to new [...] "open flow" [...] mufflers. The dual-snorkel air intake introduced on L-82 cars the previous year was now fitted to all cars and the base engine now generated [...] The optional L-82 engine increased to [...] This was the final year a manual gearbox could be ordered with the L-82 engine. This was also the last year for the M21 close-ratio 4-speed, a gearbox that, as in previous years, required the optional L-82 engine. A wide-ratio 4-speed was available for all cars. Noteworthy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>about</b> 82% of the cars were ordered with manual transmissions in 1968. In '79, less than 20% of the cars were delivered with manual gearboxes. This year reached an all-time high in Corvette popularity. Production hit its peak in 1979 at 53,807, a record that stands to this day.|$|E
