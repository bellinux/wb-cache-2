5|$|The main trade route {{leading into}} Han China passed first through Kashgar, yet Hellenized Bactria further west {{was the central}} node of {{international}} trade. By the 1st century AD, Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire. Silk was the main <b>export</b> <b>item</b> from China to India. Indian merchants brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, crystal sugar, pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares. Indian merchants brought Roman styrax and frankincense to China, while the Chinese knew bdellium as a fragrant item from Persia, although it was native to West India. The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China. The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes (i.e. vitis vinifera) were used to make grape wine, although the Chinese had rice wine before this. Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia {{have been found in}} Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC, with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou. Silverwares from Roman- and Arsacid territories have also been found at Han tomb sites.|$|E

50|$|Bangladesh and Slovakia {{have sought}} to expand trade. In 2010, the two {{countries}} drafted an agreement to strengthen the bilateral trade and investment. Bangladeshi export to Slovakia stood at more than 100 million Euros in 2011 which has been termed significant considering the small population of Slovakia. Most of the Bangladeshi <b>export</b> <b>items</b> are related to apparel products. Bangladeshi jute, leather and leather products, ceramics and pharmaceuticals {{have been identified as}} promising <b>export</b> <b>items</b> to Slovakian market. Slovakia's <b>export</b> <b>items</b> to Bangladesh were dominated by chemical products. Bangladesh and Slovakia have also been discussing the possibility of forming a Joint Business Council to further explore business opportunities.|$|R
25|$|Coffee was {{introduced}} in Brazil early in the eighteenth century, but initially it was planted only for domestic use. It took the high world prices of the late 1820s and early 1830s to turn coffee into a major <b>export</b> <b>item.</b> During the initial phase, production was concentrated in the mountainous region near Rio de Janeiro. This area was highly suitable for coffee cultivation, and it had access to fairly abundant slave labor. Moreover, the coffee could be transported easily on mule trains or on animal-drawn carts over short distances to the ports.|$|E
25|$|In late 1985 North Korea's first {{integrated}} circuit plant became operational. By the early 1990s, North Korea was producing about 20,000 computers a year, reportedly 60% were exported {{and the remainder}} were mostly for domestic military use. The development of a software industry started in the early 1990s. In general, software development is on a high level and {{it could become a}} major <b>export</b> <b>item</b> in the future, along with world-class voice recognition, automation and medical technology. North Korea has developed its own operating system, the Red Star, and has an intranet network named Kwangmyong, which contains censored content from the Internet. North Korean IT specialists demonstrate a high degree of technological literacy.|$|E
25|$|Another major, though erratic, <b>export</b> <b>item</b> was indigo dye, {{which was}} {{extracted}} from natural indigo, and {{which came to}} be grown in Bengal and northern Bihar. In late 17th and early 18th century Europe, blue clothing was favoured as a fashion, and blue uniforms were common in the military; consequently, the demand for the dye was high. In 1788, the East India Company offered advances to ten British planters to grow indigo; however, since the new (landed) property rights defined in the Permanent Settlement, didn't allow them, as Europeans, to buy agricultural land, they had to in turn offer cash advances to local peasants, and sometimes coerce them, to grow the crop. The European demand for the dye, however, proved to be unstable, and both creditors and cultivators bore {{the risk of the}} market crashes in 1827 and 1847. The peasant discontent in Bengal eventually led to the Indigo rebellion in 1859-60 and to the end of indigo production there. In Bihar, however, indigo production continued well into the 20th century; the centre of indigo production there, Champaran district, became the staging ground, in 1917, for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's first experiment in non-violent resistance against the British Raj.|$|E

25|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the major}} food and cash crop after banana, in the {{highland}} region. Next in order of priority are maize, beans and wheat. In order to increase the growth of these crops in the highland region, inter cropping of bean, potato, pea and wheat was tested on an experimental basis with Seasbani sesban (Sesbania); lime and manure were added as supplements for the growth. Species of shrubs such as Sasbania, Leucaena, Calliandra and Markamia showed better growth than in the Central Plateau Region where similar studies were conducted. Studies have been conducted since 1987 by the National Agricultural Research Institute (ISAR) who maintains a substation in Rwerere, Western Province within the highlands. In order to increase agricultural production with use new commercial crops have been adopted in the project area. The crops adopted are maracuja (passion fruit), an <b>export</b> <b>item,</b> and potatoes. In addition, modern livestock breeding techniques have also been adopted. This project under the aegeis of IFAD, has been found successful in increasing the incomes and purchasing power of the farmers and pastorals. A local NGO supports women {{who live in the}} highlands to collect clay and sell it for use in the construction of bricks and roof tiles.|$|E

2500|$|During the 19th century, {{the wine}} {{production}} remained a profitable business while the island's annual wheat production was only enough {{for three months}} of the islanders' consumption.

50|$|Bangladesh and Italy {{have formed}} 'Italy-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IBCCI)' {{to boost the}} {{bilateral}} economic relations. Between 2000 and 2006, the bilateral trade {{between the two countries}} increased by more than 200%. As of 2012, the total amount of the bilateral trade stood at $1.286 billion, of which Bangladesh's export to Italy accounts for $1.036 billion. Bangladesh's main <b>export</b> <b>items</b> to Italy include frozen food, agri-products, tea, leather, raw jute, jute goods, knitwear, woven garments etc. Italy's chief <b>export</b> <b>items</b> to Bangladesh include machineries, electronic products, vehicles, aircraft, vessels and associated transport equipments.|$|R

2500|$|Important changes {{occurred}} in several specific trade categories in the 1970s and 1980s. Imports of textile fibers rose from 5.8 percent in 1975 to 10.7 percent in 1980 as the Chinese textile industry grew faster than domestic cotton supplies but then fell to 4 percent in 1985 as domestic cotton production increased. Imports of unfinished textile products also increased from 1.3 percent in 1975 to 5.3 percent in 1985 {{as a result}} of textile industry growth. Iron and steel accounted for approximately 20 percent of imports in the 1970s, fell to 11.6 percent in 1980, then rose to 14.9 percent in 1985. Imports of manufactured goods, machinery, and transportation equipment represented 62.6 percent of total import value in 1975, fell to 53.9 percent in 1980 as imports were cut back during the [...] "period of readjustment" [...] of the economy (1979–81), and rose again to 75.2 percent in 1985. On the export side, the share of foodstuffs fell to 12.5 percent in 1985. The fastest growing <b>export</b> <b>item</b> in the 1970s was petroleum, which was first exported in 1973. Petroleum rocketed to 12.1 percent of all exports in 1975, 22 percent in 1980, and 21.2 percent in 1985. In the 1980s textile exports grew rapidly. Although exports of unfinished textiles remained about 14 percent of total exports, all categories of textile exports rose from 5 percent in 1975 to 18.7 percent in 1984. In 1986 textiles replaced petroleum as China's largest single <b>export</b> <b>item.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Aside from Carthage, {{urbanization}} in North Africa came in {{part with}} the establishment of settlements of veterans under the Roman emperors Claudius (reigned 41-54), Nerva (96-98), and Trajan (98-117). In Algeria such settlements included Tipasa, Cuicul or Curculum (modern Djemila, northeast of Sétif), Thamugadi (modern Timgad, southeast of Sétif), and Sitifis (modern Sétif). The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture. Called the [...] "granary of the empire", North Africa became one of the largest exporters of grain in the empire, shipping to the provinces which did not produce cereals, like Italy and Greece. Other crops included fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. By the 2nd century AD, olive oil rivaled cereals as an <b>export</b> <b>item.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{limitations}} to pulque's popularity has been the inability to store it for long periods or ship it far. Recently, pulque makers {{have found a way}} to preserve the beverage in cans. However, they admit this does change the flavor. The hope is that with this innovation, pulque can regain its lost market in Mexico and even achieve success as an <b>export</b> <b>item,</b> like tequila. It is already being offered in the United States by Boulder Imports, selling the brand [...] "Nectar del Razo". The original market was Mexican-American men, but the company reports the product is having success as a health food, sought out by athletes and body builders.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we {{extend the}} labor demand model by {{considering}} additional dimensions of export activities. Countries and industries with comparable export-output ratios may {{differ in the}} range of <b>export</b> <b>items,</b> i.e., the extensive margin. Hausmann et al. (2007) argue that the discovery of new <b>export</b> <b>items</b> is bound to be sub-optimal because of sunk costs that are private and the public-good nature of successful new export products. The authors also show diversification as an important predictor of both the level and future growth rate of per capita income. In a related literature, Bernard et al. (2010) and Goldberg et al. (2010) find that multiproduct firms are significantly larger, more productive, and more export oriented than single product firms. Whether diversification affects employment opportunities, holding export-ratio constant, is thus worth exploring.|$|R
