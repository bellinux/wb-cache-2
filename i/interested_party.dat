5|$|In 1992, having {{arranged}} for a private investigation of Hendrix's death, Etchingham supplied {{the results of the}} effort to UK authorities and requested they reopen the coroner's inquest. After a several-month inquiry by Scotland Yard, during which every <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> to the events was interviewed, officials were confident the request would be granted. The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell decided that proceeding with the investigation would not serve the public, {{due in part to the}} excessive time that had passed since Hendrix's death.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{has argued}} that critics like Daniel Dennett, who (he claims) insist that {{discussing}} subjectivity is unscientific because science presupposes objectivity, are making a category error. Perhaps the goal of science is to establish and validate statements which are epistemically objective, (i.e., whose truth can be discovered and evaluated by any <b>interested</b> <b>party),</b> but are not necessarily ontologically objective.|$|E
25|$|Further {{measures}} were introduced by race organisers and the UCI, including more frequent testing and tests for blood doping (transfusions and EPO use). This {{would lead the}} UCI to becoming a particularly <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> in an International Olympic Committee initiative, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), created in 1999. In 2002, the wife of Raimondas Rumšas, third in the 2002 Tour de France, was arrested after EPO and anabolic steroids were found in her car. Rumšas, who had not failed a test, was not penalised. In 2004, Philippe Gaumont said doping was endemic to his Cofidis team. Fellow Cofidis rider David Millar confessed to EPO after his home was raided. In the same year, Jesus Manzano, a rider with the Kelme team, alleged he had been forced by his team to use banned substances.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{the rule}} {{applies only to}} conduct leading {{directly}} to a final act or decision, and not to making a preliminary decision or investigation designed to obtain information {{for the purposes of}} a report or a recommendation on which a subsequent decision may be founded. However, there are also many situations where the rule will be presumed not to apply. For example, the rule does not apply where compliance with it is inconsistent with the need for taking urgent preventive or remedial action, the interests of national security, or the deportation of undesirable aliens; where disclosure of confidential information to an <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> is prejudicial to the public interest; where it is impracticable to give prior notice or an opportunity to be heard; where a hearing would serve no useful purpose; or in some cases where Parliament shows its intention to exclude its application by conferring on an authority wide discretionary power.|$|E
25|$|Because of the party's pacifist-based {{opposition}} to the Gulf War, there was mass-media antipathy and negative publicity which some construed as poor media performance by Janet Powell, the party's standing having stalled at about 10%. Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party's first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell's alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support. When this charge was deemed insufficient, <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> officers and senators reinforced it with negative media 'leaks' concerning her openly established relationship with Sid Spindler and exposure of administrative failings resulting in excessive overtime to a staff member. With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy John Coulter. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip Paul McLean who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by Karin Sowada. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired. In later years, she campaigned for the Australian Greens.|$|E
25|$|An {{example is}} a {{contemporary}} responsum by the well-known Israeli posek, Ovadia Yosef to Rabbi Grubner of Detroit, Michigan, establishing an impossibility to prove mamzer status {{in a situation where}} the evidence might appear to be clear-cut. The case involved the daughter of an aguna, who had been married by a Haredi rabbi to a husband who subsequently converted to Christianity and refused to participate in a Jewish divorce. The mother eventually divorced and remarried civilly and had the daughter years later. The daughter, who had been raised as an Orthodox Jew and attended a Haredi day school, brought up the question of her status herself prior to an impending marriage. Rabbi Yosef proceeded systematically to disqualify evidence that a prior marriage had ever taken place. The mother's evidence was immediately disqualified as an <b>interested</b> <b>party.</b> The ketubah (Jewish marriage contract/certificate) was never found. The rabbi who performed the marriage was contacted, but Rabbi Yosef wrote that his testimony could not be accepted without the ketubah, and in any event required corroboration by a second witness. Attempts to contact the husband were abandoned after an adversarial conversation with his new, non-Jewish wife. Thus, Rabbi Yosef concluded there was insufficient evidence that a valid prior marriage had ever taken place. Rabbi Yosef then proceeded to establish the possibility that the former husband might be the daughter's father. The mother testified that her former husband occasionally brought alimony payments and came for visitation in person and hence the two were sometimes at least momentarily alone together. Applying an ancient rule that when a husband and wife are known to be alone together behind a closed door the law presumes sexual intercourse may well have taken place, Rabbi Yosef concluded that it was possible the former husband was the daughter's father and hence Jewish law, which very strongly construes all evidence in favour of birth within marriage, had to presume that he was. Thus, Rabbi Yosef concluded that there was insufficient evidence of either a former marriage or that the new husband was the father, and hence he concluded that no evidence of mamzerut had occurred.|$|E

2500|$|Initial {{reaction}} to the notices by local residents was stunned disbelief. [...] The claim {{had the potential to}} nullify all existing land titles within the grant and most residents were concerned by the threat of possible litigation. [...] When word spread that both the Southern Pacific Railroad and Silver King Mine had agreed to terms with Reavis, concern turned to panic. [...] Many residents reasoned that if the mine and railroad, with their associated financial and legal resources, found Reavis' claim too strong to fight then they stood no chance against it. [...] This belief was augmented by Reavis' willingness to allow any <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> access to inspect his documents. [...] Faced with this challenge, some area pioneers abandoned their homes and land instead of trying to deal with Reavis.|$|E
2500|$|The writ of {{habeas corpus}} is one of what are called the [...] "extraordinary", [...] "common law", or [...] "prerogative writs", which were {{historically}} issued by the English courts {{in the name of}} the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are quo warranto, prohibito, mandamus, procedendo, and certiorari. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an <b>interested</b> <b>party.</b> This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.|$|E

2500|$|MD 545 was paved as a {{concrete}} road from MD 280 (now MD 213) to Little Elk Creek near Childs in 1933.

MD 545 was extended to Pleasant Hill after the state reconstructed Blue Ball Road from there to Childs as a gravel road between 1947 and 1949 and resurfaced soon after with bituminous concrete. The highway was resurfaced with bituminous concrete from MD 280 to Dogwood Road in 1969 and from Dogwood Road to Pleasant Hill in 1972. In January 2010, the Maryland State Highway Administration put the 1932 pony truss bridge MD 545 used to cross Little Elk Creek up for sale to any buyer willing to preserve the bridge at a new location. No <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> was found, so the old bridge was demolished in June and July 2011. The new [...] concrete bridge opened in November 2011.|$|E
