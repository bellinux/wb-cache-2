25|$|Pectins, {{also known}} as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Several {{distinct}} polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked D-galacturonic acid.

Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α-D-galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α-L-rhamnose-(1. From many of the rhamnose residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-galactose, L-arabinose and D-xylose, with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin.|$|E

25|$|The {{organic acids}} are mainly malic and tartaric acids. Tartaric acid is a {{characteristic}} of grapes; in its leaves its content ranges from 5 to 7 grams per litre. Malic acid is present in green grapes and its ratio decreases with maturation to give between 2 and 7 grams per litre at harvest. The range is very wide depending on the variety and soil with hot climates giving lower rates as the heat accelerates its degradation. There are many other acids in small quantities: citric acid, ascorbic acid, α-ketoglutaric, fumaric acid, <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acid,</b> coumaric acid, etc. Their variable quantity varies the pH of the wort. The must of white wine is generally more acidic than red grape must simply because the grape maturity is less advanced.|$|E

The genetic map position of the locus, eda, is about 35 min. The inability to grow on the uronic acids was expected, because the aldolase is on the sole known pathway of their metabolism. However, inability to grow on gluconate was less expected, because the hexose monophosphate shunt might be used, as happens in mutants blocked in the previous step, edd, of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The likely explanation of gluconate negativity is inhibition by accumulated KDGP, because gluconate is inhibitory to growth on other substances, and one type of gluconate revertant is eda−, edd−.

40|$|Cell wall pectin forms {{a matrix}} around the cellulose–xyloglucan network that is {{composed}} of rhamnogalacturonan I, rhamnogalacturonan II and homogalacturonan (HG), a major pectic polymer consisting of α- 1, 4 -linked <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acids.</b> HG is secreted in a highly methyl-esterified form and selectively de-methyl-esterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) during cell growth and pathogen attack. The mechanical damage that often precedes the penetration of the leaf by a pathogen promotes the activation of PME, which in turn leads to the emission of methanol (MeOH), an abundant volatile organic compound, which is quickly perceived by the intact leaves of the damaged plant and the neighboring plants. The exposure to MeOH {{may result in a}} priming effect on intact leaves, setting the stage for the within-plant and neighboring plant immunity. The emission of MeOH by a wounded plant enhances the resistance of the non-wounded, neighboring receiver plants to bacterial pathogens and promotes cell-to-cell communication that facilitates the spread of viruses in neighboring plants...|$|R

Chemically, pectin is a polysaccharide composed of a linear chain of 1 -> 4 linked <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acids,</b> which is esterified with methanol at 80 %. The pectin-based gel electrolytes in a transparent film form were obtained by a plasticization process with glycerol and addition of LiClO(4).

The electrochemical behaviors of the samples were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Nyquist graphs are showed and discussed. The obtained pectin-based samples also presented good adherence to the glass, flexibility, homogeneity (SEM) and transparency (about 70 % in the vis) properties. They are good candidates to be applied as gel electrolytes in electrochromic devices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Here, {{we focused}} on the {{biochemical}} characterization of the Arabidopsis thaliana pectin methylesterase 3 gene (AtPME 3; At 3 g 14310) {{and its role in}} plant development. A combination of biochemical, gene expression, Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy and reverse genetics approaches were used. We showed that AtPME 3 is ubiquitously expressed in A. thaliana, particularly in vascular tissues. In cell wall-enriched fractions, only the mature part of the protein was identified, suggesting that it is processed before targeting the cell wall. In all the organs tested, PME activity was reduced in the atpme 3 - 1 mutant compared with the wild type. This was related to the disappearance of an activity band corresponding to a pI of 9. 6 revealed by a zymogram. Analysis of the cell wall composition showed that the degree of methylesterification (DM) of <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acids</b> was affected in the atpme 3 - 1 mutant. A change in the number of adventitious roots was found in the mutant, which correlated with the expression of the gene in adventitious root primordia.

40|$|Two {{different}} procedures, alcohol precipitation with washing (APW) and a 10 kD MWCO membrane ultrafiltration with diafiltration (UF-DF), for pectin recovering and purification from crude aqueous extracts were investigated. The {{results showed}} that the yield, purity, chemical, and physicochemical features of isolated pectins depended upon the type of procedure used. The APW technique gave a higher pectin yield, and the isolated pectin contained more neutral sugars, more proteins, and more ash but less <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acids</b> than the 10 kD membrane UF-DF one. The weight-average molar mass of the APP was lower and its emulsifying properties slightly better than those of the UFPR 10. Molar mass distribution of APP or UFPR 10 showed two distinct pectin fractions peaks, which were separated in high-MW and low-MW pectin fractions using a 50 kD MWCO membrane. The high-MW fractions exhibited poor emulsifying and emulsion stabilizing abilities whereas the low-MW fractions displayed a much higher emulsifying ability than the initial pectin fractions. Therefore, it was inferred that the ability of beet pectin to be an effective emulsifier and/or emulsion stabilizer was greatly dependent on its weight-average molar mass. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanical}} wounding on membrane voltage, endogenous ion currents, and ion fluxes were investigated in primary roots of maize (Zea mays) using intracellular microelectrodes, a vibrating probe, and ion-selective electrodes. After a wedge-shaped wound was {{cut into the}} proximal elongation zone of the roots, a large inward current of approximately 60 [mu]A cm- 2 was measured, together with {{a change in the}} current pattern along the root. The changes of the endogenous ion current were accompanied by depolarization of the membrane voltage of cortex cells up to 5 mm from the wound. Neither inhibitors of ion channels nor low temperature affected the large, wound-induced inward current. The fluxes of H+, K+, Ca 2 +, and Cl- contributed only about 7 [mu]A cm- 2 to the wound-induced ion current. This suggests the occurrence of a large mass flow of negatively charged molecules, such as proteins, sulfated polysaccharides, and <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acids,</b> from the wound. Natural wounding of the root cortex by developing lateral roots caused an outwardly directed current, which was clearly different in magnitude and direction from the current induced by mechanical injury...|$|R

In this study, we characterized the soluble exopolysaccharides of 25 model bacterial strains isolated from different locations of a full-scale desalination plant in Western Australia. Biofilms of individual strains were initially quantified using crystal violet assay; significant biofilm production was detected in 21 / 25 isolates. Enzyme-linked lectin sorbent assay using lectins, Conacavalin A (ConA) and Ulex identified glucose and/or mannose in 11 / 25 isolates, and fucose in 24 / 25 isolates to significant levels. Exopolysaccharides were extracted and purified from bacterial cultures using centrifugation, TCA precipitation, cold acetone precipitation, dialysis and vacuum drying. Yield of exopolysaccharides varied between 90 mg to 480 mg/L of broth culture. Purified exopolysaccharides of 14 strains were analysed by High-Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD) and ATR-FTIR.

40|$|In fleshy fruits {{ripening}} {{is generally}} {{associated with a}} loss in tissue firmness resulting from depolymerization of wall components and separation of adjacent cells. In the regions of the wall that contain plasmodesmata, the usual sequences of ripening events, i. e. depolymerization of the middle lamellae and splitting of the walls, are not observed. In the present study we attempted to characterize in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) fruit the structural microdomain of the cell wall that surrounds the plasmodesmata by in muro visualization of the cell wall components. Anionic sites of <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acids</b> were labeled with cationic gold. Low-esterified homogalacturonans were labeled with the monoclonal antibody JIM 5. In addition, a polyclonal antibody directed toward [beta](1 -> 3) -glucopyranose was used to target callose in situ.

This domain was composed of low-esterified homogalacturonans that were not involved in calcium cross-bridging but were probably surrounded by a cationic environment. These structural features may result in the prevention of normal cell wall separation in regions containing plasmodesmata. However, observations by low-temperature scanning electron microscopy suggested that splitting of these walls ruptured the plasmodesmata and ultimately resulted in the spatial separation of adjacent cells...|$|R
40|$|The !-glucuronidase gene aguA from Aspergillus niger was cloned and characterised. Analysis of the {{promoter}} {{region of}} aguA revealed {{the presence of}} four putative binding sites for the major carbon catabolite repressor protein CREA and one putative binding site for the transcriptional activator XLNR. In addition, a sequence motif was detected which differed {{only in the last}} nucleotide from the XLNR consensus site. A construct in which part of the aguA coding region was deleted still resulted in production of a stable mRNA upon transformation of A. niger. The putative XLNR binding sites and two of the putative CREA binding sites were mutated individually in this construct and the effects on expression were examined in A. niger transformants. Northern analysis of the transformants revealed that the consensus XLNR site is not actually functional in the aguA promoter, whereas the sequence that diverges from the consensus at a single position is functional. This indicates that XLNR is also able to bind to the sequence GGCTAG, and the XLNR binding site consensus should therefore be changed to GGCTAR. Both CREA sites are functional, indicating that CREA has a strong influence on aguA expression. A detailed expression analysis of aguA in four genetic backgrounds revealed a second regulatory system involved in activation of aguA gene expression.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of alkaline pretreatment on chemical composition, physical structure and methane production of five varieties of sorghum (S 1, S 2, S 3, S 4, and S 5). The pretreatment was conducted in closed bottles, at 55 degrees C for 12 h. Samples were soaked in a NaOH solution at 4 and 10 gNaOH/ 100 gTS, with a solid concentration of 35 gTS/L. Sodium hydroxide pretreatment led to a reduction of lignin (50 - 70 %), hemicelluloses (18 - 35 %), cellulose (16 - 45 %) and <b>galacturonic</b> <b>acids</b> (up to 100 %), for all varieties of sorghum, as also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The reduction of lignin content and thereafter the solubilization of cellulose and hemicelluloses, previously observed, can accelerate the disintegration and the hydrolysis steps during anaerobic digestion.

Hereto, the alcohol insoluble residues were extracted and sequentially fractionated using hot water, a chelating agent, sodium carbonate, and potassium hydroxide solutions to obtain different pectin fractions and a hemicellulose fraction. Chemical analyses were used to characterize these polysaccharide fractions. The results show that cell wall polysaccharides of the pulp and especially of the peel from white-flesh and red-flesh dragon fruits contain significant amounts of pectic substances that are lowly methyl-esterified. The cell wall polysaccharides of the peel {{as well as those}} of the pulp contain high amounts (38 - 47 %) of loosely bound (water-soluble) pectic substances.
