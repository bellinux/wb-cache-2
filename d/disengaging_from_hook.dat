500|$|In service, the {{parasite}} fighter would be launched and retrieved by a trapeze. With the trapeze fully extended, the engine would be airstarted {{and the release}} from the mother ship was accomplished by the pilot pulling the nose back to <b>disengage</b> <b>from</b> the <b>hook.</b> In recovery, the aircraft would approach the mother ship from underneath and link up with the trapeze using the retractable hook in the aircraft's nose. The anticipated production shift would see a mixed B-36 fleet with both [...] "fighter carriers" [...] and bombers employed on missions. There were plans that, from the 24th B-36 onward, provisions would be made to accommodate one XF-85, with a maximum of four per bomber envisioned. Up to 10 percent of the B-36s on order were to be converted to fighter carriers {{with three or four}} F-85s instead of a bomb load.|$|R
2500|$|The lockback's {{blade locking}} {{mechanism}} is a refinement of the slipjoint design; both utilize a strong backspring located {{along the back}} of the knife. [...] However, the lockback design incorporates a hook or lug on the backspring, which snaps into a corresponding notch on the blade's heel when the blade is fully opened, locking the blade into position. [...] Closing the blade requires the user to apply pressure to the bar spring located towards the rear of the knife handle to <b>disengage</b> the <b>hook</b> <b>from</b> the notch and thus release the blade.|$|R

6000|$|When he {{made sure}} that the Devil had retired, he {{carefully}} drew from his pocketbook {{a slip of paper}} and affixed it on the hook. The line had scarcely reached the current before he felt a bite. The hook was swallowed. To bring up his victim rapidly, <b>disengage</b> him <b>from</b> the <b>hook,</b> and reset his line, was the work of a moment. Another bite and the same result. Another, and another. In a very few minutes the roof was covered with his panting spoil. The broker could himself distinguish that many of them were personal friends; nay, some of them were familiar frequenters of the building on which they were now miserably stranded. That the broker felt a certain satisfaction in being instrumental in thus misleading his fellow-brokers no one acquainted with human nature will for a moment doubt. But a stronger pull on his line caused him to put forth all his strength and skill. The magic pole bent like a coach-whip. The broker held firm, assisted by the battlements of the church. Again and again it was almost wrested from his hand, and again and again he slowly reeled in a portion of the tightening line. At last, with one mighty effort, he lifted {{to the level of the}} roof a struggling object. A howl like Pandemonium rang through the air as the broker successfully landed at his feet--the Devil himself! ...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{theories}} is the Disengagement Theory proposed in 1961.

Furthermore, <b>disengaging</b> <b>from</b> social ties in old age is not across the board: unsatisfactory ties are dropped and satisfying ones kept.|$|R
