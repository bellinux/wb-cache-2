5000|$|An <b>egg</b> <b>spoon</b> is a {{specialized}} spoon {{for use in}} eating boiled eggs. In comparison to a teaspoon it typically has a shorter handle and bowl, a more pointed tip and often a more rounded bowl. These characteristics are intended to facilitate the removal of an egg's contents from the shell, through a small hole in one end. For this purpose the <b>egg</b> <b>spoon</b> is easier to use than a normal teaspoon.|$|E
50|$|Games {{that are}} played on school sports days can be wide and varied.

50|$|In New Orleans, {{sweetened}} {{condensed milk}} is commonly used as a topping on chocolate or similarly cream-flavored snowballs. In Scotland, it is mixed with sugar and butter then boiled to form a popular sweet candy called tablet or Swiss-milk-tablet, this recipe being very similar to another version of the Brazilian candy brigadeiro called branquinho. In {{some parts of the}} Southern United States, condensed milk is a key ingredient in lemon ice box pie, a sort of cream pie. In the Philippines, condensed milk is mixed with some evaporated milk and <b>eggs,</b> <b>spooned</b> into shallow metal containers over liquid caramelized sugar, and then steamed to make a stiffer and more filling version of crème caramel known as leche flan, also common in Brazil under the name pudim de leite.|$|R

Perhaps the most collected souvenirs by tourists are photographs as a medium to document specific events and places for future reference.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded usage in the Oxford English Dictionary is in {{an article}} of 8 September 1894 featured in The Daily News: [...] "the gentlemen had a turn in the egg-and-spoon race, in which the competitors had to punt {{with one hand and}} balance an <b>egg</b> on a <b>spoon</b> with the other". An earlier origin in colonial USA has been claimed. Egg-and-spoon races formed part of village celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, alongside the tug of war and blindfold wheelbarrow races. A set of turned and stained wooden <b>eggs</b> and <b>spoons</b> designed for racing and dating to the 1920s forms part of the Good Time Gallery of the Museum of Childhood in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. It reached Canada by at least 1922, the first time it was mentioned in The Globe. By the 1930s, the phenomenon of the parents' egg-and-spoon race was sufficiently well-established to be satirized in Punch. Races were held among the staff of Trinity College, Cambridge until the 1950s. Egg-and-spoon races were held as part of the celebrations for both the 1977 Silver Jubilee and 2012 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. [...] In 2012, the British Council promoted the egg-and-spoon race as a suitable event for [...] "English days", alongside the celebration of Charles Dickens and of the Victorian era.|$|R
40|$|ScreenWork was {{established}} by Jon Dovey, University of Bristol, through developing discussions at AVPhD (An AHRC-funded network instigated by Goldsmiths and Westminster University) and other practice-based research symposia. It is a blind peer-reviewed publication of practice-based audio-visual research, launched at the 3 rd Journal of Media Practice (JMP) Symposium: ‘Making the Case: contextualising and documenting media practice as research', University of Bristol, 15 th June 2007 at which Bendon also presented a related paper. <b>Egg</b> & <b>Spoon</b> (2005), a DV loop, was selected for the first edition. It is one outcome from a period of research on encountering narrative or psychological stasis in moving-image practice. Bendon focuses on the work's form {{to draw attention to}} the idea (perversion) of representations of stasis within durational work, and how non-linear presentations can be explored as appropriate modes of reception. This project was informed by theoretical and contextual considerations (including Deleuze's work on stillness and movement, Adorno and Horkheimer's critique on viewing film, and Ivone Margulies' reflections on the films of Chantal Akerman). Bendon expands on these in A Place For Ambiguity - Articulating Practice As Research (2005) JMP 6 (3) 157 - 165. This essay was developed from a paper presented at Articulating Media Practice As Research, South Bank University (17 th June 2005). In both paper and subsequent essay, Bendon articulates and reflects on the types of understanding and knowledge employed as a creative practitioner, using <b>Egg</b> & <b>Spoon</b> to reflect on the role that creative process plays in research culture, exploring the significance of process in developing research outcomes through performative and spatial investigations. It is in the context of an integrated theory/practice model of research that the work was submitted to ScreenWork. The DVD is distributed with Journal of Media Practice 8 (2) 2007 ISSN 14682753.

50|$|Week 13: Train the Trainers Challenge - For one hour, the {{remaining}} contestants got {{the opportunity to}} train the trainers (first for the Commando and Tiffiny). After their training session, the contestants made a challenge for the trainers to determine who the fittest trainer.

In the second round, it was a 100m <b>egg</b> and <b>spoon</b> race. Shannan's hand was shaking before the race even began and it cost him a place in the final round. The Commando ate his egg (including the shell). In the final round, trainers had gone around the pole 25 times and run 100m.

Mr. Wimpy's only defences against the enemies are to trap them between the falling burger ingredients and to temporarily freeze them with pepper. Only a small supply of pepper (up to 4 bottles) can be carried at a time; when the player is low on pepper, more can be acquired by collecting a coffee cup or ice cream.
