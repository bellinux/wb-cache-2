40|$|We {{study the}} dynamic {{relation}} between daily stock retums and daily <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> option-derived implied volatilities. By simultaneously analyzing <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> index- and firm-level implied volatilities, we distinguish between <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> systematic and idiosyn-cratic volatility {{in an effort}} to better understand the asymmetric volatility phenomenon. Our results indicate that the relation between stock retums and <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> systematic volatility (idiosyncratic volatility) is substantially negative (near zero). These results sug-gest that asymmetric volatility is primarily attributed to systematic market-wide factors rather than aggregated firm-level effects. We also present evidence that supports our as-sumption that <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> implied volatility are good proxies for <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> expected stocic volatility. I...|$|R

The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E

Changes in the money stock represent an endogenous reaction to some third factor and do not cause subsequent changes in output. Therefore, {{a change in the}} current fiat money stock will not lead to any change in output.

5|$|Gia Long {{abolished}} all large landholding by princes, nobles {{and high}} officials. He dismantled the 800-year-old practice of paying officials and rewarding or endowing nobles with {{a portion of}} the taxes from a village or a group thereof. Existing highways were repaired and new ones constructed, with the north-south road from Saigon to Lạng Sơn put under restoration. He organised a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land clearing and cultivation. There was little emphasis on <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.|$|E
5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E
