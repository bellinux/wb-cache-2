40|$|With modern {{digital control}} systems, using engine thrust for {{emergency}} <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> to supplement or replace failed aircraft normal <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> {{has become a}} practical consideration. The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center has developed a propulsion-controlled aircraft (PCA) system in which computer-controlled engine thrust provides emergency <b>flight</b> <b>control.</b> An F- 15 and an MD- 11 airplane have been landed without using any <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Preliminary studies have also been conducted that show that engines on only one wing can provide some <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> capability if the lateral center of gravity can be shifted toward {{the side of the}} airplane that has the operating engine(s). Simulator tests of several airplanes with no <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> operating and <b>all</b> engines out on the left wing have all shown positive control capability within the available range of lateral center-of-gravity offset. Propulsion-controlled aircraft systems that can operate without modifications to engine control systems, thus allowing PCA technology to be installed on less capable airplanes or at low cost, are also desirable. Further studies have examined simplified 'PCA Lite' and 'PCA Ultralite' concepts in which thrust control is provided by existing systems such as auto-throttles or a combination of existing systems and manual pilot control...|$|R

50|$|Development of an {{effective}} set of <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> was a critical advance {{in the development of}} aircraft.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an electromechanical actuation system presenting improved reliability, high integrity and prognostic functions able to alert of a developing failure. In this system a <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> {{is driven by}} two parallel rollerscrews, each driven by a brushless motor with gearhead and clutch; the motors electric drives are controlled by dual redundant electronic units performing closed loop position control {{as a function of}} the commands received from the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> computer. Provisions are taken to provide damping in the event of simultaneous failure of both actuators. The electronic units perform control, diagnosis and prognosis of the actuation system and mutually exchange data via a cross channel data link. The actuation system thereby provides high integrity control of an aerodynamic surface with dual mechanical link, dual power source and quadruplex control, similarly to a fly-by-wire hydraulic <b>flight</b> <b>control.</b> The paper first addresses the critical design issues associated with the electromechanical actuation of <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces,</b> then outlines configuration, characteristics and performance of the actuation syste...|$|R
