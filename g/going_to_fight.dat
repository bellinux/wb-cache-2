5|$|Vinnie runs off, finding {{himself on}} the black area of the beach where he bumps into rival gang leader Boogaloo Jones and his gang, the Chaplains. Boogaloo sets up a rumble between his gang and the Stompers. Vinnie later meets up with Roz and the girl Crazy dates, Eva; Crazy has {{meanwhile}} beaten all the mobsters. The four head out to a party, where Vinnie tells the Stompers that they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> with the Chaplains, to which the gang responds negatively. Much of the gang and their girls head out to a rock and roll show. Vinnie is horrified {{at the idea of}} Crazy and himself having to fight the Chaplains alone. One of the Stompers named Sal and his girl have a run-in with Boogaloo while driving, and wind up in a car crash. Vinnie finally persuades the Stompers to rumble with the Chaplains.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

The altenses did not comply, and led by Guzmán and his forces, they started chasing Carrera; the caudillo hid, helped by his native allies and remained under their protection when the forces of Miguel Garcia Granados arrived from Guatemala City looking for him.|$|E

I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{itself was}} {{essential}} {{in the kind}} of operations the German Army and its allies were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight.</b> In the Inter-War period, the Luftwaffe developed its communications, aircraft, training programs, and to an extent its logistics to support mobile operations. Its primary mission was not direct close air support, but operational-level interdiction. This entailed attacking enemy logistics, communications, and air bases. Air raids on Soviet war-making potential were forbidden by Hitler. It made little sense to destroy industry that would soon be in Axis hands; the OKW did not believe the Soviets could transport the industry to the Ural Mountains. Counter-air operations were considered most important. In order for the German Army and Luftwaffe bombers to operate effectively in their roles, the first task of the Axis was to eliminate the Soviet air force and deny the enemy the means to interfere with their operations. Once these operations had been carried out, close air support could be rendered to the army. This had always been a core tenet of Luftwaffe doctrine. Once the A-A line had been reached, the Luftwaffe was to destroy the surviving factories in the Urals.|$|E

25|$|UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy {{and a team}} {{of lawyers}} were in court until 4:30p.m. {{on the day of the}} fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An {{ultimatum}} was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight.</b> While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken nose, and cracked ribs. His injuries combined with the rule change, he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.|$|E

Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the Allies and Central Powers against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective propaganda efforts. While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 Vingt-cinq poèmes ("Twenty-five Poems").|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters {{publicly}} insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing {{he had left the}} band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd [...] "a spent force creatively." [...] When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. He later told The Sunday Times: [...] "Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> him". In 2013, Waters stated that he regretted the lawsuit, saying: [...] "I was wrong. Of course I was." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{songs for}} Spiritual Machines were written and {{partially}} recorded during {{a year in}} which the band was doing extensive touring of Canada, the United States, and Europe. According to lead singer Maida, the live stage-context inspired the band to [...] "keep it really basic and not try to add too many textures... to not overdo it." [...] and giving the technically inclined record an ironically acoustic feel at times. According to Maida, half of the record was completed before the book and its ideas even entered the equation. During an interview in late 2001, he stated, [...] "... even though it seems quite intrinsic to the record, really, it only represents about four or five songs." [...] While the lyrics of several songs were inspired by the futuristic theories of Kurzweil, they were also written as a response to them, saying that the human spirit would always prevail. [...] "Lyrically, this album is about finding the spirituality within ourselves." [...] This is the case with the opening song, [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)", which Raine said, [...] ".. not an 'f-you' to Kurzweil. It's like 'I believe [...] what you're saying, but we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> it as well because there is a soul and there is a spirit.'" [...] Following [...] "Mafia" [...] is the song [...] "In Repair", which muses on how the human body can be [...] "repaired," [...] whether through heart surgery or after an accident.
