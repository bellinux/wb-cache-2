5|$|Transportation of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> for {{commercial}} purposes in the USA is regulated by Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 - Transportation, (abbreviated 49 CFR). A cylinder containing 200kPa (29.0psig/43.8psia) or greater at 20°C (68°F) of non-flammable, nonpoisonous compressed gas, and being transported {{for commercial}} purposes is classified as HAZMAT (<b>hazardous</b> <b>materials)</b> in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Materials</b> Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400psi) by several manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|Changing the bogies on a {{rail car}} takes hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, {{containerized}} freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead {{of changing the}} bogies. As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers can be moved from one train to another {{in as little as}} 47 minutes. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> however, the bogies are usually changed.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} {{in the last}} two decades have increased public awareness of potential risks associated with <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> transport. Consequently, the safety management of this activity has become an issue of major importance. This paper presents a methodology and case study of Rourkela, which is to contribute a national action plan for <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> transport for Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP). The main objective, is to develop a planning system for <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> transport. The planning system considers both economic and risk values. Risk assessment for the route system is discussed. Firstly, <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> identification and classification is studied and international norms for accidents of <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> carrying vehicle and their influence on routing decision are briefly described.. The consequences of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> accident are explosion, heat radiation, and toxicity. Secondly, intelligence phase is mainly used to understand the problem. GIS played an important role in risk assessment. The elements at risk include population, buildings and economic activitiesThirdly, Buffer analysis is done to identify the potentially hazardous road locations and necessary preventive measures are suggested for this. Accident rate is calculated from Crossthwaite, Fitzpatrick, TNO, and Gaussian equation considering the preventive measures for <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> carrying vehicles. The new accident rate calculated by using the above mentioned formula was compared with the previous 7 years data sets obtained from different police stations. The results obtained from the present method are promising. The buffer analysis will be helpful for traffic planners to take decisions correctly in case of any future research in that area...|$|R
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as much of a problem to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E

The fire department operates the Citizens Fire Academy, a fire and life safety program for Bellaire citizens held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The old fire station was demolished on December 4, 2009, with demolition continuing on Monday December 7, 2009, and operations are temporarily relocated at the Chevron building.

This involved the removal of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> and contaminants, to keep in line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E
