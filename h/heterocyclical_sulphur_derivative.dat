40|$|The {{chemical}} instability and reactivity of certain biologically important <b>sulphur</b> <b>derivatives</b> are recalled and their {{relevance to the}} study of sulphur auxotrophs is pointed out. In {{the early stages of the}} biological utilization of inorganic sulphur sources the compounds involved are often relatively unstable. In the conditions used for the examination of their specific biological effects the compounds themselves, even when initially pure, may undergo chemical change by reaction with other com-pounds in growth media or the oxygen of the air, for example. Many inorganic sulphur compounds, particularly those which involve intermediate oxidation states of the sulphur, are unstable (see for example, Pollard & Jones, 1958) and exchange reactions readily occur between these compounds and organic-SH or-SS-compounds. Such hazards are familiar to many workers in the field of microbial sulphur meta-bolism (e. g. Vishniac & Santer, 1957; Szczepkowski, 1958). Deductions about meta-bolic pathways which involve such sulphur compounds and are based on growth and metabolic experiments, particularly those of long duration, should be made circum...|$|R

Title of Thesis: Influence of benzoxazinedione {{derivatives}} {{on selected}} mycobacterial enzymes Tuberculosis is an insidious infectious disease {{with more and}} more increasing incidence in certain regions. It is difficult to treat by the available means because of increasing cases of multidrug resistance, which is defined as a resistance of M. tuberculosis at least to two primary antituberculotic drugs - rifampicin and isoniazid.

In this study we present the results of an investigation into the electrochemical doping process of PEDTT, using four different electrolyte solutions, differing in anion content of the chosen salt. The results show that the anion identity {{plays a key role in}} the redox reactions accompanying these processes in what could be interpreted as anion ionochromism. In situ UV–Vis spectroelectrochemical experiments reveal an intriguing double electrochromic transition of PEDTT films during their oxidative doping, going from golden-yellow through green to pomegranate – a quality not so common within the family of electroactive conjugated polymers. The evolution of each UV–Vis spectrum over a potential range indicates that different redox states of the polymer are responsible for the chromatic changes. In the reduction half-cycle, the dedoping process of PEDTT appears to follow a path dissimilar to the p-doping one, featuring only one, direct electrochromic transition of the film’s colour, bypassing the green state, and a distinct two-step bleaching process of doping-induced charge carrier bands. The observed electrochemical and spectral phenomena have been accredited to the specific redox behaviour of doping-induced radical cation and cationic defect states interacting with the dithioalkylene sulphur atom...|$|R

The functional details of these highly complex associations remain largely unclear. The impetus {{of this study is}} to gain a better understanding of the symbiotic interaction between marine bacteria and their coral host. Studies have shown that certain bacterial orders associate with specific certain coral species, thus making the symbiotic synergy a non-random consortium. Consequently both corals and bacteria may be capable of emitting chemical cues that enable both parties to find one another and thus generate the symbiosis. The production of these cues by the symbionts may be the result of environmental stimuli such as elevated ocean temperatures, increased water acidity, and even predation. One potential chemical cue could be the compound DMSP (Dimethylsulfoniopropionate) and its <b>sulphur</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Reef-building corals are believed to be the major producers of the DMSP during times of stress. Marine bacteria utilize DMSP as a source of sulfur and carbon. As a result corals could potentially attract their bacterial consortium depending on their DMSP production. This would enable them to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions by changing their bacterial communities to that which may aid in survival. To test the hypothesis that coral-produced DMSP plays a role in attracting symbiotic bacteria, this study utilized the advent of high-throughput sequencing paired with chemotactic assays to determine the response of coral-associated bacterial isolates towards the DMSP compound at differing concentrations. Chemotaxis assays revealed that some isolates responded positively towards the DMSP compound. This finding adds to existing evidence suggesting that coral-associated pathogens utilize chemotaxis as a host colonization and detection mechanism. Thus the symbiotic bacteria that make up the coral microbiome may also employ this process. Furthermore this study demonstrates that bacterial motility may be a strong contributing factor in the response to the chemotactic cue. Swarming motility may be better suited for bacteria that need to respond to a chemical gradient on the surface of the coral. Therefore the isolates that were able to swarm seemed to respond more strongly to the DMSP...|$|R

The cause of this attraction may stem from the capability of a variety of marine bacteria to catabolize DMSP into different metabolically significant pathways, which may be necessary for the survival of these mutualistic interactions. To test the hypothesis that coral-produced DMSP play a role in attracting symbiotic bacteria, this study utilized the advent of high-through sequencing paired with bacterial isolation techniques to properly characterize the microbial community in the stony coral Porites astreoides. We conducted DMSP swarming and chemotaxis assays to determine the response of these coral-associated bacterial isolates towards the DMSP compound at differing concentrations. Preliminary data from this study suggests that six out of the ten bacterial isolates are capable of conducting unidirectional motility; these six isolates are also capable of conducting swarming motility in the direction of an increasing DMSP concentration gradient. This would indicate that there is a form of positive chemotaxis on behalf of the bacteria towards the DMSP compound. By obtaining a better understanding of the dynamics that drive the associations between bacterial communities and corals, we can further aid in the protection and conservation processes for corals.

40|$|El treball que es presenta en aquesta tesi {{doctoral}} és la continuació i ampliació de la feina feta en el nostre grup en els darrers anys sobre el metal·lacarborà cobalto-bis(dicarballur). Amb la finalitat de la seva aplicació com a components de materials moleculars, calia com a objectiu inicial la síntesi i caracterització de nous derivats en els àtoms de carboni i de bor del clúster, així com l'estudi teòric d'alguns d'aquests compostos que presentaven propietats que no s'havien observat fins al moment. A partir d'aquests compostos s'han buscat aplicacions en els camps del tractament de residus nuclears, motors sintètics moleculars i en el camp de la biomedicina. Finalment i per ampliar el coneixement en el camp dels carborans, s'han fet estudis teòrics del pKa de nido-carborans, s'ha estudiat tant teòrica com experimentalment la reacció de cloració de l'anió [Ph-CB 9 H 9]- i s'ha participat en l'elaboració d'un treball d'interaccions intermoleculars entre molècules de iode i fosfino-carborans. Pel que fa a la síntesi de derivats en els àtoms de carboni, s'han obtingut productes substituïts amb àtoms de fòsfor i de sofre. En el primer cas l'àtom de fòsfor fa de pont entre les dues caixes de dicarballur de manera semblant als derivats del ferrocè anomenats ferrocenofans. Pel que fa als derivats de l'anió cobalto-bis(dicarballur) amb sofre s'han obtingut derivats disubstituïts amb funcions tioèter a partir dels disulfurs orgànics apropiats, i altres en què l'àtom o àtoms de sofre estan pinçant les dues caixes de dicarballur. Les substitucions en els vèrtexs de bor s'han treballat en tres vies diferents. La primera és l'halogenació de l'anió cobalto-bis(dicarballur) amb àtoms de clor, brom i iode emprant diferents mètodes, tant en dissolució com en estat sòlid. S'ha estudiat en més detall la reacció de cloració per la importància dels seus compostos en l'extracció de radionúclids. La segona via que s'ha treballat consisteix en la formació d'enllaços B-C utilitzant les condicions de reacció ben establertes per l'acoblament C-C com la reacció de Kumada o la de Heck. La tercera via parteix ja d'un oxo-derivat de l'anió 1, el zwitterió [8 -OC 4 H 8 O- 1, 2 -(C 2 B 9 H 11) 2]- (43). Aquest té l'oxigen enllaçat al B(8) fet que el fa que estigui carregat positivament, i per tant susceptible a l'atac de nucleòfils. S'han sintetitzat i caracteritzat un ampli ventall de compostos utilitzant diversos nucleòfils com alcohols, àcids, reactius de grignard, tiols, carborans i tiocarborans. Alguns dels compostos sintetitzats en aquest treball s'han aplicat en diversos camps. Els derivats clorats del cobalto-bis(dicarballur) s'han provat com a agents sinèrgics en l'extracció selectiva de radionúclids amb resultats interessants en quant a la millora de la selectivitat quan s'usen aquests compostos. També s'ha provat la incorporació del metal·lacarborà cobalto-bis(dicarballur) en màquines moleculars, i més concretament en rotors del tipus rotaxà. S'han sintetitzat i caracteritzat nous rotaxans a fi d'estudiar l'efecte intramolecular o intermolecular del clúster de bor en la dinàmica d'aquest tipus de molècules. D'altra banda s'han utilitzat alguns dels oxo-derivats en el vèrtex B(8) en la investigació antimicrobiana i en el tractament en cèl·lules tumorals. Finalment, tot i que els objectius d'aquest treball es centraven en el metal·lacarborà cobalto-bis(dicarballur) també s'ha fet un estudi teòric de carborans tenint en compte que aquests són part del cobalto-bis(dicarballur). En primer lloc s'ha volgut ampliar l'estudi de cloració fet a l'anió 1 sobre un altre clúster de bor. L'anió [Ph-CB 9 H 9]- (86) mostra l'interès de tenir dos punts de reactivitat molt diferent, els vèrtex aromàtics C-H i els del clúster B-H. Per altra banda s'ha buscat un mètode teòric per tal de calcular l'acidesa de nido-carborans mitjançant una metodologia ràpida i senzilla. Per últim s'ha realitzat un estudi que tracta les interaccions entre els fosfinocarborans i el iode. És interessar observar el cas del compost [1 -Me- 2 -PPh 2 - 1, 2 -C 2 B 10 H 10] (99) on l'addició de iode no provoca una disminució de la interacció entre ambdós àtoms, indicant la formació d'una estructura del tipus P···I-I···P. Aquest tipus d'estructura també es troba en estat sòlid tal com demostra l'estructura de raigs X. The work {{presented in}} this manuscript is the continuation and extension of the work done in our group during the last years on the cobaltabisdicarbollide metallacarborane. To apply these molecules as components of molecular materials, the initial objectives were the synthesis and characterization of new derivatives of cobaltabisdicarbollide on the carbon and boron vertices of the cluster, {{as well as a}} theoretical study of some of these compounds that presented properties not previously observed. The second objective was the application of some of these compounds to different fields such as the treatment of nuclear waste, molecular synthetic motors and in biomedicine. Finally, work on carboranes has also been done as these are part of metallacarboranes. Theoretical calculations of pKa values of nido-carboranes have been done. It has been studied both theoretically and experimentally the chlorination reaction of the anion [Ph-CB 9 H 9]-. Also the intermolecular interaction between iodine molecules and phosphino-carboranes has been studied by computational methods. Concerning the synthesis of carbon functionalized compounds, products substituted with phosphorus and sulphur have been obtained. In the first case the phosphorus is bridging the two dicarbollide cages in a way similar to the already known ferrocene <b>derivatives</b> called ferrocenophanes. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>derivatives</b> of cobaltabisdicarbollide have been obtained as disubstituted molecules with thioether groups obtained from the appropriate organic disulfides. C,C bridging molecules in which one or two sulphur atoms bridge both dicarbollide cages have also been obtained. Boron substituted vertices have been studied in three different ways. The first concerns halogenation of cobaltabisdicarbollide anion with chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms by using different methods, such as solution or solid state reactions. It has been studied more deeply the chlorination reaction because of the importance of these compounds on the extraction of radionuclides. The second way studied concerning the derivatization of 1 refers to the formation of B-C bonds by using either Kumada reaction or Heck reaction conditions. The third way of cobaltabisdicarbollide derivatization has as the starting product the oxo-derivative of 1, the zwitterion [8 -OC 4 H 8 O- 1, 2 -(C 2 B 9 H 11) 2]- (43). This compound has an oxygen atom bonded to the B(8) vertex with a positive charge and this position is susceptible to the attack by nucleophiles. We have synthesized and characterized a wide range of compounds by using different nucleophiles such as alcohols, acids, Grignard reagents, thiols, carboranes and thiocarboranes. Some compounds synthesized during this work have been used in different applications. Chlorinated derivatives of cobaltabisdicarbollide have been tested as synergic agents in the selective extraction of radionuclides for nuclear waste treatment. It has been tested the incorporation of metallacarborane cobaltabisdicarbollide in molecular machine structures, and more precisely in rotors like organic molecules called rotaxanes. We have synthesized and characterized new rotaxanes specially designed to study intramolecular or intermolecular effects of the boron cluster in the dynamics of this kind of molecules. Moreover, some oxo-derivatives at the B(8) vertex of cobaltabisdicarbollide have been applied in the research of antimicrobial and antitumoral treatments. Finally and although the aims of this work were centered on cobaltabisdicarbollide, some theoretical and experimental studies on carboranes have been done taking into account that these are part of the cobaltacarborane. Firstly we would like to improve the understanding of the chlorination reaction, extending the work done for 1 to other boron clusters. Anion [Ph-CB 9 H 9]- (86) was selected because it has two very different reactivity points, aromatic C-H groups and B-H cluster vertices. On the other hand we have described a theoretical method to calculate the acidity of nido-carboranes by means of a fast, reliable and simple methodology. Finally, {{the last part of the}} manuscript was focused on interactions between phosphino-carboranes and iodine. It is remarkable the behaviour of compound [1 -Me- 2 -PPh 2 - 1, 2 -C 2 B 10 H 10] (99), where upon addition of iodine the decrease of the interaction can't be observed. This behaviour can be explained by the formation of a P···I-I···P moiety, which can be observed in solid state by its x-ray crystal structure...|$|R
40|$|Described herein, is the {{synthesis}} and coordination chemistry of eight novel ligands L 1 -L 8, and the solid state studies of diphenylcarbazide and dithizone. These ligands form metallosupramolecular assemblies upon coordination of {{transition metal ions}} resulting {{in a wide range}} of architectures. Described in chapter two is a series of ligands that contain both N-donor and N-oxide donor atoms, L 1 -L 4. Reaction of L 1 with Cu 2 + results in the formation of a mononuclear complex [Cu(L 1) (ClO 4) 2 (sol) ] (solvent = MeCN or H 2 O), whereas L 2 forms the dinuclear double helicate [Ni 2 (L 2) 2] 4 + with Ni 2 +. Reaction of L 3 with Cu 2 + results in the formation of a head-to-tail dinuclear double helicate [Cu 2 (L 3) 2] 4 +. The N-oxide units imparts flexibility in the ligand strand and where the unoxidised ligand strand forms a circular helicate, the incorporation of an N-oxide unit allows the formation of the dinuclear double helicate. Reaction of L 4 with Co 2 + results in the formation of a tetranuclear circular helicate [Co 4 (L 4) 4] 8 +. Analogous complexes that contain ligands with a 1, 3 -phenyl spacer unit give pentanuclear circular helicates, whereas with a 1, 3 -phenol spacer the lower tetranuclear species is observed. The difference in the nuclearity of the circular helicates is due to the steric bulk of the methyl group on the central phenol spacer. In the dinuclear double complex formed with L 3 the N-oxide unit allows the ligand to flex, whereas the steric bulk of the –OH unit in L 4 is sufficiently large that even with the added flexibility that the N-oxide units imparts a double helicate cannot be formed. Chapter three introduces a new class of polydentate ligands, L 5 -L 7, these ligands consist of N-donor domains separated by a 1, 3 -phenol unit. The ligand L 5 contains two identical tridentate N-donor domains, reaction of L 5 with Zn 2 + results in a tetranuclear circular helicate [Zn 4 (L 5) 4] 8 +. Within the structure all four Zn 2 + ions are six-coordinate, arising from the coordination of two tridentate domains from two different ligand strands. Reaction of L 6 with Ag+ results in the formation of the dinuclear double meso-helicate [Ag 2 (L 6) 2] 2 +. Reaction of L 6 with Cd 2 + produces a crystalline material that consists of both colourless and orange species. The colourless crystals correspond to the mononuclear complex [Cd(L 6) 2 (MeCN) 2] 2 +, whereas the orange crystals produce the dinuclear double meso-helicate [Cd 2 (L 6) 2] 2 +. This variation in self-assembly is a direct result of the –OH unit on the 1, 3 -phenol spacer; if the -OH unit is protonated the oxygen atom can only coordinate once and therefore the mononuclear complex forms, however deprotonation of one of the -OH unit results in the oxygen coordinating twice as a bridging donor to form the dinuclear complex. Both the [Cd(L 6) 2 (MeCN) 2] 2 + and [Cd 2 (L 6) 2] 2 + species are present in solution, under equilibrium conditions, varying the stoichiometry alters the predominant species. The ligand L 7 is unsymmetrical, upon reaction with Co 2 + the ligand partitions into two different binding sites; a tridentate N-donor domain and a tridentate domain consisting of the bidentate N-donor domain and the O-donor atom from the central 1, 3 -phenol spacer. The resulting dinuclear HH-[Co 2 (L 7) 2] 3 + complex demonstrates that the two cobalt metal centres occupy different binding sites. Examining the solid state X-ray crystallographic data suggests that the two cobalt metal centres in the [Co 2 (L 7) 2] 3 + complex occupy different oxidation states; Co 2 + and Co 3 + to give a mixed valence helicate. In an analogues fashion to L 6, reaction of L 7 with Zn 2 + produces a crystalline material that consists of both colourless and orange species. The colourless crystals correspond to the mononuclear complex [Zn(L 7) 2] 2 +, whereas the orange crystals produce the dinuclear double helicate [Zn 2 (L 6) 2] 3 +. In the mononuclear [Zn(L 7) 2] 2 + species the Zn 2 + metal centre is coordinated by the tridentate N-donor domain of two different ligands. In the dinuclear [Zn 2 (L 6) 2] 3 + species each Zn 2 + metal centres is coordinated by the tridentate N-donor domain of one ligand and the tridentate domain, consisting of the bidentate N-donor and the O-donor from the central 1, 3 -phenol spacer, from another different ligand. The variation in the self-assembly is a direct result of the stoichiometry of the reaction; the formation of these two complexes is under the same equilibrium conditions of the previous L 6 structures. Described in chapter four is the potentially pentadentate N-donor ligand L 8, which comprises of a bidentate and tridentate binding domains separated by a 1, 3 -pyrene spacer. Reaction of L 8 with Cu 2 + results in the formation of a tetranuclear circular helicate [Cu 4 (L 8) 4] 8 +. Each of the Cu 2 + ions adopts a 5 -coordinate geometry formed by the coordination of the bidentate domain of one ligand strand and the tridentate domain of a different ligand strand, resulting in a head-to-tail tetranuclear circular helicate. The formation of this head-to-tail circular helicate is a result of the 1, 3 -pyrene spacer preventing the formation of the linear double stranded assemblies and secondly the stereoelectronic preference of Cu 2 +. Chapter five reports the solid state studies of diphenylcarbazide and dithizone, which are both useful reagents for the colorimetric determination of a variety of different metal ions. Examination of the scientific literature over the past 100 years shows that the coordination chemistry of DPC and DPTC is inconsistent, with literature sources proposing contradictory and non-definitive explanations, this chapter aims to extend the knowledge surrounding these reagents by isolating crystals. DPC reacts with Cd 2 + to form the mononuclear species [Cd(DPC) 2] 2 + the two ligands are coordinating through both the N-donor and O-donor domains. The discrepancies surrounding the DPC reaction is whether the redox reactions between the metal and ligand occur, upon reaction of DPC and Cd 2 + the metal does not oxidise the ligand. Reaction of DPC and Cu 2 + is more complex than the previous Cd 2 + reaction, the resulting [Cu 3 OH(OH 2) 3 (DPTO) 6] 5 + structure comprises of six ligands and three metal ions. DPC undergoes oxidative intramolecular cyclisation to form the nitrogen containing heterocycle 2, 3 -diphenyltetrazolium- 5 -olate (DPTO) and coordinates the Cu 2 + metal centre in two different modes: via both the oxygen and amide nitrogen atoms or by the bridging carbonyl unit. The [Cu 3 OH(OH 2) 3 (DPTO) 6] 5 + structure is also generated when reacting DPCO with Cu 2 +. Unfortunately a crystal of a chromium or vanadium complex with DPC was not achieved; however the cyclised ligand was isolated, highlighting that the oxidation and cyclisation of DPC is important in the coordination chemistry of these ions. Reaction of the <b>sulphur</b> <b>derivative</b> DPTC with various metal ions results in the deprotonation of the ligand to form the monoanionic species, which coordinates the metal ions via the S-donor and azo N-donor atoms. Reaction of DPTC with Hg 2 + to form the mononuclear complex [Hg(DPTC) 2]. The simple mononuclear complex involves two DPTC ligands coordinating the four-coordinate Hg 2 + ion as a bidentate donor via the N-donor and S-donor atoms. The reaction of DPTC with both Hg 2 + and Ag+ results in an interesting structure containing two Ag+, two Hg 2 + and four DPTC ligands. The DPTC appears to first react with Hg 2 + to form the previous [Hg(DPTC) 2] complex, this then acts as a bidentate ligand, coordinating via the S-donor atom and the Hg 2 + itself to form the [Hg 2 Ag 2 (DPTC) 4 (acetone) 2 (ClO 4) 2] complex. The reaction of DPTC with Cu 2 +, whether the anion is perchlorate or tetrafluoroborate, results in a very interesting structure, which comprises of eight DPTC ligands and eight Cu+ metal ions. The reaction of Cu 2 + with DPTC results in the metal ion reducing to Cu+ and simultaneously the DPTC deprotonates to form the monoanionic form. The counter-anion acts as a template and the formation of the “Cu 8 ” is a result of the presence of the anion. Reaction of copper (II) acetate with DPTC results in the [Cu 2 (DPTC) 2 (DPTCO) ] complex. The structure contains three ligands and two reduced distorted tetrahedral Cu+ ions. Each Cu+ ion has four-coordinate geometry arising from the coordination of two different forms of the DPTC ligands. Two of the ligands present are the monoanionic DPTC, coordinating via the S-donor and terminal N-donor azo atoms. Whereas the third ligand has completely oxidised to form DPTCO, coordinating via both the terminal N-donor azo N-donor atoms, the sulphur atom bridges both of the metal ions...|$|R
