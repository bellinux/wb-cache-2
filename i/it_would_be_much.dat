25|$|Another way {{to imagine}} wormholes {{is to take}} a sheet of paper and draw two {{somewhat}} distant points {{on one side of the}} paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate about}} the nature of the mind is {{relevant}} to the development of artificial intelligence. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{understood}} that the region would not be re-attached. Therefore, they favored {{the lesser of two}} evils and tacitly supported the interests of Lithuania. The Weimar Republic saw both Poland and France as its major enemies while Lithuania was more neutral. Also, once Germany restored its might, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> easier to recapture the region from weaker Lithuania than from larger Poland. Already on February 22, 1922, the Germans unofficially informed the Lithuanians that they were not opposed to Lithuanian action in Klaipėda and that, understandably, such a stance would never be officially declared. Such attitudes were later confirmed in other unofficial German–Lithuanian communications and even during the revolt, when Berlin urged local Germans not to hinder the Lithuanian plans.|$|E
25|$|On May 13, 2009, Pakistan's {{ambassador}} to the United States Husain Haqqani revealed on The Daily Show to Jon Stewart that Pakistan's decision to strike a peace deal with Taliban militants earlier, which effectively ceded control of large swathes of the country's northwest, {{was all part of}} a cunning plan to fool the Taliban, which is now coming to fruition with the commencement of Operation Black Thunderstorm. The ambassador mentioned to Jon Stewart that President Asif Ali Zardari's signing of the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, which was the Swat peace deal, {{was nothing more than a}} trick to lure the Taliban from the mountains and countryside to the main towns where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> easier for the Pakistani military to kill or capture them.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{felt that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> safer {{far away from}} Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown {{for his part in}} the Siege of Mytilene. He went on a mission to Bithynia to secure the {{assistance}} of King Nicomedes's fleet, but he spent so long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied {{for the rest of his}} life. Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.|$|E

25|$|The Court buttressed its {{determination}} {{based upon}} the underlying premises of the directness requirement. First, the Court explained that great difficulties arise when courts attempt to determine damages caused by attenuated actions. For example, in this case, National could have lowered its prices for numerous reasons unrelated to the asserted fraud. Conversely, Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than National's alleged RICO violation. Secondly, the direct causal connection requirement is especially warranted where the direct victims of the RICO violation can pursue their own claim. Here, the State of New York could file suit and in that situation, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> easier for a court to calculate New York's damages. Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court reversed the Second Circuit's holding that Ideal had satisfied the proximate cause requirement under its section 1962(c) claim.|$|E
25|$|The young Clarence {{attended}} Allegheny College and the University of Michigan Law School, {{but did not}} {{graduate from}} either institution. He attended Allegheny College for only one year before the Panic of 1873 struck, and Darrow {{was determined not to}} be a financial burden to his father any longer. Over the next three years he taught in the winter at the district school in a country community. While teaching, Darrow started to study the law on his own, {{and by the end of}} his third year of teaching, his family urged him to enter the law department at Ann Arbor. Darrow only studied there a year when he decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more cost-effective to work and study in an actual law office. When he felt that he was ready, he took the Ohio bar exam and passed. He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1878. The Clarence Darrow Octagon House, his childhood home in Kinsman, contains a memorial to him.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, I Love Lucy was re-tailored into {{an hour-long}} show {{originally}} titled The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show {{that was to}} be part of an anthology series called the Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse. The hour-long Lucy-Desi show was to alternate on a monthly basis with other hour long Playhouse shows. The new series put a much heavier emphasis on big name guest stars as being part of the plot and although the Mertz characters continued into the new series, their roles became somewhat diminished. Although a lighter workload was welcomed by Frawley, Vance came to somewhat resent the change. Arnaz, in an effort to please Vance, for whom he had much respect, proposed doing a spin-off from I Love Lucy called The Mertzes. Seeing a lucrative opportunity and the chance to star in his own show, Frawley was enthused. Vance, however, declined for a number of reasons, the biggest factor being that she felt she and Frawley could barely work together on the ensemble show they were doing at the time, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> less likely the two could work together on their own series. Vance also felt that the Mertz characters would not be as successful without the Ricardos to play-off each other, and despite being her biggest success, she was becoming interested in playing more glamorous roles rather than Ethel. In fact, during the thirteen-episode run of the Lucy-Desi hour-long shows, Vance was given a lot more latitude to look more attractive as Ethel Mertz, something she was denied during the run of the I Love Lucy episodes. Frawley's resentment of Vance intensified after she declined to do the spin-off show and the two rarely talked to each other outside of their characters' dialogue with one another.|$|E

Chi is voiced by Rie Tanaka in the anime and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The manga and anime follow Hideki's find of Chi and their relationship, but differ in the storyline.

500|$|The story, {{sometimes}} told through in-game dialogue, {{is pushed}} forward with comic panels that play during cut scenes. The developers found comic panels {{to be more}} effective and less costly to use in the cut scenes than fully animated cinematics. They also noted that comic panels forced the player to interpret each panel for themselves, and [...] "the nuances are there in the head of the reader [...] <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> harder to reach that level with in-game or even prerendered cinematics." [...] The developers also found it easier to reorganize the comic panels if the plot needed to be changed while developing the game.|$|E

500|$|The GRC scheme {{has been}} criticized as {{weakening}} the candidate–voter relationship, because {{it may be more}} difficult for voters to feel that candidates actually represent them when {{there are a number of}} candidates in a team to vote for. Most voters elect MPs whom they can identify with and are better able to represent their interests. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> easier for voters to identify with a single candidate than with a team of, say, four individuals. Also, since there will be key vote pullers in every GRC, the unknown or unpopular candidate is [...] "dragged into Parliament on the coat-tails of the major vote-puller". This alienates the electorate from its representatives, thereby undermining the idea of representation. Since the people [...] "cannot clearly identify themselves with the candidates ... responsibility for choices cannot be ascribed to the people".|$|E
500|$|In 1786, Charles III of Spain {{provided}} a library and laboratory to Pierre-François Chabaneau {{to aid in}} his research of platinum. Chabaneau succeeded in removing various impurities from the ore, including gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron. This led him {{to believe he was}} working with a single metal, but in truth the ore still contained the yet-undiscovered platinum-group metals. This led to inconsistent results in his experiments. At times, the platinum seemed malleable, but when it was alloyed with iridium, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more brittle. Sometimes the metal was entirely incombustible, but when alloyed with osmium, it would volatilize. After several months, Chabaneau succeeded in producing 23kilograms of pure, malleable platinum by hammering and compressing the sponge form while white-hot. Chabeneau realized the infusibility of platinum would lend value to objects made of it, and so started a business with Joaquín Cabezas producing platinum ingots and utensils. This started {{what is known as the}} [...] "platinum age" [...] in Spain.|$|E
500|$|Illinois Representative Chauncey Reed had {{introduced}} the Elgin coin legislation at Rovelstad's behest, {{and both the}} sculptor and Hoffecker worked with him to advance the bill through Congress. [...] In February 1936, Hoffecker, who had been appointed by ANA President T. James Clarke to lead a committee against abuses in the issuance of commemorative coins, went to Washington, passing through Chicago {{on his way to}} visit Rovelstad. [...] The two men had hoped to keep the mintage to 10,000, to be able to sell the coins at a higher price. [...] Congress, however, was not minded to create a low-mintage commemorative, as there had been several issues which had been struck in small numbers only to sell at high prices, and the bill was amended to provide for 25,000 half dollars. Hoffecker hoped to lower the number, urging the sculptor to lobby for a decrease. [...] Hoffecker noted <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more work to sell 25,000, and they could not command as high a price. There were a large number of commemorative coin bills in Congress in 1936, and the dealer feared that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would start vetoing them. [...] Hoffecker visited Washington twice more in May, once meeting Rovelstad there, where they lobbied members of Congress.|$|E

500|$|Thurstan gave land {{to many of}} {{the churches}} of his diocese and founded several {{religious}} houses. He founded the first nunnery in Yorkshire when he founded St Clement's between 1125 and 1133. He obtained for Whitby Abbey a papal privilege of protection as well as giving his own privilege to the abbey. He also helped found the Cistercian Abbey of Fountains, by giving the site to monks who had been expelled from the Abbey of St. Mary's, York. Thurstan helped the hermitess Christina of Markyate at several points in her career, and tried to persuade her to become the first prioress of his foundation of St. Clement's. He was a patron to the Augustinian Hexham Priory, founded by his predecessor at York, as well as helping the foundation of Bridlington Priory, another Augustinian house. He was a sincere reformer, and opposed to the election of unfit men to the episcopacy. When Pope Innocent II asked Thurstan's opinion on the elevation of Anselm of St Saba, who was Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds, to become Bishop of London, Thurstan replied [...] "If we consider his life and reputation, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more fitting to remove him from his abbacy than to promote him to be bishop of London."

500|$|No Saudi women's {{national}} football {{team will be}} competing at the 2012 London Olympics, despite extensive pressure from the International Olympic Committee. Still, in 2012, the national federation was quietly arguing with the International Football Association Board not to allow women's participation if they were wearing the hijab while playing. The logic they followed was that if FIFA allowed women to wear the hijab in recognised matches, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{more difficult for the}} federation to prevent a national team from being created. There is a lot of pressure being put on the sporting community to allow for national representation of women on the international team as the kingdom will likely be the last nation in the world to prohibit women from competing at the Olympics. If the Saudis can successfully argue the hijab cannot be worn in competition, it would make them less isolated internationally as other teams in the Arab world {{would be less likely to}} compete in the upcoming FIFA Women's Under-17 World Cup.
