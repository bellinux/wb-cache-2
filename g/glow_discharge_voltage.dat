At lower currents, the voltage across the tube is almost current-independent; this is used in <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>voltage</b> stabilizers. At lower currents, {{the area of the}} electrodes covered by the glow discharge is proportional to the current. At higher currents the normal glow turns into abnormal glow, the voltage across the tube gradually increases, and the glow discharge covers {{more and more of the}} surface of the electrodes. Low-power switching (glow-discharge thyratrons), voltage stabilization, and lighting applications (e.g. Nixie tubes, decatrons, neon lamps) operate in this region.|$|E

The X-rays were recorded during the Glow Discharge operation and after the Glow Discharge current switch off. Presumably the observed X-ray emission proceeds {{as a result of}} relaxation of excited energetic levels in the cathode solid medium. These excited levels are formed during the exposure of the cathode sample solid surface to the effect of the ions flux produced by plasma or electrolyte medium. The energetic and temporal characteristics of the X-ray emission have been studied with reference to the cathode material used, the kind of plasma-forming gas and the Glow Discharge operational parameters.
