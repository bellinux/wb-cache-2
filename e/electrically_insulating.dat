25|$|AlN {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1877, {{but it was}} not until the middle of the 1980s that its potential for application in microelectronics was realized due to its relatively high thermal conductivity for an <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> ceramic (70–210 W·m−1·K−1 for polycrystalline material, and as high as 285 W·m−1·K−1 for single crystals).|$|E
25|$|On the anode side, {{hydrogen}} diffuses to the anode catalyst {{where it}} later dissociates into protons and electrons.

The protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode, but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit (supplying power) because the membrane is <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating.</b> On the cathode catalyst, oxygen molecules react with the electrons (which have traveled through the external circuit) and protons to form water.|$|E

25|$|If the {{environment}} is controlled (especially in recirculating systems), corrosion inhibitors can often be added to it. These chemicals form an <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces, to suppress electrochemical reactions. Such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating, since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed. Chemicals that inhibit corrosion include some of the salts in hard water (Roman water systems are famous for their mineral deposits), chromates, phosphates, polyaniline, other conducting polymers and {{a wide range of}} specially-designed chemicals that resemble surfactants (i.e. long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups).|$|E
25|$|The HVAC {{system uses}} an AC {{induction}} motor {{to drive a}} sealed-system scroll compressor, a design principle not usually used in automotive applications. Using a scroll compressor increases {{the efficiency of the}} system, while driving it with an AC induction motor makes the system more flexible, so the AC can run while the engine is off. Because the oil used with the refrigerant gas also flows {{in the area of the}} high-voltage motor-windings, the fluid must be <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> to avoid transmitting electric current to exposed metal parts of the system. Therefore, Toyota specifies a POE oil (designated ND11) is required for repairs. The system cannot be serviced with equipment normally employed for regular cars, which typically use PAG oils, as the equipment would contaminate the ND11 oil with PAG oil. According to SAE J2843 the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1% PAG when filling. One percent PAG oil may result in an electrical resistance drop by a factor of about 10.|$|E
500|$|In 2014 {{researchers}} {{discovered that}} sodium bismuthide can {{exist as a}} form of matter called a “three-dimensional topological Dirac semi-metal” (3DTDS) that possess 3D Dirac fermions in bulk.
