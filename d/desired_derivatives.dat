Starting from a local model of the signal consisting of a truncated Taylor expansion, we express, through adequate differential algebraic manipulations, the <b>desired</b> partial <b>derivative</b> {{as a function of}} iterated integrals of the noisy signal. Iterated integrals provide noise filtering. The presented method leads to a family of estimators for each partial derivative of any order. We present a detailed study of some structural properties given in terms of recurrence relations between elements of a same family. These properties are next used to study the performance of the estimators. We show that some differential algebraic manipulations corresponding to a particular family of estimators leads implicitly to an orthogonal projection of the <b>desired</b> <b>derivative</b> in a Jacobi polynomial basis functions, yielding an interpretation in terms of the popular least squares. This interpretation allows one to 1) explain the presence of a spacial delay inherent to the estimators and 2) derive an explicit formula for the delay. We also show how one can devise, by a proper combination of different elementary estimators of a given order derivative, an estimator giving a delay of any prescribed value. The simulation results show that delay-free estimators are sensitive to noise. Robustness with respect to noise can be highly increased by utilizing voluntary-delayed estimators. A numerical implementation scheme is given in the form of finite impulse response digital filters. The effectiveness of our derivative estimators is attested by several numerical simulations...|$|R

However, commonly used approximate density functionals produce total energies that do not exhibit this piecewise-linear behavior. As a result, the ionization potential theorem, equating the highest occupied eigenvalue with the ionization potential, is grossly disobeyed. Here, we show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, most of the required piecewise-linearity of an arbitrary approximate density functional can be restored by careful consideration of the ensemble generalization of DFT. Furthermore, the resulting formulation introduces the <b>desired</b> <b>derivative</b> discontinuity to any approximate exchange-correlation functional, even one that is explicitly density-dependent. This opens the door to calculations of the ionization potential and electron affinity even without explicit electron removal or addition. All these advances are achieved while neither introducing empiricism nor changing the underlying functional form.
