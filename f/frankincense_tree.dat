These forests are the most threatened and least protected forests due to expansion of agriculture and pasture lands, unregulated grazing, forest fire, unregulated collection of wood and other forest products. Dry forests of Ethiopia are heavily affected by such human induced factors. The iconic Boswellia papyrifera (Del.) Hochst is a dominant tree species of this forest and the principal source of the globally traded frankincense. The species lacks regeneration in all forests evaluated so far. Frankincense forests in relatively wetter dry land areas with little or no human related disturbance are not evaluated so far. Here we quantified the regeneration status of the <b>frankincense</b> <b>tree</b> in such areas and evaluated these forests in comparison to non-regenerating frankincense forests elsewhere. We surveyed two-ha plots in each of five districts in Benishangul Gumuz Region, Western Ethiopia. The <b>frankincense</b> <b>tree</b> populations showed two different regeneration patterns: inverse J-shaped and bell-shaped pattern. The presence of regenerating populations in three of our study areas is in sharp contrast to all earlier studies on this species. The healthy regeneration might be related with the availability of more favourable conditions such as better precipitation, lower levels of anthropogenic disturbances and younger ages of the three woodlands. These unique, regenerating <b>frankincense</b> <b>tree</b> populations need recognition and should be delineated as priority areas for conservation, which includes their role as source of genetic material.

40|$|Resin {{production}} in trees probably depends on trade-offs within the tree, its environment and on tapping activities. Frankincense, the highly esteemed resin from dry woodland <b>frankincense</b> <b>trees</b> of Boswellia papyrifera is exploited in traditional ways for millennia. New exploitation practices lead to weak trees and non-sustainable resin production. For 500 trees from four populations of B. papyrifera we evaluated how frankincense yield {{is affected by}} different tapping intensities (number of incision spots) and frequencies (number of resin collection rounds during the dry season), since both {{of them have been}} intensified recently. These effects are considered for trees of different size, since larger trees probably provide more resources for resin production. We predicted that frankincense production would initially increase with tapping intensity and tapping frequency, but later level-off because of resin depletion. Frankincense production varied highly: yield per tree per year of all 500 monitored trees averaged 261 g (± 231, but largely varied and ranged from 41 to 1829 g. We indeed found that resin yield increased with tapping intensity, but not anymore beyond an intensity of 6 – 9 incision spots. Yield peaked around the seventh collection round, and declined thereafter. Yield increased with trunk diameter, but leveled-off beyond trees with a stem diameter of > 20 cm. These patterns were similar across populations, and between contrasting areas. Our results suggest that high tapping intensity risks short-term resource depletion, warranting tuning down the intensity of the current collection practices. Less intense tapping rounds per season will reduce damage, increase the health of tree populations, and contribute to long term frankincense production. This study thus allows for developing less damaging and more sustainable management for <b>frankincense</b> <b>trees...</b>|$|R
50|$|Frankincense is tapped {{from the}} scraggy but hardy trees by {{slashing}} the bark, {{which is called}} striping, and allowing the exuded resin to bleed out and harden. These hardened resins are called tears.There are several species and varieties of <b>frankincense</b> <b>trees,</b> each producing a slightly different type of resin. Differences in soil and climate create even more diversity of the resin, even within the same species. Boswellia sacra trees are considered unusual {{for their ability to}} grow in environments so unforgiving that they sometimes grow out of solid rock. The initial means of attachment to the rock is unknown, but is accomplished by a bulbous disk-like swelling of the trunk. This growth prevents it from being ripped from the rock during violent storms. This feature is slight or absent in trees grown in rocky soil or gravel. The trees start producing resin when they are about eight to 10 years old. Tapping is done two to three times a year with the final taps producing the best tears due to their higher aromatic terpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene content. Generally speaking, the more opaque resins are the best quality. Fine resin is produced in Somalia, from which the Roman Catholic Church purchases most of its stock.|$|R

Against this background, a study was carried out to investigate the species current population structure and tree morphology in five Boswellia areas along an altitude gradient (range 800 - 2000 m a. s. l.). In each area sample plots of 20 by 20 m were inventoried; a total of 144 plots were studied.

40|$|Carbohydrates {{fixed by}} {{photosynthesis}} {{are stored in}} plant organs {{in the form of}} starch or sugars. Starch and sugars sum to the total non-structural carbohydrate pool (TNC) and may serve as intermediate pools between assimilation and utilization. We examined the impact of tapping on TNC concentrations in stem-wood, bark and root tissues of the <b>frankincense</b> <b>tree</b> (Boswellia papyrifera (Del.) Hochst) in two natural woodlands of Ethiopia. Two tapping treatments, one without tapping (control) and the other with tapping at 12 incisions, are applied on experimental trees. Trees are tapped in the leafless dry period, diminishing their carbon storage pools. If storage pools are not refilled by assimilation during the wet season, when crowns are in full leaf, tapping may deplete the carbon pool and weaken Boswellia trees. The highest soluble sugar concentrations were in the bark and the highest starch concentrations in the stem-wood. The stem-wood contains 12 times higher starch than soluble sugar concentrations. Hence, the highest TNC concentrations occurred in the stem-wood. Moreover, wood volume was larger than root or bark volumes and, as a result, more TNC was stored in the stem-wood. As predicted, tapping reduced the TNC concentrations and pool sizes in frankincense trees during the dry season. During the wet season, these carbon pools were gradually filled in tapped trees, but never to the size of non-tapped trees. We conclude that TNC is dynamic on a seasonal time scale and offers resilience against stress, highlighting its importance for tree carbon balance. But current resin tapping practices are intensive and may weaken Boswellia populations, jeopardizing future frankincense production...|$|E
40|$|Boswellia papyrifera Hochst. is {{the most}} {{important}} global source of <b>frankincense.</b> <b>Tree</b> numbers are rapidly decreasing in many populations of B. papyrifera in Ethiopia, where most of the internationally traded frankincense comes from. Improper tapping is among the frequently mentioned reasons for this decrease within populations. We still lack sustainable techniques for frankincense tapping, and these techniques are not yet tuned to individual trees since we are unaware how tree characteristics influence frankincense yield. This study investigates the relationships between different tree characteristics and their relation to frankincense yield. We selected 53 trees and measured frankincense yield and their DBH, tree age, number of leaf apices, radial growth, bark thickness, total resin-canal area, and total number of resin canals in a cross-section. Regression and path analysis were used to unravel cause-effect relationships between tree characteristics and frankincense yield. Frankincense yield was independent of the actual radial growth rate, but increased with increasing total resin-canal area in the bark, stem diameter, tree age, and the number of leaf apices. We show that frankincense yield by trees is not only a simple function of tree size. Remarkably, trees that grew slower over their whole life history produced more frankincense, suggesting an intra-specific trade-off in growth rate and frankincense production. Overall, this study thus shows that frankincense production is the result of complex plant trait networks and long term tree life properties. The results contribute to management regimes that minimize the damage to trees, while maximizing benefits in terms of frankincense yield and can also be used for selection and propagation of trees which are well suited for frankincense production. </p...|$|E

40|$|Frankincense, a much revered non-timber {{forest product}} (NTFP) known as luban in Oman, is a {{gum-resin}} extracted from Boswellia sacra (meqerot). In Oman, B. sacra is endemic to ecological zones in and around Dhofar's southern mountain ranges of Jabal Samhan, Jabal Qamar and Jabal Qara. Hojar (Samhan Nejd), Nejd (Qara Nejd), Shazr (Qamar Nejd) and Sha'b are the four B. sacra ecological zones. A suffix (i) after the name (i. e. Hojari or Samhan Nejdi) {{is indicative of the}} luban produced in or associated with the respective zone. Traditional Omani B. sacra ownership, management, organization, and frankincense extraction are based on a land parcel system known as menzela. The 1970 's oil boom attracted rural labor to urban and oil operation centers in Dhofar and other provinces, thus creating a labor shortage that had a profound transformative impact on frankincense production. This transformation caused frankincense extraction to evolve from an Omani-controlled system to a Somali-dominated hybrid system. Migrant Somali harvesters predominantly control the production and processing of frankincense in the field. Similarly, wholesalers occupy the next rung up the production ladder are the most powerful players in the frankincense industry. Dhofar {{has a long history of}} {{non-timber forest product}} (NTFP) extraction. From April to mid-June 1999, luban production in the Hojari/Nejdi zone of the study area was estimated at 8, 710 kg with a seasonal projection of 24, 840 kg- 30, 360 kg.

This study is aimed at estimating frankincense yield in a single production year, assessing the relationship between yield and dendrometric variables, and developing predictive yield models. We collected data of one harvesting season from randomly selected sample trees in an exclosure and a free grazing site. We found strong nonlinear relations between yield and dendrometric variables, which are useful for predictive yield modeling.

The frankincense yield was larger in the exclosure than in the adjacent free grazing site and the difference was statistically significant.

40|$|Keywords: Boswellian papyrifera, <b>Frankincense</b> <b>tree,</b> matrix model, {{population}} dynamics, population bottleneck, tapping. Combretum – Terminalia woodlands and Acacia – Commiphora woodlands {{are the two}} dominant vegetation {{types that}} cover {{large parts of the}} dry land areas in Ethiopia. Several of their tree and shrub species yield economically valuable products such as gum Arabic, frankincense and myrrh. Boswellia papyrifera provides the widely traded frankincense that accounts for > 80 % of the export revenues that the country is earning from gum and resin resources. Unfortunately, the Ethiopian dry woodlands and the B. papyrifera populations are disappearing rapidly due to the combined effects of over-harvesting gums and resins, overgrazing by livestock, recurrent fires, and excessive wood harvesting. The current lack of small saplings in the remaining populations of Boswellia suggests that the populations may not be sustained for the future. The main objectives of this thesis were to determine diversity and production patterns in B. papyrifera dominated dry woodlands, to show the regeneration status in various B. papyrifera populations, and to evaluate the effects of environment, frankincense harvesting, and grazing on the population dynamics of B. papyrifera. The main research questions were: (1) how do environmental conditions affect the tree/shrub species richness and production of Ethiopian dry woodlands? (2) what factors determine the frankincense production by B. papyrifera trees? (3) how do the vital rates and population dynamics of B. papyrifera vary across habitats that differ in soil conditions and biotic factors? (4) What are the major bottlenecks in the life cycle of the trees that hinder the sustainability of the remaining populations? To address these questions, tree populations were studied in the highlands of Abergelle and the lowlands of Metema. Metema also has a longer wet season length, higher annual rainfall and better soil fertility status than Abergelle. In total 36 and 22 tree and shrub species representing 20 and 9 families were recorded in Metema and Abergelle woodlands, respectively. The most dominant plant families were Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Combretaceae and Anacardiaceae. The vegetation at both sites was dominated by B. papyrifera. The two sites differed in species richness, diversity and production. Metema, the site with the longer wet season, had a higher species richness, diversity and production than Abergelle. The productivity of woodlands also increased with a higher clay content and greater soil depth. Populations structures indeed lacked the saplings, except for one very isolated population on a steep mountain slope. The studied frankincense trees produced 41 to 840 gram of frankincense during a year with seven collection rounds, and 185 to 1826 gram of frankincense during a year with 14 collection rounds. The variation in frankincense production was large across individuals. Frankincense production increased with tree size, tapping intensity, and tapping frequency. The increase in production, however, levelled-off beyond a stem diameter of 20 cm, a tapping intensity of 9 spots, and a tapping intensity of 10 rounds. Growth rate, survival rate and fruiting probability varied across populations, but were not related to soil conditions or biotic factors. The growth rates of the 12 Metema populations varied between 0. 86 to 0. 98, suggesting that they were all decreasing. Matrix model analyses indicated that the mortality of adult trees was the major bottleneck for sustainable population growth, and that the lack of sapling recruitment was a second major bottleneck. These bottlenecks appear both in tapped and non-tapped stands. Remarkably, tapped stand showed higher growth rates than nontapped stands, probably because productive stands were selected for harvesting resin. All results suggest that the remaining populations of B. papyrifera will disappear in the near future if the current situation continues. Frankincense production is expected to halve in 15 - 20 years. Unexpectedly, tapping had no negative effect on vital rates, nor on population growth rates indicating that other factors are responsible for the decline of the populations. Adult mortality by insect infestation and windfall, and the negative impact of grazing and fire on the establishment of saplings need extra attention. Management should be directed towards releasing two major population bottlenecks (improve sapling regeneration, reduce adult mortability) to maintain the Boswellia populations and frankincense production in the future.  ...|$|E

In fungal communities, five major phyla were found with significantly higher abundance of Ascomycota (60. 3 %) in wild population and Basidiomycota (52 %) in cultivated tree rhizospheres. Among bacterial communities, 31 major phyla were found, with significant distribution of Actinobacteria in wild tree rhizospheres, whereas Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were highly abundant in cultivated trees. The diversity and abundance of microbiome varied significantly depending upon soil characteristics of the three different populations. In addition, significantly higher glucosidases, cellulases and indole- 3 -acetic acid were found in cultivated tree's rhizospheres as compared to wild tree populations. for these plants to survive the harsh arid-land environmental conditions. The current study is a first comprehensive work and advances our knowledge about the core fungal and bacterial microbial microbiome associated with this economically important tree...|$|R
40|$|Cuboid incense burners {{were first}} {{identified}} as räucherkästchen or smoking-burning boxes, by the German archaeologist Robert Koldewey in the 1901 Deutsche Orient- Gesellschaft excavation season at Babylon. This dissertation examines {{the form and}} function of a catalogued assemblage of excavated incense burners from southern Mesopotamia, Arabia and the Levant from 2250 BC at R’as al-Jinz {{until the end of}} the First Millennium BC. The study argues that the form of the four-legged incense burner was bi-directionally exchanged along overland trade routes to the west, and through seafaring routes via the Arabian Gulf and the Euphrates River to the east. From every quadrant of the Middle East, their local reproduction was an attempt to emulate räucherkästchen indigenous to the Arabian Peninsula under the economic guise of Mesopotamian empires controlling the 2 ̆ 2 invisible 2 ̆ 2 yet lucrative trade in aromatic gum- resins. After first presenting the historical background to the ancient Near East for trading frankincense and all kinds of aromatics from the Third through the late First Millennium BC, a new typological standard for portable cuboid burners from the Levant and Mesopotamia is evaluated through the lens of the types of incense burners that were available from Southeastern Arabia. In the final section, the investigation concludes with ethnographic analogies collected by the author from the Dhofar, the southernmost region of the Sultanate of Oman, where <b>frankincense</b> (Boswellia-sacra) <b>trees</b> are cultivated. This region, where environmental factors favor the development of a domestic ceramic specialization, is also known for its terra-cotta cuboid incense burners [mibkhara/mibakhirah; majmar/maj amirah], which are crafted today in a similar form and style as in the Pre-Islamic past. From interviews conducted on the ground, potters revealed important information on how they crafted incense burners from local clays, using wooden tools to impress geometric patterns culled from the architectural surroundings onto the central fields of view, the most important spaces of the cuboid incense burners. From such evidence, it was concluded that the iconic legacy of the incense burner in the Arabian Peninsula today attests to the importance of this manifold artifact-type as a holdover of domestic material culture whose fumigation functions were multifaceted in antiquity. ...|$|R
40|$|Nabataean {{civilisation}} and {{the topic}} of their technology has been a subject of debate {{as long as the}} re-discovery of the ancient city of Petra in 1803 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. 	The Nabataeans thrived in the deserted regions of today’s Israeli and Jordanian deserts by the usage of an elaborate water supply technology that was perfectly suited for their idea of life in the hostile environment. Water tanks and cisterns hidden in plain sight accumulated water during rainstorms. The same water was later used by travelling Bedouins. Their travel frequently involved conquering thousands of kilometres in order to exchange goods, considered exotic and high in value. The knowledge of hidden water basins and their water storing capabilities gave them a rather big advantage in terms of speed and travel safety. This work aims to describe the ideas and technology that the Nabataeans acquired, additionally trying to identify the source of those ideas whether to pin point their origin as completely self-created or largely influenced from different earlier existing cultures. 	The Nabataean Kingdom was established during the early 1 st century B. C. as a loose conglomerate of nomadic tribes that engaged in the so -called Frankincense trade. During its lifetime, it {{became one of the most}} prominent players on the political and economic spectrum of the Arabian world. Described by Strabo in his Georaphica as a tribe of wealthy desert farers Nabataeans became Roman vassals sometime in the 1 st century B. C. until the kingdom was disbanded after the death of its last monarch Rabbel the second in the year of 107 A. D. Organised society became even more creative and further advanced their technology. The entire mountainside of the city in Rock called by the ancients Petra was transformed by skilled architects to work as a water collecting vessel. Several tunnels and aqueducts were created for this sole purpose. The world-famous tourist attraction – The Petrean Siq is one of the fruits of this enterprise. Presented paper was divided into several different chapters with the aim of presenting the Nabataean tribe, its history and technological advancements in the field of water gathering and distribution to provide a greater context of its importance for this region. One chapter focused on the history of the archaeological framework done during the almost 200 years of European re-discovery of the region. Divided into two significant sections with focuses on different time periods of Arabian archaeology. The explorers section describes the bios of different names of the most prominent early explorers of the region like Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, Alois Musil and Thomas Edward Lawrence. All of them thoroughly engaged in the history and lifestyle of the region. Second part engages with the work of more modern archaeologists whose fields of expertise include Nabataean water supply technologies but also a different and wider spectrum of additional archaeological work. Sections on climate and geology provide additional understanding on how the Nabataean technology utilizes the natural properties of rocks and soil. Chapter Water Management Systems in different time periods of the Nabataean Kingdom provides a breakdown of known Nabataean technology between the 4 th century B. C. and the 4 th century A. D. Starting from the Early Bronze Age where we can find traces of people setting up different technological ideas for water capture. Beginning with the usual rock cut ponds that were very prone to water evaporation like the Thamila till the more advanced concepts like wadi terracing and underground water tunnels. With the beginning of the Iron Age technological advancement appeared in the shape of an upgrade that has been done to the water collection basins. Cisterns and water reservoirs littered the desert. Cut in the bedrock and waterproofed by hydraulic mortar they could have stored water for several months. This became a serious breakthrough for the prosperity of the later Nabataean people. Sabaean chapter focuses on a short history of the Sabaean people. A trading nation very much like the Nabataeans. They inhabited the region of today’s country of Yemen and engaged in the very profitable frankincense trade. Growing of the <b>frankincense</b> <b>trees</b> and trying to live in a very hostile environment of the Arabian Peninsula desert prompted the industrious Sabaeans to create and further develop their own water supply technology. Many of such constructions like to world famous Ma’rib Dam stands as a testament to that notion. Many of the Negev and Jordanian desert Bedouins engaged in desert faring trade with the Sabaeans. Their frequent excursions could be one of the elements that weighted very heavily on their knowledge of water supply facilities. Further Chapters go in depth about the water supply technology that the Nabataeans used and further developed over the years. Explaining the intricacies of how do they work and presenting their probable roots. The last chapter consists of Archaeological evidence segregated by country (Israel or Jordan) presenting the most important sites for the Nabataean culture...|$|R
40|$|Boswellia papyrifera (Del.) Hochst is a {{multipurpose}} deciduous {{tree species}} with high economic, cultural and environmental values. <b>Frankincense</b> from this <b>tree</b> species is a traded commodity {{used in the}} pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and chemical industries, for clerical services in different religions, and as a fragrance during coffee ceremonies in Ethiopia. However, the resource has been declining due to unsustainable management, which includes shifting to crop cultivation, free grazing and indiscriminate cutting of leaves for livestock feeding, and overtapping for frankincense. This study aims at: a) assessing the effects of leaf lopping for fodder, tapping for frankincense, and free grazing on the biophysical state of Boswellia papyrifera forests of Ethiopia, b) assessing the stocks of biomass and soil organic carbon in Boswellia papyrifera forests, c) evaluating the trade-offs between conservation, production forestry, and shifting to crop cultivation, d) assessing rural households demand for conserving the forest, and e) identifying the role of frankincense forests on rural livelihood and poverty reduction. The dissertation is a multidisciplinary piece of work based mainly on primary data from plot level experiments and a household survey conducted in five villages with Boswellia papyrifera forests in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. For analysing these biophysical and socio-economic data, a number of statistical and econometric models are applied, which include: multilevel linear mixed model, the standard allometric model, the model of environmental cost benefit analysis, the double-bound dichotomous contingent valuation method, and standard impact assessment parametric and non-parametric econometric models. We found that leaf cutting caused significant declines in frankincense yield, and production of inflorescence and fruits. Tapping showed a significant positive impact on frankincense yield, {{but there was no}} evidence of a significant difference between tapped and untapped trees in terms of flowering and fruiting. Some environmental variables like altitude, soil depth and nutrient content also significantly affect <b>tree</b> productivity. Interestingly <b>frankincense</b> yield, flower and fruit production significantly differ in relation to the bark colour that would be used as an indicator of tree fitness. The allometric model AGB = 0. 061 (DBH) 2. 353 predicts the above ground biomass carbon in Boswellia papyrifera forest with an average bias of less than 2 %. The stored carbon in Boswellia papyrifera forests was about 44 Mg ha- 1 of which nearly 78 % was accounted by soil organic carbon and fenced plots had more concentrations of carbon and nutrients in the soil than unfenced plots. Given the economic and ecological importance of this species and the limited data on biomass and carbon stock especially in dry forests of Africa, the findings are useful for biomass and carbon stock estimation, and for assessing the implications of land use change on carbon emissions. Moreover, it is also important for validating existing generalized allometric models, which mostly lack evidence from Africas dry forest. The cost benefit analysis assesses the economic benefits and costs of six frankincense forest management options that range from conservation in the form of exclosure to the business as usual scenario that involves free grazing, leaf lopping and intensive frankincense tapping. The Net Present Values of almost all the forestry options are negative if the benefits from carbon and nutrient storage services are excluded indicating that direct benefits from frankincense forests are less than the benefits from the competing land use. Moreover, as shifting cultivation is the competing land use in the study area, estimates of the opportunity costs of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) specific to the forest were also provided. Accordingly, pure conservation of the forest could result in emission reduction of about 142 tons of CO 2 per hectare at an opportunity cost of about 33 USD per ton of CO 2 emission reduction. About 80 % of this opportunity cost is incurred by rural people in the form of forgone net benefits from not converting the forest to cropland through shifting cultivation. The contingent valuation study aims at assessing local evidence on whether any conservation intervention will be welcomed by rural people in the Boswellia forest areas. Accordingly, the study assessed the rural households willingness to pay and willingness to contribute labour for Boswellia papyrifera forest conservation. We found that next to the bid level, willingness to pay is influenced most by income and education, and willingness to contribute labour is significantly affected by size of family labour and gender of the household head. A household is willing to pay at least about 5 USD per year or contribute almost one week of free labour per year, which amounts to close to 7 USD valued at per capita daily income of the households. The potential local demand for conservation of Boswellia papyrifera forest could be mobilized effectively with complementary policy interventions aimed at sustainable use and poverty reduction. Recently there is a considerable debate on the role of non-timber forest products on poverty alleviation. The study on the impact of frankincense membership on rural income and poverty contributes to the empirical literature on the role of organized access to a traded non-timber forest product on rural livelihood and poverty reduction. In the past, rural households in northern Ethiopia had no access to frankincense production and trading. With recent developments in the region, rural households are getting access to the harvesting of frankincense through organizing cooperatives. We analysed the income and poverty effects of rural frankincense cooperative firms and the results indicate that both membership as a binary variable and amount of households investment on shares in the cooperative firms have significant positive welfare impacts in terms of increasing householdincome and reducing rural poverty. The negative impact of leaf looping on the trees capacity to produce frankincense, fruits and flowers as well as the negative net present values of all the forestry alternative management options indicate that the forest is in a very high risk of continuous degradation and perpetuation of what is called a tragedy of the commons. Thus, conservation and sustainable management practices should be in place to increase the resources competitiveness and hence avoid its degradation. This could be possible through interventions that can make developments in alternative livestock feed productions, through creating favorable conditions for the development of businesses that can add value to the frankincense, which is now exported as a raw material, and with the introduction of the other ecosystem service benefits of the resource like development of bee keeping and ecotourism. Moreover, the participation of rural communities both in the conservation and sharing of benefits from the resource are very crucial in future conservation and management interventions as it has been confirmed from the results of the contingent valuation on rural households demand for conservation as well as the results from the impact evaluation. However, further research is required on assessing the resource base at a wider spatial scale, on whether bark color of the tree is a genetic or phenotypic phenomenon affecting tree productivity, and also on the problems associated with legal and institutional frameworks in the use and management of Boswellia papyrifera forests in Ethiopia.
