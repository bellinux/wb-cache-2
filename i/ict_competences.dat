Refusal of CBA is more frequent than lack of <b>ICT</b> <b>competences</b> in many countries, but {{the relative importance of}} each explanation does not depend on the educational career. For this reason and given that the lack of ICT competence is likely to induce refusal of CBA, in the following analysis we will treat PSTRE proficiency as a single outcome, without distinguishing between the two sources.|$|E
40|$|Since its founding, ICTs {{have formed}} an {{integral}} part of the educational activity of the UOC. From the outset, the university designed a specific, cross-programme course on digital literacy that has been evolving ever since in line with the needs of its students. The current basis of the course are the central <b>ICT</b> <b>competences</b> inspired by the Declaration of Bologna (Guitert & Romeu, 2008; Romero et al., 2010). The <b>ICT</b> <b>Competences</b> course uses a project-based working methodology to facilitate the progressive acquisition of <b>ICT</b> <b>competences.</b> Our current research is part of a wider research project that seeks to develop an evidence-based understanding of our students' opinions of the <b>ICT</b> <b>competences</b> course and how this could be improved by taking into account the perspective of learners. One of the specific aims of this research is to describe how the time factor affects the collaborative learning activities carried out on the course, taking into account descriptive research using the survey as a data-gathering tool. The data gathered demonstrate that the time factor is a key element in the development of collaborative online learning activities, where the best rated are those related to competences. By analysing the effect of an individuals' time planning on the group planning, we ensure that, in the view of the students, the first one allows the second to become a reality; it also contributes to the successful completion of the course project...|$|E

40|$|The {{passage from}} {{secondary}} school to university puts {{students in an}} environment with different expectations. Not only the expectations towards learning might change, but also towards <b>ICT</b> <b>competences</b> and computer use. The {{purpose of this article}} is to ﬁnd out whether freshmen, after 6 months at the university, changed their self-perception of <b>ICT</b> <b>competences</b> and computer use in comparison with their behaviour at secondary school, and what factors can explain the self-perception of <b>ICT</b> <b>competences</b> and computer use in secondary school, in the university and their possible change. Based on a panel research among 714 freshmen of a large university, this article answers the following questions: (1) What is the self-perception of <b>ICT</b> <b>competences</b> among freshmen and is there a change in this self-perception 6 months after entering the university? (2) How often and for what purpose do freshmen use a computer and is there a change in the frequency of the use of a computer? (3) What factors might inﬂuence this attitude, behaviour, and possible change? In function of the basic components of Uniﬁed Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, & Davis, 2003) hypotheses was developed and tested to answer these questions. Students who consider the computer to be a useful instrument, have control over the computer, possess a certain level of Internet competence, and are at ease with computers are more likely to have the skills needed to maintain a computer, to develop a web site, and to use basic ICT skills. The predictors have little inﬂuence on Internet usage. The same predictors contribute modestly to the explanation of the different frequencies of computer use, and a few of the predictors explain parts of change in ICT skills and frequency of computer use. status: publishe...|$|E

The current study, conducted in Flanders, aims to get {{a clearer picture of}} ICT use in Flemish preschools. For this purpose, a questionnaire was composed consisting of newly developed and existing scales. Based on the answers of 232 preschool teachers, two types of ICT use are distinguished in early childhood education, ‘ICT use supporting basic ICT skills and attitudes’, and ‘ICT use supporting contents and individual learning needs’. ‘ICT use supporting basic ICT skills and attitudes’ occurs more frequently and is related to the grade of the preschoolers, teachers’ self-perceived <b>ICT</b> <b>competences</b> and the number of years of experience with ICT at school. ‘ICT use supporting contents and individual learning needs’ is strongly related to the grade of the preschoolers, teachers’ self-perceived <b>ICT</b> <b>competences,</b> ICT professional development and teachers’ attitudes towards the possibilities of ICT for teachers in early childhood education.
