25|$|The Vedas {{and other}} {{associated}} texts {{dating to the}} post-Rigvedic (Iron Age) Vedic period (ca. 1100–500BC) contain the earliest written references to armies in India.

25|$|The other {{direct method}} is the {{so-called}} moving cluster method. This relies {{on the fact that}} the stars of a cluster share a common motion through space. Measuring the proper motions of cluster members and plotting their apparent motions across the sky will reveal that they converge on a vanishing point. The radial velocity of cluster members can be determined from Doppler shift measurements of their spectra, and once the radial velocity, proper motion and angular distance from the cluster to its vanishing point are known, simple trigonometry will reveal the distance to the cluster. The Hyades are the best <b>known</b> <b>application</b> of this method, which reveals their distance to be 46.3parsecs.|$|E

2500|$|Locus of control's best <b>known</b> <b>application</b> {{may have}} been in the area of health psychology, largely due to the work of Kenneth Wallston. Scales to measure locus of control in the health domain were {{reviewed}} by Furnham and Steele [...] in 1993. The best-known are the Health Locus of Control Scale and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, or MHLC. The latter scale is based on the idea (echoing Levenson's earlier work) that health may be attributed to three sources: internal factors (such as self-determination of a healthy lifestyle), powerful others (such as one's doctor) or luck (which is very dangerous as lifestyle advice will be ignored – these people are very difficult to help).|$|E

30|$|In Section 2, we {{introduce}} {{basic concepts}} on our abstract convex spaces and a basic KKM theorem by following [3]. We give also the new concepts of intersectionally closed and unionly open sets due to Luc et al. [4].

In Section 4, we give some known particular KKM-type theorems and indicate {{some of their}} <b>known</b> <b>applications.</b> In Section 5, we give some known Fan-Browder-type fixed point theorems mainly due to the author and indicate their <b>known</b> <b>applications</b> by other authors.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} <b>known</b> <b>applications</b> of Discrete Optimization is on {{scheduling}}. In con-trast, one {{of the most}} <b>known</b> <b>applications</b> of Continuous Nonlinear Optimization is on the control of dynamic systems. In this paper, we combine both views, solving scheduling problems as dy-namic systems, modeled as discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problems with state and control continuous variables subjected to upper and lower bounds. Complementarity constraints are used to represent scheduling decisions. One example we discuss in detail is the crude oil scheduling in ports, with numerical results presented...|$|R
