50|$|The Marconi Company built a Long Wave <b>receiver</b> <b>station</b> in Tywyn in 1914, {{working in}} duplex with the {{high-power}} transmitter station near Waunfawr.

30|$|To {{integrate}} the toolset with NS 2, a video sender and receiver modules, called MyUDP, {{located at the}} sender and <b>receiver</b> <b>stations</b> are added. The sender module, acts as a traffic generator, reads a video trace file from EvalVid toolset and generates a stream of corresponding packets for transmission. Then, packets will be sent out in the NS 2 simulation environment. Once packets arrive at the <b>receiver</b> <b>station,</b> the <b>receiver</b> module records their packet time stamps and generates the video trace file to EvalVid toolset for evaluation. The implementation details {{can be found at}} [25].|$|R
30|$|This {{phase is}} {{carried out by the}} <b>receiver</b> <b>station</b> to verify the {{freshness}} and validity of the received CP. Upon receiving the CP, the <b>receiver</b> <b>station</b> will immediately discard the packets that do not have any TS or AF security elements based on the ground of wrong format. Otherwise, the receiver must first check the freshness of the received CP. Doing freshness check as {{the first line of defense}} can significantly enhance the speed and efficiency of the proposed models. By this way, the old CP are discarded immediately by the receiver without even wasting time to involve the authentication algorithm.|$|R

50|$|Tropospheric scatter (also {{known as}} troposcatter) {{is a method}} of {{communicating}} with microwave radio signals over considerable distances - often up to 300 km, and further depending on terrain and climate factors. This method of propagation uses the tropospheric scatter phenomenon, where radio waves at UHF and SHF frequencies are randomly scattered as they pass through the upper layers of the troposphere. Radio signals are transmitted in a narrow beam aimed just above the horizon {{in the direction of}} the <b>receiver</b> <b>station.</b> As the signals pass through the troposphere, some of the energy is scattered back toward the Earth, allowing the <b>receiver</b> <b>station</b> to pick up the signal.|$|R

30|$|An {{exploration}} {{is performed}} in [34] {{of the concept}} of self-recharging of sensor nodes in a network system powered by an IPS. The study exploited a full-duplex mode of communication in a co-located energy transmitter and <b>information</b> <b>receiver</b> architecture that transmits/receives over an in-band frequency such that the energy transmitter as well as the <b>information</b> <b>receiver</b> carries out their communications over a single-frequency band in a simultaneous fashion. The employed communication mode may be advantageous in improving the spectral efficiency of the operating frequency; however, it suffers from interference problems as the energy transmitter that co-locates with the <b>information</b> <b>receiver</b> causes a complex co-channel interference issue. Since full-duplex communication allows simultaneous communications, the sensor nodes in the full-duplex system in [34] performs data transmission and energy reception concurrently. The network sensor nodes also perform self-recharging as they transfer their independent information. These processes make the system complex as the network sensor nodes are faced with a strong self-interference that causes corruption of data transmissions. Interference cancelation techniques are employed; however, it is difficult to achieve perfect cancelation of self-interference in a wireless channel. The interference issues in turn affect the system’s overall performance in terms of energy efficiency and achievable throughput rate. The complexity associated to the work in [34] is circumvented in this paper by exploring a half-duplex communication mode in both co-located and separated energy transmitter and <b>information</b> <b>receiver</b> architectures operating in separate time-slots over a single-frequency band. The employed technique in this paper is cost-effective and alleviates the problem of interference faced by the full-duplex approach operating in in-band. The application of both co-located and separate energy transmitter and <b>information</b> <b>receiver</b> architectures employed in this paper tackles the practical doubly-near-far issue faced by the co-located architecture adopted by [34].|$|R

50|$|Engineers at Toshiba {{had already}} begun work on a {{pulse-modulated}} system.

Multiple <b>receiver</b> <b>stations</b> were spaced about 100 m around the transmitter. Each of these had a hand-rotated pole with Yagi antennas at two levels, allowing azimuth and elevation measurements.
