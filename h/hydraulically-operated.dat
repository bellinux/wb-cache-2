50|$|The wing {{center section}} was {{strengthened}} by a typical Blohm & Voss cross-girder, {{which consisted of}} a large-diameter pipe. This transverse tube (divided internally into five sections) also acted as a fuel tank. The center wing was metal-covered, while the outer wings were fabric-covered. There were six <b>hydraulically-operated</b> flaps in the mid-wing. The fuselage was of metal and had an approximately circular cross-section.|$|E

Along with its control building (often {{referred to as a}} signal box) it is now a listed structure.|$|E
50|$|The central {{supporting}} tube was split at the front, which allowed {{the engine and}} gearbox to be attached. The drive shaft was located inside the tube, and transmitted the engine's power to the rear wheels. The Superb utilized leaf springs for its suspension; one at the front and two at the rear. It featured <b>hydraulically-operated</b> drum brakes, with a mechanical handbrake connected to the rear wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{common type}} was {{originally}} developed by Wallace R. Turnbull and refined by the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. This electrically-operated mechanism was first tested in on June 6, 1927 at Camp Borden, Ontario, Canada and patented in 1929 (...) [...] It was favoured by some pilots in World War II, because {{even when the}} engine was no longer running the propeller could be feathered. On <b>hydraulically-operated</b> propellers the feathering had to happen before the loss of hydraulic pressure in the engine.|$|E
50|$|The target thrust {{reverser}} uses {{a pair of}} <b>hydraulically-operated</b> 'bucket' type doors to reverse the hot gas stream. For forward thrust, these doors form the propelling nozzle of the engine. In the original implementation of this system on the Boeing 707, and still common today, two reverser buckets were hinged so when deployed they block the rearward flow of the exhaust and redirect it with a forward component. This type of reverser is visible {{at the rear of}} the engine during deployment.|$|E

50|$|Vulnerable {{parts of}} the {{aircraft}} were armoured; the pilot had additional armour and bulletproof glass and an armoured bulkhead was {{to the rear of}} the navigator's position. The Manchester featured three <b>hydraulically-operated</b> turrets, located in the nose, rear and mid-upper fuselage; the addition of a ventral turret directly behind the bomb bay had been considered and tested on the second prototype, but did not feature on production aircraft. Access to all crew stations was provided by a walkway and crew positions had nearby escape hatches.|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} the bore was 405 in (30 calibres), of which the length of rifling was 333.4 in. The rifling used the {{increasing}} twist system; there were 54 grooves, with a twist of 1 in 120 at the breech-end rising to 1 in 30 at 166.7 in from the muzzle; the twist then remained a uniform 1 in 30. [...] The chamber length was 66.5 in, and {{the volume of the}} chamber was [...] [...] The gun had a <b>hydraulically-operated</b> interrupted-screw breech-block.

50|$|Supplemental Type Certificate SA5858S, {{issued by}} the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), held by the type allows for the {{installation}} of underwing pylons upon the Fan Jet Falcon, Fan Jet Falcon Series D and Fan Jet Falcon Series E. This modification has been commonly used upon those Falcon 20s which have been operated as special mission aircraft, which would often make use of underwing stores. Substantial numbers of Falcon 20s were converted into cargo-carrying configurations; a <b>hydraulically-operated</b> cargo door served to simplify loading-unloading operations. According to Flying Magazine, upon its launch, the Falcon 200 model had the largest cabin of any mid-seize business jet. Additionally, the rear fuselage of the Falcon 200 was re-designed to accommodate a 28-cubic foot baggage compartment within the tailcone, which supplements the standard aft cabin baggage compartment.|$|E
50|$|Construction was {{of mixed}} balsa/plywood {{similar to the}} Mosquito but the Hornet {{differed}} in incorporating stressed Alclad lower-wing skins bonded to the wooden upper wing structure using the new adhesive Redux. The two wing spars were redesigned to withstand a higher load factor of 10 versus 8. Apart from the revised structure, the Hornet's wings were a synthesis of aerodynamic knowledge that had been gathered since {{the design of the}} Mosquito, being much thinner in cross-section, and with a laminar flow profile similar to the P-51 Mustang and Hawker Tempest. The control surfaces consisted of <b>hydraulically-operated</b> split flaps extending from the wing root to outboard of the engine nacelles; as on the Mosquito, the rear of the nacelle was part of the flap structure. Outboard, the Alclad-covered ailerons extended close to the clipped wing tips and gave excellent roll control.|$|E
5000|$|The No.2 dock, (often {{referred}} to as the [...] "New dock") to the east of No.1 dock, was open and in use by 1898. The first ship to enter No.2 dock was the S.S. Solent when it opened without ceremony on 10 October 1898.John Jackson, a veteran of several major dock and harbour projects including the piers and foundation for Tower Bridge, London, the new Dover Harbour and part of the Manchester Ship Canal, was the contractor for the expansion.No.2 Dock is 3338 ft long and 400 to 600 ft wide, connected to No.1 Dock via a narrowing channel from west to east, was latterly bridged by a <b>hydraulically-operated</b> road/rail swingbridge but that had been removed after 1999. Dock walls 46.5 ft high were built of large limestone blocks at the loading points.The tall hydraulic hoists have since been demolished.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station is}} served by the Piccadilly and Victoria lines. Although {{thought of as a}} 'deep-level' tube station, Finsbury Park has neither lifts nor {{escalators}} as its lines are less than 20' (6.1 m) below street level, though there used to be lifts from the high-level platforms to the tube level. These were the last <b>hydraulically-operated</b> lifts on LT. Access to the Piccadilly and Victoria line platforms is by staircase only, reached via two narrow passages that physically prevent the installation of automatic ticket barriers. Manual ticket inspections by ticket inspectors do, however, regularly take place to combat fare evasion and ticketless travel. Stand-alone Oystercard validators are available by the station entrances for [...] "pay as you go" [...] customers to touch in and out.In 2015 ticket barriers were installed and operated on all the entrances to the station.|$|E
50|$|The {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage of Oxford uses {{an arrangement}} of spruce longerons and stiffeners underneath a plywood exterior. It is constructed in two sections on separate jigs, divided between the front and rear, these are joined together at the rear bulkhead. The forward bulkhead is deliberately reinforced so that the structure is capable of withstanding {{the impact of the}} aircraft turning over during landing {{in the hands of an}} unfortunate trainee pilot. Both the elevator and fin of the tail unit used a wooden spar and rib structure covered by fabric. The fuselage can be partially dismantled, the wing dividing into three separate sections, so that it can be road-transported. The wing uses a stressed-skin ply-covered structure using spruce flanges and ply webs. The spars are assembled upon a single jig, while others are used for the elements of the leading edge and trailing edge. Similar construction to the center section is also used in the outer panels. The wings are outfitted with <b>hydraulically-operated</b> split flaps, which extend between the ailerons.|$|E
5000|$|The Barracuda was a shoulder-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with an oval, all-metal fuselage. It had a retractable {{landing gear}} and non-retracting tailwheel. The <b>hydraulically-operated</b> main landing gear struts were of an [...] "L" [...] shape and retracted into a recess {{in the side of}} the fuselage, with the wheels held in the wing. A flush arrestor hook was fitted ahead of the tail wheel. The crew of three were in tandem under a continuous glazed canopy. The pilot had a sliding canopy and the other two crew members' canopy was hinged. The two rear-crew had alternate locations in the fuselage, with the navigator having bay windows below the wings for downward visibility. The wings had large Fairey-Youngman flaps that doubled as dive brakes. Originally fitted with a conventional tail, flight tests suggested stability would be improved by mounting the stabiliser higher, similar to a T-tail, which was implemented on the second prototype. For carrier stowage, the wings folded back horizontally at the roots; the peculiar small vertical protrusions on the upper wingtips held hooks that attached to the horizontal stabilizers.|$|E

40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of gases released from geologic samples upon crushing. The system includes a <b>hydraulically-operated</b> stainless-steel crusher through which helium flows. The released gases are fed directly into a gas chromatograph equipped with dual columns and helium ionization detectors. The chromato-graphic system is capable of separating and detecting Hr, Ar, Or, Nr, CO, COr, light hydrocarbons, and water. Samples {{ranging in size from}} 5 mg to l 000 mg can be crushed and the released trapped gases analyzed. The crushing pressure (up to 32 kbar) allows efficient release of trapped gases. Depending {{on the nature of the}} sample, 85 to 100 percent of the trapped gases in the crushed sample are released. The newly-developed crushing technique eliminates previously identified problems associated with gases generated by the crusher and adsorption of the released gases by the newly generated surfaces of the crushed sample. The analytical system has a wide range of potential uses. To date meteorites, lunar rocks and soils, basalts, ' glasses, and minerals with both fluid and gas phase inclusions have been analyzed. Selected examples of experimental results are presented...|$|E
40|$|Effective Gravel-packing of {{horizontal}} wells {{is difficult to}} achieve, using conventional pre-slotted liners, yet it is generally required in the soft Heavy Oil reservoir rocks of California, where cyclic steam injection has been proven {{to be the most}} cost-effective oil recovery method. The proposed method of gravel placement behind a non-perforated liner, which is later perforated {open_quotes}in situ{close_quotes} with a new tool operated by coiled-tubing, is expected to greatly reduce costs resulting from sand production in horizontal wells operated under cyclic steam injection. The detailed configuration of the prototype tool is described. It includes two pairs of cutting wheels at the ends of spring-loaded pivoting arms, which are periodically pressed through the liner wall and shortly thereafter retracted, while the coiled tubing is being pulled-out. For each operating cycle of the <b>hydraulically-operated</b> tool, this results in a set of four narrow slots parallel to the liner axis, in two perpendicular diametral planes. The shape of the edges of each slot facilitates bridging by the gravel particles, for a more effective and compacted gravel-packing. The tool includes a few easily-assembled parts machined from surface-hardened alloy steel presenting great toughness, selected from those used in die making. The operation of the system and potential future improvements are outlined. The method of fabrication, detailed drawings and specifications are given. They will serve as a basis for negotiating subcontracts with qualified machine shops...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} {{investigation and}} {{measurement of the}} elastic deformation properties of an anisotropic soil {{within the context of}} critical state soil mechanics. The soil tested is a heavily overconsolidated Gault Clay. Laboratory triaxial testing on 38 mm samples is used to measure and soil 100 mm diameter stiffness. A microcomputer-based control system has been developed for use with <b>hydraulically-operated</b> triaxial cells to enable stress path testing, and this is described. The axial and radial stresses and the back pressure can be varied independently to produce any desired stress path. A method of measurement of anisotropic of loading stiffness is developed using various pairs and unloading cycles, or stress path probes. tried, with isotropic, undrained cycles proving to be of most Several alternatives are uniaxial and constant pi use. For the soil tested, measured modulus values are found to be about 25 % in error if anisotropy is neglected. Factors affecting stiffness measurements are assessed, including sample disturbance, soil structure, threshold and stress history effects, design of the apparatus and test procedure. Elasticity theory for cross-anisotropic soils is reviewed, particularly {{as it relates to the}} triaxial apparatus. The way in which elasticity theory is incorporated in the critical state model is discussed. Isotropic compression a~ swelling test the compression law usually used in the results question critical state model.
