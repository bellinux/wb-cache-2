5|$|Males having short, cut hair {{are in many}} {{cultures}} viewed as being under society's control, such as while in the military or prison or as punishment for a crime. Although recently in The United States {{it has become more}} socially acceptable and more common for men to have hair reaching {{all the way down to}} their upper back. Long, thick <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> been a sign of wealth, power or prominence throughout time and history.|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight <b>hair,</b> <b>has</b> been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E

5000|$|Other plants, such as opuntias, <b>have</b> <b>hairs</b> or spines {{that cause}} {{mechanical}} irritation, {{but do not}} inject chemicals. Stinging hairs occur particularly in the families Urticaceae, Loasaceae, Boraginaceae (subfamily Hydrophylloideae) and Euphorbiaceae. Such <b>hairs</b> <b>have</b> been shown to deter grazing mammals, but are no more effective against insect attack than non-stinging hairs. Many plants with stinging <b>hairs</b> <b>have</b> the word [...] "nettle" [...] in their English name, but may not be related to [...] "true nettles" [...] (the genus Urtica).|$|R
5|$|She uses unnamed famous scientists, Aleister Crowley and Yūsuke Santamaria {{as models}} for several of her characters. Characters are also based on her editor and the Tim Campi Design silver {{accessory}} brand. Hoshino collaborated with Kata Kizaki, {{the author of the}} novel adaptations, to create the character Bak Chan. The role of Miranda Lotto changed, and was ultimately lengthened, after Hoshino realized the similarities the two shared. Hoshino comically comments that Allen's <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> become very similar to the Super Saiyan, a transformation from Dragon Ball, in which the character's hair becomes spiky. Towards the beginning of D.Gray-mans publication, Hoshino stated that Allen, Kanda, and Cross Marian are the hardest characters to draw while the Millennium Earl and Hevlaska are the easiest.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of forensic {{science and the}} ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible {{at the time of the}} original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.|$|E

25|$|Different {{ethnic groups}} have {{observable}} {{differences in the}} structure, density, and growth rate of hair. With regard to structure, all human <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> the same basic chemical composition in terms of keratin protein content. Franbourg et al. have found that Black hair may differ {{in the distribution of}} lipids throughout the hair shaft. Classical afro-textured <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> been found to be not as densely concentrated on the scalp as other follical types. Specifically, the average density of afro-textured hair was found to be approximately 190 hairs per square centimeter. This was significantly lower than that of Caucasian hair, which, on average, has approximately 227 hairs per square centimeter.|$|E

25|$|One {{issue that}} can be {{considered}} an advantage or a disadvantage depending upon an individual's viewpoint, is that removing <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> the effect of removing information about the individual's hair growth patterns due to genetic predisposition, illness, androgen levels (such as from pubertal hormonal imbalances or drug side effects), and/or gender status.|$|E
25|$|The body hair of {{surgical}} patients may be removed before surgery. In the past {{this may have}} been achieved by shaving, but that is now considered counter-productive, so clippers or chemical depilatories may be used instead. The shaving of <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> sometimes been used in attempts to eradicate lice or to minimize body odor due to accumulation of odor-causing micro-organisms in hair. Some people with trichiasis find it medically necessary to remove ingrown eyelashes. Shaving against the grain can often cause ingrown hairs.|$|E
25|$|Forms of hair removal are practised {{for various}} and mostly cultural, sexual, medical or {{religious}} reasons. Forms of <b>hair</b> removal <b>have</b> been practised {{in almost all}} human cultures {{since at least the}} Neolithic era.

25|$|The cuticle is {{the first}} region of the hair that is {{attacked}} in an A. fulvescens infection. This attack resembles that of true dermatophytes in that some lateral hyphae give rise to fronded mycelium. However, some hyphae also give rise to appressoria, or flattened hyphal pressing organs, which are characteristic of non-keratinophilic fungi. Dermatophytes digest the hair cuticle rapidly, unlike A.fulvescens, which breaks the cuticle down so slowly that the scales are still visible for weeks after the <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> been infected.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of natural <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> waxed and waned. In the early 21st century, {{a significant percentage}} of African-American women still straighten their hair with relaxers of some kind (either heat- or chemical-based). This is done despite the fact that prolonged application of such chemicals (or heat) can result in overprocessing, breakage and thinning of the hair. Rooks (1996) argues that hair-care products designed to straighten hair, which have been marketed by white-owned companies in African American publications since the 1830s, represent unrealistic and unattainable standards of beauty.|$|E
25|$|Each {{culture of}} human society has {{developed}} social norms {{relating to the}} presence or absence of body hair, which has changed from one time to another. Different standards can apply to females and males. People whose hair falls outside a culture's aesthetic standards may experience real or perceived social acceptance problems. For example, for women in several societies, exposure in public of body hair other than head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows is generally considered to be unaesthetic, unattractive and embarrassing. In Middle Eastern societies, removal of the female body <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> been considered proper hygiene, necessitated by local customs, for many centuries.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{have found}} that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic. Other {{research}} publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men. A follow-up study by the same group showed {{that men and women}} with red <b>hair</b> <b>had</b> a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide.|$|R
5000|$|The pluck test is {{conducted}} by pulling hair out [...] "by the roots". The {{root of the}} plucked hair is examined under a microscope to determine the phase of growth, and is used to diagnose a defect of telogen, anagen, or systemic disease. Telogen <b>hairs</b> <b>have</b> tiny bulbs without sheaths at their roots. Telogen effluvium shows an increased percentage of hairs upon examination. Anagen <b>hairs</b> <b>have</b> sheaths attached to their roots. Anagen effluvium shows a decrease in telogen-phase hairs and an increased number of broken hairs.|$|R
25|$|An {{individual}} hair's {{shape is}} never completely circular. The cross-section of a hair is an ellipse, which can tend towards a circle or be distinctly flattened. Asiatic heads of straight hair are formed from almost-round hairs, and Caucasian hair's cross sections form oval shapes. Afro-textured <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> a flattened cross-section and is finer, and its ringlets can form tight circles with diameters {{of only a}} few millimeters. In humans worldwide, Asiatic hair is the most common, whereas afro-textured hair is the least common. This is because the former hair texture is typical of the large populations inhabiting East Asia as well as the indigenous peoples of the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{males with}} 5α-reductase type II {{deficiency}} exhibit signs of continued undervirilization {{in a number}} of domains. Facial hair was absent or sparse in a relatively large group of Dominican males with the condition. However, more facial <b>hair</b> <b>has</b> been observed in patients with the disorder {{from other parts of the}} world, although facial hair was still reduced relative to that of other men in the same communities. The divergent findings may reflect racial differences in androgen-dependent hair growth. A female pattern of androgenic hair growth, with terminal hair largely restricted to the axillae and lower pubic triangle, is observed in males with the condition. No temporal recession of the hairline or androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss or baldness) has been observed in any of the cases of 5α-reductase type II deficiency that have been reported, whereas this is normally seen to some degree in almost all Caucasian males. Individuals with 5α-reductase type II deficiency were initially reported to have no incidence of acne, but subsequent research indicated normal sebum secretion and acne incidence.|$|E
25|$|Caribou or Porcupine caribou, wild caribou Rangifer tarandus granti (tuntu sg tuntuk dual tuntut pl or tuntupik sg tuntupiik dual tuntupiit pl or tuntupiaq sg tuntupiak dual tuntupiat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tuntupig in Cup'ig).

Sealskins and caribou skins were always kept separate and not combined in the same garment except for occasional decorative strips. Yup’ik dance fans decorated with caribou throat hair, caribou leg-skins were made into high boots, sleeping bags for travel made by joining two caribou skins and fur-side-out fancy parkas. Historically, caribou were hunted {{in the fall and}} skins were brought home for skin clothing. Caribou hunts were discouraged by the Russian and American traders as they felt it took the trappers away from their trap lines. Prior to European contact, caribou were important not only for their meat but for the skins which were an important item used in clothing. The Russians encouraged the Eskimos to adopt Western-style dress in order to release more furs for trading. In the spring, some people hunted caribou along the inland river ways.|$|E
