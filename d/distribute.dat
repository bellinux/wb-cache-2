40|$|A <b>distributed</b> {{database}} (DDB) is {{a collection}} of multiple, logically interrelated databases <b>distributed</b> over a computer network. A <b>distributed</b> database management system (<b>distributed</b> DBMS) is the software system that permits the management of the <b>distributed</b> database and makes the distribution transparent to the users [1]. The term <b>distributed</b> database system (DDBS) is typically used to refer to the combination of DDB and the <b>distributed</b> DBMS. <b>Distributed</b> DBMSs are similar to <b>distributed</b> file systems (see <b>Distributed</b> File Systems) in that both facilitate access to <b>distributed</b> data. However, there are important differences in structure and functionality, and these characterize a <b>distributed</b> database system: 1. <b>Distributed</b> file systems simply allow users to access files that are located on machines other than their own. These files have no explicit structure (i. e., they are flat) and the relationships among data in different files (if there are any) are not managed by the system and are the users responsibility. A DDB, on the other hand, is organized according to a schema that defines both the structure of the <b>distributed</b> data, and the relationships among the data. The schema is defined according to some data model, which is usually relational or object-oriented (s e e <b>Distributed</b> Database Schemas). 2. A <b>distributed</b> file system provides a simple interface to users which allows them to open, read/write (records or bytes), and close files.
