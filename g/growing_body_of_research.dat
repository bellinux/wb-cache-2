5|$|A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> {{suggests}} that self-control {{is akin to}} a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact {{that can be a}} source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

Furthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains. Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men.|$|E

Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted {{by those who}} are in a position of power over the victim. A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: [...] "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion". The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems {{to play an important role}} in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.|$|E

2500|$|One {{limitation}} of any land management {{system is that}} economically and politically powerful users can easily quantify and argue their needs.

Another common criticism of holistic planned grazing is that while farmers and ranchers around the world believe that it works for them and they have even received awards, the majority of range scientists {{have not been able to}} experimentally confirm that intensive grazing systems similar to those at the center of holistic management show a benefit, and claim that [...] managers' reports of success are anecdotal.

Con-trary to some characterizations of evolutionary social science, this review presumes that there exist multiple evolutionary perspectives that have applicability to matters of practical importance. Basic findings include recognition of a strong evolutionarily-sensible preference for relatively high salary standings that is independent of absolute salary amounts. Synthetic findings include identification <b>of</b> <b>research</b> problems that future, directed studies can profitably address. For practical application, my review finds that evolved preferences appear more aligned with salary structures that are dispersed relatively evenly among co-workers when compared with tournament-style compensation patterns...|$|R

[...] "Women's issues" [...] had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best a nice thing to work on but hardly a necessity.

[...] As of 2003 there was little research on environmental effects; the research showed little effects on aquatic plants at relevant exposure levels; toxicological studies had been done on the model fish, Medaka and found little effect on adult behavior or physiology, but developmental abnormalities were observed more frequently in spawn of fish that {{had been exposed to}} relevant doses. [...] Studies had also been conducted on mesocosms that included sunfish, that were exposed to three dose ranges of the combination of fluoxetine, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin, with the highest dose range set well beyond environmental exposures; [...] almost all the fish died at the doses in the highest ranges and half the fish died in the middle dose ranges, while almost none died in the low range and in the controls. [...] The reason for this was studied but the investigators were not able to identify the cause. [...] Subsequent studies showed that fluoxetine may be an endocrine disruptor in some fish species.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>growing</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> {{indicates}} {{that exposure to}} distal stressors leads to proximal stressors in sexual minority populations. While sexual minority stress and gender minority stress both use Meyer's Minority Stress Model as a framework, and share some characteristics with gender minority stress, some researchers have suggested that sexual minority stress is distinct from the minority stress experienced by transgender, gender non-conforming, and gender non-binary individuals. [...] For example, LGB youth and adults who have experienced prejudice about their sexual orientation sometimes choose to conceal their sexual identity from others. Concealing such personal information causes significant psychological distress, including intrusive thoughts about the secret, shame and guilt, anxiety, and isolation from {{other members of the}} minority group. Internalized homophobia is another proximal stressor prevalent among LGBT individuals. [...] It refers to the internalization of negative social views about homosexuality, which leads to self-hatred and poor self-regard. As predicted by minority stress theory, internalized homophobia is associated with exposure to distal stressors, insofar as it only occurs because LGB individuals are exposed to negative societal attitudes toward same-sex attraction. Rejection sensitivity represents a third proximal stress among sexual minority individuals. [...] Rejection sensitivity refers to chronic, anxious expectations of rejection based on one's stigmatized status. [...] Among sexual minority individuals, rejection sensitivity emerges from experiences of rejection from parents and is associated with internalized homophobia, unassertiveness, depression, and anxiety. [...] Thus, previous experiences with prejudice are associated with proximal stress among LGB individuals, including concealment of their sexual identity, internalized homophobia, and rejection sensitivity.|$|E

These maps (consisting of a report, a database, and sometimes a geographical information system) can prove highly useful for research, policy and practice communities, by providing assessments of knowledge gaps (subjects requiring additional research), knowledge gluts (subjects where full SR is possible), and patterns across the research literature that promote best practice and direct research resources towards the highest quality research.

As hypothesized, self-report measures of individual differences in affective information processing were associated with choices in a task designed by Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson to mimic the gains, losses, and uncer-tainties of real life decisions. The results were stronger when the processing of losses was considered separately from the processing of gains. Greater negative affectivity was associated with more avoidance of high-loss options; greater positive affectivity was associated with more choices from high-gain options.
