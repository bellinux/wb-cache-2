40|$|This paper {{raises the}} issue of {{employability}} of Persons with Disabilities in Macedonia. Theoretically reviews the Medical and Social models of Persons with Disabilities (PWD), as well as analyses the international disability rights instruments – UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – and the European Union legislation – Directive on Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation. The paper thoroughly describes the legislative and strategic framework of Macedonia attempting employment of PWD. It concludes that Macedonia is significantly lagging behind in reforming its social service sector, particularly its system for employment protection of PWD. Public support for employment of persons with disabilities is based on medical diagnosis and partial social actions {{have been taken to}} fully integrate these individuals into the society. Public measures are primarily focused on providing small financial support, which goes with remarkable lack of statistical data and reporting on the results. The paper calls for transforming public measures in favor of employability of PWD. Keywords: <b>employment,</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities (PWD), barriers, equality;...|$|E
40|$|In the {{situation}} of rapid population aging, postponing retirement is a timely and effective measure in relieving pressure of old age support. However, many people think that postponing retirement will crowd out youth employment. Using data in China, this paper shows that this judgment cannot be supported by empirical evidence. Using data from 1990 census, 2000 census and 2005 1 % population sample survey, this paper examines the impact of <b>employment</b> of older <b>persons</b> on <b>employment</b> of younger <b>persons.</b> Our OLS estimation results suggest that <b>employment</b> of younger <b>persons</b> is positively instead of negatively correlated with <b>employment</b> of older <b>persons.</b> We further dealt with the potential endogeneity of the OLS estimation by employing two-way fix-effects and TSLS estimation strategies. The results still suggest that increase of <b>employment</b> of older <b>persons</b> will promote rather than depress <b>employment</b> of younger <b>persons.</b> We also found a positive effect of <b>employment</b> of older <b>persons</b> on young workers’ wage. This study suggests that postponing retirement wouldn’t crowd out <b>employment</b> of younger <b>persons.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{reported}} socioeconomic inequalities in mental health among urban residents. This study aimed at investigating whether neighborhood social cohesion influences the associations between socio-economic factors and psychological distress. Cross-sectional questionnaire study on {{a random sample of}} 18, 173 residents aged 16 years and older from 211 neighborhoods in the four largest cities in the Netherlands. Psychological distress was the dependent variable (scale range 10 - 50). Neighborhood social cohesion was measured by five statements and aggregated to the neighborhood level using ecometrics methodology. Multilevel linear regression analyses were used to investigate cross-level interactions, adjusted for neighborhood deprivation, between individual characteristics and social cohesion with psychological distress. The mean level of psychological distress among urban residents was 17. 2. Recipients of disability, social assistance or unemployment benefits reported higher psychological distress (β = 5. 6, 95 %CI 5. 2 to 5. 9) than those in paid <b>employment.</b> <b>Persons</b> with some or great financial difficulties reported higher psychological distress (β = 3. 4, 95 %CI 3. 2 to 3. 6) than those with little or no financial problems. Socio-demographic factors were also associated with psychological distress, albeit with much lower influence. Living in a neighborhood with high social cohesion instead of low social cohesion was associated with a lower psychological distress of 22 % among recipients of disability, social assistance or unemployment benefits and of 13 % among citizens with financial difficulties. Residing in socially cohesive neighborhoods may reduce the influence of lack of paid employment and financial difficulties on psychological distress among urban adults. Urban policies aimed at improving neighborhood social cohesion may contribute to decreasing socio-economic inequalities in mental health...|$|E

Therefore, this study aims to understand the status of the financial resourses for the <b>employment</b> policy of <b>persons</b> with disability and to clarify the problems in South Korea by comparing and analyzing the current financial resources for the <b>employment</b> policies of <b>persons</b> with disability between South Korea and Japan. As for the study method, literature review was employed to analyze the literatures and information related to financial resources of <b>employment</b> policy for <b>persons</b> with disability mainly focusing on the revenue account among the accounts of budget to implement the <b>employment</b> policy for <b>person</b> with disability. The biggest difference between financial resources to perform the <b>employment</b> policy for <b>persons</b> with disability of Japan and South Korea is from the total amount of budget and the distribution ratio of General Account, Social Insurance and the share. While in Japan the <b>employment</b> policies for <b>persons</b> with disability are financed by the General Account and Social Insurance much more than the Share, in South Korea, they are financed by the Share more than the General Account and Employment Insurance.

40|$|EXTRACT To {{promote the}} <b>employment</b> of <b>persons</b> with disabilities, the {{adoption}} of one model over the other depends on the economic, political, and social circumstances of a particular country. Regardless of what approach is used to promote the <b>employment</b> of <b>persons</b> with disabilities, empowerment and social integration of persons with disabilities should be the cornerstone. Toward these aims, efforts must be made not only to procure <b>employment</b> opportunities for <b>persons</b> with disabilities, but also to educate employers, workers without disabilities, {{and the general public}} regarding unfounded prejudices against this disadvantaged group. In this connection, corporate or industrial codes of conduct or codes of practice for the furtherance of ethical behavior and social responsibility may also contain explicit provisions to facilitate the integration of workers with disabilities. Trade unions can be more proactive in advocating the rights of workers with disabilities and increasing the awareness of obstacles facing persons with disabilities. As a result, legislative efforts to promote the <b>employment</b> of <b>persons</b> with disabilities are only the beginning—meticulous implementation strategies, effectual enforcement mechanisms, regular evaluations of progress, and the fostering of new societal attitudes toward disabilities must follow to effect success...|$|R
