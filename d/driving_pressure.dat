2500|$|A further minor {{complication}} {{exists at}} altitude. If {{the volume of}} the lungs were to be instantaneously doubled at the beginning of inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs would be halved. This happens regardless of altitude. Thus, halving of the sea level air pressure (100kPa) results in an intrapulmonary air pressure of 50kPa. Doing the same at 5500m, where the atmospheric pressure is only 50kPa, [...] the intrapulmonary air pressure falls to 25kPa. Therefore, the same change in lung volume at sea level results in a 50kPa difference in pressure between the ambient air and the intrapulmonary air, whereas it result in a difference of only 25kPa at 5500m. The <b>driving</b> <b>pressure</b> forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is therefore halved at this altitude. The rate of inflow of air into the lungs during inhalation at sea level is therefore twice that which occurs at 5500m. However, in reality, inhalation and exhalation occur far more gently and less abruptly than in the example given. The differences between the atmospheric and intrapulmonary pressures, driving air {{in and out of the}} lungs during the breathing cycle, are in the region of only 2–3kPa. A doubling or more of these small pressure differences could be achieved by only very minor adjustments to the breathing effort at high altitudes.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Driving airway pressure, the {{difference}} between plateau (end of an inspiratory pause) and end-expiratory airway pressure, can be an independent predictor of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [1]. However, during ongoing mechanical ventilation, (dynamic) end-inspiratory airway pressure exceeds (static) plateau airway pressure, especially when inspiratory flows are very high [2]. Thus, for the same static <b>driving</b> airway <b>pressure,</b> different dynamic <b>driving</b> airway <b>pressures</b> can be reached.|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of clastic dikes was studied in Ami'az Plain, {{where hundreds of}} clastic dikes cross-cut the soft rock of the late Pleistocene lacustrine Lisan Formation, within the seismically active Dead Sea basin. Two analytic models were established to estimate the dike propagation velocities, the dike emplacement duration, and the <b>driving</b> <b>pressures</b> that were associated with dike propagation either under laminar or turbulent flow conditions. These models depend on the host-rock and fluid properties, dike width and length. Based on these properties and field limitations, {{the results indicate that}} the dikes were propagated under turbulent flow conditions and propagation velocities of ~ 4 – 65 m/s. The emplacement duration of the clastic dikes is between ~ 0. 8 and 2 s, which is similar to the order of the acoustic wave duration that passes through the soft rock during an earthquake event. This implies that the {{propagation of}} dikes could form during the passing acoustic waves and may thus be considered as an earthquake-induced impact structures. The calculated <b>driving</b> <b>pressures</b> that were generated during the earthquake events near the surface are 1 – 2 MPa, one order of magnitude larger than the pressure due to the overburden on the source layer. © 2010 Elsevier B.
