Old Benjamin Breck, her grandfather, undaunted by sea or wilderness, had come {{straight}} from Belfast {{to the little}} log settlement by the great river that mirrored then the mantle of primeval forest on the hills. So much for chance. He kept a store with a side porch and square-paned windows, where hams and sides of bacon and sugar loaves in blue <b>glazed</b> <b>paper</b> hung beside ploughs and calico prints, barrels of flour, of molasses and rum, all {{of which had been}} somehow marvellously transported over the passes of those forbidding mountains,--passes we blithely thread to-day in dining cars and compartment sleepers.

6000|$|No {{one could}} deny that Evangelicalism had wrought a {{change for the}} better in Rebecca Linnet's person--not even Miss Pratt, the thin stiff lady in spectacles, seated {{opposite}} to her, who always had a peculiar repulsion for 'females with a gross habit of body'. Miss Pratt was an old maid; but that is a no more definite description than if I had said she was in the autumn of life. Was it autumn when the orchards are fragrant with apples, or autumn when the oaks are brown, or autumn when the last yellow leaves are fluttering in the chill breeze? The young ladies in Milby would have told you that the Miss Linnets were old maids; but the Miss Linnets were to Miss Pratt what the apple-scented September is to the bare, nipping days of late November. The Miss Linnets were in that temperate zone of old-maidism, when a woman will not say but that if a man of suitable years and character were to offer himself, she might be induced to tread the remainder of life's vale in company with him; Miss Pratt was in that arctic region where a woman is confident that at no time of life would she have consented to give up her liberty, and that she has never seen the man whom she would engage to honour and obey. If the Miss Linnets were old maids, they were old maids with natural ringlets and embonpoint, not to say obesity; Miss Pratt was an old maid with a cap, a braided 'front', a backbone and appendages. Miss Pratt was the one blue-stocking of Milby, possessing, she said, no less than five hundred volumes, competent, as her brother the doctor often observed, to conduct a conversation on any topic whatever, and occasionally dabbling a little in authorship, though it was understood that she had never put forth the full powers of her mind in print. Her 'Letters to a Young Man on his Entrance into Life', and 'De Courcy, or the Rash Promise, a Tale for Youth', were mere trifles which she had been induced to publish because they were calculated for popular utility, but they were nothing to what she had for years had by her in manuscript.

40|$|Abstract. The {{surface quality}} of forming {{products}} is definitely {{dependent on the}} final finishing process of their dies or molds. Injection molds especially need higher surface quality than that of general purpose dies and molds. Conventional polishing pads have not made mold surface down {{to the level of}} nanometer roughness efficiently because of their loading and <b>glazing.</b> This <b>paper</b> focuses on the development of a fixed abrasive pad that uses a self-conditioning mechanism. Self-conditioning is recognized as a long term polishing stabilizer without any loading or glazing because water makes the fixed abrasives free by swelling of the polymer binder network. Consequently, a stable nano-polishing process has been realized for the injection molds. The experimental results show the polished surface roughness was Ra 15. 1 nm on a D 2 die of steel in the AISI standard...|$|R

5000|$|Nashua {{began as}} a gummed paper {{manufacturer}} in Rockport, Massachusetts. In 1898 the company folded. The owner, Charles H. Crowell, was not only an inventor, {{but he was also}} a farsighted entrepreneur. He sold his crumbling company to Carter, Rice & Company of Boston, who kept Crowell on as manager of their new division, now renamed to Winthrop Manufacturing Company. A fire destroyed the factory in February, 1904, which had in the meantime moved to south Boston. The search for a new locale led owners Carter and Rice to Nashua, New Hampshire, where they found the heavily in debt Nashua Card and <b>Glazed</b> <b>Paper</b> Company, which had been founded in 1849 as a manufacturer of cardboard and <b>glazed</b> <b>paper.</b> During the California Gold Rush Nashua made playing cards for miners and became known as a result as the Card Shop. This name stuck with the company for almost 100 years, well into the 1950s. The owners of Nashua were happy to sell their factory to Carter and Rice for $74,000, plus mortgage. At that moment, 1904, the present day Nashua Corporation was founded. In April, 1904 the wholly owned subsidiary was incorporated. It became known as the Nashua Card, Gummed and Coated Paper Company. The new company brought together the capabilities of both companies, continuing to manufacture the products of Carter, Rice & Company, namely gummed flats, gummed paper, and sock linings, they added the products of the previous company, that is, <b>glazed</b> <b>paper,</b> cardboard, and [...] "surface coated" [...] paper.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of an analytical study of the functioning of glazing at two different yet interacting levels: {{at the level of the}} building as a whole, and at that of glazing as a building element. At the building level, analyses were performed on a sample of high-rise business buildings in Slovenia, where the glazing"s share of the building envelope was calculated, and estimates of the proportion of shade provided by external blinds were made. It is shown that, especially in the case of modern buildings with large proportions of glazing and buildings with no shading devices, careful glazing design is needed, together with a sound knowledge of energy performance. In the second part of the article, the energy balance values relating to selected types of glazing are presented, including solar control <b>glazing.</b> The <b>paper</b> demonstrates the need for a holistic energy approach to glazing problems, as well as how different types of glazing can be methodically compared, thus improving the design of sustainability-orientated buildings...|$|R

A series of experiments were performed on the shaking table of the IZIIS institute inSkopje,Macedonia. Oneand two-story full scale structures were subjected to a series of ground motions, namely sinus sweep testing, natural and modified ground motion accelerograms. All together 8 different setups were tested in elastic and inelastic behaviour range. Displacements and accelerations were measured in each floor as well as the slipping of walls, uplifting of their corners and the shear deformation of the adhesive between the glass panels and the timber frames. The tested combination of timber-glass walls exhibited a rocking type of behaviour, resulting in a desirable ductile failure of steel hold-downs and not brittle failure of the glazing nor failure of the adhesive. Hence such a combination of glass and timber in wall systems could potentially be used in seismically active areas. </p...|$|R

A tradition that is not very well known is that of the Paḷḷi-Arai or bedroom, wherein, each night, the Lord is informed of the status of the temple's accounts for the day, by the custodians of the temple, and then put to sleep to the singing of an ōdhuvār or bard.

5000|$|Light Absorption - light {{absorption}} of glazing is {{the light that}} is neither transmitted nor reflected by the glazing. Since light is not necessarily absorbed uniformly, some wavelengths may be transmitted more than others, causing the transmitted color to be distorted.

This test, used to detect the transmission color of glazing, involves placing a piece of <b>glazing</b> on white <b>paper,</b> and comparing the paper's color with and without the glass.

40|$|Mathematical {{modelling}} can be {{a powerful}} tool in the design and optimalization of glazing. By calculation, the specifications of a glazing design and the optimal design parameters can be predicted without building costly prototypes first. Furthermore, properties which are difficult to measure, like for instance solar and visible light properties for oblique or diffuse irradiation, can be determined accurately by calculation. At the TNO Institute of Applied Physics, a glazing model for simulation and optimalization is being developed, which allows to determine according to international standards, glazing specifications, ranging from optical properties (solar energy, visible light, color appearance) to thermal properties (U-value, thermal shock resistance, fire control properties). The model is connected to a data base containing optical constants and other properties of glasses, coatings and other materials, used in <b>glazing.</b> The <b>paper</b> discusses the <b>Glazing</b> Model which consists of an Optical Transfer Model simulating the optical behavior, and a Thermal Transfer Model which simulates the thermal behavior.
