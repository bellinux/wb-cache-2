5|$|Up to {{the late}} spring of 1940, Fighter Command had been {{preparing}} to meet a possible air attack on the British Isles coming only from due east, <b>from</b> <b>Germany</b> itself; prior to the German victory in Western Europe. The possibility that France might fall and Britain would continue to fight on had not been considered. An air attack <b>from</b> <b>Germany</b> meant the Luftwaffe's bombers would operate beyond the range of their fighters and be vulnerable to attack. If twin-engine fighters, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110s were used, they would be fighting at {{the limits of their}} range.|$|E
