40|$|Role of endothelin- 1 and {{thromboxane}} A 2 in renal vasoconstriction {{induced by}} angiotensin II in diabetes and hypertension. BackgroundInteractions among angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) may {{play an important}} role in the regulation of renal function. The present study investigated the participation of TXA 2 and ET- 1 in the increase in renal vascular resistances (RVR) induced by Ang II, as well as the consequences of diabetes, hypertension, and the combination of both on this response. MethodsIsolated kidneys from male normoglycemic or streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used. The increase in perfusion pressure (PP) produced by Ang II was studied in the absence or presence of the TXA 2 receptor antagonist, <b>ifetroban,</b> or the ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, PD 145065. ResultsSystolic arterial pressure (SAP) was higher in SHR than in WKY, but diabetic rats (D) from each strain showed lower SAP values than their respective non-diabetic rats. Basal renal PP was higher in WKY and SHR than in WKY-D and SHR-D. Increases in renal PP produced by Ang II were comparable in the kidneys from all groups. Either <b>ifetroban</b> or PD 145065 reduced the maximal Ang II response in all animals. The maximal inhibitory effect of <b>ifetroban</b> was higher (P < 0. 05) in WKY than in the other groups. However, the maximal inhibitory effect of PD 145065 was lower in SHR than in the other groups. ConclusionThis study supports a role for ET- 1 and TXA 2 as mediators of the increase in renal vascular resistance produced by Ang II. These results indicate that the participation of ET- 1 in the renal vasoconstriction produced by Ang II was reduced under hypertensive conditions, and that of TXA 2 was reduced by both diabetes and hypertension...|$|E
40|$|AT- 1 {{receptor}} antagonism modifies {{the mediation}} of endothelin- 1, thromboxane A 2, and catecholamines in the renal constrictor response to angiotensin II. ObjectiveThe present study investigated the consequences of partial AT 1 receptor blockade on the participation of catecholamines, thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2), and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) in the renal vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II (Ang II). MethodsFor this purpose, the increase in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) produced by Ang II was studied in isolated kidneys from untreated or irbesartan-treated Wistar Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), in absence or presence of the alfa- 1 receptor antagonist, prazosin, the TXA 2 receptor antagonist, <b>ifetroban,</b> or the ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, PD 145065. ResultsSystolic arterial pressure (SAP) was higher (P < 0. 05) in SHR than in WKY. Increases in RPP produced by Ang II were comparable in kidneys from both untreated groups. Treatment with irbesartan reduced SAP and RPP in both strains in a comparable extent. Presence of prazosin, <b>ifetroban,</b> or PD 145065 in perfusion media reduced (P < 0. 05) Ang II maximal response in all groups. Maximal inhibition of Ang II–induced vasoconstriction produced by the 3 antagonists was comparable in untreated WKY, but that of <b>ifetroban</b> and PD 145065 was lower (P < 0. 05) than that of prazosin in untreated SHR. Maximal inhibition of Ang II–induced vasoconstriction produced by the 3 antagonists was comparable in WKY treated with irbesartan, and not different to that observed in untreated WKY. Maximal inhibitory effect of the 3 antagonists was higher (P < 0. 05) in treated than in untreated SHR. ConclusionThe study further supports the importance of catecholamines, TXA 2, and ET- 1 as mediators of the renal vasoconstriction induced by Ang II in both normotensive and hypertensive rats. Hypertensive conditions appeared to reduce the participation of TXA 2 and ET- 1 in Ang II–induced vasoconstriction when compared with normotensive conditions. Chronic partial blockade of AT 1 receptors {{did not affect the}} participation of catecholamines, TXA 2, and ET- 1 in normotensive rats, but increased the participation of the 3 mediators in SHR. This suggests that when AT 1 receptors are partially blocked, other vasoconstrictor factors could exert part of the renal vasoconstrictor effects of Ang II...|$|E
40|$|Background—Pulmonary {{hypertension}} {{induced by}} chronic hypoxia {{is characterized by}} thickening of pulmonary artery walls, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, and right-heart failure. Prostacyclin analogues reduce pulmonary pressures in this condition; raising the possibility that cycloxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) modulates {{the response of the}} pulmonary vasculature to hypoxia. Methods and Results—Sprague-Dawley rats in which pulmonary hypertension was induced by hypobaric hypoxia for 14 days were treated concurrently with the selective COX- 2 inhibitor SC 236 or vehicle. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) was elevated after hypoxia (28. 13. 2 versus 17. 23. 1 mm Hg; n 8, P 0. 01), with thickening of small pulmonary arteries and increased COX- 2 expression and prostacyclin formation. Selective inhibition of COX- 2 aggravated the increase in mPAP (42. 85. 9 mm Hg; n 8, P 0. 05), an effect that was attenuated by the thromboxane (TX) A 2 /prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist <b>ifetroban.</b> Urinary TXB 2 increased during hypoxia (5. 90. 9 versus 1. 20. 2 ng/mg creatinine; n 6, P 0. 01) and was further increased by COX- 2 inhibition (8. 50. 7 ng/mg creatinine; n 6, P 0. 05).

Prostacyclin analogues reduce pulmonary pressures in this condition; raising the possibility that cycloxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) modulates {{the response of the}} pulmonary vasculature to hypoxia. Methods and Results? Sprague-Dawley rats in which pulmonary hypertension was induced by hypobaric hypoxia for 14 days were treated concurrently with the selective COX- 2 inhibitor SC 236 or vehicle.

Selective inhibition of COX- 2 aggravated the increase in mPAP (42. 8 ? 5. 9 mm Hg; n= 8, P< 0. 05), an effect that was attenuated by the thromboxane (TX) A 2 /prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist <b>ifetroban.</b> Urinary TXB 2 increased during hypoxia (5. 9 ? 0. 9 versus 1. 2 ? 0. 2 ng/mg creatinine; n= 6, P< 0. 01) and was further increased by COX- 2 inhibition (8. 5 ? 0. 7 ng/mg creatinine; n= 6, P< 0. 05).

40|$|We {{investigated}} the potentiating effect of low concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on the vasoconstriction induced by transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) and noradrenaline (NA) in human saphenous veins. The effects of (i) endothelium removal; (ii) {{the addition of}} the NO pathway precursor L-arginine; (iii) the ETA/ETB endothelin receptor antagonist Ro 47 - 0203; (iv) the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin; (v) the selective thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) receptor antagonists Bay u 3405 and <b>ifetroban,</b> and (vi) the TxA 2 synthase inhibitor, UK 38485, were studied in order to gain information about the mechanisms of NPY-induced potentiation. Contractile response curves for TNS (0. 5 – 8 [*]Hz) and for exogenously administered NA (0. 1 – 3 [*]μM) were obtained in superfused saphenous vein rings. The contractions induced by both TNS and NA at all tested frequencies and concentrations, respectively, were significantly potentiated by 50 [*]nM NPY in endothelium intact veins. Conversely, in endothelium-denuded vessel rings the contractile-response curves to TNS and NA overlapped both in the absence and presence of NPY, thus suggesting that a release of vasoactive substances from endothelial cells could account for the noradrenergic NPY-induced potentiation. In vessels with intact endothelium, the potentiating action of NPY on TNS and NA was unaffected by the presence of high concentrations of the NO precursor L-arginine (3 – 10 [*]mM) or the non-selective ETA/ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, Ro 47 - 0203 (10 [*]μM). These data indicate that the NPY-induced effect does not involve either the endothelium-derived vasodilator nitric oxide or the vasoconstrictor endothelin. Conversely, {{in the presence of the}} cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (30 [*]μM), NPY failed to potentiate the vasoconstrictions produced by either nerve stimulation or by exogenous NA, thus providing evidence that arachidonic acid metabolites through the cyclo-oxygenase pathway are mainly responsible for the potentiation evoked by NPY. When the TxA 2 receptor antagonists, Bay u 3405 (1 [*]μM) and <b>ifetroban</b> (1 [*]μM) were added to the superfusing medium, NPY did not alter either the frequency- or the concentration-response curves for either TNS or NA. Accordingly, both TNS- and NA-induced contractions were not potentiated by NPY in the presence of the TxA 2 synthase inhibitor, UK 38485 (10 [*]μM). This clearly demonstrates the pivotal role of TxA 2 in NPY-induced potentiation. In superfused vein rings with endothelium, a subthreshold concentration (0. 2 [*]nM) of the TxA 2 mimetic U 46619 potentiated both TNS- and NA-induced vasoconstrictions. This potentiation was higher at low stimulation frequencies and low NA concentrations, and resembled that produced by NPY. Our results indicate that in the human saphenous vein NPY potentiates the contractions produced by sympathetic nerve stimulation acting at the postjunctional level, primarily on endothelial cells. In particular, the NPY-induced release of a cyclo-oxygenase metabolite, namely TxA 2, may have a synergistic effect on the vasoconstriction induced by the noradrenergic mediator. Thus, such a mechanism may play a key role in the maintenance of the sympathetic tone of large human capacitance vessels...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to analyse the mechanism of the contractile response induced by the bioflavonoid myricetin in isolated rat aortic rings. Myricetin induced endothelium-dependent contractile responses (maximal value= 21 ± 2 % of the response induced by 80 [*]mM KCl and pD 2 = 5. 12 ± 0. 03). This effect developed slowly, reached a peak within 6 [*]min and then declined progressively. Myricetin-induced contractions were almost abolished by the phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) inhibitor, quinacrine (10 [*]μM), the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 [*]μM), the thromboxane synthase inhibitor, dazoxiben (100 [*]μM), the putative thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) /prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist, <b>ifetroban</b> (3 [*]μM). These contractions were abolished in Ca 2 +-free medium but were not affected by the Ca 2 + channel blocker verapamil (10 [*]μM). In cultured bovine endothelial cells (BAEC), myricetin (50 [*]μM) produced an increase in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) which peaked within 1 [*]min and remained sustained for 6 [*]min, {{as determined by the}} fluorescent probe fura 2. This rise in [Ca 2 +]i was abolished after removal of extracellular Ca 2 + in the medium. Myricetin (50 [*]μM) significantly increased TXB 2 production both in aortic rings with and without endothelium and in BAEC. These increases were abolished both by Ca 2 +-free media and by indomethacin. Taken together, these results suggests that myricetin stimulates Ca 2 + influx and subsequently triggers the activation of the PLA 2 and cyclo-oxygenase pathways releasing TXA 2 from the endothelium to contract rat aortic rings. The latter response occurs via the activation of Tp receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} free to read on the publisher's website* Exogenous {{prostacyclin}} is effective in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance in some forms of human pulmonary hypertension (PH). To explore whether endogenous prostaglandins played a similar role in pulmonary hypertension, we examined the effect of deleting cyclooxygenase (COX) -gene isoforms in a chronic hypoxia model of PH. Pulmonary hypertension, examined by direct measurement of right ventricular end systolic pressure (RVESP), right ventricular hypertrophy (n = 8), and hematocrit (n = 3), was induced by 3 weeks of hypobarichypoxia in wild-type and COX-knockout (KO) mice. RVESP was increased in wild-type hypoxic mice compared with normoxic controls (24. 4 ± 1. 4 versus 13. 8 ± 1. 9 mm Hg; n = 8; p < 0. 05). COX- 2 KO mice showed a greater increase in RVESP following hypoxia (36. 8 ± 2. 7 mm Hg; p < 0. 05). Urinary thromboxane (TX) B 2 excretion increased following hypoxia (44. 6 ± 11. 1 versus 14. 7 ± 1. 8 ng/ml; n = 6; p < 0. 05), an effect that was exacerbated by COX- 2 gene disruption (54. 5 ± 10. 8 ng/ml; n = 6). In contrast, the increase in 6 -keto-prostacyclin 1 α excretion following hypoxia was reduced by COX- 2 gene disruption (29 ± 3 versus 52 ± 4. 6 ng/ml; p < 0. 01). Tail cut bleed times were lower following hypoxia, and there was evidence of intravascular thrombosis in lung vessels that was exacerbated by disruption of COX- 2 and reduced by deletion of COX- 1. The TXA 2 /endoperoxide receptor antagonist <b>ifetroban</b> (50 mg/kg/day) offset the effect of deleting the COX- 2 gene, attenuating the hypoxia-induced rise in RVESP and intravascular thrombosis. COX- 2 gene deletion exacerbates pulmonary hypertension, enhances sensitivity to TXA 2, and induces intravascular thrombosis in response to hypoxia. The data provide evidence that endogenous prostaglandins modulate the pulmonary response to hypoxia. Copyright © 2008 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|EP 3 {{receptor}} antagonists are {{a recent}} {{addition to the}} prostanoid ligand armoury. We have examined the profiles of two such agents, L- 798106 (([(2 E) -N-[(5 -bromo- 2 -methoxyphenyl) -sulphonyl]- 3 -[2 ¢-(2 -naphthyl-methyl) phenyl]acrylamide) and its 5 ¢-chloro analogue L- 826266 (Belley et al., 2006). Muscle tension in isolated preparations of thoracic aorta and vas deferens (electrical-field stimulation) from Dunkin-Hartley male guinea-pigs (600 - 800 g) was recorded. EP 3 agonism (17 - phenyl PGE 2 or ONO-AE- 248) on aorta was measured under priming with phenylephrine (500 - 1500 nM). Selectivity of prostanoid ligands was confirmed using human recombinant prostanoid receptor FLIPR assays (co-transfection with chimeric G-protein cDNAs to allow activation of Ca 2 +flux / HEK- 293 EBNA cells). L- 798106 and L- 826266 (50 - 1000 nM) slowly inhibited established contraction of the guinea-pig aorta to the primed EP 3 agonist (incomplete at 60 min) in contrast to faster block on vas deferens. Exposure of aorta to antagonist for 3 h resulted in much greater block and parallel displacement of the EP 3 agonist log concentrationresponse curve; pA 2 value = 7. 58 and 7. 96 respectively. Phentolamine (100 nM) rapidly inhibited phenylephrine / EP 3 agonist responses. The potent TP antagonist BMS- 180291 (<b>Ifetroban)</b> also slowly blocked U- 46619 contraction of the aorta at concentrations of 0. 3 - 3 nM (pA 2 = 9. 76), whereas the less potent antagonists EP- 045 and EP- 092 had faster onsets. Studies on histamine H 1 antagonists showed that doxepin (pA 2 = 9. 6), terfenadine (pA 2 = 7. 9) and astemizole (7. 5) were slow to reach steady-state block, while (+) -chlorpheniramine (9. 1) was faster and diphenhydramine (7. 8) even faster. The slow kinetics of L- 798106, L- 826266, terfenadine and astemizole, which have modest affinities, may relate to their very high lipophilicity (clogP = 6. 87, 7. 39, 6. 54 and 5. 64 repectively; ChemAxon software). In contrast, the slow kinetics of BMS- 180291 and doxepin (cLogP = 3. 60 and 3. 59) are probably a consequence of their high affinity for TP and H 1 receptors respectively. Care is needed in using highly lipophiic EP 3 antagonists to elucidate receptor involvement...|$|E
