5|$|A {{person with}} cholangitis may {{complain}} of abdominal pain (particularly {{in the right}} upper quadrant of the abdomen), fever, rigors (uncontrollable shaking) {{and a feeling of}} uneasiness (malaise). Some may report jaundice (yellow <b>discoloration</b> of the skin and the whites of the eyes).|$|E
5|$|<b>Discoloration</b> {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth <b>discoloration.</b> Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue <b>discoloration</b> may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
5|$|Prior to a 2006 {{match against}} Arminia Bielefeld in Munich, Michael Rensing {{peppered}} Kahn with practice shots. One shot hit Kahn {{squarely in the}} eye, causing enough swelling and <b>discoloration</b> {{to keep him from}} playing. With Rensing in goal, Bayern Munich won the match 2–0.|$|E
30|$|<b>Discolorations</b> {{are often}} {{encountered}} on stone surfaces of sculptures housed indoor or exhibited outdoor and then re-located indoor. Among the available stones, marble {{is one of}} the most used by artists of all times to carve sculptures. Therefore, the study of marble <b>discolorations,</b> typically ranging from black to grey and from brown to orange, is a relevant subject in the field of conservation of cultural heritage. Although <b>discolorations,</b> and in particular brown <b>discolorations,</b> represent a widespread alteration, scientific literature on this specific subject is limited. While in some instances technical investigations clearly identified the causes of the <b>discolorations,</b> in many other cases they are still debatable.|$|R
40|$|Most {{conventional}} smoothing and denoising meth-ods {{for color}} images deal with each color channel inde-pendently, {{which results in}} <b>discolorations</b> due to unbal-ancing {{the relation between the}} color components. In this paper, we propose a smoothing algorithm to reduce <b>discolorations</b> based on ”color-lines”. Our iterative al-gorithm consists of a local color decomposition step by color-line vectors and an iterative filtering step. Our numerical simulation shows that the method improves image quality with less <b>discolorations</b> while keeping the smoothing capability. 1...|$|R
50|$|Extrinsic <b>discolorations</b> {{are common}} and have many {{different}} causes. The same range of factors {{are capable of}} staining the surface of restorations (e.g., composite fillings, porcelain crowns). Some extrinsic <b>discolorations</b> that are allowed to remain {{for a long time}} may become intrinsic.|$|R
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, {{but it may also}} be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown <b>discoloration</b> of the urine.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red <b>discoloration</b> of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow <b>discoloration</b> of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
40|$|In this {{literature}} study, a classification of severe <b>discolorations</b> and a summary over {{the options for}} different dental treatments have been described. Various causes of these severe <b>discolorations</b> are presented and how the mechanisms behind tooth <b>discolorations</b> affect {{the outcome of a}} treatment or treatment options. Finally, the aesthetic outcome of a possible bleaching treatment of the different classified <b>discolorations</b> is discussed. In the management of patients with stained teeth {{it is very important to}} know and understand the mechanisms behind tooth <b>discolorations</b> as well as the clinical features of different types of tooth staining, in order to make a correct diagnosis. The teeth are an integrated part of facial aesthetics and are involved in a complex social, cultural and psychological interaction. For people with severe <b>discolorations,</b> bleaching can be an important and valuable treatment. Brown and yellow staining are easier to change compared to grey and blue stains which are mostly resistant to bleaching. <b>Discolorations</b> located in the gingival area have a poor prognosis. However, recent research has shown that for example tetracycline-stained teeth that often have a grey-blue staining may demand longer bleaching treatments, from one to 12 months, but it is almost impossible to predict the result of such a treatment. Clinical research has shown that it is best to try bleaching first, as a patient may be pleased with the outcome of this treatment and thus the need for veneers or replacement with full crowns will be eliminated. There are no guidelines telling the dental practitioner when it is correct to carry out bleaching or operative treatment. Therefore, in cases with aesthetic problems, it is important to understand the self-perceived opinion of the patient in the treatment planning...|$|R

5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or <b>discoloration,</b> and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Ferrochromium alloy is commercially {{produced}} from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was {{the discovery that}} steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and <b>discoloration</b> by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin <b>discoloration</b> with this combination.|$|E
50|$|Alpha hydroxy acid peels (using 50% {{concentrations}} or greater) may remove skin <b>discolorations.</b> Only {{a qualified}} physician should perform {{these types of}} facial peels.|$|R

5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish <b>discoloration</b> of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue <b>discoloration</b> of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish <b>discoloration</b> of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E

5|$|Two {{to three}} tablespoons of ReaLemon lemon juice has the {{equivalent}} of the juice from one average-sized lemon. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime are used as ingredients in various recipes, such as in baking, grilling, and as an ingredient in marinades and salad dressings. ReaLemon can be used as an ingredient in hot tea, lemonade and hot lemonade, and in various cooked dishes and baked goods such as pies. ReaLemon and other lemon juices can be used to prevent browning <b>discoloration</b> from occurring in peeled or sliced potatoes. This is performed by soaking the sliced potatoes in a mixture of the lemon juice and water. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime must be refrigerated after the bottles are opened.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and <b>discoloration</b> of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing <b>discoloration,</b> deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E

50|$|Enamel microabrasion is a {{procedure}} in cosmetic dentistry {{used to improve}} {{the appearance of the}} teeth. Like tooth whitening it is used to remove <b>discolorations</b> of the tooth surface but microabrasion is a mechanical, rather than chemical, procedure.|$|R
50|$|Adverse effects {{associated}} with the MMR vaccine include fever, injection site pain and, in rare cases, red or purple <b>discolorations</b> on the skin known as thrombocytopenic purpura, or seizures related to fever (febrile seizure). Serious side effects are extremely rare.|$|R
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow <b>discoloration</b> and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
