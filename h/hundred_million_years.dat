Set mainly in Paris in 1979, the plot concerns a scheme by an alien, Scaroth, {{to steal the}} Mona Lisa to finance experiments in time travel {{in the hope of}} averting the accident that marooned him on Earth four <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> previously, which began the existence of life on the planet as well.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago, California lay at {{the bottom}} of a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E

5|$|Thermal {{modeling}} of Saturn's moon Dione, {{which is similar}} to Ariel in size, density, and surface temperature, suggests that solid state convection could have lasted in Ariel's interior for billions of years, and that temperatures in excess of 173 K (the melting point of aqueous ammonia) may have persisted near its surface for several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> after formation, and near a billion years closer to the core.|$|E
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, {{which is a}} bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E

5|$|The stones used to {{backfill}} the quarry are those which underlie the Givetian limestone extracted in the Bellignies quarry. There is , a coarse shelly limestone, deep gray, yellowish when it outcrops, detrital ferruginous dated to the Lower Cenomanian epoch, a <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago. There is clay and very glauconitic marl of the Upper Cenomanian stage, enriched by a pebble conglomerate paléozoïc stones. These rocks contain Praeactinocamax plenus, Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana and radiated fossils: Janira quadricostata, Cyprina ligeriensis, Arca mailleana. There is also bluish marl of the Turonian.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years.</b> This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years.</b> In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E

5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years,</b> resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E
5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-Neptunian objects after several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years.</b> Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E

40|$|Malaria parasites {{belong to}} an ancient lineage that diverged very early from the main branch of eukaryotes. The {{approximately}} 90 -member plasmodial kinome includes a majority of eukaryotic protein kinases that clearly cluster within the AGC, CMGC, TKL, CaMK and CK 1 groups found in yeast, plants and mammals, testifying to the ancient ancestry of these families. However, several <b>hundred</b> <b>millions</b> <b>years</b> of independent evolution, and the specific pressures brought about by first a photosynthetic and then a parasitic lifestyle, {{led to the emergence}} of unique features in the plasmodial kinome. These include taxon-restricted kinase families, and unique peculiarities of individual enzymes even when they have homologues in other eukaryotes. Here, we merge essential aspects of all three malaria-related communications that were presented at the Evolution of Protein Phosphorylation meeting, and propose an integrated discussion of the specific features of the parasite's kinome and phosphoproteome...|$|R
5|$|The current Laplace {{resonance}} {{is unable}} to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; {{if it is not}} pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago. Because Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively low—on average 0.0015—tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.|$|E
25|$|When Phobos is {{eventually}} {{torn apart by}} tidal forces, {{it is likely that}} a fraction of the debris will form a planetary ring around Mars. This ring may last for between one million and one <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neptune's regular moons Proteus and Larissa {{are thought}} to have passed through a 1:2 {{resonance}} a few <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> ago; the moons have drifted away from each other since then because Proteus is outside a synchronous orbit and Larissa is within one. Passage through the resonance is thought to have excited both moons' eccentricities to a degree that has not since been entirely damped out.|$|E
50|$|Most natural (or biological) {{materials}} are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents {{from which they}} are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from <b>hundreds</b> of <b>million</b> <b>years</b> of evolution, are inspiring the design of novel materials with exceptional physical properties for high performance in adverse conditions. Their defining characteristics such as hierarchy, multifunctionality, and the capacity for self-healing, are currently being investigated.|$|R
50|$|Many fantastic rock {{figures and}} small valleys with steep {{vertical}} slopes have formed over <b>hundreds</b> of <b>millions</b> of <b>years</b> {{as a result}} of the natural processes of erosion, denudation, growth of mosses and lichens, and other natural factors.|$|R
50|$|In general, the {{sedimentary}} basement terranes become younger from West to East {{across the}} country, as the newer terranes were scraped off the subducting paleo-Pacific Plate, and accreted to {{the boundary of}} Gondwana over <b>hundreds</b> of <b>millions</b> of <b>years.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{more distant}} an object is, the younger it appears: its light has taken longer to reach human observers. Because the {{universe}} is expanding, as the light travels it becomes red-shifted, and these objects are therefore easier to see if viewed in the infrared.

25|$|Other mechanisms, such as melting from a {{meteorite}} impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, {{and the outer}} several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites {{in the last few}} <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{classify}} insect endosymbionts in {{two broad}} categories, 'Primary' and 'Secondary'.

They form obligate associations (see below), and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts exhibit a more recently developed association, are sometimes horizontally transferred between hosts, live in the hemolymph of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.|$|E
