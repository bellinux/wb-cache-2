500|$|By late 1985, Rangel {{was in a}} six-person race {{to become}} the next House Majority Whip, the third-highest ranked {{position}} in the House {{and for the first time}} up for election by the members rather than appointment by the Speaker. By October 1986 the race was heating up, with Rangel the underdog coming close to Representative Tony Coelho from California through use of his personal skills and Rangel arguing that the Democratic leadership needed better regional balance. However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the whip election, 167–78. Rangel attributed his loss to Coelho having funded the campaigns of many House members via his role as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, later saying, “I had never been so goddamn naive. I came to Washington as an experienced politician. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> miss Coelho’s contribution to members?” ...|$|E

500|$|Vanity Fair {{described}} Alan Partridge as [...] "a {{national treasure}} ... as cherished {{a part of}} British comedy heritage as John Cleese's Basil Fawlty and Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean." [...] According to Variety, in Britain [...] "Alan Partridge is a full-on phenomenon, a multiplatform fictional celebrity whose catchphrases, mangled metaphors and social ineptitude are the stuff of legend and good ratings." [...] The character is less well known outside the UK, but according to [...] director Adam McKay, [...] "every American comic knows who Steve is, whether it's Stiller or Ferrell or Jack Black or me ... and everyone watching those [...] DVDs had the same reaction. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> not know about this guy?"

500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E

Knowles addressed this in an interview with GQ magazine, saying [...] "I always battle with: <b>How</b> much <b>do</b> <b>I</b> reveal about myself? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> keep my humility? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> keep my spirit and the reality?

2500|$|After Hande Maxi, {{with its}} {{electronic}} and trance sound, Yener continued with that sound releasing [...] "Nasıl Delirdim?" [...] (<b>How</b> <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> Go Mad?) on 15 May 2007. The album included numerous tracks written and composed by Sezen Aksu. The first single featured was called, [...] "Kibir" [...] (Arrogance). The album was released with 72 000 copies and four different covers which included 3-dimensional artworks. The copies released later fashioned {{only one of}} these four covers. The themes on the album were mostly about a woman's worries about relationships dealing with about paranoia, letting go, being sad or mad and selfishness. The second single was almost obvious when the first single came out. It was called, [...] "Romeo"; a song co-written by Yener herself, dedicated to her boyfriend. [...] "Yalan Olmasın" [...] (Without a Lie) was released in January 2008 as a third, and final, single with accompanying music video. It did not achieve much success, however, for it did not chart at all in Turkey.|$|E
