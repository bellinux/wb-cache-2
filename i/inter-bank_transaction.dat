40|$|From American {{subprime}} crisis to European debt crisis, {{the problem of}} liquidity risk in commercial banks is never out of the public’s sight. At each financial crisis, banks {{are the first to}} get into a dilemma. Due to the implicit government guarantee and a macro-economic liquidity surplus, Chinese banking system has experienced {{a relatively small number of}} bankruptcy and liquidity crises, which makes it not urgent to manage liquidity risk. However, the 2013 June Currency Shortage in China exposes the severe potential liquidity difficulties. Therefore, this dissertation aims to study current status of liquidity risk and liquidity risk management in Chinese banking system in the post-crisis era. Through the analysis of a series of static indicators, such as the non-performing loan ratio, the loan-to-deposit ratio and the liquidity ratio, it is believed that Chinese commercial banks are still in a condition of excessive liquidity. However, under the influences of new features in financial operation, such as financial disintermediation, <b>inter-bank</b> <b>transaction</b> and off-balance-sheet business, the liquidity risk exposure in Chinese commercial banks enlarges. Additionally, through empirical study of determinants of the liquidity risk in Chinese commercial banks, it can be estimated that the liquidity risk in Chinese commercial banks is generally under greater role by internal factors than by external ones. Banks’ asset size and profitability replenish the liquidity to withstand risks, while higher equity-to-assets ratio and non-performing loan ratio intensify the risk exposure. Banks which have implemented Basel III standards face less likelihood of liquidity risk exposure than banks which have not implemented. After analysing the differences between Basel III and Chinese regulatory rules and differences in the liquidity risk management modes between other countries and China, it can be concluded that the diversified, hierarchical and elaborated tendency of liquidity risk management and regulation in China is necessary.

The first 3 numbers are for Location, the next 3 are for Bank. The last 3 {{are for a}} Branch in that location. The newer clearing systems uses an 11 digit alphanumeric code, called IFSC (Indian Financial System Code), where the first 4 characters represent the Bank and last 6 characters represent the Branch. The codes are used to uniquely identify the bank and its branch for <b>inter-bank</b> <b>transactions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gold {{certificates}} {{were issued}} from 1865 through 1934 and were redeemable in gold coin. Following the 1933 ban on gold {{ownership in the}} United States, they were recalled to be redeemed for United States Notes. They were issued in large size through 1929 and in small size thereafter. They were originally issued in denominations of $20, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000. A $50 note was added in 1882, followed by a $10 note in 1907. A $100,000 note which was used only for <b>inter-bank</b> <b>transactions</b> was also issued in 1934 but never {{made available to the}} general public. It is still illegal to own.|$|R

25|$|Currently printed {{denominations}} are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Notes {{above the}} $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in <b>inter-bank</b> <b>transactions</b> or by organized crime; {{it was the}} latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details. With {{the exception of the}} $100,000 bill (which was only issued as a Series 1934 Gold Certificate and was never publicly circulated; thus it is illegal to own), these notes are now collectors' items and are worth more than their face value to collectors.|$|R

In this study we used the GMDH-neural network method as an instrument for complicated non- linear trends especially with the limited observations. We employed the model {{in a bid to}} delineate relationship between bank efficiency which was proxied by output of banks (net profit-average of <b>inter-banks</b> <b>transactions</b> ratio) and electronic payment system including Automated Teller Machines (ATM) - POS Terminals - Branch PIN Pads and we present two models for each type of banks ownership and a model for all banks in Iran and compare them. The results show that {{despite the fact that the}} payment systems are an easy access for everybody, they don’t have the same effects and some of them have double effects on bank efficiency in different situations...|$|R
40|$|Financial crises are {{associated}} with reduced volumes and extreme levels of rates for term <b>inter-bank</b> <b>transactions,</b> such as in one-month and three-month LIBOR markets. We provide an explanation of such stress in term lending by modelling leveraged banks’ precautionary demand for liquidity. When adverse asset shocks materialize, a bank’s ability to roll over debt is impaired because of agency problems associated with high leverage. In turn, a bank’s propensity to hoard liquidity is increasing, or conversely its willingness to provide term lending is decreasing, in its rollover risk over the term of the loan. High levels of short-term leverage and illiquidity of assets can thus lead to low volumes and high rates for term borrowing, even for banks with profitable lending opportunities. In extremis, {{there can be a}} complete freeze in inter-bank markets. bank liquidity; bank loans; debt; financial leverage; interbank market; risk management...|$|R
50|$|During this reign {{the range}} of {{currency}} notes was extended up to one thousand dollars {{for the convenience of}} <b>inter-bank</b> clearing <b>transactions.</b> In 1915, it was decided to make a complete change {{in the design of the}} 50, 100 and 1000 dollar notes. These denominations were first issued to the public in February 1920, October 1919 and May 1917 respectively. They were printed by Thomas de la Rue. A 10,000 note was first issued in October 1922. This was not available to the public, but was used exclusively in inter-bank transfers.|$|R

40|$|Bilateral {{financial}} {{investments are}} not commonly available {{from a single}} source. Our database Finflows aims at centralising the information on bilateral capital financial stocks and financial flows in a single place. It provides estimates of external assets and liabilities flows between around 80 countries including those from European Union, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Russia, China, Brazil, India and the largest offshore countries. The database contains yearly data from 2000 to the last available year (in general with a 20 months delay). Initially developed by (Hobza & Zeugner, 2014) under {{the scope of the}} macroeconomic surveillance work, we provide bilateral financial investment links broken by class of investment such foreign direct investment, banking flows or portfolio investment following the Sixth Edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM 6, 2009). The specificity of this database {{lies in the fact that}} it includes official intermediated links either via European Central Bank’s funding or other official flows which were providing financial assistance to Euro-area countries in distress helping them to refinance their liabilities. We also consider the investment made during the quantitative easing program of the European Central Bank in 2010 and redirect those <b>inter-banking</b> <b>transactions</b> and customer payments that are settled, in real time, within the Euro-zone system when necessary. Another advantage of the database Finflows relies in the resolution of potential mismatch between countries’ declarations. JRC. B. 1 -Finance and Econom...|$|R
40|$|Learning market participants’ policy rate {{expectations}} is a {{major issue}} for central banks. The underlying {{reason for this is}} that the interest rate expectations of market participants may themselves contain information on market participants’ perceptions of the economic prospects, which decision-makers might want to incorporate into their own assessment of the outlook. Market participants’ expectations, however, cannot be observed directly and are difficult to quantify. Of the two most common approaches, we will discuss in detail the one where we infer market expectations from the prices of the financial instruments which are closely related to expectations. In properly functioning, liquid markets we can infer market participants’ expectations of future interest rates from the prices of and returns on government securities and <b>inter-bank</b> <b>transactions.</b> Before the onset of the financial crisis, BUBOR (Budapest Inter-bank Offered Rate) reflected market participants’ expectations of the interest rate relatively reliably, but since the deepening of the crisis, this has changed for a number of reasons, which we will also seek to pinpoint. The fact that BUBOR no longer reflects real market expectations, i. e. it distorts them, is all the more important as this measure serves as a benchmark rate for other financial products, among other things, for corporate loans. The loss of the information content of BUBOR means that the yield curve derived from returns on inter-bank market instruments provides a more accurate measure of market expectations if we exclude data on BUBOR fixings. Nevertheless, forward rate agreements (FRAs) settled on BUBOR remain suitable for the quantification of market participants’ expectations. However, in interpreting these, it is important that, in addition to credit and liquidity risk premia, the bias caused by BUBOR should also be taken into consideration. interest rates, expectations, financial markets, monetary policy. ...|$|R

50|$|On 28 September, Wheatley's {{independent}} review was published, recommending that an independent organisation with government and regulator representation, called the Tender Committee, manage {{the process of}} setting LIBOR under a new external oversight process for transparency and accountability. Banks that make submissions to LIBOR {{would be required to}} base them on actual <b>inter-bank</b> deposit market <b>transactions</b> and keep records of their transactions supporting those submissions. The review also recommended that individual banks' LIBOR submissions be published, but only after three months, to reduce the risk that they would be used as a measure of the submitting banks' creditworthiness. The review left open the possibility that regulators might compel additional banks to participate in submissions if an insufficient number do voluntarily. The review recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates such as the LIBOR, saying that existing criminal regulations for manipulation of financial instruments were inadequate.
