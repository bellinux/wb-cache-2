5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their {{connection to the}} means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E

Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, Krusty the Clown, is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a clown. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much to the delight of the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has a place to sit. During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of Satan's Little Helper) was the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of jurors of American Idol, since that several other programs with the opportunity of this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> were suddenly cancelled.|$|E

30|$|One of the regularities is {{that the}} {{estimate}} for required education {{is larger than the}} estimate for overeducation but both are positive. This means that overeducated workers earn more than correctly matched workers in the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> but less than correctly matched workers with the same education. However, our estimations reveal that the difference in the estimates is much larger for immigrants than for natives. Overeducated immigrants earn only slightly more than correctly matched workers in the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> but much less than correctly matched workers with the same education. Large wage differences between the jobs that correctly matched and mismatched immigrants with the same education have, and compressed wage distributions and no individual wage bargaining within occupations could be the explanation.|$|R
40|$|Grid environments have gain {{tremendous}} {{importance in}} recent years since application requirements increased drastically. The heterogeneity and geographic dispersion of grid resources and applications places some complex problems such as job scheduling. Most existing scheduling strategies in Grids only focus on one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Grid <b>jobs</b> which can be data-intensive or computation-intensive. However, only considering one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> in scheduling does not result in suitable scheduling {{in the viewpoint of}} all system, and sometimes causes wasting of resources on the other side. To address the challenge of simultaneously considering both <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs,</b> a new Cost-Based Job Scheduling (CJS) strategy is proposed in this paper. At one hand, CJS algorithm considers both data and computational resource availability of the network, and on the other hand, considering the corresponding requirements <b>of</b> each <b>job,</b> it determines a value called W to the job. Using the W value, the importance of two aspects (being data or computation intensive) for each job is determined, and then the job is assigned to the available resources. The simulation results with OptorSim show that CJS outperforms comparing to the existing algorithms mentioned in literature as number <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> increases...|$|R

40|$|Both {{human capital}} {{accumulation}} and Lazear contracts {{can explain the}} rais- ing wage of salary/wage worker through job experience or tenure. To distin- guish between these two effects, Lazear and Moore (1984) used self-employed workers' wage growth to partial out the effect of human capital accumulation from salary/wage workers' wage growth. When the human capital accumu- lation behavior is identical across two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs,</b> the difference in wage growth between salary/wage workers and self-employed workers are due to Lazear contract since self-employed workers' wage are determined by their productivity. However, in the model developed in this paper, when self- employed workers face more wage variation but enjoy a higher return for human capital, human capital accumulation for those two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> are shown to be different.
