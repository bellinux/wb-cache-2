There {{are two types of}} pedestrian dead-reckoning, the strapdown algorithm and the step-and-heading approach. Unlike the strapdown algorithm, which consists of the double integration of the three orthogonal accelerometer readings, the step-and-heading approach lacks the vertical displacement estimation.

Additionally, we found that with the pitch angle, five activities are distinguishable: standing, sitting, walking, walking up stairs and walking down stairs.

Four different handheld positions can be distinguished, i. e. pocket or bag, phoning, texting and swinging. We present a standalone inertial pocket navigation system. It only requires introducing the inertial measurement unit in the trousers’ pocket and walking freely.

It was the latter, the basic longitudinal texture, {{that was the most}} surprising find on the fracture surfaces of borosilicate glass. On the fracture surfaces of polymer thermoset glasses, the basic longitudinal texture has been interpreted as a remnant from the fracturing process, arising from an instability in the meniscus between air and a poly-mer layer softened or "'liquified " by the stresses of cracking. The meniscus instability results in an array of crack fingers preceding the nominal crack front. By analogy, it is suggested that the borosilicate glass fractures by a similar process, including the softening of the glass ahead of the crack front.
