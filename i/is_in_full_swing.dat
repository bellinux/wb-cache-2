500|$|While some reviewers {{considered}} Neverwinter Nights 2 {{superior to}} its predecessor, Neverwinter Nights, the sequel received lower overall review ratings. Implementation of the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 ruleset was praised as faithful to the pen-and-paper version, with GameDaily stating [...] "The 3.5 edition ruleset <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>swing</b> in Neverwinter Nights 2, where critical hits can devastate your entire party." [...] The game's representation of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting was also well received. The storyline was widely {{considered one of the}} game's strong points and an improvement over Neverwinter Nights. GameSpy stated that the single–player campaign was [...] "worthy of its exhaustive pedigree", and Game Informers reviewer said [...] "This title easily trumps the original NWN’s campaign with a vastly superior story and characters". Another reviewer declared it [...] "one of the best written games in history". [...] Aaron R. Conklin of The Wisconsin State Journal said, [...] "It'd be very easy to be turned off by the first mundane chapters of the game's sprawling plot.... Stick with it: Once your party hits Neverwinter (and reaches level seven or so), the proceedings become significantly more interesting—especially in terms of character interaction and development.... NWN2 is a masterpiece of storytelling and scope." [...] Conklin and Matt Slagle of Deseret News were pleased with the ethical choices in the game, with both noting approvingly that diplomacy was a very valid option that could succeed in place of combat.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{composition}} of the painting is in {{the contrast between the}} solemn jester (Stańczyk)– obviously the focus of the painting– and the lively ball going on in the background. Stańczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room, while a ball, hosted by the royal family, <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>swing</b> in the neighbouring hall. His appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester– gloomy, deep in thought. His seriousness is reinforced by his accessories: his marotte lies discarded on the floor, whereas a holy medallion of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa can be seen on his torso. The wrinkled carpet at Stanczyk's feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily into the chair upon reading the letter, or through a nervous shifting of the feet thereafter. On the table lies a letter likely announcing that Poland has lost Smolensk (now in Russia) to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, causing Stańczyk's sorrow and reflection on his fatherland's fate. The letter seems to have been discarded by some official, and only the jester realizes its significance– while the rulers are partying, celebrating the recent victory at the battle of Orsha, disregarding the bad news about Smolensk. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} the letter bears the year 1533 (A.d. MDXXXIII) and the name [...] "Samogitia", a province of the Commonwealth. [...] The note is incongruent with the actual date of the fall of Smolensk in 1514, and is a matter of ongoing debate, with an outright mistake by the meticulous Matejko, known for use of symbolism and iconography, being unlikely. [...] Another symbol, a lute, symbol of glory, is being carried by a midget, stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in Matejko's time; this suggests a decline of the Jagiellon dynasty's fortunes. The window is thrown - or was blown - open, ruffling the tablecloth and alluding to an upset of the present order. [...] Through the open window, the darkened profile of Wawel Cathedral in Krakow is visible - the site of the coronation of Polish kings. [...] Next to it, a comet is seen– a portent of ill fortune. [...] The imagery of downfall is completed with the inclusion of the three stars of Orion's Belt seen above and to the left of the cathedral spire. [...] In Greek mythology, Orion was a powerful hunter blinded by ego and his own greatness, but was ultimately brought down by the pinprick of a scorpion's sting.|$|E

2500|$|In September and October {{the days}} get rapidly shorter, and in {{northern}} areas the sun disappears {{from the sky}} entirely. [...] As the amount of solar radiation available to the surface rapidly decreases, the temperatures follow suit. [...] The sea ice begins to refreeze, and eventually gets a fresh snow cover, causing it to reflect even more of the dwindling amount of sunlight reaching it. [...] Likewise, the northern land areas receive their winter snow cover, which combined with the reduced solar radiation at the surface, ensures {{an end to the}} warm days those areas may experience in summer. [...] By November, winter <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>swing</b> in most of the Arctic, and the small amount of solar radiation still reaching the region does not {{play a significant role in}} its climate.|$|E
2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day.

Indeed, after nightfall, when they are all lighted up for the evening technical classes and when their testing machinery <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>swing</b> and there are students {{going in and out}} in overall suits, people have often mistaken the university, or this newer part of it, for a factory.

Trollope fills very adequately a space between Thackeray and Dickens, of whom the former deals for the most part with the upper 'ten', the latter with the lower 'ten'; Trollope with the suburban and country-town 'ten'; the three together giving us a very complete and detailed picture of the lives led by our grandmothers and grandfathers, whose hearts were in the same place as our own, but whose manners of speech, of behaviour and of dress have now entered into the vague region known as the 'days of yore'.|$|E
