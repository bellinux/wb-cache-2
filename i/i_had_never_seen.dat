[...] Senator Paul Simon of Illinois also received a thousand calls.

I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It frightened me to death. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, then I would have said so. I did not know then. I do not know now." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{assumed the}} role of {{unofficial}} [...] "protector" [...] for her husband after the attempted assassination in 1981. On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by troubled 25-year old John Hinckley, Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen [...] "emergency rooms before, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> one like this – with my husband in it." [...] She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife.|$|E

500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a performer perform like James Brown, and {{right then and there}} I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{impact on}} him was {{likewise}} emphatic: [...] "I saw {{a cousin of}} mine dance to... 'Hound Dog' and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her get up and be moved so much by anything. It really impressed me, {{the power of the}} music. I started getting records immediately after that." [...] By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as [...] "mesmerizing... like someone from another planet." [...] After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School.|$|E
500|$|In 1913, Chabas {{stated that}} he was [...] "pained and humiliated" [...] by the {{controversy}} over September Morn, though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as [...] "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements {{that it was his}} masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it [...] "was [...] wife's favorite picture". At {{the time of his death}} in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy." [...] However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, [...] "Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first result}} {{had already been}} {{determined}} by G. Bauer in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called hypergeometric series, which had first been researched by Leonhard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Hardy found these results [...] "much more intriguing" [...] than Gauss's work on integrals. After seeing Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy commented that the theorems [...] "defeated me completely; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything in the least like them before". He figured that Ramanujan's theorems [...] "must be true, because, {{if they were not}} true, no one would have the imagination to invent them". Hardy asked a colleague, J. E. Littlewood, {{to take a look at}} the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were [...] "certainly the most remarkable I have received" [...] and said that Ramanujan was [...] "a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power". One colleague, E. H. Neville, later remarked that [...] "not one [...] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world".|$|E
500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since {{listening to his}} group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous {{to work with him}} on the album: [...] "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: [...] "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." [...] " [...] On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished [...] "My Name Is" [...] in an hour. [...] Three other songs, including [...] "Role Model", were also recorded that day.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{learned of}} the deaths on the {{following}} morning when National Security Council staffer Michael Forrestal rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ngô brothers' alleged suicides. According to General Maxwell Taylor, [...] "Kennedy leaped {{to his feet and}} rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before." [...] Kennedy had planned that Ngô Đình Diệm would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. recalled that the US President was [...] "somber and shaken". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was [...] "particularly abhorrent" [...] and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that [...] "It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam." [...] When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied [...] "No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country." ...|$|E

500|$|O'Bannon soon {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} work on Alejandro Jodorowsky's adaptation of Dune, a project which took him to Paris for six months. Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose work gave him ideas for his science-fiction story including Chris Foss, H. R. Giger, and Jean [...] "Moebius" [...] Giraud. O'Bannon was impressed by Foss's covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work [...] "disturbing": [...] "His paintings {{had a profound effect}} on me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster." [...] After the Dune project collapsed, O'Bannon returned to Los Angeles to live with Shusett and the two revived his Memory script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about gremlins infiltrating a B-17 bomber during World War II, and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story. The working title of the project was now Star Beast, but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to Alien after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the script. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as both a noun and an adjective. Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that would burst out of him; he thought this would be an interesting plot device by which the alien could get aboard the ship.|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever {{you have to do to}} get me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E
