40|$|Gallic acid (3, 4, 5 -trihydroxybenzoic acid, GA), {{a natural}} {{phenolic}} acid widely found in gallnuts, tea leaves and various fruits, possesses several bioactivities against inflammation, oxidation, and carcinogenicity. The beneficial effect of GA on {{the reduction of}} animal <b>hepatofibrosis</b> has been indicated due to its antioxidative property. However, the cytotoxicity of GA autoxidation causing cell death has also been reported. Herein, we postulated that GA might target activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs), the cell type responsible for <b>hepatofibrosis,</b> to mitigate the process of fibrosis. The molecular cytotoxic mechanisms that GA exerted on aHSCs were then analyzed. The results indicated that GA elicited aHSC programmed cell death through TNF-α-mediated necroptosis. GA induced significant oxidative stress through the suppression of catalase activity and the depletion of glutathione (GSH). Elevated oxidative stress triggered the production of TNF-α facilitating the undergoing of necroptosis through the up-regulation of key necroptotic regulatory proteins TRADD and receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP 3), and the inactivation of caspase- 8. Calmodulin and calpain- 1 activation were engaged, which promoted subsequent lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). The TNF-α antagonist (SPD- 304) and the RIP 1 inhibitor (necrostatin- 1, Nec- 1) confirmed GA-induced TNFR 1 -mediated necroptosis. The inhibition of RIP 1 by Nec- 1 diverted the cell death from necroptosis to apoptosis, as the activation of caspase 3 and the increase of cytochrome c. Collectively, {{this is the first}} report indicating that GA induces TNF signaling-triggered necroptosis in aHSCs, which may offer an alternative strategy for the amelioration of liver fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|Phragmites karka {{has been}} {{reported}} for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Here, extracts of leaf and rhizome of the plant were individually investigated in CCl 4 -induced <b>hepatofibrosis</b> in male Wistar rats by administering CCl 4 intraperitoneally biweekly for 6 weeks. Afterwards the animals were investigated for liver fibrosis at biochemical, molecular and histological levels, and it showed a profound increase (p< 0. 001) in elevation of serum levels of transaminases, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, mRNA expression of α smooth muscle actin, collagen and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), and extracellular matrix deposition and perilobular necrosis. Both extracts markedly (p< 0. 001) decreased the elevated levels of these markers. Histopathological investigations also substantiated the above results by exhibiting a decreased in extracellular matrix deposition in post-treatment animals. In conclusion, both extracts had substantially modified the biochemical and molecular markers of liver fibrosis, in addition to histological improvement in architecture of liver...|$|E
40|$|Subject {{headings}} liver cirrhosis/therapy; liver cirrhosis/pathology; liver cirrhosis, expremental/therapy; tetrandrine/therapeutic use Tetrandrine (Tet) is {{the main}} alkaloid isolated from the lumpy root of Stephania tetrandra s. Moore. Its molecular formula is C 33 H 42 N 2 O 6 and its chemical structure belongs to a dibenzy-isoquindine. Modern pharmacological studies have proved that Tet is a Ca 2 + antagonist, which acts mainly on the calcium channel of cell to block the cross-membrane transportation of calcium ions {{as well as their}} intracellular distribution and utilization. In recent years, the actions of Tet in preventing and treating <b>hepatofibrosis</b> have gradually attracted attention of more investigators. With the establishment of the technique of liver cell isolation and culture and advance in technology of molecular biology, studies of the antihepafibrotic effects of Tet have probed into the cellular, subcellular and molecular levels. This article is to give a brief review of such researches over the past few years...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the antihepatofibrotic effects of CGXII, an aqueous extract which is composed of A. iwayomogi, A. xanthioides, and S. miltiorrhiza, against dimethylnitrosamine- (DMN-) induced <b>hepatofibrosis.</b> Male Sprague Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with 10 [*]mg/kg of DMN for 4 weeks (three consecutive days weekly). Rats were orally given distilled water, CGXII (50 or 100 [*]mg/kg), or dimethyl dimethoxy biphenyl dicarboxylate (50 [*]mg/kg) daily. DMN injection caused substantial alteration of total body weight and liver and spleen mass, whereas they were notably normalized by CGXII. CGXII treatment also markedly attenuated the elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, hepatic lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonyl contents. Collagen accumulation in hepatic tissue evidenced by histopathological analysis and quantitative assessment of hepatic hydroxyproline was ameliorated by CGXII. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed decreased α-smooth muscle actin supporting the antihepatofibrotic effect of CGXII. The profibrogenic cytokines transforming growth factor-β, platelet-derived growth factor-β, and connective tissue growth factor were increased by DMN injection. Administration of CGXII normalized the protein and gene expression levels of these cytokines. Our findings suggest that CGXII lowers the levels of profibrogenic cytokines and thereby exerts antifibrotic effects...|$|E
40|$|Liver {{fibrosis}} {{represents the}} consequences of a sustained wound healing response to chronic liver injury which could be caused by viral, autoimmune, drugs, and so on. Unfortunately, there was no effective therapy available for liver fibrosis in clinic. In this study, we identified the anti-fibrotic effects of 1, 7 -dihydroxy- 3, 4, 8 -trimethoxyxanthone (ZYC- 1) on the dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) -induced rat model. ZYC- 1 was isolated from Swertia punicea Hemsl and was administrated to DMN-induced rat model. ZYC decreased the hyaluronic acid (HA), type IV collagen (CIV) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) levels and inhibited the expression of α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF- 1 β). The anti-fibrotic effect of ZYC- 1 was also confirmed by Sirius Red staining. Finally, we identified 42 differentially expressed proteins by using proteomics analysis after ZYC- 1 treatment, of which 17 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated. These Most of the 42 proteins are involved in the oxidative stress pathway, the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway and the amino acid metabolism pathway. Our study presented the first elucidated mechanisms of xanthone on liver fibrosis in vivo. This study pointed out that ZYC- 1 may be used as a lead compound for <b>hepatofibrosis</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background: The endocannabinoid {{system is}} {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. However, most of the findings in this area have come from experimental studies in animal models or clinical trials on chronic hepatitis C. The roles of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB 1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB 2) in <b>hepatofibrosis</b> in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) have not been studied fully. This study aimed to explore the relationship between liver fibrosis and the expression of CB 1 and CB 2 in patients with CHB. Methods: Eighty liver biopsy specimens from patients with CHB (52 male, 28 female) were analyzed in this study. Fibrosis was staged on a scale of 1 to 4 (F 1 to F 4, with F 4 defining cirrhosis). There were 20 samples for each fibrosis stage. The expression of hepatic alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), CB 1, and CB 2 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Hepatic CB 1 and CB 2 were expressed in all patients with CHB. The degree of fibrosis was significantly associated with the increased expression of CB 1 and CB 2 in CHB. Furthermore a significant increase in cells positive for both CB 1 and CB 2 was detected in stage 3 and stage 4 disease compared to stage 1 and stage 2 disease. There was a strong positive association between CB 1 expression and α-SMA expression. Moreover, double immunofluorescence staining for CB 1 and α-SMA demonstrated that activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) express CB 1. Conclusions: The hepatic expression of CB 1 and CB 2 plays an important role during the progression of fibrosis induced by CHB. Endogenous activation of CB 1 receptors in patients with CHB enhances fibrogenesis by direct effect on activated HSCs...|$|E
