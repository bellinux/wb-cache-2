5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. <b>He</b> <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|He {{converted}} from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009, {{along with several}} other Phillies pitching prospects. Around that time, he also, {{at the suggestion of}} the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief, lowered his release point to his current low angle. Success did not manifest itself immediately, as he still posted a 4.04 ERA in 2009, his first season in relief, but in 2010, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> ERA to 2.91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies High-A affiliate. At the end of the 2010 season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League. He spent the 2011 season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, accruing a 0–1 record and a 3.05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games. Thereafter, the Phillies added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.|$|E

25|$|The delay {{caused by}} {{fundraising}} allowed the French to invade Gascony, and threaten the English ports while the English conducted widespread piracy in the Channel. Edward proclaimed himself king of France {{to encourage the}} Flemish to rise in open rebellion against the French king and won a significant naval victory at the Battle of Sluys, where the French fleet was almost completely destroyed. Inconclusive fighting continued at the Battle of Saint-Omer and the Siege of Tournai (1340), but with both sides running out of money, the fighting ended with the Truce of Espléchin. Edward III had achieved nothing of military value and English political opinion was against him.

25|$|Commius, Caesar's Atrebatian ally, later {{switched}} sides, {{fighting in}} Vercingetorix's rebellion. After {{a number of}} unsuccessful engagements with Caesar's forces, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> losses and fled to Britain. Sextus Julius Frontinus, in his Strategemata, describes how Commius and his followers, with Caesar in pursuit, boarded their ships. Although the tide was out and the ships still beached, Commius ordered the sails raised. Caesar, still some distance away, assumed the ships were afloat and called off the pursuit. Archaeologist John Creighton believes that this anecdote was a legend, and that Commius was sent to Britain as a friendly king {{as part of his}} truce with Mark Antony. Commius established a dynasty in the Hampshire area, known from coins of Gallo-Belgic type. Verica, the king whose exile prompted Claudius's conquest of AD 43, styled himself a son of Commius.|$|E
25|$|Pichegru ordered Saint-Cyr, a mere {{lieutenant}} colonel, to take {{command of}} Pierre's brigade on 6 December. After his brigade was reinforced, Saint-Cyr moved on Berstheim on the 8th. The Royalists taunted the Republicans, asking {{if they were}} bringing them more artillery to capture. Saint-Cyr advanced his light troops {{to the edge of}} the village before pulling back. The émigré infantry under General Gelb and cavalry led by Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien rushed in pursuit. On this day the Royalists were mauled and Gelb was killed while Enghien's coat was riddled with bullet holes. The Duke of Bourbon narrowly escaped death. When <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> way into the 19th Line Infantry, a Republican officer recognized him and saluted with his sword rather than running him through. On 9 December, Saint-Cyr advanced on Berstheim again and was surprised to find that the Royalists had retired. This move was part of Wurmser's deliberate withdrawal to the Moder.|$|E

25|$|In a {{press conference}} November 5, 2006, Chen rebutted the charges against his wife and members of his Presidential office. He said that Taiwan {{government}} offices advised him to prepare the receipts in such a fashion, and that {{after six years of}} doing so, it is strange that they would never mention an irregularity if it was not the right way to do it. He promised that all of the money actually went to diplomatic missions and did not go into any private pockets. Furthermore, he mentioned that when he took office, he thought his salary was so excessive that <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> own salary in half, and that reduction is more than the amount he is accused of embezzling, so {{there is no need for}} him to take that money. In addition, he said that if the charges against his wife were proven in a court of law just as they were charged, then he would at that time step down as President of the Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} a Carson City Silver Dollar match between John Tenta and Big Bubba, who was {{accompanied}} by Jimmy Hart. Attached {{to one of the}} ringposts by straps was a tall steel pole, with a sock of silver coins hanging from the top. At the start of the match, both attempted to get the sock but were stopped by the other. Bubba climbed the turnbuckles but Tenta forced him to drop onto the top turnbuckle. After performing an atomic drop onto the turnbuckle, Tenta tossed Bubba to the outside. Tenta attempted to remove the straps. Bubba came back and uses a belt to choke Tenta. He then used athletic tape to tape Tenta's left wrist to the middle rope and continued attacking Tenta with the belt. As Bubba cut Tenta's hair with scissors, Tenta performed a low blow. Using the scissors, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> hand free and attempted to cut the straps. Bubba stopped him, and performed a spinebuster. Bubba then told Hart to climb the pole. As Hart got the sock, Tenta performed a scoop slam. Tenta grabbed the sock from Hart, hit Bubba with it, and pinned Bubba for the victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{police raid}} on the school, which housed protesters linked to the Genoa Social Forum, took place {{a few minutes before}} midnight when most guests were already asleep. The raid was {{initiated}} by mobile police units from Rome, followed by more units from Genoa and Milan. Battalions of the Carabinieri did not actively participate in the raid, but limited themselves to surround the perimeter and areas adjacent to the school. Mark Covell, a British journalist, was the first person who met the police outside the building and was assaulted, leaving him in a coma. During the raid the police violently attacked those who were in the school, injuring 82 people {{out of a total of}} 93 arrested. Among the arrested, 63 were taken to hospital and 19 were taken to the police station of Bolzaneto. According to the reconstruction of events given in subsequent investigations, evidence was planted after the raid to justify the brutality of the raid. Senior police officers planted two Molotov cocktails recovered elsewhere in the school, delivered to them by General Valerio Donnini that afternoon. Police also planted construction tools, hammers and knives from a nearby construction site and claimed they belonged to anarchist groups housed in the building. A police officer, Massimo Nucera, showed a slash in his bulletproof vest, claiming he was knifed by a violent demonstrator. However, the knife was never identified. He was later convicted of forgery and defamation, and it was later revealed that <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> own vest to claim resistors were violent, and thus justify the brutality of the raid.|$|E
5000|$|One of his {{performance}} {{works from the}} 1980s was documented in the artists' periodical Force Mental.

Against the wall he hangs photocopies of Hitler's head. Enlargements whereby the moustache is growing bigger (till A3 format). Bleus sticks then stamps, the same as of which his costume is made of and stamps them with his number-stamp: 42.292. Then he sticks a naked girl full with stamps of 1/2fr and stamps them with the number stamp. Finally <b>he</b> <b>cuts</b> off <b>his</b> Hitler-moustache and breaks a mirror." [...] Another fascinating performance of Bleus is called 'Value Shredder' (1982).|$|R

Dougan went on to host a half-hour show on BBC Radio Birmingham, which previewed the weekend's football. He published a second autobiography, The Sash He Never Wore, in 1972 (in 1997, he republished the book under the name The Sash He Never Wore – 25 Years On).|$|E
500|$|Van Vleet {{remained}} {{loyal to}} his local Rockford Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) club team rather than accept offers to more high-profile teams in Chicago.

If they see you competing and winning with guys maybe I shouldn't be winning with, that's maybe even an advantage for me."

How you?" [...] Despite his strong comedic qualities, Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that [...] "there is a frightening side to Cary that no one can quite put their finger on". Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image.|$|E
