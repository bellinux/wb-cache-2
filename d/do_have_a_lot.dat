5000|$|The {{reviews of}} Chrononauts leans towards the positive. Gamers at BoardGameGeek.com gave the game an average rating of 6.23 (out of 10) as of March 22, 2016. Out of the Box {{columnist}} Kenneth Hite wrote:And I do love all that, {{but the game}} itself needs more of the first part and less of the 'scavenger hunt through time' aspect that unfortunately dominates game play — the various victory conditions are mechanically unbalanced, leading to a de-emphasis of the time changing mechanic that is Looney’s best idea for this game.Spotlight on Games' 1001 Nights of Gaming review sub-site gave the game a personal rating of 6 as it has some well designed ID goals while others are [...] "poorly integrated."

5000|$|In December 2012, it was {{announced}} that an upcoming storyline would see Tracy begin a relationship with Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis), the brother of Carla Connor (Alison King). Speaking of the storyline a Coronation Street source said: [...] "Tracy and Rob are a match made in soap heaven, They will be fiery, passionate and out to cause trouble." [...] Baylis went on to say: [...] "Watch this space - interestingly, Tracy Barlow comes onto his radar. [...] That is an interesting combination. Without a doubt, he sees something of himself in Tracy and finds her intriguing!" [...] Ford admitted: [...] "She Tracy likes the fact that he's quite feisty - it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!" [...] Asked about the kind of a dynamic between Rob and Tracy, Baylis told Digital Spy: [...] "There's a lot of joyful banter - they challenge each other in a fun way. They're quite similar, they can see those similarities and they <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun together. They put a smile on each other's faces, and we'll just have to see how it goes from there." [...] Asked if Rob can hold his own when it comes to Tracy, Baylis replied: [...] ""Definitely, otherwise he wouldn't get involved. He is aware of the whole situation that happened with Ryan last year, but he's got a few more years on Ryan and he's been round the block a few times. Rob definitely wouldn't get involved in something that he didn't think he could handle. But Rob does have an arrogant side, and he feels like he could deal with anything. That's one of Rob's main flaws. I've really enjoyed working with Kate Ford on the storyline - we've had an absolute blast. We've been working a lot together, and hopefully the working relationship that we've built up behind the scenes will come across on screen. I'm looking forward to seeing that unfold myself." [...] When asked how Rob first gets Tracy's attention, Ford told All About Soap: [...] "Well, Tracy's going off shopping in town and she gets into a taxi at exactly the same time as Rob. She demands that he leave, as it's her taxi and not his. He refuses to move though, and when Steve asks them where they're going and they both say the city centre at the same time, they share a smile and end up going in the cab together. She likes the fact that he's quite feisty - it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!" [...] Ford also stated that not only is Tracy attracted to Rob, she realises that it would also annoy Michelle (Kym Marsh), adding: [...] "If he had got out of the taxi, she probably wouldn't have fancied him. He's quite easy on the eye too, of course. Plus, he hangs round with Michelle, and if Tracy and Rob were an item, it would annoy her - that's another good reason for Tracy." [...] On Tracy's reaction to being asked out by Rob, she said: [...] "She's quite annoyed at first and she turns him down. But he persists and he flatters her, so she thinks, why not? I think he's like a nicer version of Charlie, so maybe. He's got the bad lad streak, he's ruthless, but he's nowhere near as cruel as Charlie." ...|$|E
