40|$|A cone {{calorimeter}} {{with air}} supply box {{around the fire}} test zone was shown to reproduce all the classic features of compartment fires and hence could {{provide a basis for}} the determination of toxic gases emitted from materials in fires, under realistic test conditions. Direct hot exhaust gas sampling was used from a small chimney attached to the cone heater outlet and <b>heated</b> <b>sample</b> lines, <b>pumps</b> and filters were used to transport the <b>sample</b> to a <b>heated</b> Temet FTIR, calibrated for all the toxic gases of interest in fire toxicity. Three aircraft seat material were tested, two seat covers of fabric and leather and the seat foam. All the materials were from commercial suppliers to the aircraft industry. Ventilation conditions in the fires were typical of those on aircraft at 9 - 15 ACH. All three material samples had S and N in their composition, the S from the fire retardants and N from the use of an acrylic fibre in the seat covers and of PUF in the seat foam. As a consequence SO₂ and HCN were major toxic species in all the material fires. In all the fires HF was detected and for the foam and the leather seat cover HCl was detected and these indicate the presence of halogen based fire retardants in the material composition. Thus, most of the toxic gases measured were due to the presence of S, N, F and Cl in the material composition. Other toxic gases detected were the more conventional fire toxic gases CO, formaldehyde, acrolein and benzene. Only in the fabric fire was NO₂ significant. The peak toxicity occurred in the initial flaming combustion and the toxicity order was leather > fabric > foam on both an LC₅₀ and COSHH 15 min toxic assessment basis. Both toxic assessment methods showed the same group of toxic gases were important and only their relative importance changed between the toxic assessment methods. It was concluded that toxic gas assessment should be added to current material test programmes on fire behavior and that the cone calorimeter, modified as in the present work, was a good basis for the toxic gas measurements...|$|R
40|$|Life cycle climate {{performance}} (LCCP) is {{an evaluation}} {{method by which}} heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R) systems can be evaluated for the global warming impact {{over the course of}} their complete life cycle. LCCP is more inclusive than previous metrics such as total equivalent warming impact (TEWI). It is calculated as the sum of direct and indirect emissions generated over the lifetime of the system â€œfrom cradle to graveâ€. Direct emissions include all effects from the release of refrigerants into the atmosphere during the lifetime of the system. This includes annual leakage and losses during the disposal of the unit. The indirect emissions include emissions from the manufacturing process, energy consumption, and disposal of the system. This paper proposes a standardized approach to the use of LCCP and traceable data sources for all aspects of the calculation. An equation is proposed that unifies the efforts of previous researchers. Data sources are recommended for average values for all LCCP inputs. A residential <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> <b>sample</b> problem is presented illustrating the methodology. The heat pump is evaluated at five U. S. locations in different climate zones. An excel tool was developed for residential heat pumps using the proposed method. The primary factor in the LCCP calculation is the energy consumption of the system. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to characterize pulsations {{generated by}} personal <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> relative to a nominal flow rate at the inlet of different respirable cyclones. Experiments were conducted using a factorial combination of 13 widely used <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> (11 medium and 2 high volumetric flow rate pumps having a diaphragm mechanism) and 7 cyclones [10 -mm nylon also known as Dorr-Oliver (DO), Higgins-Dewell (HD), GS- 1, GS- 3, Aluminum, GK 2. 69, and FSP- 10]. A hot-wire anemometer probe cemented to the inlet of each cyclone type was used to obtain pulsation readings. The three medium flow rate pump models showing the highest, a midrange, and the lowest pulsations and two high flow rate pump models for each cyclone type were tested with dust-loaded filters (0. 05, 0. 21, and 1. 25 mg) to determine the effects of filter loading on pulsations. The effects of different tubing materials and lengths on pulsations were also investigated. The fundamental frequency range was 22 - 110 Hz and the magnitude of pulsation as a proportion of the mean flow rate ranged from 4. 4 to 73. 1...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 40) Airborne dust {{evaluation of}} occupational environments is accomplished primarily by {{measurement of the}} mass concentration of dust in the air. Personal air <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps</b> are used for this purpose. The determination of the concentration of airborne dust {{is dependent on the}} volume of air drawn through the filter by the <b>sampling</b> <b>pump</b> and the mass of dust collected on the filter. Therefore, it is crucial that the flowrate and mass of dust be determined with a good degree of accuracy. The relationship between dust-loading on the filter and decrease in flowrate is examined in this study. The effect of smaller particles of dust versus larger particles of dust in relation to flowrate variance is also examined. In addition, the variance of flowrate over time due to the dust loading is investigated. Finally, a new, possibly more accurate gravimetric analytical technique involving the weighing of the entire field monitor unit is compared with standard methods. It is concluded that the variation of flowrate due to dust loading under normal conditions is not significant, and the variation that does occur in the flowrate is primarily due to individual differences in the air <b>sampling</b> <b>pumps.</b> The new gravimetric technique indicated 2 - 5 percent greater mass of dust than the standard technique in comparative determinations for heavy dust loading on the filter...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteFadi M. AramouniOhmic heating for {{the food}} {{industry}} consists of using electrical energy to heat foods {{as a method of}} preservation, which can in turn be used for microbial inactivation or several other processes such as pasteurization, extraction, dehydration, blanching or thawing. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of this environmentally friendly processing technique. Due to the lack of sufficient information on research into ohmic heating {{for the food}} industry, a few of the published studies are discussed here in detail. This report also focuses on self-conducted research using ohmic heating to determine its effect on Lactobacillus acidophilus inactivation versus conventional heating. Lactobacillus acidophilus was inoculated into MRS broth and incubated for 24 hours. The sample was then inoculated into sterile buffer at a dilution rate of 1 : 100. Samples of the diluted culture were subjected to either low voltage (18 V) or conventional heating (300 °C) over a hotplate stirrer. Temperature was monitored on test and control samples to achieve an endpoint of 90 °C. Samples were taken at regular intervals, plated onto MRS agar and incubated for 72 hours at 35 °C to compare plate count expressed as colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL). Temperature was uniform throughout the ohmically <b>heated</b> <b>sample</b> and reached the endpoint more quickly than the conventionally <b>heated</b> <b>sample,</b> which also had cold spots. The total plate count {{at the end of the}} experiment was less for the ohmically <b>heated</b> <b>sample</b> versus the conventionally <b>heated</b> <b>sample.</b> Ohmic <b>heating</b> was more effective in inactivation of Lactobacillus acidophilus than conventional heating, most likely due to the more rapid and uniform <b>heating</b> of the <b>sample,</b> and possible electroporation of the cells...|$|R

The heating temperature of the oil sample was 20 °C for the first minute, {{and then it was}} increased up to 160 °C at the rate of 10 °C min- 1. The final temperature was kept for 10 minutes. 19 volatiles were identified in the <b>heated</b> <b>samples</b> without antioxidants. Medium-chain carbonyls predominated in the volatile fraction, mainly 2 -heptenal, 2, 4 -heptadienal and 2, 4 -decadienal. Around 11 to 15 volatile compounds were detected in the <b>heated</b> <b>samples</b> treated with 5 -CQA and quercetin, respectively. 5 -CQA was not very efficient in delaying the formation of oxidative volatile compounds. The samples quercetin presented lower proportion of carbonyls with C 6 -C 9 [...] The GC peak area data were used as an approach to estimate the relative content of each volatile compound and indicate that the samples treated with quercetin (p < 0. 05) had significantly lower values for, 1 -pentanol, 2, 4 -heptadienal, and 2, 4 -decadienal compared with those without antioxidants and treated with 5 -CQA. GC/SNIFFING analysis revealed a smaller odor perception in the samples treated with 5 -CQA compared to those without antioxidants. No odor was perceived in the <b>heated</b> <b>samples</b> treated with quercetin.
