50|$|In {{physics and}} engineering, the {{thin-film}} equation is a partial differential equation that approximately predicts the time {{evolution of the}} x- and y-dependent local thickness h(x,y,t) of a liquid film (puddle, <b>flat</b> <b>drop</b> of liquid) that lies {{on a flat surface}} which coincides with the xy-plane. In lubrication theory in fluid mechanics, a body of liquid is assumed to be a thin film, i.e. considerably thinner in one Cartesian direction than in the two directions orthogonal to that. That is one of many problems that can be simplified if one can make some assumptions about the length scales that are relevant for the physical system.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Egg {{packaging}} {{was tested}} {{to determine the}} relative protective ability of some presently available types and to identify and develop possible standard test procedures. Seven types of 12 -egg cartons underwent laboratory tests simulating transportation, handling, and storage conditions individually and in two different arrangements in 15 -carton packs (corrugated fibreboard boxes). In packs, crossed tiers of cartons protected eggs better than cartons all aligned in the same direction. One of {{the two types of}} moulded pulp cartons and one of the three types of expanded polystyrene cartons appeared very effective in preventing damage. One moulded pulp carton and one of the two other polystyrene cartons gave comparable, good protection inside the packs. The two types of chipboard cartons tested allowed a lot of damage to occur with the packs. In tests on individual cartons, one chipboard carton proved extremely ineffective and one polystyrene carton, not very effective, in preventing damage successfully prevented by the five other types of cartons. A simple, 12 -inch, <b>flat</b> <b>drop</b> of the packs on the bottom appeared to be the most effective single test to distinguish the protective abilities of the 14 different carton-and-pack combinations tested. Tests in which one end of an individual carton was raised and allowed to drop 6 inches onto its bottom or 3 inches onto its side effectively indicated the cartons ' relative protective abilities. There was a strong indication that—for moulded pulp and polystyrene cartons at least—carton design was more important than material in determining relative protective ability...|$|E

Based on results for the structure formation in a thin liquid film on a horizontal plane, we study one-dimensional periodic drop profiles sliding down an inclined plane. The analysis of the dependence of their amplitude, velocity, advancing and receding dynamic contact angles on period and the interaction parameters reveals an universal regime of <b>flat</b> <b>drops.</b> The main properties of the <b>flat</b> <b>drops</b> do not depend on their volume.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of regular corrective exercise on skeletal deformities such as scoliosis, shoulders <b>dropping,</b> <b>flat</b> foot and bow leg in secondary school male students of Khorramabad city as the statistical population. Materials and Methods: 160 girls in khorramabad city, aged 12 - 14 years, participated in this study. The subjects were examined twice before and after 24 sessions of corrective exercise. Deformities were measured by grid plane, plumb line and other relevant tests. The gathered data were analyzed by descriptive statistical methods including: frequency, percentage and graphs. Results: In 12 years old sbjects the degree of shoulders <b>dropping,</b> <b>flat</b> foot and bow leg in post- test were lower than pre-test and differences were significant (F= 7. 96, P< 0. 001 & F= 100. 1, P< 0. 001 & F= 27. 63, P 0. 001). The differences between pre and post measurments of shoulders <b>dropping,</b> <b>flat</b> foot and bow leg in 13 years old cases were significant (F= 100. 1, P< 0. 001 & F= 27. 63, P< 0. 001 F= 7. 96, P 0. 001).
