5|$|Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was {{the first}} non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian {{grandmaster}} Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:I have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique {{at the age of}} 19 is something rare. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> only one other player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.|$|E
25|$|Sa Ngalan ng Ina was {{the first}} project of Aunor after her return, she starred with Christopher de Leon and Bembol Roco. It was also the last directorial job of the late Mario O'Hara. Sa Ngalan ng Ina is a movie made for {{television}} or a miniseries is a political drama about a widow that ran as a governor when her husband was assassinated. In his review, film critic Noel Vera {{point out that the}} show is rare creature in Philippine television, the political melodrama. Longer and more complex soap operas have been mounted on Philippine television before, and politics has been touched upon before, but far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> {{there has never been a}} series (the exact name of the genre is, I believe, the teleserye) fully driven by politics, hinging upon the election into office and subsequent administration of the main character. All of the performances were great especially Aunor which gave her a nomination from Golden Screen TV Awards and a best actress trophy from 2012 Star Awards for Television. This miniseries would be the last collaboration between Aunor and O'hara before his death from leukemia.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, Los Angeles Times critic Cecil Smith, who {{considered}} the original format [...] "maybe the three worse shows on television rolled into one" [...] now remarked: [...] "Paul Lynde {{for the first}} time that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> has a part worthy of his mettle. The people surrounding him are first rate." ...|$|E

I covered a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black man's face with his hand covering his eyes. You can {{get a sense of how}} many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version [...] "A" [...] of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but I have not seen it since I worked on it. We did versions [...] "A," [...] B", and [...] "C," [...] with [...] "C" [...] being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called [...] "X" [...] version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> doing multiple versions of was the guy in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy's ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Treatt {{was given}} the {{position}} of Challis lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sydney, a position he was to hold until 1959. One of his students was the future Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby: [...] "I can still see Mr Vernon Treatt QC coming on to {{the stage of the}} Phillip Street Theatre where we took some of our lectures. Treatt's task was to instruct a hundred first year law students in that most important discipline, criminal law. I can see him toss his hat onto the chair, open his notes and begin reading his latest lesson. I can hear him talking about the sections of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales dealing with 'unnatural offences'. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> his rasping voice as he intoned the old provisions of section 79, spitting out the exceptionally ugly words of denunciation in the parliamentary prose". In March 1928, Treatt was appointed and served as a Crown Prosecutor for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Quarter sessions for the metropolitan district.|$|E
2500|$|I thought I {{was being}} taken {{just for a}} few days. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> seeing my mother {{standing}} {{on the side of the}} road with her head in her hands, crying, and me in the black FJ Holden wondering why she was so upset. A few hundred words can't fix this all but it's an important start and it's a beginning ...|$|E

2500|$|After the incident, {{the then}} Prime Minister of New Zealand, Robert Muldoon, {{described}} it as [...] "the most disgusting incident <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> {{in the history of}} cricket", going on to say that [...] "it was an act of true cowardice and I consider it appropriate that the Australian team were wearing yellow". Even the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, called the act [...] "contrary to the traditions of the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|In For Love Not Money former Wallaby Simon Poidevin refuted Campese's claim, writing that, [...] "Tales of Jonsey {{screaming}} at Campese in the dressing-room {{immediately after the}} game for the poor way he played that afternoon was absolute nonsense. Nothing at all was said by anyone for nearly three-quarters of an hour, and the only noise <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> was that of tough men openly sobbing from disappointment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although it was {{not universally}} illegal to bowl underarm at the time, it was widely {{accepted}} to be contrary {{to the spirit of}} the game. A visibly agitated McKechnie could do little but block the ball to avoid being dismissed and so Australia won the game. It was described as [...] "the most disgusting incident <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> in the history of cricket" [...] by then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Rob Muldoon.|$|E
60|$|If {{an actor}} {{has given me}} a lunch, I refuse to bite the hand that has fed me.

60|$|It {{would be}} difficult, even impossible, {{to set down}} in writing my sensations at that moment.

Lord! how I did want to smoke; but {{that was out of}} the question.|$|R
5000|$|It had {{a certain}} {{nightmare}} quality. ... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>recall</b> {{looking down on the}} operation from a control tower and thinking that Fresh Kills, like Jamaica Bay, had for thousands of years been a magnificent, teeming, literally life-enhancing tidal marsh. And in just twenty-five years, it was gone, buried under millions of tons of New York City's refuse.|$|R
2500|$|A {{review in}} DVD Talk {{concluded}} that Beban's performance {{was able to}} overcome the film's melodramatic premise:"Beppo is a delightful character ... His rage after being robbed was another standout moment. [...] The camera does a very tight closeup, one of the closest <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> for a film from 1915, and his anger and fear are almost palatable. ... The ending {{of the film is}} also very dramatic and works well, without a false Hollywood happy ending ... It was nice to see the hardships of poverty portrayed without any easy answers, something that doesn't often happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the game, {{the then}} Prime Minister of New Zealand, Rob Muldoon, {{described}} it as [...] "the most disgusting incident <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> {{in the history of}} cricket." [...] At the time, underarm deliveries were legal, but {{as a direct result of}} the incident, underarm bowling was banned in limited overs cricket by the International Cricket Council as [...] "not within the spirit of the game." [...] The 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket declares that an underarm delivery is illegal unless otherwise agreed before the match.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the first}} time I had heard this great artist play. [...] He was most amiable at the rehearsal....

It seemed to me I had never before heard the piano really played. [...] The grandeur of style with which Rubinstein presented those five measures, the beauty of tone his softness of touch secured, the art with which he manipulated the pedal, are indescribable ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>recall</b> {{the feeling}} of sitting at my desk that night in that large study of mine in Radnor Square, waiting for Margaret to come home.

Komarek Sr. of Tall Timbers Research Station, on the occasion of the conference on The Role of Fire in Northern Circumpolar Ecosystems held in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Bud and I kept in contact by mail and phone for many years thereafter. It was indeed a privilege to have personally known him.|$|R

2500|$|When {{questioned}} at a {{press conference}} about Sheridan's goal, Meath manager Eamon O'Brien said: [...] "I can't say and I'm not commenting. I can comment, as I said to RTÉ, that loads of decisions were made during the game that didn't go our way. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> three or four balls that were blown for picking off the ground that I didn’t think were off the ground. Nigel Crawford was booked up here and Louth got a point off it. The game goes for 70 minutes, decisions are made and you live with it. That’s it, that’s the way I see it".|$|E
2500|$|Chappell instigated the underarm bowling {{incident}} in the New Zealand–Australia One Day International on 1 February 1981. Chappell, the captain, ordered his brother Trevor Chappell, to bowl underarm along the ground to Brian McKechnie, thus ensuring the Australian team would win the match and avoid a tie. The New Zealand Prime Minister Rob Muldoon said it was [...] "the most disgusting incident <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> {{in the history of}} cricket", the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser said it was [...] "contrary to the traditions of the game", and the Chappells' decision was universally condemned. Both brothers have expressed regret and embarrassment over the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Willow's {{progression}} {{has been}} noted to be unique in television. Her relationship with Tara coincides {{with the development of}} her magical abilities becoming much more profound. By the seventh season, she is the most powerful person in Buffy's circle. Jessica Ford at PopMatters asserts that Willow's sexuality and her magical abilities are connected and represented by her relationships. In her unrequited attraction to Xander, she has no power. With Oz, she has some that gives her the confidence she sorely lacks, but his departure leaves her unsure of herself. Only when she meets Tara do her magical abilities flourish; to Ford, sexuality and magic are both empowering agents in Willow's story arc. David Bianculli in the New York Daily News writes that Willow's progression is [...] "unlike anything else <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> on regular prime-time television: a character evolving naturally over four seasons of stories and arriving at a place of sexual rediscovery".|$|E
6000|$|Only once, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> a cloud. That was one Sunday when my mother, {{speaking}} {{across the}} table in the middle of dinner, said to my father, [...] "We might save the rest of that stew, Luke; there's an omelette coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{talked of}} religion; I {{think she was}} the first person to thaw the private silences that had kept me bound in these matters even from myself for years. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>recall</b> her face, a little flushed and coming nearer to mine after avowals and comparisons.

I remember--in college you were an unusually liberal, {{sensitive}} chap. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>recall</b> your saying {{to me that you}} were going to be a lawyer, and take the cases of the poor for nothing, and fight the rich. And I remember I said I was going to be one of the rich myself, and buy paintings and live at Newport. I'm sure you inspired us all." ...|$|R
2500|$|While Borges was {{the great}} popularizer of the review of an {{imaginary}} work, he had developed the idea from Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, a book-length review of a non-existent German transcendentalist work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author. In This Craft of Verse, Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva [...] " [...] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read Sartor Resartus, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> many of its pages; I know them by heart." [...] In the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, The Garden of Forking Paths, Borges remarks, [...] "It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better {{way to go about}} it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them." [...] He then cites both Sartor Resartus and Samuel Butler's The Fair Haven, remarking, however, that [...] "those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others. A more reasonable, more inept, and more lazy man, I have chosen to write notes on imaginary books." ...|$|E
2500|$|John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, remarking, [...] "...more than most adaptations, this is a film true to Shakespeare's practice of employing all means at hand to keep the crowd entertained". Tom Clift of Moviedex complimented the director's use of subtle visual humor, while Lou Lumenick of the New York Post commented that [...] "this is the funniest Shakespeare film <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>recall</b> seeing". The Guardian scored the film {{four out of five}} stars, calling it [...] "...the first great contemporary Shakespeare since Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet". Christopher Schobert of IndieWire wrote, [...] "The result is an utter joy, Whedon's most emotionally resonant and fully realized feature film to date. And I say that as one who is not a devoted member of the Whedon army". Sheila O'Malley of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, noting that [...] "Much Ado About Nothing {{is one of the best}} films of the year". BBC Radio 5 Live's Mark Kermode said of the film, [...] "One of the things that it manages to do is, firstly, make all the dialogue and the language completely comprehensible". He proceeded to note that [...] "it makes sense to its audience. I think that the comedy is funny, and I don't say that lightly. [...] And finally, I think in terms of the way in which it deals with that gender politics issue is really well done. [...] It's a very hard trick to pull off, and he did it in two weeks!" [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire believed that, while keeping a sense of noir to compensate the romance, it was [...] "in balancing these competing elements and characters that this version really shines". The Village Voices Chris Packham said that the director [...] "approaches the story with a tremendous amount of joy".|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{perfectly}} <b>recall</b> my childish {{figure as}} I stood with endless satisfaction surveying my reflection in a looking-glass on the Christmas morning after my ninth birthday. My frock {{was of a}} fine puffed scarlet, my slippers loose at heel, to match. My hair, demurely parted in the middle, hung straight on my narrow shoulders (though I had already learned to plait it) and so framed my face; the eyebrows faintly arched (eyebrows darker and crookeder now); the nose in proportion; the lips rather narrow, and of a lively red.|$|R
60|$|I nodded again. I {{could follow}} the trend. Ever since the scullery window was found open the year Shining Light was disqualified in the Cesarewitch for boring, Uncle Tom {{has had a}} marked complex about burglars. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>recall</b> my {{emotions}} when, paying my first visit after he had bars put on all the windows and attempting to thrust the head out {{in order to get}} a sniff of country air, I nearly fractured my skull on a sort of iron grille, as worn by the tougher kinds of mediaeval prison.|$|R
60|$|So {{protracted}} did my fall seem, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{even now}} <b>recall</b> {{the feeling of}} wondering how much longer it would be, ere all was over and I struck.
