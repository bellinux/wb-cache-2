5|$|Artavasdes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> Median and {{possibly}} of Armenian, Greek descent. He {{was the child}} born to Ariobarzanes I by an unnamed wife. His probable paternal uncle could have been Darius I. He {{was born and raised}} in the Kingdom of Media Atropatene. Artavasdes I is the namesake of his ancestor, Artabazanes a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene in the 3rd century BC, as the name Artavasdes is a variation of the name Artabazanes (see Asha).|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> course {{happy to}} meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} decorations {{and the new}} westwork {{were considered}} a major feat in the 19th century. Ludwig <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> the opinion that nothing greater had been created than these paintings. Yet, {{by the start of}} the 20th century, the mood had changed. In 1916, Georg Dehio, a German art historian, was convinced that among all the misfortunes to befall the Speyer cathedral, the alterations of the 19th century were not the smallest.|$|E

500|$|Neferhotep I's {{relative}} chronological {{position is}} secured {{thanks to the}} Turin canon as well as contemporary attestations. He was the successor of Sobekhotep III and predecessor of Sobekhotep IV. Since his father Haankhef and mother Kemi are also well attested and not known to have had any title beyond those of [...] "God's father" [...] and [...] "King's mother", respectively, Egyptologists such as Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker believe that Neferhotep <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> non-royal birth and usurped the throne. The military background of his family might {{have played a role}} in this.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{slated for}} a March 2, 2012 release, {{the film was}} pushed by Paramount Pictures to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013. Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: [...] "We’d {{finished}} it but we were still discussing adding a coda scene, which {{we were able to}} shoot. And there was always the consideration that Jeremy [...] had Avengers and Bourne coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us." [...] Wirkola said that [...] "the main reason is because they wanted to wait on Jeremy. He was cast before , Bourne and The Avengers. They wanted to wait until after those. <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>of</b> course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because we came in under budget" [...] and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay. The first trailer for the film was released on September 5, 2012.|$|E
2500|$|I was {{requested}} to attend at the Sunshine Welfare Offices, where they formerly (sic) discharged me from State ward ship.

2500|$|Originally called Pa-ra-mes-su, Ramesses <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> non-royal birth, {{being born}} into a noble {{military}} family from the Nile delta region, perhaps near the former Hyksos capital of Avaris. He was {{a son of a}} troop commander called Seti. His uncle Khaemwaset, an army officer, married Tamwadjesy, the matron of the Harem of Amun, who was a relative of Huy, the viceroy of Kush, an important state post. This shows the high status of Ramesses' family. Ramesses I found favor with Horemheb, the last pharaoh of the tumultuous Eighteenth dynasty, who appointed the former as his Vizier. Ramesses also served as the High Priest of Amun [...] as such, he would have {{played an important role in}} the restoration of the old religion following the Amarna heresy of a generation earlier, under Akhenaten.|$|E
2500|$|Casanova gambled {{throughout}} his adult life, {{winning and losing}} large sums. He was tutored by professionals, and he was [...] "instructed in those wise maxims without which games of chance ruin those who participate in them". He was not above occasionally cheating and at times even teamed with professional gamblers for his own profit. Casanova claims that he was [...] "relaxed and smiling when I lost, and I won without covetousness". However, when outrageously duped himself, he could act violently, sometimes calling for a duel. Casanova admits {{that he was not}} disciplined enough to be a professional gambler: [...] "I had neither prudence enough to leave off when fortune was adverse, nor sufficient control over myself when I had won." [...] Nor did he like being considered as a professional gambler: [...] "Nothing could ever be adduced by professional gamblers that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> their infernal clique." [...] Although Casanova at times used gambling tactically and shrewdly—for making quick money, for flirting, making connections, acting gallantly, or proving himself a gentleman among his social superiors—his practice also could be compulsive and reckless, especially during the euphoria of a new sexual affair. [...] "Why did I gamble when I felt the losses so keenly? What made me gamble was avarice. I loved to spend, and my heart bled when I could not do it with money won at cards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marcel Janco {{was born}} on May 24, 1895 in Bucharest to an upper middle class Jewish family. His father, Hermann Zui Iancu, was a textile merchant. His mother, Rachel née Iuster, was from Moldavia. The couple lived outside Bucharest's Jewish quarter, on Decebal Street. He was the oldest of four children. His {{brothers}} were Iuliu (Jules) and George. His sister, Lucia, was born in 1900. The Iancus moved from Decebal to Gândului Street, and then to Trinității, where they built {{one of the largest}} home-and-garden complexes in early 20th century Bucharest. In 1980, Janco revisited his childhood years, writing: [...] "Born as I was in beautiful Romania, into a family of well-to-do people, I had the fortune of being educated in a climate of freedom and spiritual enlightenment. My mother, [...] possessing a genuine musical talent, and my father, a stern man and industrious merchant, had created the conditions favorable for developing all of my aptitudes. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> a sensitive and emotional nature, a withdrawn child who was predisposed to dreaming and meditating. [...] I grew up [...] dominated by a strong sense of humanity and social justice. The existence of disadvantaged, weak, people, of impoverished workers, of beggars, hurt me and, when compared to our family's decent condition, awoke in me a feeling of guilt." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{artefacts}} {{depicting the}} story include {{the chest of}} Cypselus described in the travelogue by Pausanias. Among its many carvings [...] "there is a grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> opinion that they were Odysseus and Circe, basing my view upon {{the number of the}} handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are doing. For the women are four, and they are engaged on the tasks which Homer mentions in his poetry. The passage in question describes how one of them [...] "threw linen covers over the chairs and spread fine purple fabrics on top. Another drew silver tables up to the chairs, and laid out golden dishes, while a third mixed sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl, and served it in golden cups. The fourth fetched water and lit a roaring fire beneath a huge cauldron." [...] This suggests a work of considerable detail, while the Etruscan [...] coffin preserved in Orvieto's archaeological museum has only four figures. At the centre Osysseus threatens Circe with drawn sword while an animal headed figure stands on either side, one of them laying his hand familiarly on the hero's shoulder. A bronze mirror relief in the Fitzwilliam Museum is also Etruscan and is inscribed with the names of the characters. There a pig is depicted at Circe's feet, while Odysseus and Elpenor approach her, swords drawn.|$|E
2500|$|Our Rabbis {{taught that}} the {{obligation}} to confess sins comes {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, as it grows dark. But the Sages said that one should confess before one has eaten and drunk, lest one become inebriated in the course of the meal. And even if one has confessed before eating and drinking, one should confess again after having eaten and drunk, because perhaps some wrong happened during the meal. And even if one has confessed during the evening prayer, one should confess again during the morning prayer. And even if one has confessed during the morning prayer, one should do so again during the Musaf additional prayer. And even if one has confessed during the Musaf, one should do so again during the afternoon prayer. And even if one has done so in the afternoon prayer, one should confess again in the Ne'ilah concluding prayer. The Gemara taught that the individual should say the confession after the (silent recitation of the) Amidah prayer, and the public reader says it in the middle of the Amidah. Rav taught that the confession begins: [...] "You know the secrets of eternity [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Samuel, however, taught that the confession begins: [...] "From the depths of the heart [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Levi said: [...] "And in Your Torah it is said, [...] " [...] (...) Rabbi Johanan taught that the confession begins: [...] "Lord of the Universe, [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Rav Judah said: [...] "Our iniquities are too many to count, and our sins too numerous to be counted." [...] Rav Hamnuna said: [...] "My God, before I was formed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> no worth, and now that I have been formed, it is as if I had not been formed. I am dust in my life, how much more in my death. Behold, I am before You like a vessel full of shame and reproach. May it be Your will that I sin no more, and what I have sinned wipe away in Your mercy, but not through suffering." [...] That was the confession of sins used by Rav all the year round, and by Rav Hamnuna the younger, on the Day of Atonement. Mar Zutra taught that one should say such prayers only if one has not already said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] but if one has said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] no more is necessary. For Bar Hamdudi taught that once he stood before Samuel, who was sitting, and when the public reader said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] Samuel rose, and so Bar Hamdudi inferred that this was the main confession.|$|E
