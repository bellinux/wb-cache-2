40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the differences between}} mean tide level (MTL) and mean sea level (MSL) as demonstrated using information from a <b>global</b> <b>tide</b> gauge data set. The roles of the two main contributors to differences between MTL and MSL (the M 4 harmonic of the M 2 semidiurnal tide, and {{the combination of the}} diurnal tides K 1 and O 1) are described, with a particular focus on the spatial scales of variation in MTL–MSL due to each contributor. Findings from the tide gauge data set are contrasted with those from a state-of-the-art <b>global</b> <b>tide</b> model. The study is of interest within tidal science, but also has practical importance regarding the type of mean level used to define land survey datums.

40|$|The 120 m sea-level drop {{during the}} Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18 â�� 22 kyr BP) had a {{profound}} impact on the <b>global</b> <b>tides</b> and lead to an increased tidal dissipation rate, especially in the North Atlantic.

Due to uncertainties in the location of the grounding line of the Antarctic ice sheets during the last glacial, simulations are carried out for two different grounding line scenarios. Our results replicate previously reported enhancements in dissipation and amplitudes of the semidiurnal tide during LGM and subsequent deglaciation, and they provide a detailed picture of the large global changes in M 2 tidal dynamics occurring over the deglaciation period.

40|$|Satellite altimetry, {{particularly}} Topex/Poseidon, has markedly improved {{our knowledge}} of <b>global</b> <b>tides,</b> thereby allowing significant progress on some longstanding problems in geodynamics. This paper reviews some of that progress. Emphasis is given to global-scale problems, particularly those falling within {{the mandate of the}} new IERS Special Bureau for Tides: angular momentum, gravitational field, geocenter motion. For this discussion I use primarily the new ocean tide solutions GOT 99. 2, CSR 4. 0, and TPXO. 4 (for which G.

One example is a new estimate of the effective tidal Q at the M_ 2 frequency, based on combining these ocean models with tidal estimates from satellite laser ranging. Three especially intractable problems are also addressed: (1) determining long-period tides in the Arctic [large unknown effect on the inertia tensor, particularly for Mf]; (2) determining the <b>global</b> psi_l <b>tide</b> [large unknown effect on interpretations of gravimetry for the near-diurnal free wobble]; and (3) determining radiational tides [large unknown temporal variations at important frequencies].

40|$|INTRODUCTION Continuous {{monitoring}} of the range stability is a pre-requisite for sea-level rise and other demanding applications in satellite altimetry. Range stability may be investigated by either absolute or relative calibration techniques. In this study relative calibration is undertaken through intercomparison against TOPEX/Poseidon and absolute calibration undertaken {{in the vicinity of}} 8 tide gauges around the UK. In the former, dual crossover residuals between ERS- 2 and TOPEX/Poseidon are analysed for the relative bias along with other spatial and geophysical parameters. The relative bias is subsequently corrected for the observed TOPEX drift as deduced by comparison against the global network of tide gauges. This procedure provides a better estimate of the relative bias than achieved by using the <b>global</b> <b>tide</b> gauge data set, as for TOPEX/Poseidon. In the absolute calibration approach, tide gauge measurements are extrapolated to the sub-satellite points using local models for o...|$|E
