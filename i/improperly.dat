5|$|The {{mail fraud}} counts were <b>improperly</b> {{joined with the}} tax {{conspiracy}} count.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 2000, a Malaysia Airlines A330-300 {{suffered}} {{structural damage}} due to leaking oxalyl chloride, a corrosive chemical substance {{that had been}} <b>improperly</b> labeled before shipping. The aircraft was written off.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial judge}} failed {{to conduct a}} voir dire {{sufficient}} to impanel an unbiased jury and <b>improperly</b> failed to excuse several jurors for cause.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder threads {{may be in}} {{two basic}} configurations: Taper thread and {{parallel}} thread. These thread specifications are detailed in a previous section. The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the cylinder. <b>Improperly</b> matched neck threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences.|$|E
5|$|Described {{independently}} as Peziza sulcata by Persoon in 1801, it {{was placed}} under that name in both Paxina and Acetabula—alongside its precursor as both taxa were still considered separate at the time. Finally, Frederic Clements renamed Acetabula as Phleboscyphus in 1903 and <b>improperly</b> reused Fuckel's name as the basionym of his Phleboscyphus vulgaris.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 2003 an <b>improperly</b> {{locked door}} came loose in a {{high-speed}} tunnel at Perniö. No-one {{was injured in}} the accident. The settings of all Sm3 doors were checked by the operator in the following days.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a senator, Hugo L Black would give speeches based on his belief in the {{ultimate}} power of the Constitution. He came to see the actions of the anti-New Deal Supreme Court as judicial excess; in his view, the Court was <b>improperly</b> overturning legislation that had been passed by large majorities in Congress.|$|E
5|$|Welter {{survived the}} war and was {{employed}} at a sugar factory. He was killed on 7 March 1949 in Leck in Schleswig-Holstein waiting at a level crossing, when logs falling from an <b>improperly</b> loaded passing train crushed his car.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was <b>improperly</b> handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|After a whistle-blower {{reported}} that the MSDF's preference had been <b>improperly</b> changed an investigation was launched. On December 16 2016 the Japanese Ministry of Defense (the Defense Agency having been upgraded to a ministry in 2007) stated {{that it had not}} confirmed lobbying efforts but the ministry admonished Tomohisa Takei, the JMSDF chief of staff, for mentioning the MCH-101 by name during the procurement process to his subordinates. This had come after MSDF officials had {{reported that}} the Mitsubishi-built SH helicopters may be best.|$|E
5|$|As reviewers would note, the {{production}} {{was not without}} its faults. One error occurred with the photographer <b>improperly</b> taking pictures of the mermaid. The developed photographs of the mermaid were also impossible given the distances involved. A more minor error {{in the operation of}} the hotel was given by the office boy who handled the arriving guests with remarkable speed. Despite these errors, the company was {{at the forefront of the}} Independent producers and given great praise by Frank E. Woods of the American Biograph Company in The New York Dramatic Mirror.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{were again}} {{hampered}} {{when it was}} discovered the pressure relief valves on the standpipes were <b>improperly</b> adjusted when installed in the building. The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating <b>improperly</b> prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is <b>improperly</b> formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Heyer {{followed}} {{her husband to}} Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist <b>improperly</b> administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide {{the bulk of the}} family's earnings with her writing.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990, WMATA {{hired the}} Perini Corp. {{as the new}} contractor, and {{required}} the company {{to finish the job}} and rebuild the streets in the area, setting a new Green Line dedication of December 1991. Federal monitors overseeing WMATA's spending, however, issued a report in August 1990 accusing WMATA of poor financial oversight of the project and blamed the transit agency for the delays and problems Mergentime/Perini confronted. Mergentime/Perini sued WMATA, claiming that it was <b>improperly</b> dismissed from the project.|$|E
5|$|In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, {{chaired by}} Bob Dornan, {{requested}} that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident. Specifically, the GAO was asked {{to determine if the}} USAF accident investigation board had met its objectives, if the subsequent military justice investigations had followed established guidelines, and if the DoD and/or USAF had <b>improperly</b> or unlawfully influenced these investigations.|$|E
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed <b>improperly,</b> the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was <b>improperly</b> intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E
5|$|On 12 August 1978, Vulcan B.2 XL390 of No. 617 Squadron crashed {{during an}} air display at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois in the United States. The crew had been {{authorised}} {{to carry out}} a display at Chicago Lakeside airport, the captain had elected {{to carry out a}}n unauthorised display at Glenview beforehand. After a low-level run, probably below , the aircraft pulled up for an <b>improperly</b> executed wingover, resulting in a low-level stall and crash, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1984, B-1A (AF Ser. No. 74-0159) stalled {{and crashed}} while {{performing}} minimum control speed tests at low altitude. The crew used the escape capsule {{to leave the}} bomber, but the parachutes deployed <b>improperly,</b> causing the capsule to hit nose down. The impact killed the B-1's pilot, Rockwell test pilot Doug Benefield, and seriously injured two other crew members.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1982, an Orange Line train derailed as it {{was being}} backed up from an <b>improperly</b> closed rail switch between the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian stations, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} three passengers. It was the first incident within the Metro system that caused a fatality, and the deadliest incident occurring in the system until the 2009 collision that resulted in nine fatalities.|$|E
5|$|One of Corzine's first {{nominations}} {{was that}} of Zulima Farber as New Jersey Attorney General. She served for approximately seven months until an ethics investigation concluded that she had acted <b>improperly</b> {{by going to the}} location where local police in Fairview, New Jersey had stopped her boyfriend, Hamlet Gore, for driving with a suspended license and an expired vehicle registration. Corzine said he did not ask for Farber's resignation.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee {{ruled that}} Cranston had acted <b>improperly</b> by {{interfering with the}} {{investigation}} by the FHLBB. He had received {{more than a million}} dollars from Keating, including $850,000 to the voter registration groups closely affiliated with him; he had done more arm-twisting than the other Senators on Keating's behalf; and he was the only senator officially rebuked by the Senate in this matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{significant}} human impact {{is a small}} prefabricated hut which is used by researchers while staying on the island. The hut includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem. It is believed that some young boys tried to introduce potatoes, which were promptly dug up once discovered. An <b>improperly</b> handled human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root which was also destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{passage of}} Hurricane Isabel in Pennsylvania {{resulted}} in $160million in damage (2003USD, $ USD) and 2indirect deaths in Pennsylvania. One person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, {{believed to be}} caused due to <b>improperly</b> ventilated generators in an area affected by the power outages. Moderate winds left about 1.4million customers without power across {{the state as a}} result of trees falling into power lines, with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the trees.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1954, the U.S. Army accused McCarthy and {{his chief}} counsel, Roy Cohn, of <b>improperly</b> {{pressuring}} the Army to give favorable treatment to G. David Schine, {{a former aide}} to McCarthy and a friend of Cohn's, who was then serving in the Army as a private. McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican Senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built <b>improperly</b> and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within five years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} analogy, a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation {{and the nature of}} God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one analogy on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every analogy presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or <b>improperly</b> applied.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been <b>improperly</b> fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E
5|$|Kirk takes {{command of}} the ship citing his experience, angering Captain Willard Decker, who had been {{overseeing}} the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprises new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan Enterprise science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and <b>improperly</b> calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled <b>improperly,</b> or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done <b>improperly,</b> the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at The Forge, Captain Archer, Commander T'Pol, and T'Pau, {{having found}} the sacred Kir'Shara (which the Syrrannites believe will usher a Vulcan enlightenment), {{endeavor}} {{to take it}} to the capital. En route, T'Pol and T'Pau discuss the taboo of mind-melds, and T'Pau offers to mind-meld with T'Pol. She states the meld is safe when performed by those trained in the art, and that Pa'nar Syndrome is merely the by-product of an <b>improperly</b> conducted meld. The trio are then attacked by Major Talok and Vulcan commandos, and T'Pol is captured while the others escape. She tells her captors that they are headed to Mount Seleya in order to mislead them from their true destination.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2016, Laurer {{was found}} dead {{at her home in}} Redondo Beach, California. She was 46 years old. Her manager Anthony Anzaldo had grown {{concerned}} when Laurer did not post updates or content to her usual social media outlets for several days and subsequently found her body in her apartment. A statement was posted to her Twitter account by her manager confirming her death. Initial police reports stated she probably died of an accidental-drug overdose or natural causes. Anzaldo suggested that any overdose was accidental, claiming that she was prescribed drugs but tended to use them <b>improperly.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} of the cars were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray paint with red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to <b>improperly</b> designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved to have a superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1987, <b>improperly</b> {{assembled}} bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E
