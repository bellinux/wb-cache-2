(Edythe) became the first African American to attend Antioch on a completely integrated basis, and was joined by two other black female students {{in the fall of}} 1943. Pioneering is never easy, and all of us who <b>followed</b> <b>my</b> sister at Antioch owe her a great debt of gratitude.|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} of [...] "Basket Ball" [...] was played in December 1891. In a {{handwritten}} report, Naismith described {{the circumstances of the}} inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: [...] "When Mr. Stubbins brot [...] up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them {{on the inside of the}} railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class... The class did not show much enthusiasm but <b>followed</b> <b>my</b> lead... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men & tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon." [...] In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each [...] "goal" [...] a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.|$|E
