40|$|Importanceof the field: Survivin is a {{prominent}} anti-apoptotic molecule expressed widely {{in the majority}} of cancers. Overexpression of survivin leads to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and drug resistance. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression and its functions can sensitise the tumour cells to various therapeutic interventions such as chemotherapeutic agents leading to cell apoptosis. Areas covered in this review: The article thoroughly analyses up-to-date information on the knowledge generated from the survivin patents. Various key areas of research in terms of understanding survivin biology and its targeting are discussed in detail. What the reader will gain: The article clearly gives an insight on the recent developments undertaken to understand the roles of survivin in cancer and in validating various treatment paradigms that suppress survivin expression in cancer cells. Take home message:   Most recent developments are helpful for effectively downregulating survivin expression by using various therapeutic platforms such as chemotherapeutic drugs, <b>immunotechnology,</b> antisense, dominant negative survivin mutant, RNA interference and peptide-based methods.

A 58 aa IgG Fc binding three-helix bundle domainZ, derived from staphylococcal protein A has been used asframework for library constructions, in which the face of themolecule involved in the native binding activity has beenengineered by combinatorial protein engineering. Recruting 13 surface-located positions for simultanenous substitutionmutagenesis, using degenerated oligonucleotides for libraryassembly at the genetic level, two libraries differing in thechoice of codons were constructed to serve as general sourcesof novel affinity proteins. The libraries were adapted fordisplay onE. colifilamentous phage particles allowingin vitroselection of desired variants capable ofbinding a given target molecule. In selections using human IgAas target, several new IgA specific affibodies could beidentified. One variant ZIgA 1, was further investigated and showed binding toboth IgA 1 and IgA 2 human subclasses {{as well as to}} secretoryIgA. This variant was further demonstrated uesful as ligand inaffinity chromatography purification for recovery of IgA fromdifferent samples including unconditioned human plasma. Affibodies of different specificities were also fused to otherprotein domains to construct fusion proteins of relevance forimmunotechnology applications. Using Fc of human IgG as genefusion partner, "artificial antbodies" could be produced inE. colias homodimeic proteins, where the antigenbinding was confered by N-terminally positioned affibodymoieties of different valencies. One area of application forthis type of constructs was demonstrated through specificdetection of the target protein by Western blotting. Exploitingthe uncomplicated structure of affibody affinity proteins, genefusions between affibodies and the homotetrameric reporterenzyme β-galactosidase were constructed, which could beproduced as soluble proteins intracellularly inE. coli. The potential use of such recombinantimmunoconjugates in <b>immunotechnology</b> was demonstrated in ELISAdot-blot and immunohistochemistry, where in the latter case IgAdepositions in the glomeruli of a human kidney biopsy could bespecfically detected with low background staining ofsurrounding tissues.

As a means tocircumvent problems associated with the presence of humanheterophilic antibodies in serum, causing bakground signals dueto analyte-independent crosslinking of standard capture anddetection antibody reagents, assay formats based oncombinations of antibody and affibody reagents for capture anddetection were investigated and found to be of potentialuse.

Recently, CD 4 T stem cell memory (Tscm) cells {{have been identified as}} the hierarchical cellular apex of ATL. IFN-a, in combination with AZT, is currently the major treatment option for ATL, but therapeutic success is limited and no bona fide biomarkers for therapeutic failure are currently available. Results: In a prospective study with a five-year clinical follow-up, we found significant ex vivo antiproliferative, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of IFN-a treatment in short-term culture of primary mononuclear cells from ATL patients (n = 28). We detected a genotype/phenotype interaction for the - 670 FAS A/G promoter polymorphism, apoptosis and proliferation in ATL patients. Surprisingly, IFN-induced apoptosis occurred only in carriers of the functional A allele (corresponding to a functional STAT 1 binding site), which we experimentally validated in an independent cohort of healthy controls (n = 20). This Fashigh proliferating and chemotherapy-resistant leukemic phenotype is in agreement with the recently discovered CD 4 Tscm hierarchical apex of ATL. The same FAS - 670 polymorphism also determined CD 4 Tscm levels in a genome-wide twin study (p= 7 x 10 - 11, n = 460), confirming our hypothesis. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that CD 4 + Fashigh leukemic cells can be eliminated by IFN-a +AZT combination therapy, but not AZT monotherapy. Conclusion: A genetically determined IFN/STAT 1 /FAS axis underscores the CD 4 Tscm ATL model and helps explain the observed in vivo IFN + AZT responsiveness and chemotherapy resistance in ATL patients. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 is {{recognized}} as a major human enteropathogen. <b>Immunotechnology</b> and DNA based methods were developed for quantitative detection of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in ground beef. A direct spectrophotometric immuno-agglutination assay was developed for quantitation of specific Escherichia coli O 157 IgG. Optimum conditions of the assay consisted of 1 × 108 cells/ml, 40 °C, and 0. 005 M phosphate buffer containing 0. 05 % NaCl at pH 7. 4. The assay was able to quantitate (13 to 104) μg IgG/ml of anti O 157 IgG in crude antiserum and was effectively used with different batches of locally produced antisera. ^ A new cell lysis solution designated TZ (2. 0 % Triton X- 100 in 0. 1 M Tris-HCl buffer plus 2. 5 mg sodium azide/ml, pH 8. 0) was developed. TZ lysis solution was found superior {{to a variety of}} cell lysing methods (d. H 2 O, PCR buffer, SDS, Triton X- 100, proteinase K, and lysozyme in combination with proteinase K) and released the greatest yield of E. coli O 157 :H 7 DNA targets prior to PCR. Highest amplification of E. coli O 157 :H 7 SLT- 1 and SLT- 2 DNA sequences were achieved with the aid of TZ lysis solution and pellet paint. ^ Using 0. 01 M phosphate buffered saline pH 6. 0 with the aid of differential centrifugation resulted in 57 % ± 6 recovery of E. coli O 157 :H 7 from seeded ground beef. The optimization of PCR reaction mixture resulted in a minimum detection level of 100 SLT- 1 DNA sequence compared to 200 DNA targets before the optimization. Prior to optimization, the minimum limits for the SLT- 2 DNA sequence was 150 DNA targets compared to 20 after complete optimization. The complete optimization of PCR reaction mixture contained 1 mM MgCl 2, 1. 6 μM each of the two primers, (2. 5 and 5 units) of Taq polymerase for SLT- 1 and SLT- 2 respectively, and 0. 2 mM of Deoxynucleotide Triphosphates (dNTPs). The methodologies developed thereby resulted in the detection of 100 cells of E. coli O 157 :H 7 with SLT- 1 primer and 50 cells with SLT- 2 primer per 10 grams of ground beef after 5. 5 hours of pre-enrichment in 30 ml of TSB+ at 37 °C. ...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring viruses {{circulating}} {{in the human}} population and the environment is critical for protecting public and ecosystem health. The goal of this dissertation was to incorporate a viral metagenomic approach into virus surveillance efforts (both clinical and water quality control programs) to enhance traditional virus detection methods. Clinical surveillance programs are designed to identify and monitor etiological agents that cause disease. However, the ability to identify viruses may be compromised when novel or unsuspected viruses are causing infection since traditional virus detection methods target specific known pathogens. Here we describe the successful application of viral metagenomics in a clinical setting using samples from symptomatic patients collected through the Enterovirus Surveillance (EVS) program in the Netherlands (Appendix A). Despite extensive PCR-based testing, the viruses in {{a small percentage of}} these samples (n = 7) remained unidentified for more than 10 years after collection. Viral metagenomics allowed the identification of viruses in all seven samples within a week using minimal sequencing, thus rapidly filling the diagnostic gap. The unexplained samples contained BK polyomavirus, Herpes simplex virus, Newcastle disease virus and the recently discovered Saffold viruses (SAFV) which dominated the unexplained samples (n = 4). This study demonstrated that metagenomic analyses can be added as a routine tool to investigate unidentified viruses in clinical samples in a public-health setting. In addition, metagenomic data gathered for SAFV was used to complete four genotype 3 SAFV (SAFV- 3) genomes through primer walking, doubling the number of SAFV- 3 full genomic sequences in public databases. In addition to monitoring viruses in symptomatic patients, {{it is also important to}} monitor viruses in wastewater (raw and treated) to protect the environment from biological contamination and prevent further spread of pathogens. To gain a comprehensive understanding of viruses that endure wastewater treatment, viral metagenomics was used to survey the total DNA and RNA viral community in reclaimed water (the reusable end-product of wastewater treatment) (Appendix B). Phages (viruses that infect bacteria) dominated the DNA viral community while eukaryotic viruses similar to known plant and insect viruses dominated RNA metagenomic libraries suggesting that highly stable viruses may be disseminated through this alternative water supply. A plant virus, the Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), was identified as a potential indicator of wastewater contamination based on metagenomic data and quantitative PCR assays (Appendix C). The metagenomic analysis also revealed a wealth of novel single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses in reclaimed water. Further investigation of sequences with low-level similarities to known ssDNA viruses led to the completion of ten novel ssDNA genomes from reclaimed water and marine environments (Appendix D). Unique genome architectures and phylogenetic analysis suggest that these ssDNA viruses belong to new viral genera and/or families. To further explore the ecology of the novel ssDNA viruses, a strategy was developed to take metagenomic analysis to the next level by combining expression analysis and <b>immunotechnology</b> (Appendix E).
