40|$|ABSTRACT Euphorbia tirucalli (L.), {{commonly}} known as aveloz, has been indiscriminately used in popular medicine to treat various illnesses. However, some components can have devastating consequences. Injury to a cell's genetic material can cause mutations, cancer, and cell death. Our main goal in this work was to evaluate the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of E. tirucalli extract on human leukocytes. For this purpose, we performed a phytochemical analysis to evaluate the plant's components. In the second step, we treated cultured human leukocytes with different concentrations of the dry extract of the plant and then evaluated the oxidative and genotoxic profiles of these leukocytes. We found that at 1 % and 10 % concentrations, the aveloz extract acted as a <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agent</b> that could damage DNA and increase oxidative damage. We conclude that despite its popular use, aveloz {{can act as a}} <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agent,</b> especially when it contains phorbol ester. Aveloz's indiscriminate use might actually promote tumors and therefore carry a considerable genetic risk for its users...|$|E

In the last decades, {{numerous}} evidences showed that polyploidization also involves in either an early step or a critical promoting factor in tumorigenesis. In this study, I investigated whether ploidy influences {{the response of}} cancer cells to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agents.</b> Using a novel polyploid system, Hep 3 B-T cells, generated by prolonged nocodazole treatment of Hep 3 B cells followed by mitotic slippage and re-replication of the DNA, the genotoxicity of the new tetraploid cells was compared with its diploid counterpart. I found that tetraploidization increased the cell volume without affecting the cell cycle distribution and doubling time. In spite of the centrosome overduplication due to polyploidization, the majority of Hep 3 B-T cells underwent bipolar mitosis. Polyploidization sensitized cells to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agents</b> inflicted by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors without affecting the sensitivity to spindle inhibitors. Accordingly, I found that more gamma-H 2 AX foci, a molecular marker present on sites of DNA damage, were induced by radiation in Hep 3 B-T cells than in Hep 3 B cells. Furthermore, similar increase in radiosensitivity occurred in primary tetraploid fibroblasts in comparison with normal diploid fibroblasts. These results raise an implication for chemotherapy of which some cancer cells may be sensitized to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agents</b> by a preceding step that induces polyploidization...|$|R
40|$|Annexin A 2 is an {{abundant}} cellular protein that is mainly localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, however a small {{population has been}} found in the nucleus, suggesting a nuclear function for the protein. Annexin A 2 possesses a nuclear export sequence (NES) and inhibition of the NES is sufficient to cause nuclear accumulation. Here we show that annexin A 2 accumulates in the nucleus in response to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agents</b> including gamma-radiation, UV radiation, etoposide and chromium VI and that this event is mediated by the nuclear export sequence of annexin A 2. Nuclear accumulation of annexin A 2 is blocked by the antioxidant agent N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and stimulated by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), suggesting that this is a reactive oxygen species dependent event. In response to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agents,</b> cells depleted of annexin A 2 show enhanced phospho-histone H 2 AX and p 53 levels, increased numbers of p 53 -binding protein 1 nuclear foci and increased levels of nuclear 8 -oxo- 29 -deoxyguanine, suggesting that annexin A 2 plays a role in protecting DNA from damage.

Induction of a protooncogene, normally involved in mitogenic responses, by a <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agent</b> that causes growth arrest seems paradoxical.

Cells lacking c-Jun undergo prolonged cell-cycle arrest, but resist apoptosis, whereas cells that express c-Jun constitutively do not arrest and undergo apoptosis. This function of c-Jun is exerted through negative regulation of p 53 association with the p 21 promoter.

40|$|Acetylation of histone H 3 on lysine 56 {{occurs during}} mitotic and meiotic S phase in fungal species. This {{acetylation}} blocks a direct electrostatic interaction between histone H 3 and nucleosomal DNA, {{and the absence}} of this modification is associated with extreme sensitivity to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agents.</b> We show here that H 3 -K 56 acetylation is catalyzed when Rtt 109, a protein that lacks significant homology to known acetyltransferases, forms an active complex with either of two histone binding proteins, Asf 1 or Vps 75. Rtt 109 binds to both these cofactors, but not to histones alone, forming enzyme complexes with kinetic parameters similar to those of known histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes. Therefore, H 3 -K 56 acetylation is catalyzed by a previously unknown mechanism that requires a complex of two proteins: Rtt 109 and a histone chaperone. Additionally, these complexes are functionally distinct, with the Rtt 109 /Asf 1 complex, but not the Rtt 109 /Vps 75 complex, being critical for resistance to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{signalling}} loop {{concept was}} introduced in 1991 to explain activation of membrane and cytoplasmic kinases in response to DNA damage inflicted by ionizing radiation.
