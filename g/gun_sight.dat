5|$|What may be {{the most}} {{originally}} restored Spitfire in the world is maintained at Fantasy of Flight in Polk City, Florida. Over a six-year period in the 1990s, this aircraft was slowly restored by Personal Plane Services in England using almost 90% of its original aircraft skins. Owner Kermit Weeks insisted that the aircraft be restored as closely as possible to its original condition. Machine guns, cannon, <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> and original working radios are all installed.|$|E
5|$|Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese {{aircraft}} downed were {{credited to}} this weapon, {{with the high}} point being 48.3% {{for the second half}} of 1942. In 1943 the revolutionary Mark 14 <b>Gun</b> <b>Sight</b> was introduced which made these guns even more effective; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II. They were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier 40mm Bofors AA guns.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its <b>gun</b> <b>sight.</b> The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E

40|$|Construction for a 19 th-century Confederate ironclad ram {{known as}} CSS Georgia began in March 1862 after the Ladies Gunboat Association of Savannah, Georgia raised the {{necessary}} funds. However, Georgia never saw action and {{spent most of}} its career moored on the Savannah River. The Confederates intentionally sunk Georgia as General William T. Sherman?s troops approached Savannah in 1864 to prevent its capture by Union forces. It spent the next 150 years {{at the bottom of the}} channel. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Savannah District, in partnership with Panamerican Consultants, Inc., the Conservation Research Laboratory (CRL) at Texas A&M University, and the U. S. Naval History and Heritage Command, organized the recovery of thousands of artifacts and sent many of them to the CRL for subsequent conservation. This vast collection of artifacts includes a set of brass naval instruments known as <b>gun</b> <b>sights.</b> Their use enhanced the accuracy of guns during engagements at sea. Additionally, Georgia yielded brass percussion locks that facilitated the instantaneous discharge of naval guns. They represent one of the largest archaeologically recovered collections of naval <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> and percussion locks from this era. A brief historical survey of the introduction of guns at sea places the naval <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> and percussion locks within a broader context. Between the 16 th-century and the Civil War, the world?s navies placed different kinds of <b>sighting</b> mechanisms on <b>guns</b> and these continued to improve until their culmination in the form of the complex naval <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> and percussion locks recovered from Georgia. The design and use of the Georgia <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> reflects an understanding of the physical properties of a projectile in flight. The evolution of naval gunnery, sighting mechanisms used on guns, and the scientific understanding of the physical properties of a projectile in flight all form a strong basis from which a detailed analysis of the naval <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> and percussion locks under study can be made. This research sheds more light on aspects of naval gunnery during the Civil War...|$|R
5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft <b>gun</b> <b>sights,</b> anti tank <b>gun</b> <b>sights,</b> and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|R
5|$|On 1 December 1958 he was {{appointed}} {{a member of the}} de Havilland board, but the company was sold and merged into Hawker Siddeley in 1960. With the Siddeley company, he was instrumental in the development in the Hawker Siddeley Trident in 1962. Cunningham worked under the managing director Arnold Alexander Hall, whom he had first met in 1940 to iron out the malfunctions in the Beaufighter <b>gun</b> <b>sight.</b> Later Cunningham acted as a consultant and advisor to the Chinese Government from 1972–79 as the company sought to increase its revenue by selling aircraft to China. At their insistence, he postponed his retirement for three years to complete a series of aircraft sales. On 1 May 1975 the British Government announced the nationalisation of the industry and British Aerospace consumed all the nation's manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|After the Falklands War, the UK {{government}} began upgrading the defences of the Falkland Islands {{to guard against}} any further aggression from Argentina. One of the measures taken was the deployment of an interceptor squadron to the islands, with 23 Squadron forming at RAF Stanley in October 1983. At the time, the air defence variant of the Panavia Tornado was still in development, meaning that the Phantom was the UK's primary air defence aircraft (supported by two remaining squadrons of Lightnings). The removal of a squadron of Phantoms to the Falkland Islands left {{a gap in the}} UK's air defences and nothing immediately available to fill it, given that the Tornado was still some years from service. As a result, the UK government decided to purchase another squadron of Phantoms. Because the aircraft in RAF service were a special production batch built to UK specifications, it would not be possible to obtain identical aircraft, so 15 second-hand airframes were procured from among the best of the ex-US Navy F-4Js stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and the Naval Air Rework Facility at NAS North Island. The F-4J was chosen because it was the variant from which the RAF's F-4Ks and F-4Ms were developed, and was thus the closest available to the British aircraft. The 15 that were selected were extensively refurbished and brought to a standard almost equivalent to the F-4S, which was the last variant in service with the US Navy, the only differences being the absence of leading-edge slats and a helmet <b>gun</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before joining DRL as a {{part-time}} staff member in 1950, Jeffress worked on campus at UT with the War Research Lab, where he helped with the development and testing of a new <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> for the B-29 and B-36 bombers, {{as well as with}} the Military Physics Research Lab.

25|$|Unlike the L-39 {{anti-tank}} rifle, {{weapons in}} the 20 ItK 40 VKT are designed for full-automatic fire and so do not suffer from the similar structural weaknesses as the full-automatic conversion L-39/44 anti-aircraft rifles. The rate of fire for the gun is adjustable, with a maximum cyclic rate of 2x700 rounds per minute, and a more commonly used rate of 2x360 rounds per minute. The gun is loaded from 20 round magazines, with an empty weight of 5.6kg and 11–12kg full, {{depending on the type}} of ammunition. The 20x138B Long Solothurn cartridge used in 20 ItK 40 VKT was also used in the L-39 anti-tank rifle as well as the other 20mm anti-aircraft guns, the 20 ITK 30 and 20 ITK 35, used by field army units. The <b>gun</b> <b>sight,</b> designed by Osmo Niskanen and manufactured by Strömberg company, was not entirely satisfactory and was more complicated to use than the sight in the German 20 ITK 30. The gun trailer was also problematic, as it was rather frail and offered a ground clearance of only 20cm. Thus the towing speed was limited to 30–40km/h and the mobility of the gun was limited. Equipment used with the gun included spare magazines with a transport case, gun tarpaulin, a transport case for the <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> and a toolkit.|$|E
25|$|In late January 1942, the {{squadron}} became operational {{and joined the}} remnants of several others {{that had been in}} Malaya, operating out of RAF Seletar and RAF Kallang. During one of his first sorties, Gorton was involved in a brief dogfight over the South China Sea, after which he suffered engine failure and was forced to land on Bintan island, 40km (25mi) south east of Singapore. As he landed, one of the Hurricane's wheels hit an embankment and flipped over. Gorton was not properly strapped in and his face hit the <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> and windscreen, mutilating his nose and breaking both cheekbones. He also suffered severe lacerations to both arms. He made {{his way out of the}} wreck and was rescued by members of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, who provided some medical treatment. Gorton later claimed that his face was so badly cut and bruised, that a member of the RAF sent to collect him assumed he was near death, collected his personal effects and returned to Singapore without him. By chance, one week later, Sgt Matt O'Mara of No. 453 Squadron RAAF also crash landed on Bintan, and arranged for them to be collected.|$|E
500|$|Air Marshal Sholto Douglas {{formed the}} [...] "Night Fighting Committee" [...] and met {{regularly}} at Bentley Priory to discuss operational problems. As an experienced aviator, Cunningham {{was invited to}} attend. Henry Tizard invited Cunningham to air his views at the meeting. Tizard referred him to the Royal Aircraft Establishment to meet Arnold Alexander Hall, a <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> expert. With his engineering expertise and Cunningham's assessment of the issue, Hall ironed out the inadequacies in the design. Hall later became Cunningham's managing director at Hawker Siddeley twenty years later. Cunningham also worked with ground control of interception (GCI) carrying out various exercises. He made the acquaintance of Philip Joubert de la Ferté, (Chief of the Air Staff), who dropped in on 604 as well as Douglas—the two men were always keen to hear {{the experiences of the}} crew.|$|E

50|$|Often a target, {{for example}} a {{vertical}} wooden sighting panel (or a sighting pole, {{not unlike a}} surveyor's target rod) was placed precisely over the DP marker so that the guns of the battery could sight on it and adjust the offsets of their <b>gun</b> <b>sights.</b>|$|R
500|$|The A-1 {{differed}} from the A-0 only slightly. As well as {{the installation of the}} Jumo 210D, the A-1 had two 220L (60US gal) fuel tanks built into the inner wing, but it was not armoured or protected. The A-1 was also intended to be fitted with a quartet of 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns in its wings, but two of these - one per side - were omitted due to weight concerns; the pair that remained were fed a total of 500 rounds of ammunition, stored in the design's characteristic transverse strut-braced, large-planform undercarriage [...] "trousers", not used on the Ju 87B versions and onward. The pilot relied on the Revi C 21C <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> for the two MG 17s. The gunner had only a single 7.92mm (.312) MG 15, with 14 drums of ammunition, each containing 75 rounds. This represented a 150-round increase in this area over the Ju 87 A-0. The A-1 was also fitted with a larger [...] propeller.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few days 452 re-equipped with Spitfire VBs which had two Hispano-Suiza HS.404 calibre cannon in each wing to {{supplement}} four 7.7mm (0.303in) Browning machine guns. Finucane hand-picked AB852 because it had the code W adorned on the fuselage. The Spitfire that Finucane damaged in the collision with Dutton earlier also had this letter. Superstition compelled him to fly with a W-decorated fighter for good luck. On Saturday 16 August 1941 Finucane celebrated his greatest success in this machine. Circus 73 began at 07:25, and once again the wing was sent to Saint Omer. Near Gravelines eight to ten Bf 109s engaged 485 squadron. At the customary 100 yards a two-second burst—his second—put the first enemy aircraft into a spin. Pilot Officer Truscott witnessed it diving steeply at 1,000ft and spinning. At midday 452, 602 and 485 participated in Circus 74 but made no claims. At 17:45 Circus 75 yielded another response from the Luftwaffe. Kenley performed the role of escort wing. Eight Bf 109s engaged at 9,000ft and 452 claimed seven. Finucane engaged one which caught fire and emitted a lot of white smoke. He then opened fire on another from 10 yards after his <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> failed. The Bf 109 lost its tail unit. The day's successes were victory numbers 9, 10 and 11.|$|E
500|$|Returning {{to a job}} in {{the physics}} {{department}} at Auckland, Gascoigne worked on military optics, developing gun sights and rangefinders, although he did not remain there for long. Richard van der Riet Woolley, director of the Commonwealth Solar Observatory in Canberra (now Mount Stromlo Observatory), sought out Gascoigne because his [...] "experience in optical work [...] unique" [...] and Gascoigne was [...] "trained in a way that no one else in Australia has been qualified". When in 1941 Gascoigne was offered a research fellowship by Woolley, he moved to Canberra. The Solar Observatory staff had similar responsibilities to those Gascoigne had held in New Zealand. His first task was to design an anti-aircraft <b>gun</b> <b>sight,</b> and he was also involved in a range of other military optical projects. In 1944, the Melbourne Observatory, home to the Commonwealth Time Service, was closed. Gascoigne reestablished the Time Service at Mount Stromlo, using two Shortt-Synchronome clocks and astronomical observing equipment that he and his colleagues adapted; the Time Service remained at Mount Stromlo until 1968. The knowledge and experience Gascoigne gained during the war proved valuable. He was at the only facility in Australia where optical work could be done, from design and manufacture to assembly and testing. Gascoigne developed a wide range of skills and [...] "finished up quite practical, especially with a screwdriver." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the unique}} {{features}} of the AMX-30 was the Obus à Charge Creuse de 105mm Modèle F1 (Obus G) HEAT projectile and its main gun, the Modèle F1, a monoblock steel [...] cannon. HEAT warheads suffer when spin stabilized, a product of rifled barrels, causing the French to develop the Obus G, (Gresse). This projectile was composed of two major parts, including the outer shell and a suspended inner shell, divided by ball bearings. This allowed the projectile to be spin-stabilized, and therefore more accurate than a normal fin-stabilized HEAT-round, while the inner shell did not move, allowing the warhead to work at maximum efficiency. The warhead, containing 780gram hexolite, could penetrate up to [...] of steel armour and was effective against tanks at up to [...] As it combined a good accuracy with a penetration that was independent of range, it has been considered an [...] "ideal round" [...] for its day The AMX-30 was also designed to fire the OCC F1 Mle.60 high explosive projectile, the SCC F1 training warhead and the OFUM PH-105 F1 smoke round. The main gun was coupled with a [...] recoil brake, which had a maximum extension of , and could depress to −8 degrees or elevate to 20 degrees. The turret's firepower was augmented by a coaxial [...] M2 Browning machine gun. The tank commander also made use of a [...] anti-aircraft machine gun on the turret roof. The vehicle carried 50 [...] projectiles, 748 [...] rounds and 2,050 [...] bullets. The tank commander was issued a cupola which offered ten all-around direct-vision episcopes, and a binocular telescope with 10x magnification. The commander was also given an optical full-field coincidence range finder. The gunner was given a telescoping <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> and two observation periscopes.|$|E
2500|$|Another approach, {{common to}} Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan, while {{recognising}} {{the necessity to}} increase armament, preferred a system that kept a pair of synchronized guns, at least as its core.
