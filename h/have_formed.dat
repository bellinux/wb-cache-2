5|$|Different factions {{may have}} {{existed in the}} royal court. The k'uhul ahaw and his {{household}} would <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.|$|E

5|$|In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), {{an object}} {{orbiting}} a young companion star {{at a distance}} of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must <b>have</b> <b>formed,</b> as stars do, from gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's regular {{satellites}} {{are believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.

5|$|Some {{asteroid}} families <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> recently, in astronomical terms. The Karin Cluster apparently formed about 5.7 {{million years}} ago from a collision with a progenitor asteroid 33km in radius.

Most of the members appear gray, and are believed to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> from the breakup of a captured asteroid.|$|E

5|$|The Moon {{is thought}} to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely {{accepted}} {{explanation is that the}} Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E

5|$|The {{concentration}} of maria on the Near Side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> in a slow-velocity {{impact of a}} second moon of Earth a few {{tens of millions of}} years after their formation.|$|E

5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and are thought to <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of {{an unknown number of}} small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was believed to}} <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> from a low-pressure area, possibly on {{the tail end of}} a cold front on October 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began to curve west-southwestward on October 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on October 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on October 17 as a tropical depression. No damage is known to have been caused by the {{tropical storm}}.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and <b>have</b> <b>formed</b> numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
