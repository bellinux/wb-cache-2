In this research, a lateral pipeline with two diameters (tapered), laid on horizontal, uphill and downhill slopes that usually faced in design were investigated using back stepwise method. Effect of different parameters such as variation of friction factor along the pipeline, variation of discharge with head and velocity head on the total <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> and pressure along the pipeline was studied. Location of average operating pressure head along the pipeline for different slopes and tapering length ratios, which is important for computing the inlet and end pressures head, was estimated. Furthermore, empirical equations for estimating the ratio of <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> at location of average pressure head to the total <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> were developed. Then the pressure head at the upstream end or downstream end can be computed using friction correction factor method. The results showed that neglecting the effect of variation of friction factor underestimate the value of <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> along the lateral and neglecting the effect of variation in discharge overestimate the value of <b>head</b> <b>loss,</b> therefore, neglecting effects of the two parameters {{at the same time}} leads to a value of <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> very near to the value of exact solution.

40|$|Groundwater wells {{can have}} extreme {{pressure}} buildup when injecting and extreme pressure drawdown when extracting. Greater wellbore {{contact with the}} aquifer minimizes pressure buildup and pressure drawdown. Aquifers are usually much more laterally extensive than vertically thick. Therefore, horizontal wells can be longer than vertical wells thus increasing aquifer contact and minimizing pressure issues. The length and therefore the effectiveness of horizontal wells are limited by two factors, either well construction or intra-wellbore <b>head</b> <b>loss.</b> Currently no analytical groundwater model rigorously accounts for intra-wellbore kinetic and friction <b>head</b> <b>loss.</b> We have developed a semi-analytical, intra-wellbore <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> model dynamically linked to an aquifer.

We verified our intra-wellbore <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> model against MODFLOW-CFP and found matches of three significant figures. We then completed 360 simulations to investigate intra-wellbore <b>head</b> <b>loss.</b> We found that only when aquifer drawdown was small will intra-wellbore <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> be relatively important. We found intra-wellbore <b>head</b> <b>loss</b> is relatively important only in extreme scenarios.

To investigate well construction limitations, we developed an equation for the optimal slant rig entry angle, a drilling forces model, and a well construction cost model. We then collected well cost data and combined these models to make 60 well cost estimates. We found the relative cost of a horizontal well, compared to a vertical well, decreases with depth. We then used our aquifer model to investigate the benefits of horizontal wells. We found several parameters that increase the number of vertical wells replaced by a horizontal well. These parameters include less time since pumping began, nearby recharge boundaries, vertical fractures, lower permeability, higher specific storativity, and thinner aquifers. Comparing horizontal well benefit with cost, we found that horizontal wells may or may not be economically advantageous depending on site specific conditions...|$|R
