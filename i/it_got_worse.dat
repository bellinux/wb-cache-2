5|$|On {{the return}} leg to Australia, the team {{stopped on the}} Indian subcontinent. Davidson's 37 in the inaugural one off Test against Pakistan was his first score beyond 25 in nine Tests. He was bowled {{sparingly}} {{with a total of}} 2/15 from 15 overs as Australia lost by nine wickets. A muscle problem stopped Davidson from playing against India in the First Test in Madras, which Australia won by an innings. He played only in the Second Test, with pacemen Miller and Ron Archer injured and unavailable. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> for Australia as Davidson and fellow paceman Pat Crawford were hampered by stomach bugs and a hip strains respectively. Davidson scored 16 and took match figures of 1/42; Australia were unable to finish off the Indians with their depleted attack and the match ended in a draw. Davidson was left out of the Third Test win, so his overseas tour had ended without a Test victory, and only 64runs at 16.00 and his underused bowling yielded five wickets at 22.60. In total, he had played twelve Tests, none of them resulting in an Australian victory. His individual performances were also unimpressive despite being successful at first-class level, producing only 317runs at 18.64 and 16 wickets at 34.06. It was to be another year before Davidson tasted victory at the highest level.|$|E
25|$|Lancashire batted first {{after losing}} the toss at Worcester, and were soon in trouble. At 81 for 3, Andrew Flintoff, playing his first {{first-class}} match after returning from injury, came to the crease. However, after facing 5 balls {{he was back in}} the Pavilion without scoring. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> for Lancashire as they fell to 97 for 6 and 196 all out, mostly thanks to an unbeaten 69 from wicket-keeper Warren Hegg. In reply, Worcestershire lost Stephen Moore early, but Graeme Hick and Stephen Peters were there at close, with Worcestershire on 59 for 1.|$|E
25|$|Representatives of the HOS of NDH {{accepted}} the surrender on 15 May at 16:00 hours. After the immediate repatriation {{of the soldiers}} at Bleiburg was complete, the Yugoslav forces began disarming them and started preparations for transporting the prisoners back. A large number of columns of prisoners were formed in rows of four that were sent on a forced march through Slovenia. Due {{to the presence of}} the British Army, the initial treatment of prisoners was correct. However, <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> as the columns moved away from the border. The prisoners were given no food or water and were looted of valuables. Those who lagged behind were shot. Individual killings and executions of smaller groups of men soon began. The columns were in Dravograd directed to Maribor or Slovenj Gradec and Celje. On 17 May, the British started the repatriation of Croat internees of the Viktring camp, mostly members of the HOS.|$|E

50|$|The {{signing of}} Walker {{and several other}} Heisman Trophy winners gave the league much-needed credibility. However, the Dixon plan did not call for as much {{spending}} on talent as the league did in 1983. <b>It</b> only <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> in 1984 {{with the arrival of}} free spending financial pacesetters Oldenburg and Trump.|$|R
25|$|Nick Barmby {{marked his}} 500th career {{appearance}} {{against one of}} his former clubs as Middlesbrough visited Hull City for the first ever top-flight match between the two sides. Hull lined up with former Boro captain George Boateng in midfield after his departure during the summer. The previous four league meetings between the two sides had all ended in 0–0 draws, and it looked like the match was heading for another until Tuncay opened the scoring on 79 minutes. Boro's lead didn't last long however, as Bernard Mendy's shot hit the post and rebounded off of goalkeeper Ross Turnbull to go down as an own goal. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> for the visitors as just a few minutes later, Hull were awarded a soft penalty when Wheater tangled with Geovanni – a challenge which also saw the Middlesbrough defender receive a red card. TV replays showed that Geovanni was offside when the ball was played to him, but nothing was awarded by the assistant referee. Marlon King converted the penalty to give Hull a 2–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|The winless run entered {{double figures}} when Middlesbrough went down 3–0 away to West Bromwich Albion. Injuries to Pogatetz and Walker meant a {{reshuffle}} in both defense and midfield, and after just four minutes Boro were behind. The defense appealed {{in vain for}} offside as Chris Brunt fired home a heavily deflected shot. Another deflection saw Robert Koren's strike roll past Ross Turnbull to put the home side two goals up {{early in the second}} half. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> for the visitors had Didier Digard sent off for appearing to jump into a challenge on Borja Valero. Koren got his second goal not long after to add to Boro's misery. West Brom's win over Boro, added to their win earlier in the season, meant they completed their first ever Premier League double. The Middlesbrough players reaction to Digard's sending off lead to The FA charging the club with failing to control their players. A handful of Boro players surrounded referee Mark Halsey to protest as he tried to push Digard off of the pitch, with Halsey dropping one of his cards as a result. Middlesbrough finally dropped into the relegation zone following Tottenham's victory over Portsmouth the following day.|$|E
25|$|A week later, at the {{beginning}} of March, Stevenage won their second away game on the bounce; beating Eastbourne Borough 60. Captain Mark Roberts gave Stevenage the lead just before the break, following a well-worked free-kick involving both Joel Byrom and Scott Laird. After the interval, Stevenage doubled their lead when David Bridges headed in Joel Byrom's cross. It was three shortly after following a mistake from Eastbourne goalkeeper Danny Knowles, Chris Beardsley blocked the goalkeepers clearance and slid the ball into an empty net. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> for the home side ten minutes from time when Beardsley chased a long through ball and was hauled down by Darren Baker just inside the area - the defender being shown a straight red. Substitute Mitchell Cole slotted the penalty home, before adding another after good work from Eddie Odhiambo. Cole completed his hat-trick moments later slotting home Stacy Long's through ball. A third successive victory followed in a 20 win at home to Crawley Town. In a tight game, Stevenage took the lead just after the interval thanks to a rasping effort from Michael Bostwick after a well-worked corner. A second goal came deep into injury-time, Chris Beardsley countering and setting up Lee Boylan to slide the ball into the net. Three days later, Stevenage beat Barrow 40 to ensure a fourth consecutive win. In a tight first half, the home side took the lead through Yemi Odubade. Borough doubled their lead shortly before the interval; left-back Scott Laird firing the ball home. Odubade then scored his second after countering a Barrow corner, and subsequently completed his hat-trick late on with an effort drilled high into the net. Stevenage recorded their fifth straight win, beating Histon 10 at Broadhall Way. Jon Ashton scored the only goal of the game when he swept home Stacy Long's corner.|$|E

2500|$|The {{southern}} economy greatly suffered {{after the}} Italian unification {{and the process}} of industrialisation was interrupted. Poverty and organised crime were long-standing issues in Southern Italy as well and <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> after unification. Cavour stated the basic problem was poor government, and believed the solution lied in the strict application of the Piedmonese legal system. The main result was an upsurge in brigandage. Because of this, the South experienced great economic difficulties resulting in massive emigration leading to a worldwide Italian diaspora, especially to the United States and South America. Many natives also relocated to the industrial cities in northern Italy, such as Genoa, Milan and Turin. A relative process of industrialisation has developed in some areas of the [...] "Mezzogiorno" [...] after World WarII.

2500|$|On January 17 Kentucky {{traveled}} to Tuscaloosa to defeat Alabama 70 to 48. Kentucky used two big runs {{to take a}} 35 to 17 lead by halftime. Alabama trimmed the lead in half with a 13-4 run {{coming out of the}} locker room, when the Wildcats missed their first five shots. The rally was short-lived, and then <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> for the Tide. The Wildcats reclaimed control with 10 straight points en route to a 16-2 run that featured two 3-pointers by Ulis, one by Booker and a powerful dunk by Cauley-Stein. Freshman Devin Booker scored 13 points and remained solid from the perimeter. On January 20 Kentucky defeated Vanderbilt 65 to 57 at Rupp Arena. The Wildcats didn't lead by double digits until early in the second half, and that 45 to 33 advantage lasted briefly as the Commodores began answering from the perimeter to stay within reach. Five combined 3-pointers by Vanderbilt's Riley LaChance (16 points) and Matthew Fisher-Davis (13) helped Vanderbilt pull within 58 to 54 with 2:36 left. The Commodores never got closer as the Harrisons closed it out for the Wildcats. On January 24 Kentucky {{traveled to}} Columbia to defeat South Carolina 58 to 43. In the season prior, Kentucky lost 72 to 67 on this same floor only weeks before their run to the National Championship game. However, the Wildcats turned up the defense to make sure that didn't happen this time after South Carolina's Sindarius Thornwell hit a 3-pointer for a 24 to 23 South Carolina lead with 4:31 left that sent the fans into a frenzy. Ulis started the comeback for Kentucky with a steal and basket before Booker made two fouls shots and a dunk and the Wildcats were on their way. Booker scored seven points in Kentucky's 14 to 0 run that spanned both halves, closing the surge with a 3-pointer that put the Wildcats ahead 37 to 24 with 18:28 remaining. On January 29 the Wildcats again traveled to Columbia, this time to defeat Missouri 69 to 53. The Tigers looked game for most of the first half. Milking the clock with crisp ball movement, Missouri was able to crack Kentucky's long and lean front line for easy baskets. Missouri's Keanau Post started it with a rim-rattling dunk a few minutes in, and a pair of dunks by Ryan Rosburg had the fans in Mizzou Arena on their feet. Another dunk by Jakeenan Gant late in the half allowed the Tigers to close within 32 to 25. The Wildcats struggled some more early in the second half, throwing up a series of ugly jumpers and missing a couple shots at the rim. Missouri struggled to take advantage, but did close within 38 to 32 on Clark's basket with 14:25 to go. Foul trouble began to set in, though, with Missouri's Namon Wright and Montaque Gill-Caesar each picking up their fourth with more than 15 minutes left in the game. The Wildcats, with more quality depth, were able to capitalize on their absences and put together a 10 to 2 run to gain control. The Harrison twins led the way. Aaron knocked down a jumper, and after Andrew did the same, he proceeded to the foul line on the next four trips down the floor. Wright fouled out with 8:52 to go. Gill-Caesar joined him less than a minute later. And by the time the Wildcats had hit those free throws, their lead had swelled to 56 to 36. On January 30 Kentucky faced off against Alabama for the second time this season at Rupp Arena, defeating the Crimson Tide 70 to 55. Towns scored all 12 of his points in the first half to put Kentucky ahead. Cauley-Stein snapped out of a mini-slump with 12 points and four rebounds, Booker added 11 points with three 3-pointers and Aaron Harrison had 10. Kentucky quickly rolled to a double-digit lead and positioned itself to blow out Alabama before settling for a 37 to 24 advantage at the break. Kentucky controlled the paint 28 to 14 while their bench dominated the Tide 31 to 8. Kentucky also committed just five turnovers while forcing Alabama into 13 mistakes that resulted in 20 points.|$|E

Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season—hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22–60 record.|$|R
50|$|This game went {{much better}} for the Dragons, as they teed off on the uncharacteristically wild Daiei pitching. Five Hawks {{pitchers}} combined {{for a total of}} 10 walks. Second-year starter Kenshin Kawakami started for the Dragons and had a much better game than Noguchi did the previous day. Kawakami also got a lot of help from both his offense and Daiei starter Kenichi Wakatabe, as he was all over the place in the first inning. Wakatabe walked leadoff man Koichi Sekikawa, then recorded the first out of the game. However, <b>it</b> only <b>got</b> <b>worse</b> as Kosuke Fukudome and Leo Gómez both drew walks to load the bases. Kazuyoshi Tatsunami then followed it up with a towering two-run double to center to give the Dragons a 2-0 lead. Wakatabe also walked Kazuki Inoue for a total of four free passes in the first inning.|$|R

The home side were then awarded a penalty, but Begović managed to keep out Steed Malbranque's effort. In the second half, Stoke were better and thought they scored when Jones headed the ball past Simon Mignolet, but Lee Cattermole stopped the ball with his hand; referee Martin Atkinson did not award either the goal or a penalty. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> even <b>worse</b> for Stoke as Shawcross was sent off for two bookable offences and Gyan scored a deflected goal to give Steve Bruce's team a 2-0 win.|$|R

(According to historian Helen James, his brother Naungdawgyi and possibly his father Alaungpaya died from the same disease.) The palace was full of rumors and intrigues about the succession. The army commanders, who were already acting like warlords even before the king's illness, were sure that the king would die soon, and now routinely ignored the king's orders to tone down their behavior, unimaginable only a few years back. The once self-assured king also became paranoid. He trusted only Pierre de Milard, the French commander in his service that he sometimes asked de Milard to sleep in the same room as him in order to protect him against possible attacks linked to a succession dispute.|$|R
