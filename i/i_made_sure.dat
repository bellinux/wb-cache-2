When you're pregnant, it's {{a little bit harder}} to breathe, so it was hard doing all the choreography and singing at the same time. I just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better put me in this DVD.' So <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> I did." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{enhanced}} remake titled Mega Man Powered Up — {{known as}} [...] in Japan — was released worldwide for the PSP in 2006. The game features a graphical overhaul with 3D chibi-style character models with large heads and small bodies. Inafune had originally planned to make Mega Man look this way, {{but could not}} due to the hardware constraints of the NES. Producer Tetsuya Kitabayashi stated that redesigning the character models {{was a result of}} the PSP's 16:9 widescreen ratio. The larger heads on the characters allowed the development team to create visible facial expressions. [...] "The concept for these designs was 'toys'. We wanted cute designs geared towards little kids ... the kinds of characters that you'd see hanging off of keychains and such," [...] character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa explained. [...] "Not only that, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> to tell the designers not to skimp on any of the original Mega Man details. We wanted their proportions and movements to be accurately reflected in these designs as well." [...] As the size of the remake's stages are not proportional to those of the original, the widescreen ratio also presented the developers with more space to fill.|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{airing of}} the show, while praising Hatch as [...] "forthright, trustworthy" [...] and [...] "humorous and kind-hearted," [...] he became {{publicly}} known for {{how he would}} always qualify his respect for Hatch with comments such as [...] "we've become real good friends, {{but not in a}} homosexual way." [...] Boesch would proclaim {{in front of the cameras}} [...] "I wouldn't allow Hatch in my home; wouldn't allow him to meet my family" [...] and, referring to when some Green Berets came to build an obstacle course, [...] "When them Green Berets were here, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> they knew Hatch was queer." ...|$|E

I was all ready to write a good script for him but he said, he wanted me to remake Billa", confirming it was Ajith Kumar's idea. The film was originally announced, provisionally after the release of the Bollywood film, [...] – which was a remake of the yesteryear film with the same name from 1978. Also from the 1978 version of Don, a remake was made in 1980 into Tamil, called Billa. 2007's Billa drew inspirations from these three versions. Suresh Balaji, who had acted in the yesteryear version of Billa, acquired the rights to produce the film. The film became the second Tamil film to be remade from its yesteryear version after Naan Avanillai.|$|E
2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I must say. I learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, it made it more like we were saying, [...] "Let’s do it!" ...|$|E

60|$|My Jap cook Takahashi met me in Flagstaff. He {{was a very}} short, very broad, very muscular {{little fellow}} with a brown, strong face, more {{pleasant}} than usually seen in Orientals. Secretly <b>I</b> had <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that in Takahashi I had discovered a treasure, but I was careful to conceal this conviction from R.C., the Doyles, and Nielsen.

5000|$|He {{was also}} {{affected}} from having {{worked as a}} second assistant director on Bullitt (1968), which featured a famous car chase. He said, [...] "What made the Bullitt chase remarkable was not just stunts. It was the technique of shooting from inside car. You really {{felt it was a}} rollercoaster ride as well as something you were observing. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> damn <b>sure</b> that when I was doing The Driver I filmed an enormous amount of inside shots." ...|$|R

"The {{sight of}} this monster rather {{relieved}} than heightened my terrors--for <b>I</b> now <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> dreamed, and endeavored to arouse myself to waking consciousness.

A small spring of water presented itself to my view, and here, stooping, I bathed {{my hands and}} my head and neck. This seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and proceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'M. de Nid de Merle {{has been}} all the spring in Poland with the King,' said the minister, 'and the poor lady {{is thought to have}} perished at La Sablerie.

60|$|While Theodore {{was busy}} {{clearing}} up {{the debris of}} our luncheon, I not only gave him the slip, but as I went out I took the precaution of locking the outer door after me, and taking the key away in my pocket. <b>I</b> thus <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that Theodore could not follow me. I then walked to Passy--a matter of two kilometres--and by four o'clock I had the satisfaction of stowing the papers safely away {{under one of the}} tiles in the flooring of my room, and then pulling the strip of carpet in front of my bed snugly over the hiding-place.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have read}} your {{biography}} of Charles Lamb with inexpressible pleasure and interest.

I ought to have known that that was just the thing they would do, for while the search would be keen among the islets near the land, and the villages there, no one would think of looking for them on the seaward islands.|$|R

5000|$|Regarding this period, Dunnery {{would later}} comment [...] "There {{was no one}} I could rely on... <b>I</b> somehow <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> had other places to live and spend my time (talk {{about the power of}} the human spirit) because I couldn't bear to be at home when my parents were drinking. I can still {{remember}} the smell of the house when my parents were drowning in hops. To this day the smell of Carlsberg Special Brew makes me want to vomit." [...] In later years, Dunnery would himself drink heavily and eventually succumb to alcoholism (finally overcoming his addiction in the early 1990s). Many of his songs would reference his struggles with alcoholism and the behaviour that surrounded it.|$|R
6000|$|... "If your question's ironical," [...] she laughed, [...] "your irony's {{perfectly}} wasted.

[...] It was with an intensity of silence that he appeared to accept this; he was even so dumb for a minute that the oddity of the image could draw from him no natural sound. The Duchess once more, accordingly, recognised an occasion.
