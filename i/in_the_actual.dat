5|$|Admission is {{competitive}} and decisions {{are based on}} evaluations of applicants' intellectual ability, social and emotional maturity, and readiness for the accelerated program of study. Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group must submit IQ test results {{at or above the}} 91stpercentile (over 120 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an entire day, where they are assessed by teachers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> classroom setting.|$|E

5|$|An Israeli {{reserve unit}} {{was called in}} from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages. They entrenched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> village, which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948, with British escort. Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood in the south, and the railway station. The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base {{just east of the}} village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was not involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E

Later that year the book Home and Away: Bobby and Frank, written by Margaret Pearce, was released as a tie-in novel about Frank and Bobby's marriage.

5|$|In 1992, an {{animated}} {{adaptation of the}} story was integrated with The Tale of Peter Rabbit and telecast on the BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends. Benjamin also appeared in the episodes, The Tale of Mr. Tod and The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and Mrs. Tittlemouse. Also in the BBC adaptation, Peter Rabbit's mother's first name is revealed to be Josephine, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> books, her first name is not given. In the CBeebies British and Nick Jr. American CGI animated children's television series, Benjamin is voiced by Peter Steve Harris in the US version and Danny Price in the U.K. version.|$|E
5|$|On both fronts, {{the horse}} was also used as a pack animal. Because railway lines could not {{withstand}} artillery bombardments, horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches, though the horses generally were not used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> trench zone. This role of horses was critical, and thus horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries. Following the war, many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised, armoured divisions, with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.|$|E
5|$|Producer David De Silva {{conceived}} the premise in 1976, partially {{inspired by the}} musical A Chorus Line. He commissioned Gore to write the script, originally titled Hot Lunch, before selling it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). After he was hired to direct the film, Parker rewrote the script with Gore, aiming for a darker and dramatic tone. The script's subject matter received criticism by the New York Board of Education, which prevented the production from filming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> High School of Performing Arts. The film was shot on location in New York City, with principal photography beginning in July 1979 and concluding after 91 days. Parker encountered a difficult filming process, which included conflicts with U.S. labor unions over {{various aspects of the}} film's production.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{attracted}} canon {{lawyers to}} his household, including Gerard la Pucelle, Peter of Blois, and Henry Pium of Northampton, {{all of whom}} advised him on legal matters. At the Council of Westminster that Richard convened in May 1175, nineteen canons were put forth, dealing with clerical marriage, the oversupply of ordained clergy, the behaviour of the clergy and their dress and tonsure, and simony. Another canon dealt with clandestine marriages and regulated child marriages. He was also heavily involved with trying judicial cases, both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> judgment {{as well as in}} the execution of judgments made by others. Four of his questions to Alexander III entered the Decretals and the other collections of canon law of the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|To {{the west}} of the Chilean Andes are an early group of eruptions, dated from the Oligocene and the Early Miocene (33.3–20.2mya). The scale of the eruptive events that {{produced}} these features remains unclear. Further east, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> range, are huge numbers of eruptions. Between 15.3 and 6.4mya, widespread volcanism took place, followed by extensive folding; this process then repeated itself from 18.4 to 13.7 mya during the Miocene. Beginning 6.4 mya the Chilean Andes were quiet, though whether or not this quiet period took place throughout all of the Andes remains unknown. Central Chilean volcanoes became active once again around 2.5mya, and have erupted almost continuously since.|$|E

5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
5|$|While a {{defendant}} {{is entitled to}} a fair cross section in the venire, the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> grand jury or petit jury. Yet, the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.|$|E
5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable skin disease, was cured after taking a bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, {{and both of them}} were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby making it difficult to identify the right king.|$|E
