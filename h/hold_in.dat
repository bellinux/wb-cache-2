5|$|Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{is known}} from nine {{isolated}} molars, including two first upper molars (M1), {{one of which}} is broken, two second upper molars (M2), one M3, two second lower molars (m2), and two m3.

5|$|Following Gillibrand's win, Republicans quickly began speculating about {{possible}} 2008 candidates.

30|$|Let now u≥ 1. If 0 < p≤ 1, then {{inequality}} (1) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> {{the reverse}} direction and, therefore, since u/p> 0, also (2) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> the reverse direction. If q≥ 1, then inequality (3) holds, and since 1 -u/q≤ 0 in this case, {{we conclude that}} (4) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> the reverse direction. In the case q< 0, inequality (3) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> the reverse direction, but since 1 -u/q≥ 0, inequality (4) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> the reverse direction also in this case. The second statement thus follows by using reverse Hölder’s inequality and arguing as in the proof of the first case.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{territorial}} gains produced by his {{defeat of the}} Persians were lost to the advance of the Muslims, Heraclius still ranks among the great Roman Emperors.

Johnson published works championing the rights of slaves, Jews, women, prisoners, Dissenters, chimney sweeps, abused animals, university students forbidden from marrying, victims of press gangs, and those unjustly accused of violating the game laws.|$|E

Wigan Borough, founded in 1919, became the town's first club to play in the Football League when in 1921 they became founder members of the Football League Third Division North. The club left the Football League and folded in 1931. They were replaced a year later by Wigan Athletic, the town's current professional football club.|$|E
5|$|Augustine St. Clare – Tom's {{third owner}} {{and father of}} Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit.

St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him.

He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
