We limited the scope of this model to <b>delayed</b> <b>flights</b> that resulted as a direct consequence of a consumer or producer’s action. Choosing to focus on the cost of wasted time, we developed an economic model of how airlines and customers interact under the imposition of <b>flight</b> <b>delay.</b> We then re-visited the data and used our model to inform and refine our econometric methods...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the National Airspace System (NAS) is the transportation of passengers and cargo. It is no surprise, therefore, that passenger trip time performance is positively correlated with passenger satisfaction, airfare elasticity, and airline profits. Regulatory consumer information available to airline passengers provides measures of trip performance using only flight data (and not passenger trip data). Previously, researchers, using a small set of proprietary airline data, demonstrated that trip delays experienced by passengers due to missed connections, cancelled <b>flights,</b> and <b>delayed</b> <b>flights</b> are not negligible. Further they showed that <b>flight</b> <b>delay</b> data cannot {{be used as a}} proxy for passenger trip delays. This paper describes a comparative statistical analysis between <b>flight</b> <b>delay</b> data and passenger trip delay data for one year’s worth of flights on the 1030 single segment routes between the OEP- 35 airports. The passenger trip data is derived from publicly available data-bases and accounts for delays experienced by passengers on single segment routes due to cancelled flights as well as <b>delayed</b> <b>flights.</b> The statistical analysis indicates that: (i) the percentage of on-time flights is statistically equivalent to the percentage of on-time passengers, (ii) the average passenger trip delay is 34 minutes in excess of the average <b>flight</b> <b>delay,</b> and (iii) average passenger trip delay for the worst 5 % of delayed passengers is 150 minutes in excess of the <b>flight</b> <b>delay.</b> The implications of these results for consumers and consumer protection are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{value of}} the air {{transportation}} system is the transportation of light-weight, high-value cargo, and passengers. Industry and government metrics {{for the performance of}} the air transportation focus on the performance of the flights. Previous research has identified the discrepancy between flight performance and passenger trip performance, and has developed algorithms for the estimation of passenger trip performance from publicly available data. This paper describes an analysis of passenger trip delays for 5224 routes between 309 air ports in the U. S. air transportation system for 2007. The average trip delay experienced by passengers was 24. 3 minutes for a nationwide total of 247 Million hours. <b>Flights</b> <b>delayed</b> 15 minutes or more contributed 48 % of the total <b>delays,</b> cancelled <b>flights</b> 43 %, diverted flights 3 %, and <b>flights</b> <b>delayed</b> less than 15 minutes contributed the remaining 6 %.

By this point, the National Weather Service issued a Tornado Emergency (the first of five to be issued during the outbreak) {{for most of the}} Memphis metropolitan area. The tornado produced an extensive swath of damage as it moved through residential and commercial areas. Considerable damage was reported at Memphis International Airport, where a hangar lost its roof, the FedEx freight terminal's fire station suffered roof damage, airstair trucks were thrown 100yards (91m), and aircraft were moved around, including a Boeing 737 that was moved one foot. FedEx service was disrupted due to <b>flight</b> <b>delays</b> and closed roads, all because of the tornado damage in surrounding areas. The airport weather station's reporting equipment recorded a wind gust of 73knots (84mph, 135km/h). In the Clarke Road area, tractor trailers were tossed around, a power substation was severely damaged, and several warehouse structures sustained heavy damage. This included a DSC warehouse that was destroyed, killing three people inside. Numerous windows were shattered at the Willow Lake Business Park, and utility poles and trees were snapped in the area. Multiple homes along Maple Tree Drive and Pinbranch Court were damaged, five of which sustained major damage. The Hardy Bottling Company facility was also damaged, which released 120,000pounds (54,500kg) of anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere, although no public health impacts were reported. Continuing northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and struck the Hickory Ridge Mall, resulting in total collapse of a large wall and much of the roof at the Sears department store. Damage surveyors noted very poor construction at this location, and six people in the mall were injured. Cars and semi-trailers near the mall were flipped and damaged as well. A Taco Bell and a few other businesses were damaged along Winchester Road before the tornado dissipated.
