40|$|The 'Endangered' Sakalava Rail Amaurornis olivieri is {{endemic to}} {{wetlands}} in western Madagascar, {{where it has}} been recorded between the Betsiboka river in the north and the Mangoky river in the south. Between August 2003 and November 2006, including dry and wet seasons, we surveyed 36 potentially suitable wetlands throughout its known range. We found Sakalava Rails at five sites: Lacs Kinkony, Ampandra, Amparihy, Sahapy and Mandrozo. At each site the population was small (12 - 39 individuals) and the highest density Was 20 individuals km(- 2). We found up to 67 birds in each field visit and the total number of birds (sum of maxima at each site) seen was 100. We estimate the total population at the five sites to be 215 rails. We cannot confirm that the population lies within the range estimated in the current Red List (250 - 999 individuals), although this may yet be proven correct. The typical breeding habitat of Sakalava Rail is lotic marshes with a mixture of large areas of open water, reed Phragmites mauritianus and <b>floating</b> <b>Salvinia</b> hastata. The major threats to Sakalava Rail appear to be habitat loss caused by wetland conversion to rice fields and by fires, disturbance by fishermen and people from local villages, and hunting. Other processes that may alter the ecological character of wetlands and so affect their suitability for Sakalava Rails, Such as hydrological change or the effects of exotic fish or vegetation, remain to be investigate...|$|E

50|$|The Salvinia effect {{describes}} the permanent stabilization {{of an air}} layer upon a hierarchically structured surface submerged in water. Based on biological models (e.g. the <b>floating</b> ferns <b>Salvinia,</b> backswimmer Notonecta), biomimetic Salvinia-surfaces are used as drag reducing coatings (up to 30% reduction were previously measured on the first prototypes. When applied to a ship hull, the coating would allow the boat to float on an air-layer; reducing energy consumption and emissions. Such surfaces require an extremely water repellent super-hydrophobic surface and an elastic hairy structure in the millimeter range to entrap air while submerged. The Salvinia effect was discovered by the biologist and botanist Wilhelm Barthlott (University of Bonn) and his colleagues and has been investigated on several plants and animals since 2002. Publications and patents were published between 2006 and 2016. The best biological models are the <b>floating</b> ferns (<b>Salvinia)</b> with highly sophisticated hierarchically structured hairy surfaces, and the back swimmers (e.g.Notonecta) with a complex double structure of hairs (setae) and microvilli (microtrichia). Three of the ten known Salvinia species show a paradoxical chemical heterogenity: hydrophilic hair tips, {{in addition to the}} super-hydrophobic plant surface, further stabilizing the air layer.|$|R
50|$|Various {{species of}} {{floating}} fern {{are able to}} sustain a liquid-solid barrier of air between the fern and the surrounding water when they are submerged. Like the lotus leaf, floating fern species have tiny hierarchical structures that prevent water from wetting the plant surface. Mayser and Barthlott demonstrated this ability by submerging different species of the <b>floating</b> fern <b>salvinia</b> in water inside a pressure vessel to study how the air barrier between the leaf and surrounding water react to changes in pressure that {{would be similar to}} those experienced by the hull of a ship. Much other research is ongoing using these hierarchical structures in coatings on ship hulls to reduce viscous drag effects.|$|R

50|$|Encroachment of the wetland area, poaching, illegal timber felling {{are serious}} {{problems}} {{within the national}} park. The park has been invaded by alien species Lantana camara. The Nilgala jungle corridor has been proposed to link Maduru Oya National Park with Gal Oya National Park which would provide a more contiguous wildlife habitat. Unplanned colonisation {{of land in the}} park by persons expecting to obtain land deeds to land under the Mahaweli development project is showing an increase.

40|$|Populations of the <b>floating</b> macrophyte, <b>Salvinia</b> minima Baker, were {{assessed}} over a 39 -month period at four sites in southern Florida {{in order to}} elucidate the abiotic and biotic factors that influenced their density. These factors included the abundance of other plant species, changes in water depth, water quality, and herbivory by insects. Abiotic factors like temperature, pH, DO, and conductivity varied among sites and, more importantly, over time. The same was true for S. minima biomass, coverage, and condition. Principal component analysis identified four components which together explained 64 % of the variability in S. minima biomass. The first component correlated strongly with herbivory from Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands and Synclita obliteralis (Walker) {{as well as the}} abundance of the duckweed Spirodela polyrrhiza (L.) Schleid. Temperature effects were strongly represented in the second principal component. A stepwise regression model that best predicted S. minima biomass incorporated conductivity, insect herbivory, and interspecific plant abundance. Broader dry vs. wet season influences were apparent and linked to temperature, water depth, and conductivity that covaried with S. minima biomass. Sites where water depth changed the most had the least S. minima. Insect herbivory did not increase under more stagnant conditions when plant populations were less mobile. Overall, S. minima populations cycled in southern Florida in response to a shifting array of abiotic and biotic factors. The relative importance of these factors was less clear although the influences of herbivory, temperature, and the presence of other plants were significant...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} novel, {{practical}} technique for the concerted, simultaneous determination {{of both the}} adhesion force of a small structure or structural unit (e. g., an individual filament, hair, micromechanical component or microsensor) to a liquid and its elastic properties. The method involves the creation and development of a liquid meniscus upon touching a liquid surface with the structure, and the subsequent disruption of this liquid meniscus upon removal. The evaluation of the meniscus shape immediately before snap-off of the meniscus allows the quantitative determination of the liquid adhesion force. Concurrently, by measuring and evaluating the deformation of the structure under investigation, its elastic properties can be determined. The sensitivity of the method is remarkably high, practically limited by {{the resolution of the}} camera capturing the process. Adhesion forces down to 10 µN and spring constants up to 2 N/m were measured. Three exemplary applications of this method are demonstrated: (1) determination of the water adhesion force and the elasticity of individual hairs (trichomes) of the <b>floating</b> fern <b>Salvinia</b> molesta. (2) The investigation of human head hairs both with and without functional surface coatings (a topic of high relevance in the field of hair cosmetics) was performed. The method also resulted in the measurement of an elastic modulus (Young’s modulus) for individual hairs of 3. 0 × 10 5 N/cm 2, which is within the typical range known for human hair. (3) Finally, the accuracy and validity of the capillary adhesion technique was proven by examining calibrated atomic force microscopy cantilevers, reproducing the spring constants calibrated using other methods...|$|R
40|$|Underwater air {{retention}} of superhydrophobic hierarchically structured surfaces is of increasing interest for technical applications. Persistent air layers (the Salvinia effect) are known from biological species, for example, the <b>floating</b> fern <b>Salvinia</b> or the backswimmer Notonecta. The {{use of this}} concept opens up new possibilities for biomimetic technical applications {{in the fields of}} drag reduction, antifouling, anticorrosion and under water sensing. Current knowledge regarding the shape of the air–water interface is insufficient, although it plays a crucial role with regards to stability in terms of diffusion and dynamic conditions. Optical methods for imaging the interface have been limited to the micrometer regime. In this work, we utilized a nondynamic and nondestructive atomic force microscopy (AFM) method to image the interface of submerged superhydrophobic structures with nanometer resolution. Up to now, only the interfaces of nanobubbles (acting almost like solids) have been characterized by AFM at these dimensions. In this study, we show {{for the first time that}} it is possible to image the air–water interface of submerged hierarchically structured (micro-pillars) surfaces by AFM in contact mode. By scanning with zero resulting force applied, we were able to determine the shape of the interface and thereby the depth of the water penetrating into the underlying structures. This approach is complemented by a second method: the interface was scanned with different applied force loads and the height for zero force was determined by linear regression. These methods open new possibilities for the investigation of air-retaining surfaces, specifically in terms of measuring contact area and in comparing different coatings, and thus will lead to the development of new applications...|$|R

METHODS: The plants were collected in Jacu lagoon, located in the North of Rio de Janeiro State, and after a five-day-acclimation period, experiments were performed in the greenhouse with 0, 100, 200 mM concentrations of NaCI and Na 2 SO 4 salts and the usual techniques for light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: After seven days of experiment, a decrease in the content of Ca 2 +, K+, Mg 2 +, P, N ions as well as in the content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll-a,b and carotenoids) in Salvinia auriculata under saline treatments was observed. The proline content showed an upward tendency as compared to the control. Under transmission electron microscopy, it was observed that, on the foliar limb, there was a membrane system disorder, mainly of chloroplasts, with higher presence of starch grains of plant cells subjected to salinity. Under scanning electron microscope, the integrity of trichomes and foliar limb cells of Salvinia auriculata subjected to the control treatment as well as the changes caused by salinization on the surface of cells were observed.

30|$|The {{ecology of}} the {{wetlands}} is often damaged by proliferation of aquatic weeds in their water zones. Weeds interfere with the primary production of wetlands and impact severely on the biodiversity by out-competing native plants and degrading the habitat (DEC 2012). The <b>floating</b> water moss <b>Salvinia</b> natans is an invasive dominant colonizing aquatic fern species, which prevails over the aquatic ecosystem by its rapid growth and displacement of native plants that provide food and habitat for the native animals and waterfowl (Galka and Szmeja 2012). The growth and spread of Salvinia natans may be enormous {{to the extent of}} 45  % per day in nutrient-rich water bodies (Blackman 1960). The high viability of spores associated with rapid vegetative propagation is responsible for the spread of the weed producing vast thick mats and, with the impending global warming, the weed will create havoc to water bodies at the expense of submerged exotic plants {{in many parts of the}} world (Netten et al. 2010). The dense mats have a negative effect on the functioning and biodiversity of the freshwater ecosystems due to hampered photosynthesis, reduced gas exchange at the air–water interface and increased consumption of oxygen by microbial decomposition. The decayed dead weeds increase the nutrient level in the water, leading to the problem of eutrophication (Gupta et al. 2007). S. natans also covers vast free water zones of the Loktak Lake (24 ° 25 ′– 24 ° 42 ′N; 93 ° 46 ′– 93 ° 55 ′E) of Manipur, northeast India. The lake is the largest freshwater lake of the region and plays an important role in providing regional ecological and economic security by supporting valuable biodiversity or heterogeneity (Trisal and Manihar 2004).|$|R

OBJETIVO: A aqüicultura gera benefícios sociais e econômicos, mas também causa impactos ao ambiente. Um dos principais impactos é o lançamento de efluentes sem tratamento em ambientes como rios, reservatórios e lagos, o que pode afetar populações e comunidades aquáticas. Neste trabalho foi testada a hipótese de que o efluente de aqüicultura favorece o crescimento da macrófita aquática flutuante Salvinia molesta; MÉTODOS: O estudo foi realizado em uma represa não impactada (RNI) e outra represa impactada (RI) por lançamentos de efluentes de aqüicultura e teve duração de nove meses. Em cada uma das represas foram fixadas quatro unidades experimentais contendo 10 rametes de S. molesta. Mensalmente, foram determinadas variáveis limnológicas da água e a biomassa de S. molesta nas duas represas; RESULTADOS: Os valores de temperatura, turbidez, condutividade elétrica, alcalinidade, clorofila-a, nitrogênio Kjeldahl total e fósforo total foram superiores na RI em todos os meses do estudo. As concentrações de nitrogênio e fósforo total na biomassa de S. molesta da RI foram maiores do que as da RNI, ao final do experimento.
