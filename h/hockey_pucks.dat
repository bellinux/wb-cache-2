25|$|Roller <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> {{are similar}} to ice-hockey pucks, but made from plastic and thus lighter. They have small ribs {{protruding}} from their tops and bottoms which limit contact with the surface, allowing better sliding motion and less friction.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} Firepuck in {{the early}} 1990s was the first attempt to improve the {{visibility}} of <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> as seen on television. This invention incorporated coloured retro reflective materials of either embedded lens elements or prismatic reflectors laminated into recesses on the flat surfaces and the vertical edge of a standard hockey puck. Yellow was the preferred reflected colour. A spotlight was required to be positioned on the TV camera and focused at {{the centre of the}} viewing area.|$|E
25|$|Goaltenders use {{different}} equipment. With <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> approaching them at speeds {{of up to}} 100mph (160km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.|$|E

2500|$|Ice <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> of {{regulation}} [...] diameter and [...] thickness {{may be used}} as mechanical vibration dampening isolators in places such as feet for light industrial air compressors, and air conditioning units because they are {{of regulation}} materials and therefore consistent manufacture, size and shape, and are constructed of a repeatable and consistent vulcanized rubber material. [...] Since the material is rubber, it may be drilled out or milled easily to a fixed depth as rubber feet or used as rubber spacer or gasket material. [...] A very common use of a slotted hockey puck is as an adaptor between the metal foot of a trolley jack and the sill (rocker panel) of an automobile. [...] The sill has a spot-welded lip which fits into the slot of the puck and would otherwise be bent or marked by the metal foot. [...] <b>Hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> have been used to level furniture, beverage refrigeration systems, and as paper weights or door stops. [...] The hockey puck has many uses other than its original, intended purpose by virtue of its consistent physical properties.|$|E
2500|$|Ice {{hockey is}} a full contact sport and carries {{a high risk of}} injury. Players are moving at speeds around {{approximately}} [...] and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulders, hips, and <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks</b> all contribute. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players can have contact but are not allowed to body check.|$|E

The 50-joule threshold, however, can be considerably lowered when the victim's heart is under ischemic conditions, such as in coronary artery insufficiency.|$|E

2500|$|Vulcanization {{refers to}} a {{specific}} curing process of rubber involving high heat {{and the addition of}} sulfur or other equivalent curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon-to-carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber including ice <b>hockey</b> <b>pucks,</b> tires, shoe soles, hoses and many more. When [...] "rubber fever" [...] struck Boston in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by 1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze stiff. In 1839, Charles Goodyear had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top. The leather-like form of the stretchable substance resulted in the first vulcanized rubber. Goodyear received a patent on June 15, 1844.|$|E
