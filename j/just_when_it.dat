5|$|The quarter-final draw also {{determined}} the teams' routes to the final, with Barcelona facing {{the prospect of}} meeting either Chelsea or Liverpool in the semi-finals. After a 3–1 win at Anfield, Chelsea qualified for the semi-finals with a 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge. The semi-final first leg was played at the Camp Nou; although Barcelona enjoyed {{the majority of the}} possession, Chelsea's defence was resolute and they became the first side to keep a clean sheet in Barcelona in this season's competition, coming away with a goalless draw. Barcelona needed to avoid defeat to reach the final, but they found themselves a goal down within 10 minutes; after they failed to clear Frank Lampard's pass into the penalty area, Michael Essien fired a left-footed volley past Víctor Valdés into the roof of the net. The rest of the match continued much the same as the first leg, with Barcelona retaining most of the possession. Despite this, they found themselves guilty of several fouls, while Chelsea made four unsuccessful penalty appeals during the match. Meanwhile, Dani Alves received his third yellow card of the knockout phase, ruling him out of Barcelona's next match, and Éric Abidal was given a straight red card for a foul on Nicolas Anelka as the French forward was through on goal. However, television replays after the incident showed that there was little contact between Abidal and Anelka. Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø allowed a minimum of fourminutes of injury time {{at the end of the}} second half; in the third of those fourminutes – <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> looked like Chelsea were about to secure a repeat of the 2008 final – Messi played the ball across the edge of the penalty area to Andrés Iniesta, who shot just past Petr Čech's outstretched hand for the away goal that would send Barcelona to the final.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{returned}} for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 {{in the first four}} games. In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs. Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs. During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs, and achieved his personal best against Australia, as well as the third highest score in a defeat.|$|E
25|$|The Premier League's {{top three}} kicked off {{simultaneously}} on 1 March. United were first off the mark, as Owen Hargreaves scored his first competitive goal in a Manchester United shirt {{to put the}} Reds 1–0 up against Fulham. Chelsea then went 3–0 up against West Ham {{in the space of}} five minutes, before Arsenal went 1–0 down to Aston Villa via a Philippe Senderos own goal. United were next to score, Park Ji-sung doubling their lead. Chelsea got a fourth goal in the 64th minute of their match, before a Simon Davies own goal stretched United's lead to three goals. However, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> looked like United would be returning {{to the top of the}} table for the first time in a month, Arsenal snatched a late equaliser to remain a point clear at the top. With 10 games left in the season, United's goal difference seven goals better than Arsenal's, and Chelsea still only six points off the top two, this set up what was billed as one of the closest title races in recent years.|$|E
25|$|The {{team went}} into the next game against Sporting knowing that a win would secure top spot for them. However, they went 1–0 down after just 21 minutes through an {{unexpected}} goal from Abel Ferreira. It took United another 40 minutes to get an equaliser, as Carlos Tevez scored a scrappy goal in the 61st minute. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> looked like United were about {{to settle for a}} draw, they won a free kick in the 92nd minute. Up stepped Cristiano Ronaldo, who lashed the free kick into the far top corner of the net to win the match 2–1. That left the final game in the group without consequence, and so Sir Alex took a youthful squad with him to Rome, including six players yet to make their senior debuts for the club. Although none of the six made the starting line-up, it was another of United's youth players, Piqué, who scored the opening goal in the 34th minute. However, the Reds were denied maximum points from the group stage by a 71st-minute goal from Mancini. Nevertheless, the 16 points they did pick up in the six games was the most of any team in the group stage.|$|E

25|$|This time though, the openers began solidly {{putting on}} 50 {{for the first}} time in the series. When Ramesh was dismissed, Ganguly sent in VVS Laxman. Rahul Dravid had been {{struggling}} for runs for a while and Laxman had been stroking the ball well before his unfortunate dismissal. Interestingly, Laxman had been asked to open the innings in this match but had refused. He seemed to pick up from where he had left off, batting serenely, and at times aggressively – a reminder that there were no demons in the pitch. Das departed, unfortunate to hit the stumps with his heels while having executed an immaculate pull shot to end a promising partnership with Laxman. Tendulkar soon followed, for a second failure in the match but Laxman found a willing ally in Sourav Ganguly. The pair set about repairing the damage done raising a hundred for the 4th wicket, but <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> seemed India would end the day with some semblance of balance, McGrath induced an edge that was lapped up gleefully by Gilchrist to dismiss Ganguly 2 runs short of a deserved half century. Out came Rahul Dravid, with scorecard reading 232/4. Laxman duly completed a hundred in Dravid's company.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> {{looked as}} if the new gun was about to become a great success, a great deal of {{opposition}} to the gun arose, both inside the army and from rival arms manufacturers, particularly Joseph Whitworth of Manchester. Stories were publicised that the new gun was too difficult to use, that it was too expensive, that it was dangerous to use, that it frequently needed repair and so on. All of this smacked of a concerted campaign against Armstrong. Armstrong was able to refute all of these claims in front of various government committees, but he found the constant criticism very wearying and depressing. In 1862 the government decided to stop ordering the new gun and return to muzzle loaders. Also, because of a drop in demand, future orders for guns would be supplied from Woolwich, leaving Elswick without new business. Compensation was eventually agreed with the government for the loss of business to the company. The government would not release the company from its agreement not to sell armaments abroad, so that avenue was closed to it. Eventually, the restriction was relaxed, and the company was able to sell guns to both sides in the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The two Indians {{continued}} to torment the Australians, with some risk-free but effective strokeplay, which fetched them boundaries. The {{only time in}} which the partnership saw an unorthodox shot was when Dravid dispatched a Stuart MacGill ball straight back over the bowler's head for a four by lashing at it hard and straight in the 106th over, when India were at 340/4. 4.4 overs later, Dravid's wristy flick off his hips brought him his 150, his seventh score of 150+ in tests at that time. Then, <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> seemed that Australia had to resign themselves to a long day, at 376/4 from 112.4 overs Laxman flashed a short and slightly wide delivery from Andy Bichel towards slips, where Ricky Ponting could not {{get his hands on}} the ball, and it went away through third man for a four. Later, when the score stood at 384/4, and the partnership was already 299, Laxman produced a classical drive with good timing, and good placement through extra cover to bring up the 300 for the partnership off 563 balls. As a respite for the Australians, on the last ball before tea, Laxman again decide to cut a good, rising delivery from Bichel, but managed to get an edge to Gilchrist, who had to stretch a little to take an impressive catch.|$|E

500|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} Armageddon on the SmackDown brand was a match {{involving}} three competitors, {{known as a}} Triple Threat match in WWE, for the WWE Championship between Edge, Triple H, and Jeff Hardy. At Survivor Series, Jeff Hardy was out of action after being found unconscious in the stairwell of his Boston hotel earlier in the morning. This resulted to Hardy being removed from the WWE title match, leaving Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov battling each other one-on-one. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> looked like Triple H had Kozlov beat after nailing him with a hard-hitting Pedigree, SmackDown's primary authority figure Vickie Guerrero interrupted the match to announce that it would indeed be Triple Threat match– with Edge as the last minute third competitor. Edge {{made his way to}} the ring and nailed Triple H with a vicious Spear. Next, Hardy surprisingly ran into the ring and attacked Edge. Hardy then grabbed a steel chair, returned to the ring and knocked both Triple H and Kozlov with each chair shot to the head. As Hardy was about to nail Edge with the chair, Edge countered by spearing Hardy then capitalized, by covering Triple H for the win and won his 6th World Championship. SmackDown general manager, Vickie Guerrero announced on the November 28, 2008 episode of SmackDown that Triple H, Hardy, and Vladimir Kozlov would compete in a [...] "Beat the Clock" [...] challenge to gain the opportunity to face Edge at Armageddon for the title. In a Beat the Clock challenge, wrestlers compete in separate individual matches and whoever wins their match in the fastest time wins the competition. The first contest saw Hardy defeat The Brian Kendrick in 12:13. Kozlov fought in the second encounter against Matt Hardy, but failed to defeat him in under 12:13, thus being eliminated from the challenge. The last match-up pitted Triple H against Shelton Benjamin, which ended with Triple H gaining the fall at exactly 12:13. As a result of the tie, neither man was announced as the contender for the championship. One week later on the December 5, 2008 episode of SmackDown, it was announced that the WWE board of directors had decided Edge would have to defend the title against both Triple H and Hardy at Armageddon.|$|E
