Ashleigh Corbeil wrote in her book about achieving a simultaneous orgasm for two partners that due to its length the Magic Wand could be used during doggy style intercourse; and Hilda Hutcherson similarly advised use of the massager in this sexual position.|$|E

[...] Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave gave the episode a 9/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I think 'Pool Party' <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> episode so far this season.

[...] Michael Tedder from New York Magazine called the episode the season's second best, after [...] "Trivia." [...] In addition, many critics wrote positively of the characters and their actions.

[...] According to Bowers, [...] "as far as I know, the financial benefits which provided the reason for issuing the half dollars, 'to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion,' to erect 'suitable monuments, memorial and otherwise,' etc., never came to pass, at least not from money provided by the sale of the coins." [...] These, however, did not have the benefit of examining OTMA records. [...] Following the opening of Driggs's papers for research at Southern Utah University, an October 2013 article in The Numismatist concluded that though many documents, such as the arrangements with Scott's, are missing from his records, what there is [...] "seems consistent with Driggs wanting to use the coins to finance the marking of the Oregon Trail, not to line his own pockets".|$|E
