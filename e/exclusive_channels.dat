40|$|We {{report on}} the {{investigation}} of dielectron production in tagged quasi-free neutron-proton collisions by using a deuteron beam of kinetic energy 1. 25 GeV/u inpinging on a liquid hydrogen target. Our measurements with HADES confirm a significant excess of e^+e^- pairs above the π^ 0 mass in the <b>exclusive</b> <b>channel</b> dp → npe^+e^-(p_spect) {{as compared to the}} <b>exclusive</b> <b>channel</b> ppe^+e^- measured in proton-proton collisions at the same energy. That excess points to different bremsstrahlung production mechanisms. Two models were evaluated for the role of the charged pion exchange between nucleons and double-Δ excitation combined with intermediate ρ-meson production. Differential cross sections {{as a function of the}} e^+e^- invariant mass and of the angles of the virtual photon, proton and electrons provide valuable constraints and encourage further investigations on both experimental and theoretical side.

50|$|Sky Direct is a direct-broadcast {{satellite}} {{subscription television}} {{service in the}} Philippines {{owned and operated by}} Sky, a subsidiary of ABS-CBN Corporation. Sky Cable has been eyeing for a DBS service and considered on acquiring Dream Satellite TV from Antonio O. Cojuangco, Jr. The acquisition of Dream was reported to have reached an advanced stage but for some undisclosed reasons, the deal was not sealed. Sky's entry to the DBS market was hindered by various oppositions from the industry, citing legal issues and the slow growth of the pay TV market in the country. On December 23, 2015, Sky was granted by the NTC a provisional authority to operate and maintain a DBS service in 251 cities and municipalities in the country for a period of 18 months. Sky Direct offers both prepaid and postpaid packages with <b>exclusive</b> <b>channels</b> from ABS-CBN and Creative Programs such as ABS-CBN HD, ABS-CBN News Channel, ABS-CBN Sports+Action HD, Cinema One, Lifestyle, and Myx. As of March of 2017, Sky Direct has gained over 161,000 subscribers.|$|E

Although Aereo and FilmOn both stated that their use of [...] "miniature" [...] antennas for transmission of programs to individual users is legal, following mixed decisions by circuit courts that declared them either legal or in infringement of copyrights, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July 2014 that Aereo's business model had an [...] "overwhelming likeness to cable companies," [...] and its transmission of local station signals constituted an unauthorized public performance in violation of copyright rules, forcing Aereo and FilmOn to stop transmitting local stations from several markets. Aereo eventually suspended operations and filed for bankruptcy in November of that year, later choosing to auction off its assets and technology; FilmOn however remains in operation, offering other free-to-air U.S.-based networks {{in addition to its}} own <b>exclusive</b> <b>channels,</b> but was found in contempt by New York district court in July 2014 for briefly continuing to stream U.S. stations after the Supreme Court ruling.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} <b>exclusive</b> <b>channels</b> in semi-inclusive electroproduction of pions and kaons. Using the QCD factorization theorem for hard exclusive processes we evaluate the cross sections for exclusive pseudoscalar and vector meson production in terms of generalized parton distributions and meson distribution amplitudes. We {{investigate the}} uncertainties arising from the modeling of the nonperturbative input quantities. Combining these results with available experimental data, we compare the cross sections for <b>exclusive</b> <b>channels</b> to that obtained from quark fragmentation in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. We find that rho^ 0 production is the only exclusive channel with significant contributions to semi-inclusive pion production at large z and moderate Q^ 2. The corresponding contribution to kaon production from the decay of exclusively produced phi and K^* is rather small. Comment: 33 pages, 18 figure...|$|E
