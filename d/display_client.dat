While our team attacks the first problem by imple-menting parallel visualization algorithms on supercomputing architectures at vast scale, we are experimenting with autostereoscopic display technology to aid scientists in the second challenge. We are building a visualization framework connecting parallel visualization algorithms running {{on one of the}} world’s most powerful supercomput-ers with high-quality autostereo display systems. This paper is a case study of the development of an end-to-end solution that couples scalable volume rendering on thousands of supercomputer cores to the scientists ’ interaction with autostereo volume rendering at their desktops and larger display spaces. We discuss modifications to our volume rendering algorithm to produce perspective stereo images, their transport from supercomputer to display system, and the scientists ’ 3 D interactions. A lightweight <b>display</b> <b>client</b> software architecture supports a variety of monoscopic and autostereoscopic display technologies through a flexible configuration framework.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Collective, {{a system that}} delivers managed desktops to personal computer (PC) users. System administrators {{are responsible for the}} creation and maintenance of the desktop environments, or virtual appliances, which include the operating system and all installed applications. PCs run client software, called the virtual appliance transceiver, that caches and runs the latest copies of appliances locally and continuously backs up changes to user data to a network repository. This model provides the advantages of central management, such as better security and lower cost of management, while leveraging the cost-effectiveness of commodity PCs. With a straightforward design, this model provides a comprehensive suite of important system functions including machine lockdown, system updates, error recovery, backups, and support for mobility. These functions are made available to all desktop environments that run on the x 86 architecture, while remaining protected from the environments and their many vulnerabilities. The model is suitable for managing computers on a LAN, WAN with broadband, or even computers occasionally disconnected from the network like a laptop. Users can access their desktops from any Collective client; they can also carry a bootable drive that converts a PC into a client; finally, they can use a remote <b>display</b> <b>client</b> from a browser to access their desktop running on a remote server. We have developed a prototype of the Collective system and have used it for almost a year. We have found the system helpful in simplifying the management of our desktops while imposing little performance overhead. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{display of}} complex 3 D scenes in {{real-time}} on mobile devices is difficult {{due to the}} insufficient data throughput and a relatively weak graphics performance. Hence, we propose a client-server system, where the processing of the complex scene is performed on a server and the resulting data is streamed to the mobile device. In order to cope with low transmission bitrates, the server sends new data only with a framerate of about 2 Hz. However, instead of sending plain framebuffers, the server decomposes the geometry represented by the current view’s depth profile into a small set of textured polygons. This processing {{does not require the}} knowledge of geometries in the scene, i. e. the outputs of Time-of-flight camera can be handled as well. The 2. 5 D representation of the current frame allows the mobile device to render plausibly distorted views of the scene at high frame rates as long as the viewing direction does not change too much before the next frame arrives from the server. In order to further augment the visual experience, we use the mobile device’s built-in camera or gyroscope to detect the spatial relation between the user’s face and the device, so that the camera view can be changed accordingly. This produces a pseudo-immersive visual effect. Besides designing the overall system with a render-server, 3 D <b>display</b> <b>client,</b> and real-time face/pose detection, our main technical contribution is a highly efficient algorithm that decomposes a frame buffer with per-pixel depth and normal information into a small set of planar regions which can be textured with the current frame. This representation is simple enough for realtime display on today’s mobile devices. Keywords-mobile; rendering; 2. 5 D textured polygon; trans-mission; client-system; interaction I...|$|E
