25|$|To provide heat more efficiently, an {{electrically}} driven {{heat pump}} {{can raise the}} indoor temperature by extracting energy from the ground, the outside air, or waste streams such as <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> This can cut the electricity consumption to as little as 35% of that used by resistive heating.|$|E
25|$|The exhaust {{manifold}} (exhaust tee, exhaust cover, whiskers) is the ducting {{that protects the}} exhaust valve(s) and diverts the exhaled air to the sides {{so that it does}} not bubble up in the diver's face and obscure the view. This is not necessary for twin hose regulators as they <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> behind the shoulders.|$|E
25|$|In cold climates heating air {{and water}} is a major demand on {{household}} energy use. By investing in newer technologies in the home, significant energy reductions are possible. Heat pumps are a more efficient alternative to using electrical resistance heaters for warming air or water. A variety of efficient clothes dryers are available, and the classic clothes line requires no energy, only time. Natural gas condensing boilers and hot air furnaces increase efficiency over standard hot flue models. New construction implementing heat exchangers can capture heat from waste water or <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> in bathrooms, laundry and kitchens.|$|E
40|$|The heating of {{swimming}} pools {{can be expensive}} in terms of energy costs and energy-saving measures which are much {{more effective than the}} simple recovery of the <b>exhausted</b> <b>air</b> are recommended. A new open-cycle absorption system is presented here, operating by chemical dehumidification on the <b>exhausted</b> <b>air.</b> It allows important energy savings of the same order as the motor-driven heat pump systems, although its technology is in principle simpler and cheaper...|$|R
50|$|Energy {{recovery}} systems sometimes utilize {{heat recovery}} ventilation or energy recovery ventilation systems that employ heat exchangers or enthalpy wheels to recover sensible or latent heat from <b>exhausted</b> <b>air.</b> This {{is done by}} transfer of energy to the incoming outside fresh air.|$|R
30|$|Higher feed {{solid content}} caused a {{decrease}} in the solid mass carried away by the <b>exhausted</b> <b>air</b> due to its effect on the particle size. Also Goula and Adamopoulos (2004) perceived that higher feed solid contents lead to higher feed viscosity, increase in droplet diameter and, therefore, increase in the particles size.|$|R
25|$|A Waterloo and Whitehall Railway was {{promoted}} in 1864, {{to construct a}} tube railway from Great Scotland Yard to Waterloo. It was to use air pressure to propel the vehicles northwards, and was to <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> to draw them southwards, using a pressure differential of 2½ oz per sq in (about 11 mbar). The trains themselves would be the pistons. The company capital was to be £100,000. It was suggested {{that there could be}} a branch to where the Embankment station is now located: it is not clear how a junction would be managed in a pneumatic railway. There were to be three vehicles, one loading at each terminal and one in motion in the tube, so they must have been intended to pass at the terminals. There were to be three classes of accommodation in the coaches.|$|E
25|$|Burying engines {{deep inside}} the {{fuselage}} also minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared footprint.|$|E
500|$|The Lavochkin OKB {{was ordered}} to design a fighter using a single Junkers Jumo 004B axial-flow {{turbojet}} in February 1945. Much like their rivals at the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB with their MiG-9, the OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout for their new fighter, based on advice from the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI), although their design had a shoulder-mounted wing. The wings of the all-metal aircraft had fixed leading edges and slotted flaps. The cockpit was well forward, giving the pilot good visibility, and he was protected by an armored headrest. The windscreen of the teardrop-shaped canopy was also armored. Two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon were mounted on the lower side of the fuselage with 75 rounds per gun. The tricycle landing gear retracted into the fuselage which gave the 150 a very narrow track. The Soviet derivative of the Jumo engine, the RD-10, was rated at [...] and was mounted behind the cockpit. A steel heat shield protected {{the bottom of the}} rear fuselage from the engine's <b>exhaust.</b> <b>Air</b> was supplied by an intake in the aircraft nose that split around the cockpit before reaching the engine. Seven tanks, five in the fuselage and one in each wing, carried a total of [...] of fuel.|$|E
50|$|In 1839 Samuel Clegg and Jacob Samuda, {{approached}} {{the company for}} permission to use its uncompleted line for trials of their atmospheric system, with stationary engines <b>exhausting</b> <b>air</b> from a pipe laid between the rails; a carriage on the train carried a piston inside the pipe and the air pressure provided tractive force.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to natural ventilation, filtered outside air (MERV-13) {{is added to}} all the mechanical systems prior to conditioning and interior-CO2 levels are constantly monitored to control the fresh air exchange rate. A heat recovery unit exchanges the conditioned <b>exhausted</b> <b>air</b> temperature with the incoming fresh air, and prevents any cooling energy from being lost.|$|R

2500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of a BSC is {{to serve as a}} means to protect the {{laboratory}} worker and the surrounding environment from pathogens. All <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> is HEPA-filtered as it exits the biosafety cabinet, removing harmful bacteria and viruses. This is in contrast to a laminar flow clean bench, which blows unfiltered <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> towards the user and is not safe for work with pathogenic agents. Neither are most BSCs safe for use as fume hoods. Likewise, a fume hood fails to provide the environmental protection that HEPA filtration in a BSC would provide. However, most classes of BSCs have a secondary purpose to maintain the sterility of materials inside (the [...] "product").|$|E

40|$|Ascending {{control of}} stratospheric airship is a {{challenging}} control problem, especially if both the rising velocity {{and the pressure}} difference between the {{inside and outside of}} the airship are required to be controlled simultaneously during ascending. In this paper, a coordinated scheme to control pressure difference and rising velocity of stratospheric airship with vector thrust is presented. With the control scheme, the airship maintains the pressure difference by <b>exhausting</b> <b>air</b> with feedback control. At the same time, the supplemental thrust is generated to compensate the buoyancy fluctuation caused by <b>exhausting</b> <b>air</b> so that the airship’s vertical velocity can track a given reference trajectory. Simulations show that the coordinated control scheme ensures that the airship rises to the altitude of 20 [*]km steadily and rapidly while the pressure difference is always in the safe range. Furthermore, the control scheme is robust enough to the thermal disturbance caused by solar radiation and other thermal processes, which is calculated with partial differential equations...|$|R
2500|$|Windage or Drift — Water {{droplets}} {{that are}} carried out of the cooling tower with the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> Drift droplets have the same concentration of impurities as the water entering the tower. The drift rate is typically reduced by employing baffle-like devices, called drift eliminators, through which the air must travel after leaving the fill and spray zones of the tower. [...] Drift can also be reduced by using warmer entering cooling tower temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|Plume — The {{stream of}} {{saturated}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> leaving the cooling tower. The plume is visible when water vapor it contains condenses {{in contact with}} cooler ambient air, like the saturated air in one's breath fogs on a cold day. Under certain conditions, a cooling tower plume may present fogging or icing hazards to its surroundings. Note that the water evaporated in the cooling process is [...] "pure" [...] water, {{in contrast to the}} very small percentage of drift droplets or water blown out of the air inlets.|$|E
2500|$|The C-17 {{is powered}} by four Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 {{turbofan}} engines, {{which are based on}} the commercial Pratt and Whitney PW2040 used on the Boeing 757. Each engine is rated at [...] of thrust. The engine's thrust reversers direct engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> upwards and forward, reducing the chances of foreign object damage by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents. In vortex surfing tests performed by C-17s, up to 10% fuel savings were reported.|$|E
60|$|One lesson may {{be learned}} from Prideaux's cynical letters, which is still worth the {{attention}} of every young Oxford student who is conscious of ambition, of power, and of real interest in letters.

5000|$|LCDR Fane {{also brought}} the {{conventional}} [...] "Aqua-lung" [...] open-circuit SCUBA system into {{use by the}} UDTs. Open-circuit SCUBA is less useful to combat divers, as the <b>exhausted</b> <b>air</b> produces a tell-tale trail of bubbles. However, in the early 1950s, the UDTs decided they preferred open-circuit SCUBA, and converted entirely to it. (The remaining stock of LARUs was supposedly destroyed in a beach-party bonfire.) Later on, the UDT reverted to closed-circuit SCUBA, using improved rebreathers developed by Lambertsen.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{possible}} F414 improvements include {{efforts to}} reduce engine noise by using either mechanical or fluidic chevrons and {{efforts to reduce}} emissions with a new trapped vortex combustor. Chevrons would reduce engine noise by inducing mixing between the cooler, slower bypass air and the hotter, faster core <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> Mechanical chevrons would {{come in the form}} of triangular cutouts (or extensions) at the end of the nozzle, resulting in a [...] "sharktooth" [...] pattern. Fluidic chevrons would operate by injecting differential air flows around the exhaust to achieve the same ends as the mechanical variety. A new combustor would likely aim to reduce emissions by burning a higher percentage of the oxygen, thereby reducing the amount of oxygen available to bond with nitrogen forming the pollutant NOx.|$|E
2500|$|Thermal {{power plants}} {{are one of}} the main {{artificial}} sources of producing toxic gases and particulate matter. Fossil fuel power plants cause the emission of pollutants such as NOx, SOx, CO2, CO, PM, organic gases and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.World organizations and international agencies, like the IEA, are concerned about the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels, and coal in particular. The combustion of coal contributes the most to acid rain and air pollution, and has been connected with global warming. Due to the chemical composition of coal there are difficulties in removing impurities from the solid fuel prior to its combustion. Modern day coal power plants pollute less than older designs due to new [...] "scrubber" [...] technologies that filter the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> in smoke stacks; however emission levels of various pollutants are still on average several times greater than natural gas power plants. [...] In these modern designs, pollution from coal-fired power plants comes from the emission of gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide into the air.|$|E
2500|$|Type B1 and B2 {{cabinets}} have {{a minimum}} inflow velocity of 100ft/min, and these cabinets must be hard-ducted to an exhaust system rather than exhausted through a thimble connection. Their exhaust systems must also be dedicated (one BSC per duct run, per blower). In contrast to the type A1 and A2 cabinets, Type B BSCs use single pass airflow (air that does not mix and recirculate) in order to also control hazardous chemical vapors. Type B1 cabinets split the airflow so that the air behind the smoke-split is directed to the exhaust system, while air between the operator and the smoke-split mixes with inflow air and is recirculated as downflow. Since <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> is drawn from the rear grille, the CDC advises that work with hazardous chemistry be conducted {{in the rear of}} the cabinet. This is complicated, since the smoke split (demarking the [...] "rear of the cabinet") is an invisible line that extends the width of the cabinet (approximately 10-14 inches from the front grille) and drifts as the internal HEPA filters load with particulate.|$|E
