5|$|The Original Six era {{ended in}} 1967 when the NHL {{doubled in size}} by adding six new {{expansion}} teams. The six existing teams were formed into the newly created East Division, while the expansion teams were formed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Division. The NHL continued to expand, adding another six teams, to total 18 by 1974. This continued expansion was partially {{brought about by the}} NHL's attempts to compete with the World Hockey Association, which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players. Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. The NHL became involved in international play in the mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union, which was won by Canada with four wins, three losses, and a tie. Eventually, Soviet-Bloc players streamed into the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gil was {{the first}} of several {{tropical}} cyclones to affect Hawaii during the 1983 Pacific hurricane season. Gil originated from a tropical depression that developed near Clipperton Island on July 23. Steadily intensifying, it attained tropical storm status six hours later and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 26. After attaining peak intensity on July 27, Gil encountered cooler sea surface temperatures and began to weaken. Moving west-northwest, the weakening system also accelerated and on July 31, was downgraded to a tropical depression. However, Gil began to re-intensify on August1, becoming a tropical storm again later that day. Initially expected to veer north of Hawaii, it continued west-northwest and began to approach the Hawaiian group on August 3. While passing through the island group, Gil reached its secondary peak intensity. Subsequently, Gil began to weaken once again as it threatened the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. After passing through the islands, Gil was downgraded to a tropical depression on August 5. Several hours later, the storm dissipated. The remnants of the storm moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Pacific late on August 6 and were last noted the next morning while passing south of Midway Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Juliette {{can be traced}} back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on September12. After interacting with a secondary wave over the central Atlantic a few days later, it entered the eastern Caribbean, becoming steadily better defined. Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Caribbean on September22 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter. A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September27 and convection steadily increased; around 0000UTC on September19, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette. Turning northwest as a result of an upper-level trough, the system attained its peak with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mb (hPa; 29.44inHg) at 1200UTC on September30. Strong wind shear began to affect the storm thereafter, causing it to steadily weaken to tropical depression strength by 0000UTC on October2. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low. The low meandered several hundred miles off the coast of Baja California before degenerating into a trough on October5.|$|E
