40|$|INTRODUCTION: This safety lead-in study {{examined}} the pharmacokinetic and adverse event profile of combining <b>enzastaurin</b> with paclitaxel plus carboplatin as first-line therapy {{for the treatment of}} advanced-stage ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal carcinoma. The specific objectives of this study were to assess safety and tolerability after 2 cycles of treatment, to determine if <b>enzastaurin</b> alters paclitaxel and carboplatin pharmacokinetics, and to determine if <b>enzastaurin</b> pharmacokinetics is affected by paclitaxel and carboplatin. METHODS: After debulking surgery, patients with previously untreated epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma received sequential paclitaxel (175 mg/m) and carboplatin (area under the curve, 5 mg x min/mL) on day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients ingested an oral loading dose of 1125 mg <b>enzastaurin</b> on day 4 of cycle 1, followed by oral 500 -mg <b>enzastaurin</b> daily until the end of therapy. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3. 0. RESULTS: There were 5 serious adverse events in 4 of 11 patients: soft tissue injury, wound infection, intestinal fistula, clostridial infection, and anemia. Coadministration with <b>enzastaurin</b> did not significantly alter paclitaxel and carboplatin pharmacokinetics (area under the curve ratio of treatment comparison asymptotically equal to 1. 05 and 1. 06, respectively). <b>Enzastaurin</b> exposures were unchanged (Cav,ss ratio of treatment comparison asymptotically equal to 0. 95 for average steady-state total analyte concentrations of <b>enzastaurin</b> and its metabolite).

40|$|Deborah A Katz, Janet MD Plate, Sunita Nathan, Lydia UshaDivision of Hematology and Oncology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USAAbstract: Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) {{are rare}} extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas {{characterized}} by neoplastic T-lymphocyte accumulation in the skin. The two most common types of CTCLs are mycosis fungoides and the leukemic variant, Sézary syndrome. Prognosis of CTCLs {{depends on the}} stage, with a poor prognosis in advanced-stage disease. A number of agents have recently been developed {{for the treatment of}} CTCLs: chemotherapeutic agents such as pralatrexate, interferon-alpha, retinoids such as bexarotene, monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab, and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as vorinostat and romidepsin. Nevertheless, there is no cure for CTCLs except for allogeneic stem cell transplant. A promising new drug is <b>enzastaurin.</b> <b>Enzastaurin</b> is a novel serine/threonine kinase inhibitor that binds to protein kinase C-β (PKC-β) and inhibits the phosphoinositide- 3 kinase (PI 3 K) /AKT/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) signaling pathway. <b>Enzastaurin</b> induces apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis; it was also shown to suppress growth of CTCL cell lines in vitro. Given its low toxicity, <b>enzastaurin</b> has been tested against both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. This article is focused on the potential role of <b>enzastaurin</b> in the treatment of CTCLs. A phase II multicenter trial evaluated <b>enzastaurin</b> monotherapy in patients with CTCLs. However, the results from this study were disappointing, demonstrating that <b>enzastaurin</b> had only modest clinical activity. Hence, <b>enzastaurin</b> is not currently developed for treating CTCLs. Potential strategies to improve <b>enzastaurin</b> efficacy against CTCLs are discussed: validation of <b>enzastaurin</b> targets such as PKC-β expression in CTCL lesions and or/blood; measurement of serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels; dose optimization; combining <b>enzastaurin</b> with other antiangiogenic agents, or glycogen synthase kinase inhibitors, or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Ultimately, developing more potent inhibitors of PKC-β and PI 3 K/AKT/PTEN/mTOR signaling pathways may be necessary to improve clinical outcomes in CTCLs.

PKC expression was investigated by immunofluorescence and western blot. We found that <b>Enzastaurin</b> significantly reduced human PNN primary culture cell viability, as well as CgA and insulin secretion. Moreover, in the BON 1 cell line <b>Enzastaurin</b> inhibited cell proliferation at 5 and 10  μM by inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis, and reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthetase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) and of Akt, both downstream targets of PKC pathway and pharmacodynamic markers for <b>Enzastaurin.</b> In addition, <b>Enzastaurin</b> blocked the stimulatory effect of IGF 1 on cell proliferation, and reduced CgA expression and secretion in BON 1 cells.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} role of both protein kinase C (PKC) -&# 946; and {{vascular}} endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) - 2 in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) using respective inhibitors, <b>enzastaurin</b> and KRN 633. Materials and Methods: MPM cell lines, control cells, {{and a variety of}} archived MPM tumor samples were used to determine the protein expression levels of PKC-&# 946;, VEGFR- 2, VEGF, and p-AKT. Effects of <b>enzastaurin</b> and KRN 633 on phosphorylation status of key signaling molecules and viability of the mesothelioma cells were determined. The common soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, was treated with <b>enzastaurin</b> to determine its suitability to screen for highly potent kinase inhibitors. Results: PKC-&# 946; 1, PKC-&# 946; 2 and VEGFR- 2 /KDR were overexpressed in MPM cell lines and MPM tumor tissues. <b>Enzastaurin</b> treatment resulted in significant loss in viability of VEGF induced cell proliferation; however, the effect of KRN 633 was much less. <b>Enzastaurin</b> also dramatically decreased the phosphorylation of PKC-&# 946;, its downstream target p-AKT, and surprisingly, the upstream VEGFR- 2. The combination of the two drugs at best was additive and similar results were obtained with respect to cell viability.

Although, {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of Rituximab {{in combination with}} chemotherapy has improved outcome of patients with indolent lymphomas, in particular FL, these diseases are still considered incurable {{and the majority of}} patients still have a fatal course. <b>Enzastaurin,</b> an acyclic bisindolylmaleimide, is a potent and selective competitive inhibitor of protein kinase C beta, which has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis in human cancer cell lines. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to test <b>enzastaurin</b> for its effects on proliferation and survival of B-cell lines established from NHL patients. Methods. The WSU-NHL and Karpas 422 were kindly provided Dr M Introna (Division of Haematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy); the RL was purchased by DSMZ. All three lines are carrying the t(14; 18) and Karpas 422 is EBV+. We decided to conduct all the experiments under the optimal culture conditions with 10 % FCS to avoid subjecting the cells to further stress stimuli. IC 50 values were calculated from curves based on <b>enzastaurin</b> concentration ranging from 1 to 10 µM using MTT assay and cell viability assessment by Trypan Blue exclusion. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometer after staining with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. The effects of <b>enzastaurin</b> on caspases activation as well as on AKT phosphorilation were evaluated by Western blotting. We also investigated the interaction of <b>enzastaurin</b> with chlorambucil and fludarabine. Results using MTT assay were expressed as fraction of cells killed by the individual drug or the combination in the drug-treated versus untreated cells. The interaction between drugs was analyzed by isobologram analysis using the StaCorp 8. 2 software program based upon the Chou-Talalay method to determine if the combinations were additive or synergistic. Results. We found that <b>enzastaurin</b> alone inhibits the proliferation of B-cell lymphomas cell lines at IC 50 values ranging from 5 to 7. 5 µM after 48 h and from 2. 5 to 3. 2 µM after 72 h. Induction of apoptosis by <b>enzastaurin</b> evaluated on WSU-NHL and RL, by flow cytometry analysis of membrane permeability, showed that <b>enzastaurin</b> induces an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells compared with untreated controls in a time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, <b>enzastaurin</b> induces the appearance of the cleaved caspase- 3 fragment in the same cell lines in a time dependent fashion. Activation of the apoptotic pathway was confirmed by cleavage of the PARP enzyme. The apoptosis is partially prevented by the ZVAD–fmk broad caspase inhibitor. Phosphorilation status analysis of AKT up to 72 h of treatment showed a decrease of AKT phosphorilation starting from 48 h after treatment. We tested the effect of <b>enzastaurin</b> combined with chlorambucil and fludarabine,drugs that are active against B-cell lymphoma and we demonstrated that these agents enhanced the cytotoxicity triggered by <b>enzastaurin</b> in a dose-dependent fashion. A clear synergistic interaction (CI= 0. 87) appeared using low concentrations of the drugs and increased (CI= 0. 1) at high concentrations. Conclusions.

To determine whether Enzastaurin-induced cell death is mediated by apoptosis, we studied by ELISA and Western blot caspase 3 and PARP cleavage. We observed induction of caspase 3 and PARP cleavage in a dose and time dependent fashion. Notably, the broad caspase (Z-VAD-FMK) inhibitor reduced Enzastaurin-induced cytotoxicity. We next determined whether <b>Enzastaurin</b> could inhibit AKT phosphorylation in MM cell lines with constitutive phosphorylation of AKT. <b>Enzastaurin</b> decreased AKT phosphorylation in a dose and time dependent fashion. Phosphorylation of GSK 3 ß, a downstream target protein of AKT, was also markedly inhibited. Phosphorylation of PDK- 1, a known upstream activator of AKT, was not affected by <b>Enzastaurin.</b> In conclusion, our results indicate that Enzastaurin-induced cytotoxicity is mediated via activation of caspase. This effect is associated with significant inhibition of AKT activity and its downstream target GSK 3 ß. <b>Enzastaurin</b> does not alter the phosphorylation of the upstream AKT activator PDK- 1. These data suggest that <b>Enzastaurin</b> inhibit AKT signalling pathway and support its evaluation in a murine model of human MM...|$|E
40|$|This phase I {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the recommended dose of <b>enzastaurin,</b> an oral protein kinase C beta (PKC) inhibitor, for phase II trials. Secondary objectives were maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicity, and response. Patients and Methods Patients at least 18 years of age with advanced cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 lower received <b>enzastaurin</b> orally once daily at a starting dose of 20 mg. Dose escalation proceeded using a modified Simon design. Results All 47 patients enrolled (mean age, 58 years) received at least one dose of <b>enzastaurin,</b> with a median of two cycles (range, one to 17 cycles). Prevalent malignancies were lung (n 10) and head and neck cancers (n 9). Although no MTD was identified up to 700 mg/d, 525 mg was chosen as the recommended dose, and 12 additional patients were accrued at that level. Three dose-limiting toxicities (QTc changes) occurred: one at the 700 -mg dose (patient discontinued), and two in the expansion cohort at the 525 -mg dose. Total analytes (<b>enzastaurin</b> and its metabolites) exposure increased with increasing doses up to 240 mg, and appeared to plateau at 525 and 700 mg. Grade 1 chromaturia, fatigue, and other GI toxicities were the most common, while no clinically significant grade 3 / 4 toxicities occurred. Two deaths, unrelated to <b>enzastaurin,</b> occurred. Twenty-one patients (45 %) achieved stable disease (SD) for two to 16 cycles. Conclusion On the basis of plasma exposures and safety data, <b>enzastaurin</b> 525 mg once daily is the recommended phase II dose. <b>Enzastaurin</b> is well tolerated up to 700 mg/d.

It is currently used in phase II trials for the treatment of colon cancer, refractory glioblastoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In this study, the direct effect of <b>enzastaurin</b> on effector function of human natural killer (NK) cells was investigated.

40|$|GNAQ {{mutations}} at codon 209 {{have been}} recently identified in approximately 50 % of uveal melanomas (UM) and {{are reported to}} be oncogenic through activating the MAPK/Erk 1 / 2 pathway. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a component of signaling from GNAQ to Erk 1 / 2. Inhibition of PKC might regulate GNAQ mutation-induced Erk 1 / 2 activation, resulting in growth inhibition of UM cells carrying GNAQ mutations. UM cells carrying wild type or mutant GNAQ were treated with the PKC inhibitor <b>enzastaurin.</b> Effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and signaling events were evaluated. <b>Enzastaurin</b> downregulated the expression of several PKC isoforms including PKCbII PKCh, PKCe and/or their phosphorylation in GNAQ mutated cells. Downregulation of these PKC isoforms in GNAQ mutated cells by shRNA resulted in reduced viability. <b>Enzastaurin</b> exhibited greater antiproliferative effect on GNAQ mutant cells than wild type cells through induction of G 1 arrest and apoptosis. Enzastaurin-induced G 1 arrest was associated with inhibition of Erk 1 / 2 phosphorylation, downregulation of cyclin D 1, and accumulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p 27 Kip 1. Furthermore, <b>enzastaurin</b> reduced the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 and survivin in GNAQ mutant cells.

40|$|Introduction: Non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{is one of}} the most {{commonly}} occurring malignancies worldwide. Platinum based regimens are standard first line treatment against this disease. However, poor response rates, and the limiting toxicity profile of the platinum compounds, makes novel strategies and new combination regimens against NSCLC warranted. The present study investigated the cellular aspects of the interaction between <b>enzastaurin</b> (a selective PKC inhibitor) and pemetrexed (an antifolate) against SW 1573 and A 549 cells. Methods: The cells were treated with the indicated drugs, and their pharmacological interaction was assessed using the Combination Index (Calcusyn ® software). The role of the drugs in the modulation of the cell cycle and their effects on cell death was analyzed by the use of flow cytometry (FACS), whereas the effect on the protein expression and phosphorylation of different targets was investigated by western blot technique. The thymidylate synthase (TS) catalytic activity upon drug treatment was measured by the use of a radioactive TS activity assay. Results: Synergistic interaction with respect to growth inhibition was demonstrated for all the treatment regimens tested. Cell cycle analysis showed that pemetrexed was the dominating drug in the combinations, but still <b>enzastaurin</b> enhanced the amount of cell death with respect to the amount caused by pemetrexed alone. <b>Enzastaurin</b> treatment reduced the phosphorylation of targets in cell signaling pathways; Akt and GSK 3 . The latter also provided evidence that inhibition of GSK 3  phosphorylation can serve as a pharmacodynamic marker for <b>enzastaurin</b> activity in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, <b>enzastaurin</b> was able to abrogate the G 2 /M checkpoint due to inhibition of Cdc 25 C phosphorylation, thus being able to promote pemetrexed-damaged cells to undergo apoptosis. Finally, <b>enzastaurin</b> was able to downregulate TS expression, potentially facilitating pemetrexed activity. Conclusion: These data provide evidence that <b>enzastaurin</b> was able to enhance the effects of pemetrexed in NSCLC cells in vitro and suggests that this combination might be a new approach in the treatment against NSCLC...|$|E
40|$|Melanoma is {{resistant}} to most standard chemotherapeutics. We analysed the combined effect of doxorubicin and <b>enzastaurin</b> on cell death of four melanoma cell lines, namely G 361, SK-MEL 3, A 375 and SAN. <b>Enzastaurin</b> IC 50 {{was calculated by}} measure of growth inhibition with MTS assay and corresponded to 2 μM; the half maximal cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was obtained at 3 μM dose. Evaluation of combination index showed synergism (CI > 1) or additive effect (CI = 1) with all melanoma cell lines, with <b>enzastaurin</b> doses ≥ 0. 6 μM and doxorubicin doses ≥ 1 μM. Combination of the two drugs resulted in increase in caspase 3 and 8 activation, in comparison with activation by single agents. Caspase 8 activation was impaired by TNFR- 1 blocking. Our results show doxorubicin-stimulated production of TNFα, whereas enzastaurin-stimulated TNFR- 1 expression on plasma membrane. The effect on TNFR- 1 appeared to be mediated by PKCζ inhibition.

40|$|Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) is a {{well known}} {{stimulator}} of cell proliferation also in the settings of neuroendocrine tumors. Previous evidence has shown that IGF-I stimulates cell proliferation and resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli both in human pancreatic endocrine tumor (PET) and in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell lines and primary cultures. IGF-I signals through many pathways, including protein kinase C (PKC). We here investigate whether PKC may mediate IGF-I proliferative stimuli in two different in vitro models, represented by PET primary cultures and the BON 1 cell line and by MTC primary cultures and the TT cell line, by using a novel PKC inhibitor, <b>Enzastaurin.</b> We found that <b>Enzastaurin</b> inhibits IGF-I stimulated cell proliferation at 5 and 10 µM (concentrations reached also at plasma level in human clinical trials) by inducing caspase-mediated apoptosis both in PET-derived and in MTC-derived cells. We found that <b>Enzastaurin</b> also reduces IGF-I stimulated phosphorylation of glycogen synthetase kinase 3 beta (GSK 3 -β), a downstream target of PKC pathway and a pharmacodynamic marker for <b>Enzastaurin</b> in BON 1 and TT cells. These data indicate that in endocrine tumor cell lines <b>Enzastaurin</b> blocks IGF-I induced proliferative stimuli inducing apoptosis, with a mechanism likely involving GSK 3 β signaling, indicating that PKC {{plays a crucial role}} in the control of human neuroendocrine tumor proliferation and survival and that PKC inhibitors may represent a new pharmacological target in neuroendocrine tumors...|$|E
40|$|Background. Therapeutic {{inhibition}} {{of a single}} transduction pathway is often inefficient due to activation of alternative signaling. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Protein Kinase Cbeta (PKC 2), Akt and VEGF are involved in proliferation, survival and angiogenic pathways and have been implicated in the resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Therefore, blocking these pathways to interfere at multiple levels with tumor growth {{may result in a}} more efficient therapeutic strategy. Materials and Methods. We used everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, and <b>enzastaurin,</b> an inhibitor of VEGF Receptor-dependent PKC 2, alone or in combination with anti-EGFR drugs gefitinib or cetuximab, on human cancer cell lines sensitive and resistant to EGFR inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo. Results. We demonstrated that everolimus and <b>enzastaurin</b> are active against resistant cancer cell lines and are able to restore the ability of EGFRinhibitors to inhibit growth and survival. Everolimus and <b>enzastaurin</b> reduce the expression of EGFR-related signaling effectors and VEGF production. In addition, everolimus inhibits proliferation and capillary tube formation of endothelial cells and this effect is enhanced in combination with gefitinib. Finally, both everolimus and <b>enzastaurin,</b> when used in combination with gefitinib, demonstrate a cooperative effect on gefitinib resistant colon cancer xenografts, and on activation of signaling proteins and VEGF secretion. Conclusions. Targeting important pathways for tumoral growth and angiogenesis with everolimus and <b>enzastaurin</b> overcomes resistance to EGFR inhibitors and produces a cooperative effect with these agents, providing a Valid therapeutic strategy to be tested in a clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|<b>Enzastaurin</b> {{displays}} pro-apoptotic properties {{against a}} spectrum of malignancies and is currently being investigated in clinical trials. We have investigated the effects of <b>enzastaurin</b> on {{the viability of the}} cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell lines HuT- 78 and HH by using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 (3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium assay, cell cycle analysis, propidium iodide and annexin-V staining, and caspase- 3 -mediated proteolytic activation. Enzastaurin-treatment decreased cell viability, increased annexin V-FITC-positive cells, and increased the proportion of sub-G 1 populations in both cell lines that was not reversed by the T-cell growth stimulating cytokines IL- 2, IL- 7, IL- 15. Enzastaurin-induced cell death involved caspase- 3 -activated cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk, whereas the increase in sub-G 1 population was only partially inhibited by ZVAD-fmk. Furthermore, <b>enzastaurin</b> downregulated AKT activity and its downstream effectors GSK 3 β and ribosomal protein S 6. The phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /AKT pathway has been implicated in the growth and survival of hematologic malignancies and inhibition of this pathway is considered as a therapeutic target.

The effects of bortezomib, <b>enzastaurin</b> or lenalidomide, alone or in combinations, on cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using the Cell Proliferation Kit and flow cytometry analysis. The interaction between drugs was examined by the Chou-Talalay method. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. The PI 3 K/AKT, PKC and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways were analyzed using western blot. Bortezomib with either <b>enzastaurin</b> or lenalidomide synergistically induced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in B-cell lymphoma cells, even {{in the presence of the}} bone marrow microenvironment. The direct cytotoxicity is mediated by signaling events involving the PI 3 K/AKT, PKC and MAPK/ERK pathways leading to cell death. The significant increase of apoptosis was mediated by an increased ratio of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bad and Bim) to anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl- 2, Bcl-xL and Mcl- 1), triggering the cleavage of caspases - 3, - 9, - 8 and PARP.
