6000|$|It {{should appear}} that {{a part of}} his trouble arose from his having coquetted also with a certain Mrs. Ruth, about whom he was [...] "dealt with by Mrs Amee, Mr Phillips & 2 more of the Church, our Elder being one. When Mr Phillips with much {{violence}} & sharpnes charged mee home ... that I should hinder the mayd of a match at London, which was not so, could not thinke of any kindnes I euer did her, though shee haue had above 300li. through my fingers, so as if God uphold me not after an especiall manner, it will sinke me surely ... hee told me he would not stop my intended marriage, but assured mee it would not bee good ... all which makes mee reflect upon my rash proceedings with Mrs Sh." [...] Panurge's doubts and difficulties about matrimony were not more entertainingly contradictory. Of course, Peter ends by marrying the widow, and presently we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> on [...] "her trim." [...] In January, 1639, he writes to Winthrop: [...] "My wife is very thankfull for her apples, & desires much the new fashioned shooes." [...] Eight years later we find him writing from England, where he had been two years: [...] "I am coming over if I must; my wife comes of necessity to New England, having run her selfe out of breath here"; and then in the postscript, [...] "bee sure you never let my wife come away from thence without my leave, & then you love mee." [...] But life is never pure comedy, and the end in this case is tragical. Roger Williams, after his return from England in 1654, writes to John Winthrop, Jr.: [...] "Your brother flourisheth in good esteeme & is eminent for maintaining the Freedome of the Conscience as to matters of Beliefe, Religion, & Worship. Your Father Peters preacheth the same Doctrine though not so zealously as some years since, yet cries out against New English Rigidities & Persecutions, their civil injuries & wrongs to himselfe, & their unchristian dealing with him in excommunicating his distracted wife. All this he tould me in his lodgings at Whitehall, those lodgings which I was tould were Canterburies [the Archbishop], but he himselfe tould me that that Library wherein we were together was Canterburies & given him by the Parliament. His wife lives from him, not wholy but much distracted. He tells me he had but 200 a yeare & he allowed her 4 score per annum of it. Surely, Sir, the most holy Lord is most wise in all the trialls he exerciseth his people with. He tould me that his affliction from his wife stird him up to Action abroad, & when successe tempted him to Pride, the Bitternes in his bozome-comforts was a Cooler & a Bridle to him." [...] Truly the whirligig of time brings about strange revenges. Peter had been driven from England by the persecutions of Laud; a few years later he [...] "stood armed on the scaffold" [...] when that prelate was beheaded, and now we find him installed in the archiepiscopal lodgings. Dr. Palfrey, it appears to me, gives altogether too favorable an opinion both of Peter's character and abilities. I conceive him to have been a vain and selfish man. He may have had the bravery of passionate impulse, but he wanted that steady courage of character which has such a beautiful constancy in Winthrop. He always professed a longing to come back to New England, but it was only a way he had of talking. That he never meant to come is plain from these letters. Nay, when things looked prosperous in England, he writes to the younger Winthrop: [...] "My counsell is you should come hither with your family for certaynly you will bee capable of a comfortable living in this free Commonwealth. I doo seriously advise it.... G. Downing is worth 500l. per annum but 4l. per diem--your brother Stephen worth 2000l. & a maior. I pray come." [...] But when he is snugly ensconced in Whitehall, and may be presumed to have some influence with the prevailing powers, his zeal cools. [...] "I wish you & all friends to stay there & rather looke to the West Indyes if they remoue, for many are here to seeke when they come ouer." [...] To me Peter's highest promotion seems to have been that he walked with John Milton at the Protector's funeral. He was, I suspect, one of those men, to borrow a charitable phrase of Roger Williams, who [...] "feared God in the main," [...] that is, whenever it was not personally inconvenient. William Coddington saw him in his glory in 1651: [...] "Soe wee toucke the tyme to goe to viset Mr Petters at his chamber. I was mery with him & called him the Arch Bp: of Canterberye, in regard to his adtendance by ministers & gentlemen, & it passed very well." [...] Considering certain charges brought against Peter, (though he is said, when under sentence of death, to have denied the truth of them,) Coddington's statement that he liked to have [...] "gentlewomen waite of him" [...] in his lodgings has not a pleasant look. One last report of him we get (September, 1659) in a letter of John Davenport,--"that Mr Hugh Peters is distracted & under sore horrors of conscience, crying out of himselfe as damned & confessing haynous actings." ...|$|E

5000|$|Tonalist {{began his}} second season at Gulfstream Park in Florida, winning a maiden race over nine furlongs in January and running second to Constitution in an {{allowance}} race a month later. Any chance he had of competing in the major trials for the Triple Crown ended when he contracted a lung infection which disrupted his training schedule. In May he was moved up sharply in class when he contested the Grade II Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. Wearing blinkers for the first time, he was ridden by Joel Rosario and started the 6-5 favorite against six opponents on a [...] "sloppy" [...] track. He stumbled at the start but recovered {{to take the lead}} after {{a quarter of a mile}} and went clear in the straight to win by four lengths from Commissioner. After the race Clement commented [...] "What impressed me was the last eighth of a mile, when he opened up again. I was very worried about the wet track. I don't breeze my horses on the wet track so that was a complete question mark. He answered that pretty nicely. Let's see how the horse comes out of it, but of course we have to think about the Belmont Stakes". Rosario said [...] "He was doing it easy; he was doing it on his own. I don't think we were going that fast. He can go a mile and a half; I think he can run all day. He's a big horse with a long stride, when you get him in the bridle, the more you ask, the more he'll give".On June 7, in front of a crowd of 120,000, Tonalist contested the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes which attracted much attention as California Chrome, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes attempted to become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to complete the Triple Crown. Clement professed his lack of concern when Tonalist was drawn on the complete outside of the eleven runner field, saying [...] "He's a really, really big horse with a long stride, so he can basically run his own race without worrying about anybody else." [...] After a late surge of support in the betting, he started the 9.2/1 fifth choice behind California Chrome, Wicked Strong, Ride on Curlin (runner-up in the Preakness) and Commanding Curve (runner-up in the Derby). Tonalist broke well from his outside draw and was third behind Commissioner and General A Rod after the first half mile. He maintained his position despite being forced four wide on the final turn and gradually wore down the opposition in the straight to win by a head from Commissioner, with Medal Count in third and California Chrome dead heating with Wicked Strong for fourth. After the race Rosario commented [...] "He was going easy, I didn't want to be too far behind. When I got to the three-eighths pole I was a little confident. I was worried a little bit turning for home, but he started picking them up." [...] Evans said [...] "This morning I went to my father's grave and thanked him for putting me in this position. I've been where Steve Coburn has been, and it's not fun. I remember it was real quiet after we lost Pleasant Colony finished third in the Belmont in 1981." [...] When asked to respond to Coburn's statement that he had taken the [...] "coward's way" [...] by not running his horse in the first two legs of the series, Evans said [...] "I don’t think I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> on that".|$|E

From my Canadian practice experience, the rec-ommendation should have been that “primary care physicians should notify licensing bodies of concern regarding competence to drive … even if the pa-tient gives up driving voluntarily. ” Promises to give up driving volun-tarily are subject to erosion by the gen-uine or conveniently exaggerated ef-fects of short-term memory deficits: “Sorry, doc, I {{forgot all about}} that. ” My usual policy was to approve of the pa-tient’s wise decision to give up driving voluntarily but to tell him or her that I was required to inform the Ministry of Transportation anyway, just to keep everyone honest. I never received an adverse reaction to this strategy; when I didn’t use this ap-proach, however, I sometimes encoun-tered awkward situations involving prac-tical inconvenience (including personally having to disable vehicles and having to confiscate driver’s licences) and obvious potential medicolegal problems.

40|$|In {{their recent}} article, Martino et al. (1) {{concluded}} that raloxifene treatment reduces {{the incidence of}} estrogren recep-tor (ER) – positive invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteopo-rosis. However, venous thromboembolic events were two times higher in the ral-oxifene group than {{in the placebo group}} (2). We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> about this study. Nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs, such as cyclooxygenase- 1 and- 2 (COX- 1 and- 2) inhibitors, are frequently used to alleviate bone pain due to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. COX- 2 inhibitors {{have been shown to be}} chemo-preventive agents in patients with famil-ial polyposis coli (3). However, it has also been shown that overexpression of COX- 2 is associated with increased ex-pression of aromatase in breast cancer cells (4). The expression of COX- 2 pro-motes the growth of microvessels within the tumor through increased expression of prostaglandin E 2, which induces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fi broblast growth factor in cancer cells and directly modulates endothelial cell proliferation (5, 6). Be-cause both an abundant vasculature and accelerated estrogen synthesis are thought to contribute to unfavorable con-ditions for response to endocrine therapy, it is likely that COX- 2 inhibition may be a promising strategy to potentiate the effectiveness of endocrine therapy. Martino et al. (1) did not report any information about the use of analgesics, especially COX- 2 inhibitors, by the patients in their study. It is possible that patients in the placebo and raloxifene groups differed in their use of COX- 2 inhibitors, which may have had a preventive effect on the development of ER-positive breast cancer. We recommend that a subgroup analysis that considers the use of nonsteroidal anti- infl ammatory agents should be performed...|$|E

40|$|This is an English {{translation}} of the paper 2 ̆ 2 Über den Wertevorrat einer Matrix 2 ̆ 2 by Rudolf Kippenhahn, Mathematische Nachrichten 6 (1951), 193 – 228. This paper is often cited by mathematicians {{who work in the}} area of numerical ranges, thus it is hoped that this translation may be useful. Some notation and wording has been changed to make the paper more in line with present papers on the subject written in English. In Part 1 of this paper Kippenhahn characterized the numerical range of a matrix as being the convex hull of a certain algebraic curve that is associated to the matrix. More than 55 years later this 2 ̆ 2 boundary generating curve 2 ̆ 2 is still a topic of current research, and 2 ̆ 2 ¨Uber den Wertevorrat einer Matrix 2 ̆ 2 is almost always present in the bibliographies of papers on this topic. In Part 2, the author initiated the study of a generalization of the numerical range to matrices with quaternion entries. The translators note that in Theorem 36, it is stated incorrectly that this set of points in 4 -dimensional space is convex. A counterexample to this statement was given in 1984. [I] In the notes {{at the end of this}} paper the translators pinpoint the flaw in the argument. In the opinion of the translators, this error does not significantly detract from the overall value and significance of this paper.
