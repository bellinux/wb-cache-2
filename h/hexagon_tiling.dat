In addition, the plane tilings of the dihex and {{straight}} polyhexes are invariant under 180 degrees rotation or reflection parallel or perpendicular to the long axis of the dihex (order 2 rotational and order 4 reflection symmetry), and the <b>hexagon</b> <b>tiling</b> and some other polyhexes (like the hexahex with one hole, below) are invariant under 60, 120 or 180 degree rotation (order 6 rotational and reflection symmetry).|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{construct}} Hermite subdivision {{schemes for}} <b>hexagon</b> <b>tiling</b> and quadrisection / 3 refinement, which have applications in free-form surface design. Such subdivision schemes operate {{in such a}} way that when a “jet’’ of Hermite data is attached to each of the vertices in a coarse <b>hexagon</b> <b>tiling,</b> the subdivision rule is capable of defining Hermite data attached to the vertices of successively refined hexagon tilings, {{in such a way}} that the data converges to a smooth limit function which has Hermite data consistent with that generated by the subdivision process. Such a “vertex-based scheme on hexagon tiling’’ can be thought of as a “face-based schemes on triangular tiling’’. This simple connection allows us to put the construction under the mathematical framework of subdivision operators and refinement equations. Along the way, we introduce a general concept called k-fold Hermite subdivision, and analyze its properties with the help of the strong convergence theory of refinement equation. The case of k= 2, together with an appropriate symmetry condition, can be used to handle the construction of honeycomb Hermite subdivision schemes. In particular, our framework allows us to construct smoother versions of two interesting honeycomb subdivision schemes in the literature...|$|E

It runs in real time, modeling {{the interactions of}} tens of thousands of units in supporl of U. S. Army training cxcrciscs, typically involving several sites at. geographically separated locations around the world. Until rcccntly, the CBS terrain database has associated terrain characteristics with a regular grid of three-kilometer <b>hexagons</b> <b>tiling</b> an appropriate map projection of the playbox. The hexagons also served as bins for other Iocation-dependent information to simplify the search for what’s nearby. This paper presents a ncw way to dcscribc locations: llyna~y latitudes and longitudes define patches of various sizes that completely cover the globe. Larger patches, not necessarily all the same sire, can serve as bins. Medium-sized patches can be assumed to have uniform terrain characteristics throughout. Tiny patches are suitable descriptors of locations. The ncw paradigm maybe implcmcntcd in CBS in the next development cycle. Spherical coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) are used for fundamental specification of locations, so playboxcs are not limited by the characteristics of any map projection.

40|$|Here we {{consider}} the de Bruijn network, a fixed-degree hypercubic network topology. De Bruijn graphs have enjoyed a recent popularity as a proposed basis of multicomputer interconnection networks. We'll explore various characteristics that make de Bruijn graphs attractive. 1 Introduction Some motivation {{for the study of}} novel network topologies comes from the theoretical satisfaction of working on graph- and group-theoretic objects, as in [1], [4], and [3]. On a practical level, though, there are algorithmic synergies, as in [6], and favourable VLSI implementation characteristics, as in [2] and [5]. 1. 1 Some Topological Considerations Before we look at de Bruijn networks let's consider some topological issues. Optimal tilings in the plane are a well-understood field of study. If we wish to maximize the area over the circumference of a tile (i. e., a shape that can be repeated on the plane with no overlap and no empty spaces between), the result is a <b>hexagon.</b> The <b>tiling</b> of a hex [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Recently, we have {{proposed}} a novel family of bivariate, non-separable splines [1]. These splines, called “hex-splines ” {{have been designed to}} deal with hexagonally sam-pled data. Incorporating the shape of the Voronoi cell of a hexagonal lattice, they preserve the twelve-fold symmetry of the <b>hexagon</b> <b>tiling</b> cell. Similar to B-splines, we can use them to provide a link between the discrete and the continu-ous domain, which is required for many fundamental opera-tions such as interpolation and resampling [2]. The question we answer in this paper is “How well do the hex-splines ap-proximate a given function in the continuous domain? ” and more specifically “How do they compare to separable B-splines deployed on a lattice with the same sampling den-sity?” A general signal space, spanned by shifted versions of a function (such as a spline) on a lattice described by a matrix 	, contains all signals fif...|$|E
