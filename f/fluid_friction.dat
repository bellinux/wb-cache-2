25|$|Lubricated {{friction}} {{is a case}} of <b>fluid</b> <b>friction</b> where a fluid separates two solid surfaces.

25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities, in {{what is known as}} a boundary layer {{in the case of a}} bounding surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a flame in air. This relative movement generates <b>fluid</b> <b>friction,</b> which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more kinetic energy is absorbed by a more viscous fluid. The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.|$|E
500|$|Perry was {{succeeded by}} John Grundy, Sr., {{who had arrived}} in the region in 1731 {{at the request of the}} Duke of Buccleuch, who wanted his estates surveyed. Perry was {{building}} the Spalding sluice at the time, and Grundy's work allowed him to study drains, banks, sluices and outfalls. He formed the opinion that mathematical and philosophical principles should be applied to the drainage of low-lying regions. In 1733, he surveyed the parish of Moulton, a little further downstream, to assess how drainage could be improved for the Commissioners of Sewers. He demonstrated the use of a telescopic spirit level, which enabled him to achieve accurate levels, with errors of less than 1 inch per mile (2cm per km). Next he addressed the issue of flow in open drains. Using his mathematical principles, he calculated that water in a drain which was [...] long, and had a fall of [...] over its length should travel at around , taking 1 hour and 28 minutes to travel the length of the drain. Observations in the field showed him that other factors, such as <b>fluid</b> <b>friction,</b> resulted in the actual flow rate being less than half of this. He published a paper of his findings in April 1734, and insisted that accurate mapping and levels, together with physical observation of drains and rivers, were essential to deciding how fenland could best be drained. In the same month, he began working for the Adventurers of Deeping Fen, to produce a drainage scheme. He spent some time mapping [...] of the Welland, and his chief recommendation was for a reservoir and sluice at the outfall of the River Glen, which would enable the outfall to be scoured at low tide, by releasing water from the reservoir.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>friction</b> occurs between fluid layers {{that are}} moving {{relative}} to each other. This internal {{resistance to flow}} is named viscosity. In everyday terms, the viscosity of a fluid is described as its [...] "thickness". Thus, water is [...] "thin", having a lower viscosity, while honey is [...] "thick", having a higher viscosity. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of deformation or movement.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{scientific}} consensus, {{the occurrence of}} the paradox {{is due to the}} neglected effects of viscosity. [...] In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous <b>fluid</b> <b>friction</b> during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces. [...] These viscous forces cause friction drag on streamlined objects, and for [...] bodies the additional result is flow separation and a low-pressure wake behind the object, leading to form drag.|$|E
50|$|In <b>fluid</b> flow, <b>friction</b> loss (or skin friction) is {{the loss}} of {{pressure}} or “head” that occurs in pipe or duct flow due to the effect of the fluid's viscosity near the surface of the pipe or duct.In mechanical systems such as internal combustion engines, the term refers to the power lost in overcoming the friction between two moving surfaces, a different phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Journal {{bearings}} usually wok under a {{wide range}} of operating conditions. However, adverse operating such as transient operations and oil degradation can lead to early defects to the bearings. In this paper, modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) is used to analyse vibration responses from a journal bearing lubricated with three different oils to differentiate abnormal lubrication conditions. MSB magnitude results represent the nonlinear vibration responses, which are due to instable hydrodynamics, asperity excitations and nonlinear transfer paths, with two distinctive bifrequency patterns corresponding to instable lubrication and asperity interactions respectively. Using entropy measures, these instable lubrications are classified to be the low loads cases. Furthermore, average MSB magnitudes are used to differentiate the asperity interactions between asperity collisions and the asperity churns. A higher magnitude in the lower frequency band can indicate the excessive asperity contacts due to lowering viscosities. Meanwhile a higher magnitude in the higher frequency band indicates the extreme <b>fluid</b> <b>frictions...</b>|$|R
40|$|High {{frequency}} concentration fluctuations are attenuated by the eddy covariance (EC) sensors system. This {{is due to}} {{an inability}} of the EC system to process eddies of small size and induces an underestimation of the fluxes. The two main reasons are the <b>fluid</b> <b>frictions</b> through the inlet tube of the gas analyzer and {{the separation of the}} sensors position between the center of the anemometer and the inlet tube. A correction factor is then needed for CO 2 and H 2 O fluxes. In this study, we describe a new procedure for the high frequency correction (HFC). This new HFC is applied for the CO 2 and H 2 O fluxes measured at Vielsalm and Lonzée since their setup. Finally, we compare the former and updated corrected fluxes of these two sites which are part of the Terrestrial Observatories of Belgium. Both Observatories are included in the European ecosystem network of ICOS...|$|R

The low pressure drop lets the SHE handle fouling more easily. The SHE uses a “self cleaning” mechanism, whereby fouled surfaces cause a localized increase in fluid velocity, thus increasing the drag (or <b>fluid</b> <b>friction)</b> on the fouled surface, thus helping to dislodge the blockage and keep the heat exchanger clean. [...] "The internal walls that make up the heat transfer surface are often rather thick, which makes the SHE very robust, and able to last a long time in demanding environments." ...|$|E

I have argued that it is formed by rarefaction, and consequent refrigeration, of the metallic gases constituting the stratum in which the cyclone exists. He argues that it is formed within the mass of cooled hydrogen drawn from the chromosphere into the vortex of the cyclone. Speaking of the cyclones he says:--"Dans leur embouchure évasée ils entraîneront l'hydrogène froid de la chromosphère, produisant partout sur leur trajet vertical un abaissement notable de température et une obscurité relative, due à l'opacité de l'hydrogène froid englouti." [...] (Revue Scientifique, 24 March 1883.) Considering the intense cold required to reduce hydrogen to the [...] "critical point," [...] it is a strong supposition that the motion given to it by <b>fluid</b> <b>friction</b> on entering the vortex of the cyclone, can produce a rotation, rarefaction, and cooling, great enough to produce precipitation in a region so intensely heated.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 14: A {{reference}} may fitly be {{made here}} to a reason given by Mons. Babinet for {{rejection of the}} Nebular Hypothesis. He has calculated that taking the existing Sun, with its observed angular velocity, its substance, if expanded so as to fill the orbit of Neptune, would have nothing approaching the angular velocity which the time of revolution of that planet implies. The assumption he makes is inadmissible. He supposes that {{all parts of the}} nebulous spheroid when it filled Neptune's orbit, had the same angular velocities. But the process of nebular condensation as indicated above, implies that the remoter flocculi of nebulous matter, later in reaching the central mass, and forming its peripheral portions, will acquire, during their longer journeys towards it, greater velocities. An inspection of one of the spiral nebulæ, as 51st or 99th Messier, at once shows that the outlying portions when they reach the nucleus, will form an equatorial belt moving round the common centre more rapidly than the rest. Thus the central parts will have small angular velocities, while there will be increasing angular velocities of parts increasingly remote from the centre. And while the density of the spheroid continues small, <b>fluid</b> <b>friction</b> will scarcely at all change these differences.|$|E
30|$|The superficial/Darcy {{velocity}} is {{a function}} of permeability, viscosity (internal resistance), and also the friction between the surface area of the pores in the permeable media and the moving <b>fluid.</b> This <b>friction</b> begins to change at low pressure gradient because dynamic friction is smaller than static friction. At very low velocities, the static friction begins to dominate the fluid movement behavior (along with the permeability and viscosity), thus contributing to the pre-Darcy effect.|$|R

50|$|In {{degenerative}} joint disease, the proteoglycan complexes start disappearing, and the hyaluronate becomes poorer {{in quality}} and scarcer. This lowers the viscosity of the synovial <b>fluid,</b> increasing <b>friction,</b> and causing {{white blood cells}} and enzymes to enter to effect cartilage degradation and inflammation. Steroids that are released as a result kill the chondrocytes. The remaining chondrocytes have trouble exchanging nutrients with the synovial fluid, which {{would allow them to}} repair some damages.|$|R
60|$|In {{the cooling}} of {{celestial}} bodies several factors are concerned. The first and simplest {{is the one}} illustrated at every fire-side by the rapid blackening of little cinders which fall into the ashes, {{in contrast with the}} long-continued redness of big lumps. This factor is the relation between increase of surface and increase of content: surfaces, in similar bodies, increasing as the squares of the dimensions while contents increase as their cubes. Hence, on comparing the Earth with Jupiter, whose diameter is about eleven times that of the Earth, it results that while his surface is 125 times as great, his content is 1390 times as great. Now even (supposing we assume like temperatures and like densities) if the only effect were that through a given area of surface eleven times more matter had to be cooled in the one case than in the other, there would be a vast difference between the times occupied in concentration. But, in virtue of a second factor, the difference would be much greater than that consequent on these geometrical relations. The escape of heat from a cooling mass is effected by conduction, or by convection, or by both. In a solid it is wholly by conduction; in a liquid or gas the chief part is played by convection--by circulating currents which continually transpose the hotter and cooler parts. Now in fluid spheroids--gaseous, or liquid, or mixed--increasing size entails an increasing obstacle to cooling, consequent on the increasing distances to be travelled by the circulating currents. Of course the relation is not a simple one: the velocities of the currents will be unlike. It is manifest, however, that in a sphere of eleven times the diameter, the transit of matter from centre to surface and back from surface to centre, will take a much longer time; even if its movement is unrestrained. But its movement is, in such cases as we are considering, greatly restrained. In a rotating spheroid there come into play retarding forces augmenting with the velocity of rotation. In such a spheroid the respective portions of matter (supposing them equal in their angular velocities round the axis, which they will tend more and more to become as the density increases), must vary in their absolute velocities according to their distances from the axis; and each portion cannot have its distance from the axis changed by circulating currents, which it must continually be, without loss or gain in its quantity of motion: through the medium of <b>fluid</b> <b>friction,</b> force must be expended, now in increasing its motion and now in retarding its motion. Hence, when the larger spheroid has also a higher velocity of rotation, the relative slowness of the circulating currents, and the consequent retardation of cooling, must be much greater than is implied by the extra distances to be travelled.|$|E
