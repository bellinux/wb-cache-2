5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{especially}} {{due to the}} vernacular language used, this work was largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was never used as an academic work, or even as a school textbook. It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to the vernacular language it used and the liberal views it expressed. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that the work’s linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, never used such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that JCR and MCR are terms {{that are used to}} refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that it is not}} Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu), part of the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in Jiangling County, Hubei. Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the zhoubi school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until Cai Yong's (132–192 CE) commentary of 180 CE. A preface {{was added to the}} text by Zhao Shuang 趙爽 in the 3rd century CE. There was also the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century CE) in 263 CE. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> in this context that many of the documents excavated from Qin and Han sites contain evidence of the practical mathematics used by administrators for inventories and taxes, as well as for calculating labor needed for public works projects, just as described in the mathematical treatises.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that all}} the even order susceptibilities become zero in centrosymmetric media. A proof of this is as follows.|$|E
50|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that the}} part of Route 12 running through Peterborough's Bridge Street has a cycling ban in place {{approximately}} Monday-Saturday 9:00 am - 6:00pm and Sunday 9:00 am - 4:00pm.|$|R
50|$|It might <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{here that}} the first known French {{translation}} appeared in Lyon in 1559, in a volume by Charles Fontaine. The first known English translation appeared in the Edinburgh Review in 1816.|$|R
30|$|Visual {{assessment}} of the overall health status, any external abnormalities, and infection status with ectoparasites showed no remarkable results [19]. Only sporadic nematodes infections of the airbladder of the eel in 1988 and 1989 <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting.</b>|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that the}} common Jewish name Halpern, and many {{variants}} such as Alpert, derive from {{the name of this}} city Heilbronn, and the early Jewish community there.|$|E
25|$|Since 1995, two Dutch Harness Horse stallions {{have been}} chosen to add elegance and responsiveness, though it <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that these stallions had {{primarily}} Ostfriesen and Groningen pedigrees themselves, and no Hackney blood.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that despite}} the fact that the Mordecais were the only Jewish family in and around this small town, they {{remained}} observant Jews, keeping a strictly kosher home where Shabbos was observed.|$|E
50|$|In 1995/6, a large {{batch of}} Dennis Darts with East Lancs EL2000 {{bodywork}} were purchased, and <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> as {{the bodies are}} wider than usual Darts (regardless of bodywork): 12 in 1995 and 10 in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Two {{special cases}} <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting.</b> As {{the height of}} the {{potential}} becomes large, , the radius of the semicircle gets larger and the roots get {{closer and closer to the}} values , and we recover the case of the infinite square well.|$|R
50|$|Neocentromeres {{have also}} been {{reported}} in lung carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that neocentromeres in cancer may occur more frequently than currently observed, because many cancer screenings involving karyotyping do not use assays that detect neocentromere formations.|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that 'attachment', 'craving', 'fear' and 'aversion' above {{cited in}} bold font are {{somewhat}} standardized and hence less-rich lexical {{choices for the}} semantic field represented by the four of the 'Five Poisons' (Sanskrit: pancha klesha) they denote.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that action}} {{potentials}} do not usually produce an observable field, mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow {{in opposite directions}} and the magnetic fields cancel out. However, action fields have been measured from peripheral nerves.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that orbital rockets are {{launched}} vertically {{at first}} to lift the rocket above the atmosphere (which causes frictional drag), and then slowly pitch over and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbit speed.|$|E
50|$|The lion is a {{reference}} to the village’s former allegiance to the County of Veldenz. The ryesheaf (“garb of rye”) symbolizes the village’s former agricultural character. It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting,</b> though, that nowadays there is not even one farmer in Leitzweiler.|$|R

25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{during the}} {{internal}} review that Ben claimed {{he tried to}} contribute {{as much as possible}} during the task, but ultimately it was felt Ben had only done minor tasks and hadn't technically contributed anything during both weeks and this resulted in his dismissal.|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that nicotine, {{although}} frequently {{implicated in}} producing tobacco addiction, is not significantly addictive when administered alone. The addictive potential manifests itself after co-administration of an MAOI, which specifically causes sensitization of the locomotor response in rats, {{a measure of}} addictive potential.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that some}} of the shelters were {{incomplete}} as war broke out, some had little to no ventilation, many of them not camouflaged and some were not fitted with armored observation domes. The incomplete state of the shelters significantly reduced the combat capability of the emplacements.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> {{that in the}} 7 matches {{he played}} in Aucher Warner lost the toss each time. On each {{occasion}} the West Indians had to field first and on each occasion they lost the match. Stanley Sproston had more luck, winning the toss 5 times out of 10.|$|E
50|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that {{residents}} of this area remain somewhat mystified {{by the fact that}} their neighborhood is dotted on maps and designated as a CDP, as it is actually a suburban residential neighborhood and not a separate town or settlement of any sort.|$|R

25|$|A {{study by}} Griffiths et al. {{concluded}} that psilocybin {{is capable of}} producing mystical experiences. These experiences may be conducive {{to the development of}} a religious ritual. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that the experience of death and rebirth can be brought on by psychedelic drugs, but it is also a central concept of Hinduism (i.e. saṃsāra).|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} this order was, at least in part, {{to ensure that the}} local {{population}} would sell food and other supplies to his troops. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that the Parliamentarian Colonel Daniel Axtell was court-martialled by Ireton in 1650 as a result of atrocities committed by his soldiers during the Battle of Meelick Island.|$|E
25|$|The word Sadism {{originates}} {{from the}} works of Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade, and the word Masochism originates from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the author of Venus in Furs. However, it <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that the Marquis de Sade describes unconsented abuse in his works, such as in Justine. Venus in Furs describes a consented domme-sub relationship.|$|E
5000|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> that cov(FS) − cov(HS) = ¼ s2A [...] Experiments {{consisting}} of FS and HS families could utilize this by using intra-class correlation to equate experiment variance components to these covariances section on [...] "Coefficient of relationship as an intra-class correlation" [...] for {{the rationale behind}} this.|$|R
