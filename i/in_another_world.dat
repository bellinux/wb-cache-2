5|$|The series {{starts with}} Kingdom Hearts, where a 14-year-old boy named Sora is {{separated}} from his friends Riku and Kairi when their world, Destiny Islands, is invaded by creatures known as the Heartless. During the invasion, Sora obtains a weapon called the Keyblade {{that allows him to}} fight the Heartless. He soon arrives <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>world,</b> Traverse Town, where he meets Donald Duck and Goofy, two emissaries from Disney Castle sent to find the Keyblade wielder under orders from their missing king, Mickey Mouse. The three band together and travel to different Disney-themed worlds, sealing the hearts of the worlds to prevent more Heartless from devouring the hearts of those worlds as they search for their companions. Along the way, they encounter a group of Disney villains led by Maleficent, who are controlling the Heartless to capture seven maidens called the Princesses of Heart, and use their power to open the door to Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds. Though they eventually defeat Maleficent, the three discover a sentient Heartless named Ansem to be the true orchestrator of the worlds' destruction. The three defeat Ansem and seal the door to Kingdom Hearts, but remain separated from Riku and King Mickey while Kairi remains home to await her friends' return.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of the ideologues of the Udmurt Vos movement, the whole of nature is {{determined}} by the numinous presence of divinity, gods and spirits. Existence has three basic levels: the cosmic, in which the central divinity Inmar takes first place; that of the aerial elements, the heavens, Kvaz'; and the earthly creation, the world of creatures, Kelchin'. Alongside the hierarchy of Inmar, Kvaz' and Kelchin' there is Lud (the world tree), genius (breeder) of all spirits, which is not good nor evil. The dead actually live <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>world</b> which is a perfect mirror of our own.|$|E

25|$|Whatever is good, bad or {{indifferent}} about Streets of Fire, {{it had a}} {{huge impact}} on other filmmakers. The two movies that came out in the years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of Streets of Fire are RoboCop and Se7en. Se7en’s taking place <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>world.</b> It’s not New York. It’s not Chicago. A world where it’s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured out how to do the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. And I think that if we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E
25|$|Although the Giants did {{not play}} <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>World</b> Series until 1989, the teams of the 1960s {{continued}} to be pennant contenders thanks to several future Hall-of-Famers. These included Gaylord Perry, who pitched a no-hitter with the Giants in 1968; Juan Marichal, a pitcher with a memorable high-kicking delivery; McCovey, who won the National League MVP award in 1969, and Mays, who hit his 600th career home run in 1969. A Giants highlight came in 1963 when Jesús Alou joined the team, and along with Felipe and Matty, for one late inning of one game, formed the first all-brother outfield in major league history. In 1967, pitcher Mike McCormick became the first Giant Cy Young Award winner.|$|E
25|$|At the 1899 world {{championship}}s in Montreal, Canada, Taylor won the one-mile sprint, {{to become the first}} African American to win a world championship in cycling. Taylor was the second black athlete, after Canadian bantamweight boxer George Dixon of Boston, to win a world championship in any sport. Taylor won the one-mile world championship sprint in a close finish a few feet ahead of Frenchman Courbe d'Outrelon and American Tom Butler. In addition, Taylor placed second in the two-mile championship sprint at Montreal behind Charles McCarthy and won the half-mile championship race. Because the finals were held on Sundays, when Taylor refused to compete for religious reasons, he did not compete <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>world</b> championship contest until 1909 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Taylor lost in a preliminary heat at Copenhagen and did not compete in the finals.|$|E

25|$|The show {{took over}} the entire 3–4 pm/2-3 Central period, {{the latter part of}} which {{witnessed}} it beating back, to some degree, CBS' huge Match Game, then daytime's most popular program. However, starting <b>in</b> 1978, <b>Another</b> <b>World</b> began to experience an erosion in ratings caused mainly by the surge in popularity of General Hospital. <b>Another</b> <b>World</b> fell from a first-place tie in 1978 to eighth in 1979 (a drop from 8.6 to 7.5), but remained NBC's highest-rated daytime drama. Despite the fall <b>in</b> ratings, <b>Another</b> <b>World</b> became the first, and thus far only, soap opera to expand to 90 minutes, a move that proved unsuccessful—it remained in eighth place in the 1979–1980 television season.|$|R

25|$|On April 12, 1999, {{as part of}} a shakeup of the network's daytime {{and early}} morning {{schedules}} (in which NBC also cancelled NBC News at Sunrise – with newcomer Early Today replacing it as the network's early-morning newscast – and picked up the daytime talk show Later Today, a short-lived spinoff of Today), NBC announced that it would not renew Another World, ending the series' run after 35 years once the show's previous renewal agreement ended that June. Many reasons abounded for Another World cancellation, one of the more notable events occurred in the summer of 1998: the network's San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) – at the time one of NBC's highest-rated stations – stopped airing the show altogether, leaving Days of Our Lives and Sunset Beach as the only NBC soaps that the station cleared on its schedule; the move resulted <b>in</b> <b>Another</b> <b>World</b> being unavailable in around two million television households within the large San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose market, resulting in additional erosion of the program's already below-mediocre ratings (it was later picked up by smaller independent station KICU-TV).|$|E
25|$|His {{best year}} in {{international}} football came in 1949, when he scored {{five of his}} six goals for the FAI XI, including four in three successive internationals. On 12 June he scored a penalty in a 4–1 home defeat to Spain. Then on 8 September in a qualifier for the 1950 FIFA World Cup against Finland, playing a centre-forward, he scored twice. The first was another penalty and second was headed in from a corner. On 21 September, together with Johnny Carey and Peter Farrell, {{he was a member}} of the FAI XI that defeated England 2–0 at Goodison Park, becoming the first non-UK team to beat England at home. Martin scored the opener, once again from the penalty spot, after Peter Desmond was brought down in the box. He scored his fifth goal, yet another penalty, in a 3–1 defeat to Sweden <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>World</b> Cup qualifier. On 10 May 1950 he captained the FAI XI in a 5–1 defeat to Belgium. He scored his last goal for the FAI XI in a 2–1 win against Norway in a friendly on 7 November 1954.|$|E

First, he damned the crime, [...] "as odious and abominable {{in the eyes of}} God as it is hateful and abhorrent to the feelings of man". He reminded the prisoner of the short time, [...] "a very short time", that remained for him to seek for mercy <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>world,</b> and then pronounced the sentence of death itself: [...] "You shall be hanged by the neck until you be dead, your body to be dissected and anatomized". The entire trial had lasted less than eight hours.|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>Another</b> <b>World</b> {{received}} mixed reviews. Country Weekly reviewer {{wrote that}} Diffie [...] "deals with adult emotions" [...] {{and described the}} title track as [...] "a shimmering ballad perfect for his expressive tenor." [...] William Ruhlmann called the album [...] "sturdy formula country", and Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time said that he [...] "easily interpret" [...] the songs but [...] "doesn't {{seem to be doing}} anything too dramatically different." [...] After Monument closed its Nashville branch, Diffie began touring with Mark Chesnutt and Tracy Lawrence on the Rockin' Roadhouse Tour, which began in 2002. That same year, Diffie was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Sony Nashville {{transferred}} Diffie {{from its}} Epic division to the Monument Records division. This move {{was due to}} a corporate decision that Epic had too many artists and Monument had too few. Cook and Wilson also produced his only album for Monument, which was titled <b>In</b> <b>Another</b> <b>World.</b> Regarding this album, Diffie told Billboard that its material had a common theme of love, and {{that he wanted to}} create a more contemporary sound through the production. The album's title track peaked at number ten on the country charts and number 66 on the Hot 100. Only one other single was released from the album: [...] "This Pretender" [...] (co-written by Rascal Flatts lead singer Gary LeVox), which failed to make the country music Top 40.|$|E

500|$|Tron: Legacy is {{imbued with}} several {{references}} to religious themes, particularly those relating to Christianity and Buddhism. Olivia Wilde's character, Quorra, was {{informed by the}} historical Catholic figure Joan of Arc. Wilde sought inspiration from her six months before production of the film commenced. She, alongside Kosinski, collaborated with the writers on editing the characters so she would contain the characteristics of Joan of Arc. Wilde assessed {{the characteristics of the}} figure: [...] "She's this unlikely warrior, very strong but compassionate, and completely led by selflessness. Also, she thinks she's in touch with some higher power and has one foot <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>world.</b> All of these were elements of Quorra." [...] Since she epitomizes the concept of androgyny, producers conceived Quorra from an androgynous perspective, notably giving her a short haircut.|$|E
500|$|Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a human-terminator hybrid experiment. Worthington {{compared}} Marcus to Dorothy Gale and Alice due {{to being}} [...] "this person waking up <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>world</b> [...] {{tries to find}} himself". Terminator creator James Cameron personally recommended Worthington (whom he directed in Avatar) to McG. Russell Crowe also recommended him to McG. The director decided Worthington looked tougher than the [...] "great many of today's [...] young male actors". Worthington recalled Cameron told him [...] "the Terminator to make is {{the one with the}} war". Worthington tore his intercostal muscles during the first weeks of filming but nevertheless insisted on performing his own stunts. McG once expressed interest in casting Christian Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis or Josh Brolin in the part. Brolin did talk to Bale and read a draft of the screenplay, which he found [...] "interesting and dark; ultimately, though, I didn't think it felt right".|$|E
500|$|A boy called Simon was celebrating his 12th birthday, and was {{impressed}} by a magician who pulled rabbits out of hats and conjuring infinite amounts of gaily coloured handkerchiefs.

The book was stored in the loft. One day, Simon hears Chippy in the loft. Investigating, Simon finds that the book is titled [...] "Ye Olde Spellbooke". Simon throws the book onto the floor in contempt, only for a portal to open above it. Chippy quickly goes through the portal and Simon follows, ending up <b>in</b> <b>another</b> <b>world.</b> After escaping from some goblins who intended to eat Simon, he quickly discovers {{a house in a}} village belonging to a wizard called Calypso, along with a note from him. Through it, Simon learns he was brought to this world to save Calypso from the evil sorcerer, Sordid.|$|E
