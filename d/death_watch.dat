5|$|The <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> beetle, Xestobium rufovillosum (Anobiidae), is {{a serious}} pest of older wooden {{buildings}} in Europe. It attacks hardwoods such as oak and chestnut, always where some fungal decay has taken or is taking place. The actual introduction of the pest into buildings is thought to {{take place at the}} time of construction.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
5|$|In the , Palpatine was {{voiced by}} Ian Abercrombie from 2008 {{to his death}} in 2012, and by Tim Curry from 2012 to 2014. In the series, Palpatine {{continues}} to serve as Supreme Chancellor while his Sith identity remains behind the scenes via holograms. In the second season, Sidious hires bounty hunter Cad Bane to infiltrate the Jedi Temple and steal a holocron. He then takes a valuable Kyber memory crystal that contains the names of thousands of Force-sensitive younglings - {{the future of the}} Jedi Order - from around the galaxy. The final stage of the plot: to bring four Force-sensitive children to Sidious's secret facility on Mustafar. Anakin and Ahsoka again foil the plot, but Bane escapes and all evidence of Sidious' involvement is lost. In the fifth season, Sidious personally travels to the planet Mandalore to confront his former apprentice Darth Maul after becoming leader of <b>Death</b> <b>Watch,</b> killing Savage Opress before torturing Maul with the intent to make use of him. In the final season, Sidious goes to lengths to conceal the full nature of his plan from the Jedi by attempting to silence the Clone Trooper Fives when he learns of Order 66 and having Dooku wipe out anything tied to Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} of a Saxon church on the site before the Norman Conquest. In 118790 Adam de Dutton founded a priory on the site for Norbertine canons but this was short-lived and there is now {{no trace of the}} priory. It is likely that the building of the present church began {{in the middle of the}} 13th century. Towards the end of the 16th century, the chancel area was remodelled and a pulpit, altar rails and communion table were installed. In 1645 the church was extensively altered and extended. The south and west walls of the nave were rebuilt and the roof of the nave was lowered. A small chapel and vestry with a stone foundation and timber framed wall were added to the south side of the chancel, while a stone extension was added to the north side. In 1711 the east end of the chancel was rebuilt and a brick tower was added at the east end of the church. In 1722 a gallery was built. Wooden floors were installed in 1813, the vestry was incorporated into the church and a new vestry was built onto the south side of the tower. In 1857 the chancel floor was tiled, the walls were painted with medieval designs and the timber supports and the chancel ceiling were plastered. Stained glass was added to windows and the gallery was removed. By 1880 the church needed major repairs, and because of this the new church was built and the old church ceased to be the parish church. Repairs were undertaken in 1894 for dry rot, in 1927 for <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> beetle and in 1958, again for <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> beetle. In 1971 the church passed into the care of the Redundant Churches Fund, the predecessor of the Churches Conservation Trust.|$|E

Parsons' attorney said he believed his client chose this meal because the Burger King slogan [...] "Have it your way" [...] was a reflection of him taking control of his life. After playing a game of Uno, he asked for the score of the 1999 American League Championship Series game. Parsons was permitted to call his mother Marie Gordon Rivera in Florida and his sister.|$|E

500|$|The {{millstones}} {{were removed}} from the stone floor, which was then repaired. One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by <b>Death</b> <b>Watch</b> beetles, and over a third of the elm beam was replaced with oak. The six supports for the hurst frame were repaired one at a time, as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above. One post required replacement. It had rotted and the floor had sunk by [...] causing the second main floor beam to fracture. When this work had been completed, the stone floor was removed, including the second main floor beam, which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed.|$|E

500|$|The library holds 11,000 {{antiquarian}} {{printed books}} and houses {{many of the}} college's rare texts, including a Greek bible dating from 1545 and signed by Philipp Melanchthon and others, much of the library of the scholar and philosopher Lord Herbert of Cherbury and 17th-century volumes by Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton. The library also holds the undergraduate thesis of T. E. Lawrence ("Lawrence of Arabia"), entitled [...] "The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture {{to the end of}} XIIth Century". The college launched a restoration appeal in 2007 for work that was anticipated to cost £700,000. The roof was leaking, the floorboards had been affected by dry rot and <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> beetle, and new heating and ultra-violet light controls were needed to help preserve the books. The work to remedy these problems, and others, was completed in 2008.|$|E

500|$|The {{house and}} estate {{continued}} to be owned by the Leicester family until the death of Lt.Col.John Leicester Warren in 1975. [...] The first request in his will was that the estate should if possible be taken into {{the care of the}} National Trust, but this was declined by the Trust. [...] The executors then acted on Warren's second request, to pass the estate to a charitable institution, and thus it came into the care of the Victoria University of Manchester. [...] By the time of Warren's death the manor of Nether Tabley, comprising the estate and the halls, had been owned by the Leicester family for almost exactly 700years. [...] Col. Leicester-Warren used the house as a school from the late 1940s until 1984, after his death. In 1988 a 125year lease of the house, the stables, and the associated buildings was sold by the university to Cygnet Health Care, on condition that the suite of rooms {{on the first floor of}} the house, and their contents, should be preserved. [...] Between 1988 and 1990 the health care company carried out structural repairs to deal with damage caused by dry rot and the <b>death</b> <b>watch</b> beetle. [...] The ground and top floors of the house, and the wings, have been converted into nursing accommodation, leaving the appearance of the exterior virtually unchanged. [...] In 1990 the first floor was opened to the public under the care of the Tabley House Collection Trust. [...] The original entrance by the stairway on the south front was re-instated for this purpose.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} church {{goes back to the}} 7thcentury. The present church is believed to be built on the site where Plegmund, later Archbishop of Canterbury, lived as a hermit in the 9th century. The surrounding land used to be a marsh and the church stands in a slightly elevated area which was known as [...] "The Isle of Chester". [...] The original church was built in the 12thcentury but the present building dates mostly from the 15thcentury. [...] This was financed by the Trafford family who lived locally. [...] A tower was added at the west end in 1826. [...] Inscriptions in the church show that there were restorations in 1684, 1711, 1802–03 and 1819. [...] <b>Death</b> <b>watch</b> beetle was found in some roof rafters and the church was re-roofed in 1958. [...] Electric light was installed in the church in 1966 and central hearing was installed in 1968. [...] Since then a toilet and an entrance for disabled people have been built on to the vestry on the north side. [...] In 2006 new lighting was fitted in the church. [...] The pews were removed from the Barnston Chapel and replaced by modern chairs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938 some {{restoration}} {{was undertaken}} by volunteer labour, organised by Captain Berry. In the 1960s, {{a small group}} of mill enthusiasts raised enough money to enable the mill to be made structurally safe. The mill was given to the Hertfordshire Building Preservation Trust in 1967 by the owner George Turner of Cottered. Building work carried out J. A. Elliott Ltd of Bishops Stortford included replacing some beams, and reboarding the mill and roundhouse roof. New stocks and sails, and a new set of rear steps were made by E. Hole and Sons, the Burgess Hill millwrights. The restoration took place between 1967 and 1969. Further structural repairs were carried out in 1979, including work to prevent infestation by <b>Death</b> <b>Watch</b> beetles. By 1988, the mill was again in need of attention. There was an unrealised proposal to use a helicopter to move the mill to a new site near Letchworth. In 1990, further restoration work carried out by Dorothea Restorations Ltd of Bristol included a new weather beam, rebuilding the brake wheel and repairing and refitting the sails. Further work funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage enabled the mill to be returned to working order in 1998. The mill was officially reopened on 21 June 1998 by Richard Whitmore ...|$|E

I could almost hear the beating of my own heart, and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became agonizing. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.|$|E
