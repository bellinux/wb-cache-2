5000|$|While {{there was}} mining of coal {{in the area}} on a small scale, {{the late eighteenth century}} saw an {{expansion}} in activity, particularly after the industrialist John [...] "Iron-Mad" [...] Wilkinson purchased Brymbo Hall and began developing its estate, mining coal and ironstone and building an ironworks which was later to become the Brymbo Steelworks. By 1821 there was a total of 41 coal pits on the Brymbo Hall estate alone. In the nineteenth century, a number of larger deep mines were sunk around the area, and the majority of the village of Brymbo was developed as accommodation for the miners and ironworkers. The village itself was constructed on and around the steep sides of Brymbo Hill with spectacular views towards the Cheshire Plain, though the area's dramatic topography was later to cause problems when the steelworks expanded in 1956: the new parts had to be built on a vast artificial plateau of slag from the <b>furnaces,</b> <b>filling</b> the width of the valley and burying most of the village of Lodge, whose houses were purchased and demolished.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} relieve {{stresses}} from cold drawing and to regain ductility, steel wires are annealed in furnaces under prolonged exposure to an appropriate temperature termed as ‘soaking’. This ensures {{the attainment of}} the required product quality. Literature suggests that the annealing processes are still determined {{by trial and error}} approach {{due to a lack of}} standards and also due to the proprietary nature of furnace designs. This paper investigates the heat transfer mechanism in a 12 -metre long tube <b>furnace</b> <b>filled</b> with an inert gas and through which a cold-rolled steel wire travels at a specified speed. The length of the furnace is divided into three regions i. e. heating zone, soaking zone and cooling zone of which the heating and the cooling zones are given special attention. The methodology involves the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics by coupling both solid (steel wire) and gaseous zones (Hydrogen or Nitrogen). Radiation has been incorporated via a suitable model and convection taken care of by considering laminar flow of gases. The results suggest that the time needed in the heating zone is influenced by the choices of the surrounding atmosphere, speeds of gas and of the wire. These factors have an impact on the wire drawing speed and eventually on the overall productivity. It is also implied that the proposed numerical method may be used to shorten the ‘soaking’ time and hence to reduce energy consumption. The work demonstrates the usefulness of CFD in understanding and optimisation of the transfer process as well as highlights the challenges associated with numerical results...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} experimental studies of the conditions for CeS formations during manufacturing of Ce-S/Ce-S-Al/Ce-S-Al-Fe based grain refiners for steels. The thesis is divided into five parts. Part I gives a general introduction {{to the concept of}} steel grain refinement by means of heterogeneous nucleation of acicular ferrite at non-metallic inclusions during the austenite to ferrite transformation. In Part II the conditions for cerium oxide and oxysulphide formation during manufacturing of CeS-based grain refiners for steel have been examined. The small vacuum furnace used in these laboratory experiments is equipped with a graphite heating element, where both the temperature-time programme and the partial pressure of oxygen can be accurately controlled and monitored throughout the melting trials. The results from the optical and electron microprobe examinations of the as-solidified samples show that the liquid Ce-S-Fe-Al melt is prone to oxidation up to about 1600 to 1800 ˚C before the graphite heating element starts to act as an effective oxygen scavenger. The oxidation leads to conversion of CeS to Ce 2 O 2 S, which is an undesirable microconstituent in the grain refiners. In practice, the problem can be overcome by the use of rapid heating of the melt, which in the present small-scale laboratory experiments needs to be as high as 1000 ˚C/min in order to kinetically suppress the oxygen absorption from the shielding gas. In Part III the phase relations within the Ce-Al-Fe-S system have been clarified, using a combination of optical microscopy and WDS microprobe analyses. As a starting point highpurity charge materials of cerium, aluminium and FeS 2 are melted and superheated to about 2000 ˚C within small tantalum crucibles inside a dedicated laboratory <b>furnace</b> <b>filled</b> with cleaned argon. The phases detected in the as-solidified samples were CeS, Ce 3 Al, Fe 2 Ce and γ-Ce, along with Ce 2 O 2 S, which is an undesirable microconstituent in CeS-based grain refiners. It is concluded that FeS 2 {{can be used as a}} sulphur source for addition up to about 4 wt% sulphur. At higher levels the Fe-Ta interaction becomes so vigorous that tantalum no longer acts as an inert refractory metal and wetting becomes a major problem. In contrast, aluminium is an essential alloying element in the sense that it prevents the grain refiners from disintegrating in contact with air due to internal oxidation of free cerium by promoting the formation of Ce 3 Al. In Part IV the phase relations within the Ce-S-Al system have been clarified, using a combination of optical microscopy and WDS microprobe analyses. As a starting point high purity charge materials of cerium, aluminium and Ce 2 S 3 were melted and superheated to about 2000 ˚C within small tantalum crucibles inside a dedicated laboratory <b>furnace</b> <b>filled</b> with cleaned argon. The main constituent phases detected in the as-solidified samples are CeS, Ce 3 Al, CeAl and γ-Ce, where the CeS phase constitutes a discontinuous dendritic network within the grain refiners. The melting experiments show that pure cerium can dissolve about 6 wt% of sulphur at 2000 oC which drops to approximately 1. 8 wt% at 1500 oC. The measured sulphur solubility is considerable lower than that inferred from the existing binary Ce-S phase diagram, which therefore should be revised to comply with these new measurements. Because alloying with aluminium reduces the sulphur solubility in liquid cerium, the addition of this element should be restricted if a high volume fraction of CeS is desired in the grain refiners. At the same time the use of Ce 2 S 3 as a sulphur source in replacement of pyrite (FeS 2) means that aluminium is not actually needed to prevent the grain refiners from disintegrating in contact with air due to internal oxidation. Finally, in Part V up-scaled production of the CeS-based grain refiners has been attempted. As a starting point, batches of about 0. 5 kg are made from high purity charge materials of γ-Ce and Ce 2 S 3 within a suitable molybdenum crucible using an inductive heating chamber <b>furnace</b> <b>filled</b> with pure argon. Following casting in a water-cooled copper mould, the main phases observed in the as-solidified samples are γ-Ce and CeS. Also some Ce 2 O 2 S could be detected, but the amount is small, meaning that oxygen pick-up is not a major problem in these up-scaled melting experiments. Furthermore, attempts have been made to re-melt and rapidly solidify one of the produced grain refiners using melt spinning. The experiments show that a fine distribution of spherical-shaped CeS particles with a mean diameter close to 1 µm can be produced by means of this technique. This size is deemed to be optimal with respect to nucleation of acicular ferrite in steels during the austenite to ferrite transformation. Finally, a new and improved production method for CeS-based grain refiners has been suggested, which allows large quantities of materials to be melted, superheated and rapidly quenched in a single batch operation. The idea here is to use gas atomization as the main quenching technique for liquid cerium instead of melt spinning in combination with induction heating and bottom tapping of the crucible.

The gassolid flow behaviour inside the bed was described using the Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model. The momentum exchange coefficients between the gas phase and solid particles were described by the Syamlal and O’Brien drag model equations. The CFD transient simulations were run for 350 seconds at the optimum operating conditions of the used fluidized bed with bed temperature of 850 °C.

These composites feature a specific gravity of about 3. 45 grams per cubic centimeter and specific strengths of about 200 MPa/(grams per cubic centimeter). The room-temperature tensile strength is 100 ksi (689 MPa) and stiffness is 30 Msi (206 GPa). At 500 F (260 C), these composites have shown 80 percent retention in strength and 95 percent retention in stiffness. These materials also have excellent fatigue tolerance and tribological properties.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{characterized}} the path loss properties in industrial environments. However {{most of them}} have focused on one frequency, and some two or maximum three frequencies, usually cellular telephone frequencies or the unlicensed ISM bands that are commonly used in various industries. Few, if any, have characterized a larger part of the useable frequency range. This thesis is taking that challenge and investigates the path loss characteristics over a large frequency range, 300 MHz – 3 GHz, in industrial environments. First a measurement system suitable for the harsh environments found in industries is designed and verified. The measurement system is designed as two asynchronous stand-alone units that can be positioned at an arbitrary position to measure the path loss characteristics in any environment without interfering with the normal activities at the location. After that a measurement campaign involving three different types of environments is carried out. The environment types are: first, one highly absorbing – a paper warehouse at a paper mill; second, one highly reflective – a <b>furnace</b> building <b>filled</b> with metal objects and constructions and third, a mine tunnel – located 1 km below the surface of earth which is neither highly reflective nor absorbing but exhibits somewhat wave-guide like characteristics. The environments are shown to have very different behavior when it comes to propagation characteristics. Observations in the first environment reveal an environment that almost cancels out certain frequency bands and only line-of-sight communication is possible, hence no improvement will be achieved if installing systems that take multipath propagation into account, like MIMO. In the second environment reflections are legion; there are so many reflecting surfaces at different angles so any polarization of the signal is almost completely eliminated. Large fading variations were observed. The third environment is the underground mine where signals propagate inside the tunnels like in waveguides. It is shown that there are regions in the spectrum where the path loss dips and that these dips at least partly can be modeled with a simple two-beam propagation model normally used for outdoor propagation over infinite fields. The overall conclusion is that industrial environments are more heterogeneous regarding propagation characteristics than commonly assumed when selecting communication solutions. And {{that the only way to}} really know if a radio system will work at a certain location is to measure and characterize the environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a numerical simulation method for the calculation of an unsteady, three-dimensional flow and combustion phenomena in a packed bed of a furnace. The entire arrangement of a <b>furnace</b> partly <b>filled</b> with solid particles is separated into a gas phase and a solid phase. The gas flow within the void space between particles is approximated by flow through porous media according to Darcy's law. The outer flow region of the combustion chamber will be modelled as a laminar/turbulent viscous flow. Therefore a set of equations, i. e. continuity, momentum and energy equation including the homogeneous combustion between a gaseous fuel and air are applied to describe accurately the behaviour of the phenomena encountered. The motion of the solid phase, as a flow of one particle past another, is accounted for by particle-to-particle friction. As heating up and combustion of particles significantly changes their size, temeprature and composition this behaviour is treated by a special particle modelling step. It takes into account a size reduction due to heterogeneous combustion, non-uniform temperature distribution due to internal heat generation and both convective and radiative heat transfer within the gas phase and the solid phase, and a varying composition due to pyrolysation and gasification. Similar to the gas phase, a set of conservation equations applied to particles yields the solution for the relevant variables. The sets of equations for both the solid and the gas phases will be solved by a time-marching finite volume approach on an unstructured computational mesh with arbitrarily shaped cells. This novelty enhances body fitted meshing and resolution of high gradient domains. An efficient non-iterative solution algorithm is employed, which allows the size of the computational time step to be controlled solely by accuracy, rather than numerical stability, considerations in the interest of economy. The method is assessed by application to two different furnace geometries, for which a wide range of experimental data, e. g. temperature, flow rates, and species measurements are available. (orig.) Innerhalb des vorliegenden Berichts wird eine numerische Simulationsmethode vorgestellt, um die instationaere, dreidimensionale Stroemung und Verbrennung von Partikeln in einem Festbett eines Ofens zu berechnen. Die Anordnung besteht aus einem Verbrennungsraum, der teilweise mit Feststoffpartikeln gefuellt ist. Die Stroemung in den Freiraeumen zwischen den Partikeln wird als Stroemung durch ein poroeses Medium beschrieben, auf die das Gesetz von Darcy angewendet werden kann. Der verbleibende gasfoermige Verbrennungsraum wird als laminare/turbulente, reibungsbehaftete Stroemung simuliert und kann durch die Kontinuitaets-, Impuls- und Energiegleichung einschliesslich homogener Verbrennung zwischen einem gasfoermigen Brennstoff und Luft beschrieben werden. Die Bewegung der Feststoffpartikel resultiert aus einer Bilanz zwischen Reibungskraeften an den Beruehrungspunkten der Partikel und von aussen einwirkenden Kraeften. Da waehrend der Aufheizphase und hauptsaechlich waehrend der Verbrennung Partikel sich ihre Groesse, Temperatur und Zusammensetzung aendern, wurde ein effizientes Verfahren zur Beschreibung dieser Parameter entwickelt. Damit wird der Masseverlust durch Verbrennung, ungleichmaessige Temperaturverteilung als Folge von Waermefreisetzung und Waermetransport hervorgerufen durch Konvektion und Waermestrahlung als auch die sich aendernde Zusammensetzung mit fortschreitender Pyrolyse und Vergasung erfasst. Analog zur Gasphase werden auch hier Kontinuitaets-, Impuls- und Energiegleichung zur Loesung der relevanten Variablen benutzt. Die Gleichungen sowohl fuer die Gas-als auch die Feststoffphase werden auf einem unstrukturierten Gitter mit beliebiger Zellgeometrie mit einer instationaeren Finite-Volumen-Methode geloest. Dieser Ansatz ermoeglicht koerperangepasste Gitter und die Aufloesung von Gebieten mit hohen Gradienten. Ein nicht-iterativer Algorithmus, bei dem der Zeischritt nur durch numerische Genauigkeit und nicht durch Stabilitaetskriterien bestimmt wird, ermoeglicht oeknomische Rechenzeiten. Berechnungen mit dem Modell werden an zwei verschiedenen Ofengeometrien durchgefuehrt, fuer welche eine grosse Anzahl experimenteller Daten wie Temperatur, Massestroeme und Konzentrationsmessungen vorliegen.
