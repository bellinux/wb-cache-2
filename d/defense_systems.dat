5|$|In {{addition}} to legislative reform, the breaching of coastal flood <b>defense</b> <b>systems</b> during Vera prompted a redesign of such mechanisms. In Nagoya, regulation {{was created for}} coastal construction and their heights. Development of flood defenses in Ise, Osaka, and Tokyo bays was also set into motion. The heights of such <b>defense</b> <b>systems</b> were based on worst-case scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by the typhoon.|$|E

5|$|Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition {{launched}} a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air <b>defense</b> <b>systems</b> and effectively destroyed the Iraqi Air Force, whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level {{of an estimated}} 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On {{the third day of}} the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.|$|E

5|$|Ustilago maydis is a {{pathogenic}} plant fungus {{that causes}} smut disease in maize and teosinte. Plants have evolved efficient <b>defense</b> <b>systems</b> against pathogenic microbes such as U. maydis. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the oxidative burst where the plant produces {{reactive oxygen species}} {{at the site of}} the attempted invasion. U. maydis can respond to the oxidative burst with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant’s oxidative defensive response to infection.|$|E
40|$|As malware attacks {{become more}} popular in mobile {{handsets}} formed Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN), deploying an efficient <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> {{for helping the}} infected nodes to kill the malwares is important to prevent serious spreading and outbreak. In reality, the handset devices are heterogeneous in terms of operate systems, the malwares infect the targeted system in any opportunistic ways via local and global connectivity, while the to-be-deployed <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> is usually resource-limited. These points makes this problem technically challenging. In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal malware <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> deployment with realistic assumptions that specific types of malwares can only infect the targeted system and {{the capacity of the}} <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> is limited, which are usually ignored in previous analytical work for simplicity reason. Based on the proposed framework of optimizing the anti-malware software allocation for the <b>defense</b> <b>system,</b> we give a greedy algorithm to obtain the optimal solution...|$|R

5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic <b>defense</b> <b>systems</b> of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E
5|$|The 12th Battalion is {{unexpectedly}} attacked {{soon after}} by Intelligent <b>Defense</b> <b>Systems,</b> a private military contractor that had secretly supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them with {{weapons of mass}} destruction. Dr. Caulder, leader of the IDS, had taken advantage of the world's devastation to carry out horrific biological and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new disease called the Creeper, which causes flowers to bloom from infected individuals, {{for the sole purpose of}} studying the survivor's reactions. Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and its massive bomber, the Great Owl, the battalion survives and infiltrates and brings down The Great Owl, eventually pursuing Caulder to his main laboratory and fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of his lab, and the war is finally brought to an end. One year later, the village of New Hope, founded by the 12th Battalion after the conflict, begins to flourish in the new-found peace. The sun is seen rising above the nearby hills for the first time since the meteor strikes, giving hope of a brighter future.|$|E
