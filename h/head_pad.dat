50|$|The <b>head</b> <b>pad</b> {{can bring}} the head too far forward for the side panels to fully {{immobilize}} it. Care {{must be taken to}} secure the head properly to maintain neutral immobilization. If the head is too far forward, the head is brought back to meet the K.E.D. unless crepitus, pain or resistance is met. If these symptoms are present, the head is immobilized in the position found.|$|E
50|$|The figure {{shows the}} {{cross section of}} a Flat No lead package with a lead frame and wire bonding. There {{are two types of}} body designs, punch {{singulation}} and saw singulation. Saw singulation cuts a large set of packages in parts. In punch singulation, a single package is moulded into shape. The cross section shows a saw-singulated body with an attached thermal <b>head</b> <b>pad.</b> The lead frame is made of copper alloy and a thermally conductive adhesive is used for attaching the silicon die to the thermal pad. The silicon die is electrically connected to the lead frame by 1-2 mil diameter gold wires.|$|E

Leaves are also soaked in water to soften them and made into rope by knotting them together. Dried leaves are split, plaited and made into water-carrying <b>head</b> <b>pads.</b> Leaves are also used for making mats, cincture pads and other articles. The peeled roots are pounded, made into suds and used for washing the head, wool garments and blankets.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{irrigation}} {{facilities in}} farms were damaged and destroyed, and agricultural lands were neglected. Livestock also was reduced to 65%, thus a scarcity of food resulted and thus, family <b>heads</b> <b>padded</b> the numbers of their family members to get more food, thus becoming hoarders. Due to this hoarding, prices rose and thus, President Osmena tried to solve this by prescribing the maximum prices for goods. However, in reality, the real market prices were way higher than those stated by Osmena's order. Due to this, people {{had no choice but to}} follow the higher prices set by profiteers, since money was already circulating.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Justin Koschitzke was {{rendered}} unconscious by Daniel Giansiracusa with a legal hip {{and shoulder}} after both players accidentally clashed heads. Koschitzke appeared {{not to be}} aware of the oncoming Giansiracusa bump. [...] However the AFL tribunal later cleared Giansiracusa of any wrongdoing. [...] Koschitzke was diagnosed with a fractured skull, and was expected to miss 4-6 weeks. The incident sparked a media circus in many parts of Australia. This intensified when Koschitzke later dramatically fainted during a television interview. Many immediately assumed it was connected to the bump and head injury, however subsequent brain scans found nothing abnormal. In future matches, Koschitzke wore a soft <b>head</b> <b>padding</b> to protect himself.|$|R

50|$|The helmet fitting process starts by {{measuring}} the player's head with calipers. Based on measurements taken, a helmet shell of the appropriate size and style is chosen. Then, padding is added {{to ensure that the}} helmet fits the player's <b>head.</b> <b>Padding</b> consists of both foam rubber pads and inflatable (air) pads. Both the top and side padding include inflatable bladders that customize the fit. Once the helmet is in place on the player's head, the inflater bulb is applied to two points {{on the outside of the}} helmet. The jaw pads are fitted to ensure that the lower part of the helmet is snug against the player's face. The helmets that most NFL teams use are remarkably light, and once the pads are in place, there is no movement or shifting on the player's head.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Trauma {{patients}} are customarily transported in the supine position {{to protect the}} spine. The Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure (ABCDE) principles clearly give priority to airways. In Norway, the lateral trauma position (LTP) was introduced in 2005. We investigated the implementation and current use of LTP in Norwegian Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Methods All ground and air EMS bases in Norway were included. Interviews were performed with ground and air EMS supervisors. Questionnaires were distributed to ground EMS personnel. Results Of 206 ground EMS supervisors, 201 answered; 75 % reported that LTP is used. In services using LTP, written protocols were present in 67 % and 73 % had provided training in LTP use. Questionnaires were distributed to 3, 025 ground EMS personnel. We received 1, 395 (46 %) valid questionnaires. LTP was known to 89 % of respondents, but only 59 % stated that they use it. Of the respondents using LTP, 77 % reported access to written protocols. Flexing of the top knee was reported by 78 %, 20 % flexed the bottom knee, 81 % used under <b>head</b> <b>padding.</b> Of 24 air EMS supervisors, 23 participated. LTP is used by 52 % of the services, one of these has a written protocol and three arrange training. Conclusions LTP is implemented and used {{in the majority of}} Norwegian EMS, despite little evidence as to its possible benefits and harms. How the patient is positioned in the LTP differs. More research on LTP is needed to confirm that its use is based on evidence that it is safe and effective. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Coolamons were {{traditionally}} used by Aboriginal {{women to}} carry water, fruits, nuts, {{as well as}} to cradle babies.

During his tenure at OU, he developed a lightweight football uniform consisting of foamed rubber <b>head</b> gear, knee <b>pads</b> and shin guards along with pants that ended three inches above the knee. This gear weighed approximately eight pounds, half of what the old style had weighed. He also built OU's fastest all-weather football field in his time.|$|R

Swimming was too slow; he jumped fiercely out of water at the red challenge, making a great splash and commotion.|$|R

2500|$|Safety arrows are {{designed}} to be used in various forms of reenactment combat, to reduce the risk when shot at people. These arrows may have heads that are very wide or padded. In combination with bows of restricted draw weight and draw length, these heads may reduce to acceptable levels the risks of shooting arrows at suitably armoured people. The parameters will vary depending on the specific rules being used and on the levels of risk felt acceptable to the participants.

40|$|College and NFL {{football}} teams are focusing {{their efforts on}} protecting players more than ever before. With the recent attention on concussions and the troubling long-term effects of head injuries, {{more research is needed}} to find ways to ensure players have the adequate protection. The helmets being used have a hard polycarbonate shell with four inner pads that fit tight to the player’s <b>head.</b> These <b>pads</b> are filled with air. The purpose of the testing and project is to find an ideal air pressure that helmets need to maintain in order to protect the player to the best of its ability. If anyone is going to play tackle football, it is critical to protect his or her brain and keep the helmet at the best pressure possible. The helmets will be dropped on seven different locations and the amount of shock will be recorded on each location and at ten different air pressures ranging between 0 - 3 psi. Graphs and tables will provide an easy solution for the collected data. The concluded information will be provided to the Cal Poly football team, as well as other teams in California...|$|R
