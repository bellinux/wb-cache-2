30|$|The {{timing of}} an {{inspection}} would impact {{the capability of}} detecting condensation issues. To continuously monitor changes in the environmental conditions and study their impacts on condensation problems, one can place <b>environmental</b> <b>sensors</b> on building interior surfaces and continuously monitor the relative humidity and also the surface and inside air temperatures. However, in practice, only a few <b>environmental</b> <b>sensors</b> could be placed per element. As such, considering the variations of thermal performance over surface areas, {{it is difficult to}} ensure if the surface condition measured by a few sensors is representative of the entirety of the building assemblies. Here, the proposed method has potential to provide a solution for selecting the proper locations of installing a limited number of <b>environmental</b> <b>sensors</b> for detecting condensation problems. As a complementary step, after detecting the condensation problems from the proposed one-time thermography-based method, the <b>environmental</b> <b>sensors</b> can be placed at the detected areas for continuous monitoring. This will allow proper positioning of a limited number of sensors and improves the efficiency of monitoring.|$|R

Due to undersea conditions (high salt concentrations, fluctuating temperatures and limited nutrient supply), the Navy may deploy MFCs with a mixture of salt-tolerant microorganisms. A mixture would allow for a more complete utilization of available nutrients. Shewanella oneidensis is their primary candidate, but may include other heat- and cold-tolerant Shewanella spp.|$|R
