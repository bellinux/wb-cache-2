50|$|Reverse {{power feeding}} (RPF) {{is a new}} {{technology}} being standardized by ETSI and the Broadband Forum TR-301. It allows sending power from the customer premises to a distribution point (DP), in order to power the <b>distribution</b> <b>point</b> <b>unit</b> (DPU). The DPU includes typically a DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM) that can support up to 24 users and an optical network terminator (ONT), which connects the DPU to a central office (CO) where the optical line terminator (OLT) is located. This topology as also known as fiber to the distribution point (FTTdp). RPF is a critical technology for the upgrade of VDSL2 subscribers to the new G.fast standard, which has a maximum range (at high speeds) of 250m. Given {{that only a small}} number of subscribers is located at a radius of 250m from a DPU, the number of DPUs required to deploy G.fast infrastructure greatly increases, compared to VDSL2 and older xDSL technologies. RPF reduces installation cost by removing the need to connect the DPU locally to the power grid, as well as the need to monitor its power consumption with a smart meter.|$|E
50|$|While {{this sort}} of {{installation}} is useful for individual dwellings, it is less useful in large multi-unit dwellings. Corning estimates that an apartment installation would require an average of twelve right angle turns between the <b>distribution</b> <b>point</b> and the <b>units.</b> Conventional fiber would lose the signal after one or two such bends, making it useless in this role. As {{is the case for}} individual homes, the fiber can be converted to copper for the last section of delivery, but the longer runs demand much higher performance, larger cable. Finding room to run these cables in an existing structure may not be possible.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{considers}} {{the approach to}} stationarity of a Markov process of birth and death on stochastic flows. The process takes values {{in the space of}} counting measures, so its stationary states are point processes representing equilibrium <b>distributions</b> of <b>points</b> of <b>unit</b> mass. Stationary states of Poisson equilibria are explored {{in the context of a}} very natural balance among rates of birth, motion and killing. The rate of convergence to a Poisson equilibrium is shown to decay at the rate at which a certain transient diffusion escapes finite sets; similar rates apply in the general case for which equilibrium is shown necessarily to be a Cox process with directing measure hinged on the integral of a discounted one-point motion on the flow...|$|R

40|$|Floating <b>point</b> <b>units</b> form an {{important}} component of many reconfigurable computing applications. The creation of floating <b>point</b> <b>units</b> under a collection of area, latency, and throughput constraints is {{an important}} consideration for system designers. Given the range of possible tradeoffs, most commercial or academic floating point libraries for FPGAs provide a small fraction of possible floating <b>point</b> <b>units.</b> In contrast, the floating unit generation approach outlined in this paper allows for the creation of more than 200 different floating <b>point</b> <b>units,</b> with differing area, throughput, and latency characteristics. These variations are supported through selection of a floating point architecture and the use of floating <b>point</b> <b>unit</b> pipelining. Each of these floating <b>point</b> <b>units</b> can be generated with a variable number of bits for the mantissa and the exponent. Given requirements on throughput, area and latency, our generation flow automatically chooses the proper algorithm and architecture to create a floating <b>point</b> <b>unit</b> which fulfills design requirements. Our approach is fully integrated into standard C++ using ASC, a stream compiler for FPGAs, and the underlying PAM-Blox II module generation environment [13]. The floating <b>point</b> <b>units</b> created by our approach are competitive in size and performance with ones created by commercial vendors...|$|R
