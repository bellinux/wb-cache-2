50|$|A <b>jig</b> <b>grinder</b> is {{a machine}} tool used for {{grinding}} complex shapes and holes where the highest degrees of accuracy and finish are required.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, {{working from}} {{engineering}} drawings developed by engineers and technologists, tool makers lay out (mark out) the design on {{the raw material}} (usually metal), then cut it to size and shape using manually controlled machine tools (such as lathes, milling machines, grinding machines, and <b>jig</b> <b>grinders),</b> power tools (such as die grinders and rotary tools), and hand tools (such as files and honing stones).|$|R
50|$|A pin chuck is a {{specialized}} chuck {{designed to hold}} small drills (less than 1 mm in diameter) {{that could not be}} held securely in a normal drill chuck. The drill is inserted into the pin chuck and tightened; the pin chuck has a shaft which is then inserted into the larger drill chuck to hold the drill securely. Pin chucks are also used with high-speed rotary tools other than drills, such as die <b>grinders</b> and <b>jig</b> <b>grinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Moore's {{father had}} founded the Moore Special Tool Company, of Bridgeport, a tool and die maker. This {{specialised}} in ultra high-precision machine tools, such as jig borers and <b>jig</b> <b>grinders.</b> Wayne {{went to work}} for this company in 1953 and in time became its president. In 1970 he authored the book, Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy which is now seen as a standard text for the design of precise and stable machinery. He also became chairman of the National Machine Tool Builders Association (NMTB), the Acme United Corporation, and was a director of the American Precision Museum and the Bridgeport Engineering Institute.|$|R
50|$|The <b>jig</b> <b>grinder</b> is {{very similar}} to a jig borer, in that the table {{positioning}} and spindles are very accurate (far more so than a manual milling machine or lathe). It is almost exclusively used by tool and die makers in the creation of jigs or mating holes and pegs on dies. There are usually many peripheral elements to a large <b>jig</b> <b>grinder,</b> including separate hydraulic motors, air compressors, and various cooling systems for both the hydraulic circuit and supplying coolant to the work and machine itself.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Jig</b> <b>grinder,</b> {{which as}} the name implies, {{has a variety of}} uses when {{finishing}} jigs, dies, and fixtures. Its primary function is in the realm of grinding holes for drill bushings and grinding pins. It can also be used for complex surface grinding to finish work started on a mill.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of the drill bit sharpening <b>jigs</b> for bench <b>grinder.</b> The objective of this thesis is to design the drill bit sharpener jig that enhance the better outcome rather than manual sharpening operation. The thesis follows with the development of the drill bit sharpening jig that can be attached to the bench grinder. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of drill bit sharpening jig was developed using the computer-aided drawing software which is CATIA V 5 R 21. The strategy of validation of the model design was developed. The generative part structural analysis was then performed using simulation in CATIA V 5 R 21 to detect the Von Mises distribution. The design and suitable material will be validated. The fabrication of the jig may undergoes in various machining process such as milling, turning, electrical discharge wirecut and grinding. The assembled part shall be tested on the bench grinder. Besides, several dull drill bits will be sharpen using the jig. These assessment results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage. Further analysis will be conducted by testing the drilling process on the workpiece. The resharpen drill bits and the new drill bits will results on the difference surface roughness. Thus, the surface roughness analysis is performed to distinguish hole surface roughness outcomes for both drill bits. The results shows the difference of surface roughness between both hole surface is small and insignificant. Thus, it means that the outcomes is relatively same. The jig can also significantly reduce the cost and time to market, and improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|R
50|$|Jig borers {{are limited}} to working {{materials}} that are still soft enough to be bored. Often a jig is hardened; for a jig borer this requires the material to be bored first and then hardened, which may introduce distortion. The <b>jig</b> <b>grinder</b> was developed as a machine with the precision of the jig borer, but capable of working materials in their hardened state.|$|E

Diamond mounted points are tiny diamond rasps {{for use in}} a <b>jig</b> <b>grinder</b> doing profiling work in hard material. Resin and vitrified bonded mounted points with conventional grains are used for deburring applications, especially in the foundry industry.Mounted points is a small handle with a general name, used in electric mill, hanging mill, hand drill. Many of the main types of ceramic mounted points, rubber mounted points, diamond mounted points, emery cloth and so on.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} factor on a <b>jig</b> <b>grinder</b> is the dual-spindle configuration. The main spindle is roughly positioned with between 1" [...] or 2" [...] of travel for setup, and then the [...]100" [...] of outfeed is used during machine operation to outfeed into the work. A spacer bar may be used between the grinder and main spindle, allowing large (9" [...] radius or larger) work to be completed. The main spindle has {{a wide range of}} speeds to ensure proper grinder feed rates are maintained.|$|E
5000|$|The machine {{operates}} by a {{high speed}} air spindle rotating a grinding bit. The air spindles are removable and interchangeable to achieve varying surface speeds. Some spindles are fixed speed (60000 rpm), others are adjustable (30000-50000 rpm), and still others are very high speed (175000 rpm). The machines have a standard X-Y table with the notable exception of knee travel. All axes are indexed to [...]0001" [...] via a vernier scale on the handwheels, with higher accuracy available {{with the use of}} measuring bars. The machine head has two vertical travels, one rough head adjustment and the other a precise spindle adjustment. The spindle to which the detachable air spindle mounts also rotates at a variable speed and can typically outfeed [...]100" [...] while running, again with an accuracy of [...]0001" [...] on the handwheel or greater, for very precise hole, peg and surface grinding. A well-kept <b>jig</b> <b>grinder</b> will reliably position work to a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with handwheels alone. These features are all critical in positioning a hole and peg system a precise distance from a reference surface or edge.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work was primarily concentrated on precise ductile-mode grinding (milling) of flat surfaces of silicon, mainly Integrated Circuit (IC) silicon chips (dies), which were about 700 Âµm thick {{and the top}} of their surfaces covered with a silicon nitride layer. Substantial amount of partial-ductile streaks on a machined silicon surface shortens polishing time dramatically. This is of vital importance particularly in chip-making and optical industries for failure analysis. Failure analysis is a technique usually practised for locating a fault in a finished IC product. In chip-making industries, the analysis is done on the damage-free mirror-like finished silicon die of the IC. Grinding, lapping and/or polishing operations are required to get such a smooth surface. Precision grinding in a ductile mode therefore remains the critical and most important machining operation as the surface and sub-surface damages will be minimized. This results in good quality surface in terms of surface finish and flatness {{and at the same time}} generating the maximum amount of ductile streaks on the machined surface. Silicon material other than the IC silicon was also tried out for purpose of comparison and because of limited number of IC chips. Silicon like any hard and brittle material is well known for its low machinability unless it is machined under ductile mode condition. Ductile mode machining is a process that makes brittle materials to behave like ductile materials. A low cost machining technique, which facilitates partial-ductile mode grinding of small areas on thin wafer-like silicon, was developed. A specially modified conventional MAHO CNC Vertical Milling Centre that has an air driven low powered high-speed attachment (precision <b>jig</b> <b>grinder)</b> facilitated the diamond grinding. Special fixtures were designed and fabricated that held the workpieces in position and prevented them from damage during machining. Both traditional and statistical techniques for designing of experiments and subsequent analysis of results were employed in this study. A low cutting force dynamometer (Compacdyn) was used to measure cutting forces. Form Talysurf and Surfcom Surface Analysers and Atomic Force Microscope were used to measure surface texture parameters. Optical, Scanning Electron microscopy techniques, together with the Surfcom Surface Analyser and Atomic Force Microscope, were used to examine the surface morphology of the machined silicon surfaces. It was found that the amount of ductile streaks generated on a work-piece surface was not only dependent on feed and depth of cut but also on the grit size of diamond abrasive. The machining technique of grinding yielded ground surfaces with Ra as low as 50 nm, and forces around 0. 8 Newton. Flatness of the machined surfaces is very good. A model of surface roughness (Ra) for precision grinding of thin silicon has been established...|$|E
40|$|Machining of {{hard and}} brittle {{materials}} always pose {{problems such as}} rough surface, cracks, subsurface damage and residual stresses mainly due to its brittle nature. Recent developments in cutting tool technology coupled with rigid ultraprecision machine tools {{have made it possible}} to machine hard and brittle materials like optical glass in ductile mode with crack free surfaces. However this technique is reported to be relatively slow and too expensive for manufacturing less precision products like ophthalmic lenses, which do not require extreme form accuracy. Though not possible to machine glass in fully ductile mode with conventional grinding, substantial amount of partial ductile mode areas generated on the ground surface is proven to reduce polishing time significantly to get mirror finish. In this study, resinoid bonded diamond pins, with and without a central hole were used to grind BK 7 optical glass. Plano grinding operation was carried out using a high-speed <b>jig</b> <b>grinder</b> air motor, which was attached to a vertical spindle CNC milling machine. Both wet and dry grinding operations were performed. In wet grinding, ductile-fracture areas and surface roughness of ground surface were investigated by varying grinding conditions. Diamond grinding pins with and without central hole were found to have an effect on surface finish and flatness on the ground surfaces. Central holed diamond pins produced better surface finish and were 5 times superior in flatness compared to surfaces ground with diamond pins without central hole. Subsequently, zero velocity effect that cause chips trapped underneath of diamond pins are completely eliminated. Insufficient coolant penetration into grinding zone and fixture rigidity were found to have contributed stalling marks. Applications of higher coolant flow rate of 5 litres/min together with a rigid pocket groove holder were successfully used to eliminate stalling and this set-up was used in subsequent experimental trials for ductile-fracture and surface roughness analysis. Maximum ductile streaks were obtained at the lowest feed (5 mm/min) and in-feed (5 Âµm) for both 64 Âµm and 126 Âµm grit diamond pins. Finer ductile streaks were observed with 64 Âµm than 126 Âµm grit diamond pins in almost all conditions probably due to grain size effects. An image processing procedure has been successfully developed to quantify objectively the fraction of ductile and fracture areas generated on ground surfaces. Among the four alternatives developed, method B provided the least error. A linear relationship model was established for surface roughness when grinding with 64 Âµm grit diamond pins. The feed was found to have significant effect on the response investigated. The model was verified by the confirmation run and therefore can be used for prediction within the limits of the factors investigated. In dry grinding, various types of chips morphology were observed. A discovery was made during this study, namely the observation of solid spherical glass chips obtained at the lowest cutting condition (feed = 2. 5 mm/min and infeed = 5 Âµm) and its formation mechanism is described. ...|$|E
