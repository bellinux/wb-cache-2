5|$|Flea {{phylogeny}} {{was long}} neglected, {{the discovery of}} homologies with the parts of other insects being made difficult by their extreme specialization. Whiting and colleagues prepared a detailed molecular phylogeny in 2008, with the basic structure shown in the cladogram.

5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or <b>jigger</b> (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.|$|E

25|$|Squid jiggers – have {{single or}} double drum <b>jigger</b> winches lined along the rails around the vessel. Strong lamps, up to 5000 W each, {{are used to}} attract the squid. These are {{arranged}} 50–60 centimetres apart, either as one row in {{the centre of the}} vessel, or two rows, one on each side. As the squid are caught they are transferred by chutes to the processing plant of the vessel. The jigging motion can be produced mechanically by the shape of the drum or electronically by adjustment to the winch motor. Squid jiggers are often used during the day as midwater trawlers and during the night as jiggers.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Tungiasis {{is caused}} by a flea, tunga penetrans/ <b>jiggers,</b> which enters the {{epidermis}} of humans/ animals. The skin gets painful and itchy, and if untreated, bacterial infection occurs. <b>Jiggers</b> are easily transmitted among the poor living in urban slums and in rural and fishing communities. Millions are at risk worldwide. Fighting <b>jiggers</b> remains NGOs’ task. Bungoma Red Cross, Kenya conducts removal clinics since 2005. The study’s aim was to explore experiences with fighting the vermin. Methodology: Qualitative participatory research was performed in Bungoma County during a two-month fieldwork. In-depth interviews, group discussions, observation and informal talks were conducted with: NGO- and public health workers; persons affected by <b>jiggers</b> and keyinformants (e. g. teachers). 19 health-facility informants and 36 community-based informants were interviewed. Results: Those infected feel tortured by multiple penetrations on hands and feet which are painful and physically disabling, resulting in work-incapacity and school drop-out. People feel stigmatized, neglected and dependent on assistance to remove the <b>jiggers.</b> Children and elders are particularly vulnerable. Different traditional and modern methods are used for removing/ eradicating the flea. There is confusion about effective approaches and guidelines are lacking. Where the attack rate was extreme, reoccurrence after treatment was apparently inevitable. Animals were not perceived as reservoirs of <b>jiggers.</b> The government did not seem to pay attention to this vermin affecting several communities, and NGOs/ Bungoma Red Cross feel they are left alone. The program is time consuming and costly, and lacks manpower and medicine. Collaboration with government health-workers is necessary to sensitize and follow up the community, yet they also lack resources. Conclusion: Tungiasis is a debilitating problem affecting individuals’ households, and increasing the vicious circle of poverty. High-prevalence communities need coordinated measures by the public health sector to combat re-occurrence and environmental infestation. Research on prevalence, prevention and treatment is needed...|$|R
50|$|Iggy is excitedly {{waiting with}} a {{fatigued}} <b>Jiggers</b> {{in the center}} of Mooseknuckle. He tells <b>Jiggers</b> that Manly Boarman, a famous Australian explorer whom he has idolized since childhood, is coming to explore the Kookamunga, and that Iggy has agreed to be his guide. When Manly arrives, he is immediately swarmed by bees from the press, who are anxious to photograph him at all opportunities. When he lands after parachuting from his plane, he greets Iggy and <b>Jiggers,</b> who then proceed to lead him around the park. However, Boarman has not been exploring lately; being more caught up in his celebrityhood and public image. As a result, he has lost touch with nature, and repeatedly falls into scrapes with the wildlife and the landmarks. After narrowly escaping Mount Kaboom while hang-gliding with Iggy, Manly deals with the reporters once again, while <b>Jiggers</b> points out Manly's problems to Iggy. Iggy then decides to help Manly get back in touch with nature by taking him to Mango Tango Beach, a small beach where a flock of violent, stampeding flamingoes lives. When there, Manly's mother calls him on his cellphone, which alarms the flamingoes, who then proceed to run him down. As they are heading in Mooseknuckle's direction, Iggy and <b>Jiggers</b> make a fence all around their path, leading the flamingoes back to the beach. At the end of Manly Boarman's expedition, he tells them that he has been reinspired to get back to nature, and forget about publicity.|$|R

50|$|Iggy and <b>Jiggers</b> {{return home}} from {{protecting}} the river {{during the rainy}} season, to find that amongst their mail from the past week is a letter that, due to a contract from the 1940s, {{there will be a}} highway built through the middle of Kookamunga National Park. They notice the petition available to contest this construction, and head to Mooseknuckle to collect signatures. When there, they explain the situation, and even Catfish Stu makes it a point to force everyone into signing when he finds out that the highway will not allow anyone to stop and book in at his Adventure Camp. However, the petition, which needs 200 signatures, is missing most of the requirements, so Iggy and <b>Jiggers</b> head all over the park gathering signatures from the residents and tourists; finally resorting to wild yaks' hoof prints when nothing else is available. They are then left with just one more signature, and Iggy suggests going to Spelvin, the hermit crab, for help. However, Spelvin says he'll need them to renovate his domain if he's to even consider it; and when they are done, he decides not to. Iggy realizes that he still hadn't signed, and does so; upon which <b>Jiggers</b> tyrades about how Spelvin also took his bottle-cap collection. Iggy cuts him off and tells him they must hurry back to give the full petition to Quilpie, the courier. While Zoop tries to delay the punctual kangaroo back at Mooseknuckle, Iggy and <b>Jiggers</b> narrowly escape a hungry panther, but make it back to Mooseknuckle by five o'clock, to deliver the petition. The episode ends with Zoop telling them that it's Tuesday, and since the petition was due Wednesday, <b>Jiggers</b> finishes his tantrum about losing his bottle-cap collection for nothing.|$|R

[...] According to Hayden, [...] "He does the one unpardonable thing, the thing we can't forgive. [...] It's a challenge for the audience to like him after that." [...] The Hytner Carousel was presented in Japan in May 1995.

50|$|Iggy Arbuckle {{began as}} a comic strip {{entitled}} Iggy Arbuckle: Nature Freak! that premiered in National Geographic Kids in the June 2004 issue. It was, to date, the only issue of the comic strip; in which the characters Iggy Arbuckle, <b>Jiggers</b> and Zoop made their first appearances. The plot involved Iggy and <b>Jiggers</b> trying to find an acorn so Iggy could make an acorn squash pie for Zoop as a birthday present.

5000|$|Iggy, <b>Jiggers,</b> Zoop and Spiff are at Zoop's store, {{playing a}} game called [...] "Tippy Canoe", in which they place various sweets and candies on a {{miniature}} boat, balanced on a pedestal. Kira comes in, and tells them that her business running the tourist kiosk has been going very slowly lately. She then asks if she can join in the game, but when <b>Jiggers</b> pulls a chair over for her, the chair knocks into the table, causing the boat to tip over, and the game to end. At that moment, Catfish Stu enters, putting up an advertisement in the window for a chef. Zoop offers, but he declines, knocking off her cooking until she kicks him out. Later, Iggy and <b>Jiggers</b> are walking home; <b>Jiggers</b> worrying that Kira feels left out {{from the rest of}} the gang, when a bluebird comes and eats at his blueberry muffin. Iggy finds it strange, as the bluebirds are supposed to eat juniper berries. The two head to Rattler's Pass, then canyon in which the juniper bushes grow, and find that they've been replaced with rubber lookalikes. Remembering that juniper berries are a gourmet ingredient in cooking, and remembering Catfish Stu's taste for gourmet food, they immediately become suspicious, and investigate. At Stu's Adventure Camp, they find a new building has been set up, with a skylight; a place likely to serve as a greenhouse. Stu, however, has hired a flock of geese to serve as guards. After recruiting everyone and giving them each an assignment (Spiff must distract the geese with his gossip, Zoop turns off the security alarm, Kira makes sandwiches for everyone, Iggy and <b>Jiggers</b> retrieve the bushes) they set off. When Iggy and <b>Jiggers</b> are inside, they find that Stu has placed poison ivy around the bushes. They try various ways to get the bushes without touching the ivy, but when their last attempt backfires, the alarm goes off unexpectedly. The next day Stu admonishes them and returns to his house, with his new chef. Everyone is downhearted that the bluebirds will have to go hungry, until Kira shows up with the bushes. She then reveals that she's taken up a nighttime job as a chef, working for Stu. Meanwhile, when Stu and the ferrets try to take back the bushes, the birds crowd around them and chase them down.|$|R
