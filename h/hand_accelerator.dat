50|$|The {{hand-operated}} {{gear and}} rear-wheel brake controls {{are on the}} driver's right {{but there is a}} door for the driver which there was not on the 30-98 or 25. The spark and throttle levers are on the steering wheel together with an air lever working a valve in the induction pipe (after the throttle). There is also a mixture control (choke) on the dash. Gear and brake levers are well to <b>hand.</b> <b>Accelerator</b> and (transmission) brake pedals were set close together.|$|E

50|$|Toyota {{supplied}} {{a vehicle}} which was temporarily outfitted with <b>hand</b> brake and <b>accelerator</b> ring (the car {{was equipped with}} an automatic transmission and did not require a clutch controller). As part of the agreement GO became an official sponsor of the race, hosting a trackside tent during the three-day event.|$|R
40|$|Operation {{with natural}} {{chromaticity}} in a linear nonscaling fixed field alternating gradient (FFAG) accelerator causes {{crossing of the}} low order resonances such as integer and half-integer. Although those resonances are not systematic ones, small errors, such as a typical misalignment of 10 [*][*]μm rms, significantly increase particle amplitude when the accelerator is operated with a slow acceleration rate. For example, there is practically no dynamic aperture if it takes 1000 turns to finish the whole acceleration cycle. Chromaticity correction with sextupole and octupole reduces the maximum available dynamic aperture in a lattice without errors. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>accelerator</b> becomes less sensitive to errors. To use a nonscaling FFAG for applications where, unlike a muon accelerator, the large acceptance is not a high priority demand (such as a proton driver or a particle therapy accelerator), chromaticity correction {{seems to be an}} essential ingredient...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{subjects}} with lower limb disabilities {{participated in a}} simulator study. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate how an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system together with two different <b>hand</b> controls for <b>accelerator</b> and brake influenced workload, comfort and driving behaviour and to further develop a method to evaluate vehicle adaptations for drivers with disabilities. The installed ACC system could maintain a constant speed selected and set by the driver and it also adapted speed in order to keep a safe distance to a leading vehicle. Furthermore, it included a stop-and-go function. Two common types of <b>hand</b> controls for <b>accelerator</b> and brake were used. The hand controls were different both with respect to function, single or dual levers, and position, on the steering column or between the front seats. The subjects were all experienced drivers of adapted cars equipped with hand controls. All subjects drove 100 km at two occasions, with and without the ACC system available but with the same hand control. Subjective workload was found to be significantly lower and performance better for the ACC condition. The difference in speed variation between manual and ACC supported driving increased with the distance driven which seems to support the previous finding. The subjects thought they could control both speed and distance to leading vehicles better while the ACC was available. ACC driving did not influence reaction time, speed level, lateral position or variation in lateral position. Headway during car following situations was shorter for the ACC condition compared to manual driving. The ACC was well received, trusted and wanted. It was concluded that the ACC system substantially decreased workload, increased comfort and did not influence safety negatively. The only difference found between the two types of hand controls was that drivers using the dual lever system had less variation in lateral position. The applied evaluation method proved to be useful but needs to be further developed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are {{relatively}} new and challenging research area for embedded design automation. Engineering a WSN node hardware {{is a difficult}} job as the design must satisfy several constraints. Among these constraints, overall energy consumption and node size, {{are the two most}} significant constraints. WSN node platforms have until recently been designed using off-the-shelf low-power microprocessors (MCUs), even though energy profile of these MCUs is not suitable for ultra low-power sensor nodes. On the other <b>hand,</b> WSN-specific hardware <b>accelerators</b> have also been proposed that have excellent energy profile but lack in flexibility, need higher design efforts and have huge non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs. In this work, we propose an automated system level design flow for an intermediate approach, based on the concept of data path merging (DPM) where several hardware accelerators (called micro-tasks) share a common customized data path, to have an improvement in flexibility and silicon area with possible increase in dynamic power consumption for the control/processing part of the sensor node targeted for field programmable gate array (FPGA) -based implementation. Our experiments show that component-level DPM yields to savings from 20 %, to 75 % for various FPGA resources like I/O ports, area for combinational and sequential logic, and static power consumption...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} the effect of bioglass (melting) -polyvinyl alcohol (BG (M) -PVA) and bioglass (melting) -polyvinyl alcohol- 20 %ciprofloxacin (BG(M) -PVA- 20 Cip) in improving antioxidant activity and regenerating bone capacity. These composites were implanted in femoral condyles of ovariectomized Wistar rats and {{compared to that of}} controls groups. After the different period of implantation (15, 30, 60 and 90 days), the treatment of ovariectomized rats with BG(M) -PVA- 20 Cip showed a significantly higher malondialdehyde concentration when compared to that of BG(M) -PVA group. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase in BG(M) -PVA- 20 Cip group showed significantly lower activities when compared to those in BG(M) -PVA group. So, BG(M) -PVA is more tolerated by organism than BG(M) -PVA- 20 Cip. Moreover, the alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase activities showed an excellent osteoinductive property of BG (M) -PVA. This property decreased with the presence of ciprofloxacin which is confirmed by histopathological analysis. Several physicochemical techniques showed a rapid reduction in Si and Na in one <b>hand</b> and an <b>accelerator</b> rise in Ca and P ions concentrations in other hand in BG(M) -PVA than in the BG(M) -PVA- 20 Cip. Therefore, the incorporation of ciprofloxacin in BG(M) -PVA is characterized by a prooxidant effect in oxidant–antioxidant balance at the beginning of treatment and a retard effect of formation of apatitic phas...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{management}} on accelerator based {{systems is}} complicated by the disjoint nature of the main CPU and accelerator, which involves separate memory hierarhcies, different degrees of parallelism, and relatively high cost of communicating between them. For applications with irregular parallelism, where work is dynamically created based on other computations, the accelerators may both consume and produce work. To maintain load balance, the <b>accelerators</b> <b>hand</b> work back to the CPU to be scheduled. In this paper we consider multiple approaches for such scheduling problems and use the Cell BE system to demonstrate the different schedulers and the trade-offs between them. Our evaluation is done with both microbenchmarks and two bioinformatics applications (PBPI and RAxML). Our baseline approach uses a standard Linux scheduler on the CPU, possibly with more than one process per CPU. We then consider the addition of cooperative scheduling to the Linux kernel and a user-level work-stealing approach. The two cooperative approaches are able to decrease SPE idle time, by 30 % and 70 %, respectively, relative to the baseline scheduler. In both cases we believe the changes required to application level codes, e. g., a program written with MPI processes that use accelerator based compute nodes, is reasonable, although the kernel level approach provides more generality and ease of implementation, but often less performance than work stealing approach...|$|R
