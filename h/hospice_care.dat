5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, <b>hospice</b> <b>care</b> {{is not seen}} as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for <b>hospice</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
5|$|The cost of <b>hospice</b> <b>care</b> may be met {{by health}} {{insurance}} providers, including Medicare or Medicaid for eligible Americans. Hospice is covered 100% with no co-pay or deductible by Medicare Part A except that patients are responsible for a copay for outpatient drugs and respite care, if needed. (Respite care may be necessary, for instance, if a family member who is providing home <b>hospice</b> <b>care</b> is briefly unable to perform his or her duties and an alternative care provider becomes necessary.) As of 2008, Medicare was responsible for around 80% of hospice payments, reimbursing providers differently from county to county with a higher rate for inpatient <b>hospice</b> <b>care.</b> A lower rate is paid for home care, with a higher rate paid for round-the-clock nursing care {{in order to get}} a patient's symptoms under control.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} {{aimed to explore}} the {{attitude}} and knowledge toward <b>hospice</b> palliative <b>care</b> among medical caregivers in Taiwan. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among medical staff attending a <b>hospice</b> palliative <b>care</b> conference. Results: Overall, 163 of 232 questionnaires were valid. Based on the results, 54. 9 % of opinions on who {{has the right to}} sign a <b>Hospice</b> Palliative <b>Care</b> Declaration for an autonomous patient was consistent with the Taiwan <b>Hospice</b> Palliative <b>Care</b> Article; 91. 4 % of opinions on whether a life-sustaining therapy has been authorized to withhold was consistent with the article, compared with only 28. 3 % of opinions on whether a life-sustaining therapy has been authorized to withdraw. The capability of medical staff to provide these three procedures was varied (Cochran's Q =  121. 150, p  32. 5 years (odds ratio =  0. 41; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 22 – 0. 90; p  9 years (odds ratio =  0. 52; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 27 – 0. 97; p <  0. 05) tended to approach patients' informed consent of <b>Hospice</b> Palliative <b>Care</b> Declaration precisely. Conclusion: Life and work experience improve the accuracy of medical staff in providing <b>hospice</b> palliative <b>care.</b> A culture-based, case-oriented continuing education program and a timely revision of the <b>Hospice</b> Palliative <b>Care</b> Article are recommended to increase the consistency between the principle and the practice of <b>hospice</b> palliative <b>care...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for <b>hospice</b> <b>care,</b> a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for <b>hospice</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hospice</b> <b>care</b> in the United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of end-of-life care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms. These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice {{as a place to}} treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. <b>Hospice</b> <b>care</b> was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of health care has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological needs in coming to terms with dying.|$|E
5|$|Some {{confusion}} {{still exists}} {{as to what}} treatments a patient may receive in <b>hospice</b> <b>care.</b> Hospices may provide treatments that have been traditionally regarded as curative, including radiation therapy or antibiotics, if these are administered to improve quality of life.

5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with <b>hospice</b> <b>care.</b> However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E

40|$|The author {{conducted}} this constructivist {{grounded theory}} study to describe perceptions, behaviors, and communication that <b>hospice</b> <b>caring</b> triads engage in while managing cancer pain, specifically how these social processes {{can be assessed}} and used to improve poorly-controlled pain. Three <b>hospice</b> <b>caring</b> triads comprised of patients, family caregivers, and nurses along with one nurse-patient dyad, were recruited into this longitudinal qualitative study. Each group was observed during nursing visits. Triad and dyad members were individually interviewed. Nurses participated in a focus group and survey. The author used constant comparative methods of data analysis, including line-by-line gerund coding, theoretical codes from cancer pain assessment standards, theoretical sampling of early codes, memo writing, and concept-mapping to raise codes into concepts and domains for a theoretical framework. Study trustworthiness included appropriate methodology to answer research questions, prolonged and repeated participant engagement, triangulation of content across participants, reflexive memos, and use of multiple data sources. Results were presented in a triadic case study comparing and contrasting the two cancer pain social processes domains related to pain control: Controlling Cancer Pain and Proximity. The first domain included perceptions of pain control, goals, and efficacy. The second domain included physical and emotional distance between triad members, presence of communication, and level of agreement. When triads were compared, one triad with close emotional and physical proximity had a shared perception of pain meaning and goals for control, and effective communication for pain management behaviors. The other triads had more physical and emotional distance, communication that was vague, and differing perceptions of pain control, pain meaning, or control goals. An important difference for these other triads {{was a lack of}} agreement about pain perception and pain severity, as well as vague communication about pain perception, with subsequent impact on pain goals. Controlling Cancer Pain and Proximity social processes are inextricable with cancer pain management for <b>hospice</b> <b>caring</b> triads. Assessment tools for proximity-related social processes which measure closeness, communication, and agreement among <b>hospice</b> <b>caring</b> triad members should be developed and tested for improving cases of poorly controlled pain. Development and testing of simple open-ended functional goal assessments is needed...|$|R

5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with level of care and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs.

50|$|During the 237 {{years of}} its {{existence}} the English Hospice received many thousands of pilgrims, {{one of the most}} famous being the saintly mystic, Margery Kempe, who visited in 1416. In 1481, 218 pilgrims stayed here, and during the plague of 1482 the <b>Hospice</b> <b>cared</b> for 96 sick pilgrims.

5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, <b>hospice</b> <b>care</b> {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E
5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive <b>hospice</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E

40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{information}} on <b>hospice</b> and palliative <b>care</b> provision in Africa and only a weak evidence base upon which to build policy and practice development. We set out to assess {{the current state of}} provision across the continent, mapping the existence of services country by country and exploring the perspectives and experiences of those involved. A multi-method review was conducted involving a synthesis of evidence from published and gray literature, ethnographic field visits to seven countries, qualitative interviews with 94 individuals from 14 countries, and the collation of existing public health data. Forty-seven African countries were reviewed, involving the assistance of numerous <b>hospice</b> and palliative <b>care</b> activists, including clinicians, managers, volunteers, policy makers, and staff of donor organizations. The 47 countries of Africa could be grouped into four categories: no identified <b>hospice</b> or palliative <b>care</b> activity (21 countries); capacity building activity is underway to promote <b>hospice</b> and palliative <b>care</b> delivery (11 countries); localized provision of <b>hospice</b> and palliative <b>care</b> is in place, often heavily supported by external donors (11 countries); and <b>hospice</b> and palliative <b>care</b> services are approaching some measure of integration with mainstream service providers and gaining wider policy recognition (four countries). Overall, services remain scattered and piecemeal in most African countries, and coverage is poor. Nongovernmental organizations are the predominant source of provision. Major difficulties relate to opioid availability, workforce development, and achieving sustainable critical mass. Models exist in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe for the development of affordable, sustainable community-based <b>hospice</b> and palliative <b>care</b> services, but sensitivity is required in adopting Western models of <b>hospice</b> and palliative <b>care</b> for implementation in the African cultural context.
