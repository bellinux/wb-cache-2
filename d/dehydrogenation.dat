5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In processes such as the <b>dehydrogenation</b> of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. <b>Dehydrogenation</b> of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is <b>dehydrogenation</b> of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} samarium {{and its compounds}} is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as well as the}} dehydration and <b>dehydrogenation</b> of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E

5000|$|Specifically, {{during the}} {{biosynthesis}} of PZN in B. amyloliquefaciens, a ribosomally-synthesized precursor peptide undergoes extensive post-translational modification, including cyclodehydrations and <b>dehydrogenations,</b> catalyzed by a trimeric enzyme complex. This process converts cysteine and serine/threonine residues into thiazole and (methyl)oxazole heterocycles [...] (as seen to the right).|$|R
50|$|PCET {{is thought}} to be {{pervasive}} in redox reactions that appear to be net hydrogenations and <b>dehydrogenations.</b> Relevant examples include water oxidation in photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and oxygen reduction in many pathways for respiration. Inorganic chemists often study simple reactions to test this mechanism, one example being the comproportionation of a Ru(II) aquo and a Ru(IV) oxo reactants: cis-(bipy)2(py)RuIV(O)2+ + cis-(bipy)2(py)RuII(OH2)2+ → 2cis-(bipy)2(py)RuIII(OH)2+PCET is also often invoked in electrochemical reactions where reduction is coupled to protonation or where oxidation is coupled to deprotonation.|$|R
5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of <b>dehydrogenation,</b> hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E
25|$|Cycloalkanes {{reported}} as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin. The <b>dehydrogenation</b> of cycloalkanes is highly endothermic (63-69 kJ/mol H2), which means this process requires high temperature. <b>Dehydrogenation</b> of decalin {{is the most}} thermodynamically favored among the three cycloalkanes, and methyl-cyclohexane is second {{because of the presence}} of the methyl group. Research on catalyst development for <b>dehydrogenation</b> of cycloalkanes has been carried out for decades. Nickel (Ni), Molybdenum (Mo) and Platinum (Pt) based catalysts are highly investigated for <b>dehydrogenation.</b> However, coking is still a big challenge for catalyst’s long-term stability.|$|E

50|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{provide a}} certain potential for metal-free catalysis of inorganic and organic reactions. For instance, oxygen groups {{attached to the}} surface of carbon nanotubes have the potential to catalyze oxidative <b>dehydrogenations</b> or selective oxidations. Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes may replace platinum catalysts used to reduce oxygen in fuel cells. A forest of vertically aligned nanotubes can reduce oxygen in alkaline solution more effectively than platinum, which has been used in such applications since the 1960s. Here, the nanotubes have the added benefit of not being subject to carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|R

The application of these membranes on a large scale is prohibited by the costs of the existing membranes, requiring membranes with a much higher permeability.

In particular, the FluoRuGel/O 2 system is well suited for carrying out convenient oxidative <b>dehydrogenations</b> in dense phase CO 2 smoothly affording high yields {{of a variety of}} structurally different aldehydes and ketones of high purity. The potential rewards of this new technology are numerous and go beyond simple elimination of both organic solvents and stoichiometric oxidants employed in traditional alcohol oxidations...|$|R

25|$|Both {{hydrogenation}} and <b>dehydrogenation</b> of LOHCs requires catalysts. It {{was demonstrated}} that replacing hydrocarbons by hetero-atoms, like N, O etc. improves reversible de/hydrogenation properties. The temperature required for hydrogenation and <b>dehydrogenation</b> of drops significantly with {{increasing numbers of}} heteroatoms. Among all the N-heterocycles, the saturated-unsaturated pair of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (12H-NEC) and NEC has been considered as a promising candidate for hydrogen storage with a fairly large hydrogen content (5.8wt%). The figure on the top right shows <b>dehydrogenation</b> and hydrogenation of the 12H-NEC and NEC pair. The standard catalyst for NEC to 12H-NEC is Ru and Rh based. The selectivity of hydrogenation can reach 97% at 7 MPa and 130°C-150°C. Although N-Heterocyles can optimize the unfavorable thermodynamic properties of cycloalkanes, {{a lot of issues}} remain unsolved, such as high cost, high toxicity and kinetic barriers etc.|$|E

Determination of the long-sought oxidized desaturase crystal structure facilitated structural comparison of the active sites of disparate diiron enzymes. Experiments on the castor desaturase are discussed that provide experimental support for a hypothesized ancestral oxidase enzyme in the context of the evolution of the diiron enzyme diverse functionality.

40|$|An {{approach}} is developed for constructing models of ancient organisms using data from metabolic pathways, genetic organization, chemical structure, and enzymatic reaction mechanisms found in contemporary organisms. This {{approach is}} illustrated by a partial reconstruction of {{a model for the}} "breakthrough organism," the last organism to use RNA as the sole genetically encoded biological catalyst. As reconstructed here, this organism had a complex metabolism that included <b>dehydrogenations,</b> transmethylations, carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions, and an energy metabolism based on phosphate esters. Furthermore, the breakthrough organism probably used DNA to store genetic information, biosynthesized porphyrins, and used terpenes as its major lipid component.

This form of reactive DESI experiment can be utilized as an in situ derivatization method for rapid and direct analysis of alkanes at atmospheric pressure without sample preparation. Betaine aldehyde was incorporated into the DESI spray solution to improve the sensitivity of detecting the long-chain alcohol oxidation products. The limit of detection for alkanes (C 15 H 32 to C 30 H 62) from pure samples is ∼ 20 ng. Multiple oxidations and <b>dehydrogenations</b> occurred during the DESI discharge, but no hydrocarbon fragmentation was observed, even for highly branched squalane.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Herein, we {{describe}} the synthesis and characterization (chemical, structural, and thermal) of a new crystal phase of lithium hydrazinidoborane (LiN 2 H 4 BH 3, LiHB), which is a new material for solid-state chemical hydrogen storage. We put in evidence that lithium hydrazinidoborane is a polymorphic material, with a stable low-temperature phase and a metastable high-temperature phase. The former is called β-LiHB and the latter α-LiHB. Results from DSC and XRD showed that the transition phase occurs at around 90 °C. On this basis, the crystal structure of the novel β-LiHB phase was solved.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{was investigated}} {{with regard to}} a detailed prediction of the lifetime of this material {{as a catalyst for}} oxidative <b>dehydrogenations.</b> A power-law kinetics is found to be adequate for the description of CO 2 formation in the temperature range of 623 − 823 K and under O 2 partial pressures of 0. 025 − 0. 6 bar. The stability against oxidation can be enhanced by passivation with B 2 O 3 or P 2 O 5 and by high temperature treatment. The progress of oxidative degradation was monitored by TEM and Raman spectroscopy. A mechanistic study supported by high pressure XPS and SSITKA reveals full agreement with the established model of the oxidation of conventional carbon materials; however, the theory of sequential layer degradation as observed for single crystal graphite is not transferable to a technical grade CNT material, and instead, various modes of propagation of combustion sites are identified...|$|R

25|$|Lactate {{dehydrogenase}} catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+. It converts pyruvate, {{the final}} product of glycolysis, to lactate when oxygen is absent or in short supply, and it performs the reverse reaction during the Cori cycle in the liver. At high concentrations of lactate, the enzyme exhibits feedback inhibition, {{and the rate of}} conversion of pyruvate to lactate is decreased.

40|$|The aerobic {{selective}} oxidation (selox) of alcohols {{represents an}} environmentally benign and atom efficient chemical valorisation route to commercially important allylic aldehydes, such as crotonaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde, which find application in pesticides, fragrances and food additives. Palladium nanoparticles are highly active and selective heterogeneous catalysts for such oxidative <b>dehydrogenations,</b> permitting {{the use of}} air (or dioxygen) as a green oxidant in place of stoichiometric chromate permanganate saltsor H 2 O 2. Here we discuss how time-resolved, in-situ X-ray spectroscopies (XAS and XPS) reveal dynamic restructuring of dispersed Pd nanoparticles and Pd single-crystals in response to changing reaction environments, and thereby identify surface PdO as the active species responsible for palladium catalysed crotyl alcohol selox (Figure 1); on-stream reduction to palladium metal under oxygen-poor regimes thus appears {{the primary cause of}} catalyst deactivation. This insight has guided the subsequent application of surfactant-templating and inorganic nanocrystal methodologies to optimize the density of desired active PdO sites for the selective oxidation of natural products such as sesquiterpenoids...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of (PCP) Ir-catalyzed transfer-dehydrogenation {{and a full}} free-energy profile have been elucidated for the substrate/acceptor couple COA/TBE (COA = cyclooctane; TBE = t-butylethylene). Stoichiometric components of the catalytic cycle have been independently observed and their kinetics have been determined. The overall catalysis has also been monitored in situ. Good agreement is found between rates independently obtained from stoichio-metric and catalytic runs. Within the overall TBE-hydrogenation segment of the cycle, labeling experiments indicate that the rate-determining step is the C-H reductive elimination of t-butylethane from (PCP) IrH(t-butylethyl). Based on microscopic reversibility it can be then inferred that the rate-determining step for the alkane <b>dehydrogenations</b> is C-H addition (and not β-H elimination). In accord with this conclusion, n-alkanes {{are found to be}} more reactive than COA. A full energy profile for an n-alkane/α-olefin substrate/acceptor system can be extrapolated based on stoichiometric comparisons with the COA/TBE couple. A computed (DFT) free-energy profile generally matches well with the experimentally derived profile...|$|R
40|$|P 450 s {{catalyze}} a {{wide spectrum}} of stereo- and regioselective reactions like hydroxylations, epoxidations and <b>dehydrogenations.</b> Therefore biotransformations with P 450 s are of great relevance to organic synthesis. The use of isolated enzymes offers advantages over the use of whole cells. A key issue for catalytic applications of isolated P 450 s is the demand for a continuous electron supply to the heme-group. Mediator driven bioelectrocatalysis can help to overcome this problem. For mediator driven bioelectrocatalysis the identification of a suitable mediator is crucial for the fast development of an efficient electro enzymatic process. To this end we have developed a computational screening method based on using freely available software. Calculated electron transfer rates were compared with measured product formation rates. The novel in silico procedure allows a faster identification of suitable mediators for electrochemically driven P 450 catalyzed reactions and can be used as screening tool. It may also lead to a massive reduction of experimental effort for the development of bioelectrochemical reaction systems in the future...|$|R

30|$|This {{evaluation}} {{is carried out}} for 14 likewise conducted experiments of electron-beam-induced <b>dehydrogenations</b> at different accelerating voltages (80 and 300 kV). The resulting fit values for the plasmon energies and widths {{are in the range}} of E_ 1 = 9.99 - 10.37 eV and w_ 1 = 0.84 - 2.17 eV for Mg and E_ 2 = 13.79 - 14.47 eV and w_ 2 = 4.58 - 6.31 eV for MgH 2. For each investigated MgH 2 particle its relative thickness d/λ at the area, from which the VEEL spectra are acquired, is determined from these spectra. Due to the large number of spectra for each particle this quantity can be calculated with a small uncertainty. All likewise deduced characteristic electron doses are plotted as function of the relative thickness in Fig. 4 as solid symbols. It is apperent from this figure that the characteristic doses measured at 300 kV are generally higher than those measured at 80 kV. Furthermore, there is a clear tendency for the characteristic dose to increase with the relative thickness of the particle, though some measured values deviate from this trend.|$|R
