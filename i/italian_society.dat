5|$|With {{the growing}} {{industrialization}} that accelerated during the 20th and 21st century, <b>Italian</b> <b>society</b> gradually moved from an agricultural base to an urban and industrial center. This change weakened traditional culture {{in many parts}} of society; a similar process occurred in other European countries, but unlike them, Italy had no major initiative to preserve traditional musics. Immigration from North Africa, Asia, and other European countries led to further diversification of Italian music. Traditional music came to exist only in small pockets, especially as part of dedicated campaigns to retain local musical identities.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{classical}} music grew gradually more experimental and progressive into the mid-20th century, while popular tastes {{have tended to}} stick with well established composers and compositions of the past. The 2004-2005 program at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples is typical of modern Italy: of the eight operas represented, the most recent was Puccini. In symphonic music, of the 26 composers whose music was played, 21 of them were from the 19th century or earlier, composers who use the melodies and harmonies typical of the Romantic era. This focus is common to other European traditions, and is known as postmodernism, a school of thought that draws on earlier harmonic and melodic concepts that pre-date the conceptions of atonality and dissonance. This focus on popular historical composers has helped to maintain a continued presence of {{classical music}} across {{a broad spectrum of}} <b>Italian</b> <b>society.</b> When music is part of a public display or gathering, it is often chosen from a very eclectic repertoire that is as likely to include well-known classical music as popular music.|$|E

25|$|Also {{considered}} part of the trash genre are films which feature Fantozzi, a comic personage invented by Paolo Villaggio. Although Villaggio's movies tend to bridge trash comedy with a more elevated social satire; this character had a great impact on <b>Italian</b> <b>society,</b> {{to such a degree that}} the adjective fantozziano entered the lexicon. Of the many films telling of Fantozzi's misadventures, the most notable were Fantozzi and Il secondo tragico Fantozzi.|$|E

25|$|Mussolini's {{propaganda}} idolized {{him as the}} nation's saviour and the Fascist regime {{attempted to}} make him omnipresent in <b>Italian</b> <b>society.</b> Much of Fascism's appeal in Italy {{was based on the}} personality cult around Mussolini and his popularity.

25|$|During the war, the Italian Royal Army {{increased}} {{in size from}} 15,000 men in 1914 to 160,000 men in 1918, with 5 million recruits in total entering service during the war. This came at a terrible cost: {{by the end of}} the war, Italy had lost 700,000 soldiers and had a budget deficit of twelve billion lira. <b>Italian</b> <b>society</b> was divided between the majority pacifists who opposed Italian involvement in the war and the minority of pro-war nationalists who had condemned the Italian government for not having immediately gone to war with Austria-Hungary in 1914.|$|E
25|$|Moro faced big challenges, especially, the {{necessity}} to conciliate the Christian and popular mission of the Democrazia Cristiana with the rising laicist and liberal values of the <b>Italian</b> <b>society</b> in the 1960s, and {{the necessity}} to integrate new important social groups (youth, women, workers) in the democratic system. DC's mission, in Moro's vision, was intended to recover the popular class that supported Fascism and ferry them in the democratic system. The contradiction of Moro's political stance was in trying to reconcile the extreme mobility of social transformations with {{the continuity of the}} institutions of representative democracy, and the integration of the masses in the State, without falling into autocracy.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Mussolini was {{concerned}} that if Italian Fascism did not recognise Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to <b>Italian</b> <b>society.</b> Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognised Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and {{in a meeting with}} PNF members, and in June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was {{to be replaced by a}} focus on Aryanism. Mussolini in July 1938 declared that Italians had strong Nordic heritage particularly through the heritage of the Germanic tribe of the Lombards who conquered Italy after the collapse of the Roman Empire and claimed that the intermixing of Mediterranean Romans with the Nordic Lombards was the last significant racial mixing that occurred in Italy and that none had occurred since.|$|E

25|$|Italy {{was also}} {{affected}} by the Enlightenment, a movement which was {{a consequence of the}} Renaissance and changed the road of Italian philosophy. Followers of the group often met to discuss in private salons and coffeehouses, notably in the cities of Milan, Rome and Venice. Cities with important universities such as Padua, Bologna and Naples, however, also remained great centres of scholarship and the intellect, with several philosophers such as Giambattista Vico (1668–1744) (who is widely regarded as being the founder of modern Italian philosophy) and Antonio Genovesi. <b>Italian</b> <b>society</b> also dramatically changed during the Enlightenment, with rulers such as Leopold II of Tuscany abolishing the death penalty. The church's power was significantly reduced, and it was a period of great thought and invention, with scientists such as Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani discovering new things and greatly contributing to Western science. Cesare Beccaria {{was also one of the}} greatest Italian Enlightenment writers and now considered one of the fathers of classical criminal theory as well as modern penology. Beccaria is famous for his masterpiece On Crimes and Punishments (1764), a treatise (later translated into 22 languages) that served as one of the earliest prominent condemnations of torture and the death penalty and thus a landmark work in anti-death penalty philosophy.|$|E
500|$|The Fascist {{movements}} in Italy and Germany in the 1920s and 1930s made {{extensive use of}} World War I memorials to communicate a political message. War memorials were {{a key part of}} the Italian Fascist government's programme, with memorials set up in the name of the fallen and the Fascist revolution. Local Fascist organisations made extensive use of the war memorials and associated ceremonies to promote loyalty both to Italy, and to the revolution. The government promoted the [...] "cult of the fallen hero", stressing that the war dead had played a vital role in transforming Italy's position in Europe and transforming history. The Fascist leader Mussolini was less enthusiastic, however, about the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which he felt was associated with the former regime; he discouraged its use, although remained sensitive to its symbolic importance to various parts of <b>Italian</b> <b>society.</b> Military fly-pasts were added to the Armistice ceremonies and the Tomb itself was moved in 1935, to make it easier to use the memorial in military parades.|$|E
500|$|After World War I, however, opera {{declined}} {{in comparison to}} the popular heights of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Causes included the general cultural shift away from Romanticism {{and the rise of the}} cinema, which became a major source of entertainment. A third cause is the fact that [...] "internationalism" [...] had brought contemporary Italian opera to a state where it was no longer [...] "Italian". This was the opinion of at least one prominent Italian musicologist and critic, Fausto Terrefranca, who, in a 1912 pamphlet entitled Giaccomo Puccini and International Opera, accused Puccini of [...] "commercialism" [...] and of having deserted Italian traditions. Traditional Romantic opera remained popular; indeed, the dominant opera publisher in the early 20th century was Casa Ricordi, which focused almost exclusively on popular operas until the 1930s, when the company allowed more unusual composers with less mainstream appeal. The rise of relatively new publishers such as Carisch and Suvini Zerboni also helped to fuel the diversification of Italian opera. Opera remains a major part of Italian culture; renewed interest in opera across the sectors of <b>Italian</b> <b>society</b> began in the 1980s. Respected composers from this era include the well-known Aldo Clementi, and younger peers such as Marco Tutino and Lorenzo Ferrero.|$|E

500|$|Byron had {{arranged}} for Allegra to be educated in the convent precisely because he, unlike his former lover Clairmont, thought favourably of the manners and attitudes of Italian women who had received convent educations. [...] He disapproved {{of what he called}} Clairmont's [...] "loose morals" [...] and [...] "Bedlam behavior" [...] and didn't want her to influence Allegra. He also believed that his daughter, given her illegitimacy, would have a far better chance of marrying well in Italy than she would in England. A Roman Catholic girl with a suitable dowry, raised in a convent, would have a decent chance of marrying into high <b>Italian</b> <b>society.</b> He wanted the child to become a Roman Catholic, which he viewed as the [...] "best religion." [...] "If Claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with the child's morals or education, she mistakes; she never shall," [...] wrote Byron in a letter to Richard Belgrave Hoppner in September 1820. [...] "The girl shall be a Christian and a married woman, if possible." [...] Her mother could see Allegra, he added, only with the [...] "proper restrictions." [...] Byron wrote to Hoppner in March 1821 that Allegra would receive better care in the convent than she would with him. His mistress, Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, had had a happy experience at the convent boarding school where she had lived from the age of five, and had persuaded Byron that a convent school would be the best place for Allegra. He also viewed the convent as the safest place for her with revolution brewing in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
