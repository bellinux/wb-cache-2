50|$|In 1982, Iran counter-attacked and was {{successful}} in driving the Iraqis back into Iraq. That year alone, an estimated 40,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner. The defeats of 1982 were a blow to Iraq. With the economic situation worsening because of falling oil prices (and the rising military budget), the Iraqi standard of living worsened. The Revolutionary Command Council and the Ba'ath Military Command, Regional Command and National Command met in an extraordinary session in 1982 (with Saddam absent), to discuss {{the possibility of a}} ceasefire proposal to the Iranian government. The ceasefire proposal made at the meeting was rejected by the Iranian government. If the proposal had been accepted Saddam would have not have survived politically, since it was supported by all members of the Regional Command, National Command and the Revolutionary Command Council. It was at this time that rumours started circulating that Hussein would step down as president to make way for al-Bakr, the former president. As events proved, this did not happen and al-Bakr died in 1982 under mysterious circumstances. Bloodshed during the conflict nearly led to a mutiny led by Maher Abd al-Rashid, father-in-law of Saddam's second son. Rashid began public criticism, and claimed that loss of life could have been averted <b>if</b> not for <b>Saddam's</b> meddling into military affairs. This confrontation with the military led to the greater independence of military planning from Ba'athist-leadership interference. Shortly afterwards, the Iraqi Air Force once again established air superiority. The turn of events caused the Iraqi government to focus on Iraqi Kurdistan which had revolted. Saddam appointed his cousin Ali Hasan al-Majid as military chief in Kurdistan. al-Majid initiated the al-Anfal campaign; chemical weapons were used against civilians. In April 1988, after a series of Iraqi military victories, a ceasefire was agreed between Iraq and Iran; the war is commonly considered status quo ante bellum.|$|R
40|$|Spiralling {{troop levels}} and lost lives have echoes from Indochina, {{according}} to Simon Adams THE DEATH of Sergio Vieira de Mello, along with twenty {{other people in}} the United Nations building in Baghdad, has probably crippled what remaining hope still existed in Washington that the Iraq War really ended when President Bush proclaimed it over on 1 May. More than 60 US soldiers have been killed since then. And still the Americans keep desperately clutching at straws - Iraqi resistance will end with the death of Uday and Qusay, it will end when Saddam is captured, it will end when they wipe out the few remaining supporters of the old regime. It will not end. American soldiers will continue to die in Iraq as long as the US continues to occupy the country. They will die because they are seen as the most recent invaders of Iraq in an ancient history of conquest and resistance that stretches back across {{the rise and fall of}} several civilizations. They will die because they are viewed by many Iraqis as armed colonisers, not as liberators. They will die because the US has so far mightily failed to deliver on its pre-invasion promise to bring peace, prosperity and democracy to Iraq. One of the crucial things that the recent suicide bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad revealed is the difference of perception between ‘the West’ and ‘the rest’ regarding the United Nations. To the American, European and Australian governments the UN was an impediment to ‘regime change’ in Iraq. The UN Security Council refused to give its blessing to a unilateral strike by the United States, and leading UN figures were critical of the relentless US drive to war. UN arms inspectors publicly challenged US and British claims that Iraq possessed extensive ‘weapons of mass destruction’ (correctly, it has now been proven). As a result, the ‘blue helmets’ were regarded as libertarian hand-wringers in Washington, and as an obstacle to making the world a better place post- 9 / 11. Viewed from this perspective, the bombing of the UN’s Baghdad headquarters was an unprovoked terrorist attack on innocent humanitarian aid workers. In many Islamic countries, meanwhile, the UN is viewed as little more than an appendage of US foreign policy. It should be recalled that it was under the aegis of the UN that the first Gulf War against Iraq was fought in 1991, that the country was divided with its ‘No Fly Zones’ and Kurdish autonomous region, and that the sanctions, arms inspections and ‘Oil for Food’ programs were managed. To literally millions of people in the Arab world and beyond, the United Nations is not a neutral humanitarian organisation but a key participant in the US-led campaign against Iraq. For these people, the Baghdad suicide bombing was a blow struck against sanctions, humiliation and acquiescence to Western occupation of an Arab country. Writing at the time of the US-led invasion of Iraq, I argued that the ‘ghosts of Vietnam’ would haunt Washington. I was criticised by some readers for my defeatism. And yet, watching Donald Rumsfeld and his polished generals at a recent press conference fielding questions regarding a potential increase in the number of US ground forces in Iraq, one couldn’t help but think that the scenario was faintly reminiscent. Already people are wondering how many more US soldiers it will take before Iraq is pacified. During the Vietnam War, with its escalating enemy ‘body counts’ and US body-bags, the same issues of spiralling troop levels and lost lives were politically contentious and publicly divisive. Similarly, US popular support for the continuing occupation of Iraq is weakening, along with the morale of the soldiers. On July 16 Good Morning America broadcast a controversial interview with soldiers from the US Third Infantry Division. They spoke of their disappointment at becoming an occupation force. One called for Donald Rumsfeld’s resignation. Another, a Sergeant, said that US soldiers were ‘mentally and physically exhausted to the point that some hoped they would get wounded so they could go home’. Again, the ghosts of Vietnam. If George W. Bush is wondering about the future of his occupation of Iraq he only needs to look back to the Vietnam War. Only this time the resistance to US occupation is fed by nationalism and Islam rather than nationalism and communism. It scarcely matters how many more troops he sends - the resistance will not end because it is created by the humiliations and disappointments associated with occupation itself. This war, which was allegedly fought to prevent Iraq from becoming a terrorist training camp, has actually succeeded in turning it into one. Iraq is now a nation whose US-led administration is incapable of delivering essential services and where foreign Islamic extremists are able to infiltrate across borders to come kill ‘infidels’. It is a nation where legitimate domestic grievances can easily feed into illegitimate acts of terrorism, like the UN suicide bombing. President Bush’s statement that the attack on the UN was the work of ‘enemies of the civilized world’ does nothing to bridge the political gulf which now exists between so many Iraqi people and their US occupiers. Even under Saddam Hussein’s brutal dictatorship people still had some semblance of personal security (as long as they did not criticise the regime) and access to basic services (water, electricity, etc). Many Iraqis are now asking what’s the point of liberation from <b>Saddam</b> <b>if</b> they are to suffer rampant lawlessness, the collapse of essential services, and an occupying army which is rapidly coming to the conclusion (as in Vietnam) that every civilian is a potential enemy or suicide bomber. The resulting cycle of violence will only further poison both American and Iraqi hearts and minds. There was a moment when Baghdad first fell to US Marines that was broadcast live around the world. A small crowd of Iraqis were attempting to pull down a statue of Saddam Hussein and they were eventually assisted in doing so by a US tank crew. As the assembled Iraqis watched, and the world’s media zoomed in, one of the US soldiers clambered to the top of the statue and rubbed a US flag in the face of a bronze Saddam. After a few seconds the US flag was taken down and an Iraqi flag was diplomatically handed up to take its place. Arguably, the entire US occupation of Iraq was revealed - and lost - in that moment.

Under pressure from his Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and his main ally, the UK, President Bush decided to try to obtain UN backing for an invasion.
