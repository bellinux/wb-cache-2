5000|$|The user {{interface}} of a mechanical system, a vehicle or an <b>industrial</b> <b>installation</b> is {{sometimes referred to}} as the human-machine interface (HMI).

However it is abbreviated, the terms refer to the 'layer' that separates a human that is operating a machine from the machine itself. Without a clean and usable interface, humans {{would not be able to}} interact with information systems.|$|E
