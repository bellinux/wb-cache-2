Emma was waiting for her parents by placing a freezing spell on them. She tells Regina about Arthur using Mary Margaret and David in order to unite Excalibur with the dagger and then kill Merlin, which is why Emma wants a skeptical Regina to work with her to free the sorcerer, even though Regina is not convinced of Emma's claim, believing that Emma's darkness is telling Emma this, which Emma disputes by saying it's true and that dark magic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> Regina asks how Emma knew her parents were under the spell, and she shows Regina the dreamcatcher. Regina tells Emma that the device catches more than dreams because it's dark magic and dangerous, as Emma believes that her dark magic is stronger than she thought.|$|E

500|$|Another of Gestumblindi's riddles asks, [...] "What is that beast all girded with iron, which {{kills the}} flocks? [...] He has eight horns but no head, and runs as he pleases."

He has {{the name of a}} bear and runs when he is thrown;" [...] or, [...] "It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked." [...] The first problem is in translating the word húnn, which may refer to a die (as suggested by the former translation), the [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight corners of a six-sided die and [...] "the flocks" [...] that he kills referring to the stakes the players lose. [...] Alternatively, húnn may refer to the king, his [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight defenders, which is more consistent with the latter translation, [...] "He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked."

500|$|Munsey's {{plan for}} the {{magazines}} was {{laid out in a}} note that appeared in the first four issues: [...] "This magazine <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to thousands of requests we have received over a period of years, demanding a second look at famous fantasies which, since their original publication, have become accepted classics. [...] Our choice has been dictated by your requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction." [...] The first issue included Ray Cummings' [...] "The Girl in the Golden Atom" [...] and A. Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool", both popular stories by well-known authors. [...] Merritt's sequel, [...] "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", began serialization in the next issue, with illustrations by Virgil Finlay. [...] Finlay did many illustrations for Famous Fantastic Mysteries over its lifetime, and became one of its most popular artists. [...] Frank R. Paul began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers. [...] The first five covers were simply tables of contents, but with the sixth issue, dated March 1940, pictorial covers began, with Finlay the artist for that first cover. [...] Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, or his son, Peter Stevens, including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950. [...] The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine {{one of the most popular}} of its day, and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay's work in Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels that made his reputation.|$|E
