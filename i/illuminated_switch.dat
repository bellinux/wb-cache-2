Such switches work satisfactorily with incandescent lamps, halogen lighting and non-electronic fluorescent fixtures, since the small current required for the switch's illuminating source {{is too small to}} produce any visible light from such devices controlled by the <b>illuminated</b> <b>switch.</b> However, if used to control compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), the small amount of current required to energize the lighting source within switch also slowly charges the internal input capacitor in the electronic ballast of the CFL until the voltage across it rises {{to the point where it}} produces a brief discharge through the CFL.

Recently, single magnetic atoms on surfaces, or so-called magnetic adatoms, have gained {{a lot of interest}} for spin-based information storage and pro-cessing [1, 2, 3]. These concepts are mostly based on strong magnetic anisotropy energy [4, 5], which reduces spin degeneracy at zero magnetic field, thereby defining preferential spatial orientations of the spin. While magnetic anisotropy introduces an energy cost for magnetization rever-sal, countless studies have illustrated that in the presence of strong mag-netic anisotropy, individual magnetic adatoms still exhibit rather short life-times [6, 7, 8] owing to the interplay of the hybridization of the moment bearing orbitals and the underlying substrate.

40|$|Ventral premotor cortex (PMv) {{is widely}} {{accepted}} to exert an important influence over primary motor cortex (M 1) when hand movements are made. Although study of these interactions has typically {{focused on their}} excitatory nature, given its strong connections with both ventral and opercular frontal regions, one feature {{of the influence of}} PMv over M 1 may be inhibitory. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) was used to examine functional interactions between human PMv and M 1 during the selection and reprogramming of a naturalistic goal-directed action. One of two cylinders was illuminated on each trial. It was then grasped and picked up. On some trials, however, subjects had to reprogram the action as the <b>illuminated</b> cylinder was <b>switched</b> off and the other illuminated simultaneously with reach initiation. At a neurophysiological level, the PMv paired-pulse effect (PPE) on M 1 corticospinal activity was facilitatory after the initial target presentation and during movement initiation. When reprogramming was required, however, the PPE became strongly inhibitory. This context-dependent change from facilitation to inhibition occurred within 75 ms of the change of target. Behaviorally, PMv-M 1 ppTMS disrupted reprogramming. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image scans were taken of each subject. Intersubject differences in the facilitation-inhibition contrast of PMv-M 1 interactions were correlated with fractional anisotropy of white-matter in ventral prefrontal, premotor, and intraparietal brain areas. These results suggest that a network of brain areas centered on PMv inhibits M 1 corticospinal activity associated with undesired movements when action plans change...|$|R
40|$|Epigenetic {{mechanisms}} encode information {{above and}} beyond DNA sequence and {{play a critical role}} in brain development and the long-lived effects of environmental cues on the pre- and postnatal brain. Switch like, rather than graded changes, illustrate par excellence how epigenetic events perpetuate altered activity states in the absence of the initial cue. They occur from early neural development to maturation and can give rise to distinct diseases upon deregulation. Many neurodevelopmental genes harbor bivalently marked chromatin domains, states of balanced inhibition, which guide dynamic "ON or OFF" decisions once the balance is tilted in response to developmental or environmental cues. Examples discussed in this review include neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) into progenitors and beyond, activation of Kiss 1 at puberty onset, and early experience dependent programming of Avp, a major stress gene. At the genome-scale, genomic imprinting can be epigenetically switched on or off at select genes in a tightly controlled temporospatial manner and provides a versatile mechanism for dosage regulation of genes with important roles in stem cell quiescence or differentiation. Moreover, retrotransposition in neural progenitors provides an intriguing example of an epigenetic-like switch, which is stimulated by bivalently marked neurodevelopmental genes and possibly results in increased genomic flexibility regarding unprecedented challenge. Overall, we propose that molecular epigenetic <b>switches</b> <b>illuminate</b> the catalyzing function of epigenetic mechanisms in guiding dynamic changes in gene expression underpinning robust transitions in cellular and organismal phenotypes as well as in the mediation between dynamically changing environments and the static genetic blueprint...|$|R
40|$|Light is architectural. It is structural. ” - Robert Wilson Lighting {{is a vital}} {{component}} of three-dimensional design. Not only does it provide the visibility required by live performance, but, if deployed efficiently, also highlights the specific characteristics of the illuminated objects and conceals their imperfections. Moreover, different angles and sources of theatre lighting can create the pertinent atmosphere and plasticity according to the particular genre, style, and dramatic situations on stage. Psychologically, through visual cues lighting often establishes the mood and impacts the audience perception. Sometimes it even foreshadows and prompts dramatic actions. Therefore, theatre lighting design, much more than data calculations, {{should be able to}} incorporate dramatic content, dance, spatial relations and embodiment, the cognitive needs of the audience, and collaborate with other design departments, including scenery, costume and sound, to construct an aesthetically coherent theatrical world. Besides the functional purposes, it is significant for the lighting designers to take serious considerations of the palette of colors, choice of equipments, and other logistical matters. Even though lighting is often the last element in the design process, a lighting designer must envision beforehand what effects different lighting angles and colors will generate on performers while ensure the lights will fit the atmosphere of a specific plot point. To me, what colors and angles can do visually and psychologically is extremely diverse and elastic. In Rhinoceros, for instance, my use of intense white light created the illusion of enlargement of the theatre space. As the plot advanced, however, by gradually reducing the <b>illuminated</b> area and <b>switching</b> colors, I successfully enabled the perception of the change in size of theatrical space and emotions. In Native Son, utilizing the lights in the trap space below to fabricate a fireplace and sculpt the actors and stage amplified the sense of three-dimensions. Furthermore, lighting design is more than simply recreating the real world we experience every day, but a persistent attempt to realize the theatrical reality, that is, reality after meticulous dramatization. Lighting design is an endless road to the unknown...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{work performed}} at the National Physical Laboratory to improve the electrical risetime calibration of instruments such as fast sampling oscilloscopes. The majority of the work {{can be divided into}} four sections: development of an ultrafast optoelectronic pulse generator; measurement of fast electrical pulses with an electrooptic sampling system; de-embedding of transmission line and transition effects as measured at different calibration reference planes; and calibration of an oscilloscope. The pulse generator is a photoconductive switch based on low-temperature Gallium Arsenide, which has a very fast carrier recombination time. Sub-picosecond electrical pulses are produced by <b>illuminated</b> a planar <b>switch</b> with 200 fs optical pulses from a Ti: sapphire laser system. The pulses are measured using a sampling system with an external electro-optic probe in close proximity to the switch. The electro-optic sampling system, with a temporal resolution better than 500 fs, is used to measure the electrical pulses shape at various positions along the planar transmission line. The results are compared to a pulse propagation model for the line. The effects of different switch geometries are examined. Although the pulse generator produces sub-picosecond pulses near to the point of generation, the pulse is shown to broaden to 7 ps after passing along a length of transmission line and a coplanar-coaxial transition. For a sampling oscilloscope with a coaxial input connector, this effect is significant. Frequency-domain measurements with a network analyser, further electro-optic sampling measurements, and the transmission line model are combined to find the network transfer function of the transition. Using the pulse generator, the electro-optic sampling system and the transition knowledge, a 50 GHz sampling oscilloscope is calibrated. The determination of the instrument step response(nominal risetime 7 ps) is improved from an earlier value of 8. 5 - 3. 5 / + 2. 9 ps to a new value of 7. 4 - 2. 1 / + 1. 7 ps with the calibration techniques described...|$|R
40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} {{important}} fungal pathogen of human, with a remarkable ability to withstand constantly changing microenvironment within the host through its morphological and metabolic plasticity. These fine-tuning mechanisms based on the ecological niche enhance its pathogenic potential and increase its fitness. Our understanding of what, when and how these mechanisms and factors contribute to commensal and pathogenic C. albicans is still insufficient for the development of efficient drugs against C. albicans infections. This dissertation addresses unique biological aspects evolved to increase the fitness attributes of C. albicans using both in vitro and in vivo studies. First, we investigate the in vitro and in vivo role of chlamydospores using a previously identified chlamydospore defective mutant Δisw 2 /Δisw 2. We found that chlamydospores can be produced by C. albicans during mouse kidney colonization and ISW 2 (orf 19. 7401) regulates suspensor cell formation rather than the spore itself. Screening for nutritional triggers for induction of chlamydospores suggests that these are formed as a response to nutritional stress rather than being a reproductive mode or resting stage. Secondly, we characterized FMS 1 (orf 19. 4589) and CBP 1 (orf 19. 7323), the two genes predicted to be rate limiting in pantothenic acid biosynthesis in yeasts. This is the first study to use gene deletion mutants to characterize their function and our findings indicate C. albicans has redundant roles for FMS 1 compared to its ortholog in Sachcharomyces cerevisiae. Our findings fortuitously identified a ‘novel’ histidine biosynthesis regulatory pathway in Candida biology. This study <b>illuminates</b> novel metabolic <b>switching</b> circuitry through which C. albicans fulfil its essential primary metabolites. Thirdly, we investigated why C. albicans and C. dubliniensis evolved to use ubiquinone 9 (UQ 9) rather than ubiquinone 7 (UQ 7) as in other Candida species. We have shown that the presence of longer isoprenoid chains aids farnesol tolerance by comparing the farnesol sensitivity of S. cerevisiae (UQ 6) with that of a strain modified to produce UQ 9. Here we propose the presence of UQ 9 is a physiological adaptation for stress tolerance in this pathogenic yeast. ...|$|R
40|$|The Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Simulator is a {{portable}} training aid, or demonstration tool, designed to physically illustrate real-time critical-safety concepts of electrical lockout/tagout. The {{objective is to}} prevent misinterpretations of what is off and what is on during maintenance and repair of complex electrical systems. The simulator is designed {{in the form of}} a hinged box that opens up and stands on its own as an easel for demonstrations. On the outer face of the unit is a simulated circuit breaker box housing the switches. The breakers control the main power to the unit, a light bulb, and an electrical control cabinet. The light bulb is wired so that either of two breakers can provide power to it. When power is sent to the electrical control cabinet, a red indicator light illuminates. Inside the cabinet is the power supply from a personal computer. The power supply produces a 12 -V dc output that is sent over to a small fan next to it, also from a computer, and an amber light on the front of the cabinet <b>illuminates.</b> A separate <b>switch</b> powers the fan on and off. The power supply is behind a plastic shield to protect against exposure to live conductors. Electrical banana jacks are mounted in the plastic shield to allow a voltmeter to be connected safely when opening the cabinet and taking a meter reading to verify de-energization as part of a simulation exercise. This LOTO simulator prototype is designed and fabricated as an all-in-one unit. All accessories can be stored inside the hinged case, and there is a handle on top for ease of transport. The circuit breaker labels attach with hook and loop fasteners so that they may be moved and changed to fit the training or demonstration scenario. The warning signs and labels on the electrical control box are magnetic, allowing for easy reconfiguration to emulate different equipment setups. A specially designed magnetic cover was made to disguise the indicator lights for demonstrations when these indicators are not used. The cover is disguised as an arc flash safety label that would typically be found on such a cabinet. One indicator light has a separate switch that can take it offline. This is to allow for demonstration to trainees on why it is important not to completely rely on indicator lights, but that they should always take a meter reading at the exposed conductors to absolutely verify de-energization before exposure. A clear plastic barrier and banana jacks inside the cabinet provide a safe way to plug in a voltmeter for demonstrations without exposure to the hazards of energized equipment. A small remote control unit is wired into the fan circuit. The remote allows the demonstrator to turn the fan on and off, provided that all of the breakers and switches leading to it are configured on as well. The remote feature was added in order to demonstrate the importance of starting the lockout/tagout task with energized equipment, then powering it down, isolating it, and locking it out to ensure that the correct breakers have been locked out...|$|R
