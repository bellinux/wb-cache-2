5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{contacts}} like SININ and SINIS with dielectric barriers I. On {{the basis}} of a microscopic theory, we obtain the matching conditions at the SIN boundary for the distribution functions. The I(V) characteristics are found for the SININ <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> a length exceeding the correlation length-xi. It is shown that <b>in</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> a high transmittance of the SIN interface an excess current I(exc) > 0 appears at high voltages. <b>In</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> a low transmittance a deficit current I(def) < 0 at high V and a peak in the conductance at low V exist. Both I(exc) and I(def) diminish <b>with</b> increasing the <b>contact</b> length d. The zero-bias anomaly is suppressed by temperature and a weak magnetic field...|$|R

50|$|In heat {{transfer}} and thermodynamics, a thermodynamic system {{is said to}} be <b>in</b> thermal <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> another system if it can exchange energy through the process of heat. Perfect thermal isolation is an idealization as real systems are always <b>in</b> thermal <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> their environment to some extent.|$|R
5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E

Plasma forms an impassable wall that no unit can cross, and is generated by Meteors. Once a Meteor is destroyed, any Plasma <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> it disappears, allowing units to pass. Plasma that is not <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E

The FAA cited safety concerns, especially unpredictable winds from between buildings, as the reason for the change.|$|E
