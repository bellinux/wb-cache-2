The main synthetic route for the preparation of azo dyes is coupling reaction between an aromatic diazo compound and a coupling component. Of all dyes manufactured, about 60 % are produced by this reaction. Arylazo pyridone dyes can be prepared from pyridone moiety as a coupling component, where substituent can be on nitrogen, and diazonim salts which can be derived from different substituted anilines or other heterocyclic derivatives. In addition, arylazo dyes containing pyridone ring can be prepared from arylazo diketones or arylazo ketoesters (obtained by coupling β-diketones or β-ketoesters with diazonim salts) by condensation with cyanoacetamide.

40|$|The {{recent reports}} of Watson and Ducci (1, 2) have revived {{interest}} in the van den Bergh reaction (3), and in the physiological and chemical nature of serum bilirubin. These investigators have presented {{evidence to show that}} {{there are two types of}} bilirubin in serum, each having a distinctive chemical structure and physiological significance. Their work is based on the premise that the two types can be distinguished by their respective rates of diazotization in the direct van den Bergh reaction, and their observations have led to the conclusion that the prompt direct, or oneminute fraction, represents bilirubin which has been regurgitated from the biliary tree, and that the indirect fraction represents retained bilirubin. The difference in their behavior toward the diazo reagent is ascribed to the nature of their linkage with protein, the prompt direct fraction being a sodium salt loosely bound by adsorption, the indirect being firmly attached by a valence-bond. Another important physiological difference between the two fractions, according to Watson, is evident in their behavior in the kidney, direct bilirubin being excreted, indirect being retained. These conclusions reaffirm the views of many early workers (4 - 8), but are not in accord with more recent opinion that there is only one type of bilirubin in serum (9 - 11), that there is no direct relationship between the renal excretion of bilirubin and the direct van den Bergh reaction (12), and that the van den Bergh reaction is of limited diagnostic significance (13).
