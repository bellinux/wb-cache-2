25|$|Many {{religious}} traditions {{have taken a}} stance on abortion, and these stances span a broad spectrum, as highlighted below. Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; although there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was and how grave a sin it was held to be, it was seen as at least as grave as sexual immorality. Some early Christians believed that the embryo {{did not have a}} soul from conception, and consequently, opinion was divided {{as to whether or not}} <b>early</b> <b>abortion</b> was murder or ethically equivalent to murder.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Lorraine Rothman and Carol Downer, {{founding}} {{members of the}} feminist self-help movement, invented the Del-Em, a safe, cheap suction device {{that made it possible}} for people with minimal training to perform early abortions called menstrual extraction. During the mid-1990s in the United States the medical community showed renewed interest in manual vacuum aspiration as a method of early surgical abortion. This resurgence is due to technological advances that permit early pregnancy detection (as soon as a week after conception) and a growing popular demand for safe, effective <b>early</b> <b>abortion</b> options, both surgical and medical. An innovator in the development of early surgical abortion services is Jerry Edwards, a physician, who developed a protocol in which women are offered an abortion using a handheld vacuum syringe as soon as a positive pregnancy test is received. This protocol also allows the early detection of an ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} abortion {{was performed in}} the classical world, but there is disagreement about {{the frequency with which}} abortion was performed and which cultures influenced early Christian thought on abortion.

Some writers state that there is evidence that some early Christians believed, as the Greeks did, in delayed ensoulment, or that a fetus does not have a soul until quickening, and therefore <b>early</b> <b>abortion</b> was not murder; Luker says there was disagreement on whether <b>early</b> <b>abortion</b> was wrong. Other writers say that early Christians considered abortion a sin even before ensoulment. According to some, the magnitude of the sin was, for the early Christians, on a level with general sexual immorality or other lapses; according to others, they saw it as [...] "an evil no less severe and social than oppression of the poor and needy".|$|E

25|$|In very <b>early</b> <b>{{abortion}}s,</b> up to 7 weeks gestation, medical abortion using a mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimen {{is considered}} to be more effective than surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration), especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of aspirated tissue. <b>Early</b> medical <b>abortion</b> regimens using mifepristone, followed 24–48 hours later by buccal or vaginal misoprostol are 98% effective up to 9 weeks gestational age.

2500|$|Menstrual {{extraction}} {{is a form}} of vacuum aspiration, used {{to empty}} the uterus.

2500|$|From the 4th to 16th Century AD, Christian philosophers, while {{maintaining}} the condemnation of abortion as wrong, had varying stances on whether abortion was murder. Under the first Christian Roman emperor Constantine, there was a relaxation of attitudes toward abortion and exposure of children. Bakke writes, [...] "Since {{an increasing number of}} Christian parents were poor and found it difficult to look after their children, the theologians were forced to take into account this situation and reflect anew on the question. This made it possible to take a more tolerant attitude toward poor people who exposed their children." [...] Saint Augustine believed that an <b>early</b> <b>abortion</b> is not murder because, according to the Aristotelian concept of delayed ensoulment, the soul of a fetus at an early stage is not present, a belief that passed into canon law. Nonetheless, he harshly condemned the procedure: [...] "Sometimes, indeed, this lustful cruelty, or if you please, cruel lust, resorts to such extravagant methods as to use poisonous drugs to secure barrenness; or else, if unsuccessful in this, to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth, preferring that its offspring should rather perish than receive vitality; or if it was advancing to life within the womb, should be slain before it was born."(De Nube et Concupiscentia 1.17 (15)) St. Thomas Aquinas, Pope Innocent III, and Pope Gregory XIV also believed that a fetus does not have a soul until [...] "quickening," [...] or when the fetus begins to kick and move, and therefore <b>early</b> <b>abortion</b> was not murder, though later abortion was. Aquinas held that abortion was still wrong, even when not murder, regardless of when the soul entered the body. Pope Stephen V and Pope Sixtus V opposed abortion at any stage of pregnancy.|$|E

Abortion, it is true, was denounced in early Christian writings such as the Didache and by early Christian authors such as Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and St. Basil. But church councils, such as those of Elvira and Ancyra, which were called to specify the legal groundwork for Christian communities, outlined penalties only for those women who committed abortion after a sexual crime such as adultery or prostitution. Most importantly, perhaps, from the third century A.D. onward, Christian thought was divided as to whether <b>early</b> <b>abortion</b> - the abortion of an [...] "unformed" [...] embryo - was in fact murder.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} {{describes}} the clinical features and plasma profiles of bovine pregnancy-associated glycoprotein 1 (bPAG 1), the main metabolite of prostaglandin F 2 α (PG metabolite) and progesterone (P 4) in heifers in which <b>early</b> <b>abortions</b> were induced. Methods <b>Early</b> <b>abortions</b> were induced in four heifers with cloprostenol and monitored by ultrasonography. Blood {{samples were collected}} and the plasma were analyzed for bPAG 1, P 4 and PG metabolite. Results The foetal heartbeat rates varied from 170 – 186 beats per minute for all foetuses up to the date of cloprostenol treatment. Foetal death was confirmed within two days after cloprostenol treatment. Prior to cloprostenol injection, blood plasma concentrations of bPAG 1, PG metabolite and P 4 varied from 8. 4 – 40. 0 ng/mL, 158 – 275 pmol/L and 20. 7 – 46. 9 nmol/L, respectively. After the foetus expelled, the plasma level of bPAG 1 began to decrease but the decrease was small and gradual. The estimated half-life of bPAG 1 was 1. 8 – 6. 6 days. The plasma level of the PG metabolite started to have short lasting peaks (above 300 pmol/L) within three hours after cloprostenol treatment. The plasma concentrations of P 4 dropped sharply to less than 4 nmol/L after 24 hours of cloprostenol injection. Conclusion The current findings indicated that after early closprostenol-induced foetal death, the plasma concentration of bPAG 1 decreased gradually and showed a tendency of variation with the stages of pregnancy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) {{produces}} bunches {{throughout the}} year, following annual cycles {{marked by a}} peak season, with genetic diversity regarding the regularity of the annual profile of bunch production. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand this diversity among a set of oil palm crosses. We hypothesized that this diversity originated from differential responses to water balance and bunch load. Seven crosses with different production cycles were studied during 6 years in Benin, where dry seasons are marked. Phenological stages of phytomer development were recorded from leaf appearance to bunch harvest. Inequality in the distribution over the months of the year of phytomers at each stage was quantified using the Gini coefficient. We found that annual variations in the rate of <b>early</b> <b>abortions,</b> sex ratio, time between leaf opening and appearance of female inflorescence (AFI) and time between AFI and flowering strongly contributed to the diversity in production profile among crosses. To a lesser extent, annual variations in the time of bunch maturation also generated diversity in the production profile. Sex ratio was positively correlated with water balance and negatively with bunch load when leaves were around axil number - 25 (approximately 29 months before harvest). <b>Early</b> <b>abortions</b> were positively correlated with bunch load when leaves were at axil number 10 (approximately 9 months before harvest).
