The Liberal Party opposes the deal, saying it <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the province because it will increase the province's debt and will see electricity rates increase for consumers.

25|$|A {{key project}} {{is one that}} could radically {{change the way the}} medical {{profession}} is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as fee-for-service because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which generates more income) which may not be in the patients' best long-term interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking, or follow-ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost. The current fee-for-service system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service. Some have noted that the best hospitals have fewer re-admission rates than others, which benefits patients, but some of the worst hospitals have high re-admission rates which <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> patients but is perversely rewarded under the fee-for-service system.|$|E

500|$|... "Blurred Lines" [...] was controversial: its {{video was}} called sexist for its {{perceived}} degradation of women, and some felt its lyrics promoted rape. Others disagreed, {{asserting that the}} lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom. Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: [...] "it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing." [...] Ratajkowski {{did not think of}} the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, [...] "took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting". She said that the song [...] "gave me an opportunity to say the things that I felt about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture." [...] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> both sexes.|$|E

The critic added, [...] "Mars knows she <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> him, that's she's preventing him from thinking straight, that he can't actually have her the way he wants, but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her."

500|$|Later in the tournament, on 18 June 2012, Mario Balotelli scored {{his first}} goal {{in a major}} {{international}} tournament in a 2–0 victory against the Republic of Ireland. When he attempted to celebrate this goal, he was immediately halted by teammate Leonardo Bonucci, who covered Balotelli's mouth with his hand for fear that the striker would say something to [...] "get in trouble." [...] Balotelli had been dropped to the bench by Cesare Prandelli prior to the game due to his lack of ability shown in his previous group games, so when he was subbed on against Ireland fans didn't expect him to {{have much of an}} impact, and his celebration of his goal may have originally been directed towards the naysayers who believe he <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the team. Balotelli went on to start against England in the quarter-finals, his performance was described as wasteful but his effort was rated highly in a game where he missed multiple chances. He scored the first penalty taken in the shootout against his Manchester City teammate Joe Hart. On 28 June, Balotelli scored twice within the first 40 minutes in Italy's semi-final clash with Germany, as the Azzurri won 2–1 and progressed to the Euro 2012 final against European and World champions Spain. After scoring the second goal in that semi-final, he ripped off his shirt and stood motionless as he flexed his muscles, developing a famous celebration. Going into the final Balotelli said that, Manchester City's title success meant that failure in the Euros would not signal a personal failure this season. He also said that he was unfazed by the pressure he supposedly has on his shoulders going into the final, with new high expectations of him from his home supporters after his amazing performance against Germany.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{literary}} critics frequently dismissed the romance novel genre, often for contrasting reasons. Janice Radway {{contended that the}} genre <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> women, blinding them {{to the difference between}} fantasy and reality. [...] She posited that women turn towards books in this genre to get an emotional release denied to them in their daily lives, where they must devote themselves to caregiving and have little time for themselves. Other critics saw the genre as simply a rehash of stereotypical sexual and marital roles. [...] In the late 1990s, Crusie wrote several essays defending the romance novel against critics.|$|E

2500|$|Other critics reacted less {{positively}} to the film. Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan {{described it as}} [...] "at best, OK" [...] and one whose [...] "animating idea is more interesting than its actual satisfactions". Sam Adams of IndieWire argued that the unanimous praise for Boyhood <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> film criticism, as it tends to marginalize the analysis of critics who disagree with the majority; Adams further elaborated that masterpieces are not made [...] "by unanimous praise, but by careful scrutiny". Richard Brody of The New Yorker listed the film {{at the top of}} a year-end list he called [...] "The Negative Ten", a list of films with [...] "significant merit", but that also [...] "occluded the view toward the year's most accomplished and daringly original work".|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, Indians named [...] "No Neck" [...] and [...] "Black Heart" [...] {{testified in}} an inquiry before the Office of Indian Affairs. [...] The hearing weighed the {{morality}} of Indian employment in show business. [...] "You are engaged in the exhibition or show business," [...] observed the acting commissioner, A.C. Belt. [...] "It is not considered among white people a very helpful or elevating business. [...] I believe that which {{is not good for}} the white people is not good for the Indians, and what <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the white people <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> the Indians." [...] The Indians defended their work as adamantly as any white performer, and they turned the inquiry into a pointed denunciation of the Indian policy by comparing conditions in the show with those of the Pine Ridge Agency. [...] The contrast reflected poorly on the Office of Indian Affairs. Rocky Bear began by pointing out that he long had served the interests of the federal government (Great White Father) by encouraging the development of Indian reservations. [...] He worked in a show that fed him well; [...] "that is why I am getting so fat," [...] he said, stroking his cheeks. [...] It was only in returning to the reservation that [...] "I am getting poor." [...] If the Great [...] Father wanted him to stop appearing in the show, he would stop. [...] But until then, [...] "that is the way I get money." [...] When he showed his inquisitors a purse filled with $300 in gold coins, saying [...] "I saved this money to buy some clothes for my children," [...] they were silenced. [...] Black Heart, too, denounced the allegations of mistreatment. [...] "We were raised on horseback; that is the way we had to work."
