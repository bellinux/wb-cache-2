Former referee Tim Donaghy has alleged {{that at least one of}} the referees working this game had {{subjective}} motives for wanting the Lakers to defeat the Kings, and made officiating calls to effectuate this outcome. The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though The New York Times reported on June 12, 2008 that the FBI is investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game. Even the television announcers commented on how obvious <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fix was in.|$|E
5|$|Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Allied fleet {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell to the advancing Persian army, the Allied fleet still remained {{off the coast}} of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle. Partly as a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the navies finally engaged in the cramped Straits of Salamis. There, the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, and thus ensuring the Peloponnesus would not be outflanked.|$|E

25|$|The English Gothic revival style {{had become}} popular for Protestant church {{architecture}} in the British colonies, {{as it had}} in Britain itself, following the rise of the Oxford Movement—a school of Anglo-Catholic intellectuals who felt that medieval Gothic architecture inspired a greater spirituality than other styles based on non-Christian temples. The Roman Catholic Church, however, of which Petre was a member, wishing to be distinctive, adopted southern continental forms of Gothic and Renaissance architecture. Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church gave Petre his greatest opportunities of proving his worth as an architect by producing Cathedrals, Basilicas and churches in revived French and Italian styles.|$|E

From there, Mrs. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley (14) and Ronnie Shaver (10), and 17-year-old West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, traveled to the Fisher farm in an effort to locate whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boys had seen.|$|E

In 1595, the Riksdag of Söderköping elected Charles regent, and his attempt to force Klas Flemming, governor of Österland (Finland of the day), to submit to his authority, rather than to that of the king, provoked a civil war. Charles sought to increase his power and the king attempted to manage the situation by diplomacy over several years, until fed up, Sigismund got permission from the Commonwealth's legislature to pursue the matters dividing his Swedish subjects, and invaded with a mercenary army.|$|E

He is further critical of how the Holmes County sheriff's office handled the investigation, saying they should have treated it as a crime scene from the beginning. In particular, he claims, the lie detector test that Taran passed was inadequate, as it had consisted of only three questions (he says he later learned that a properly administered examination with the device should take over an hour), and that Kelly and Cronin should have been asked to take the test as well.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Laos {{moved toward}} {{independence}} from the French following World War II. Having {{paid little attention to}} fostering local government during their colonization of Laos, the French left a nation woefully short of expertise and leadership. Nor were the French successfully coping with a Lao communist insurrection sponsored by the Vietnamese communists at the time they left Laos. However, the United States, which had assumed an ever greater burden of funding the Royal Lao Government, assumed the counter-insurgency effort against the communists. The resultant Laotian Civil War predated the Vietnam War; unlike in Vietnam, the Laotian war had to be fought under an assumption of secrecy because of the existence of an international treaty, the Geneva Conference (1954). So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Central Intelligence Agency came to support and wage the Lao counter-insurgency.|$|E

500|$|Themistocles {{grew up in}} {{a period}} of {{upheaval}} in Athens. The tyrant Peisistratos had died in 527BC, passing power to his sons, Hipparchus and Hippias. Hipparchus was murdered in 514BC, and in response to this, Hippias became paranoid and started to rely increasingly on foreign mercenaries to keep a hold on power. The head of the powerful, but exiled (according to Herodotus only—the fragmentary Archon List for 525/4 shows a Cleisthenes, an Alcmaeonid, holding office in Athens during this period) Alcmaeonid family, Cleisthenes, began to scheme to overthrow Hippias and return to Athens. In 510BC, he persuaded the Spartan king Cleomenes I to launch an attack on Athens, which succeeded in overthrowing Hippias. However, in the aftermath, the other noble ('eupatrid') families of Athens rejected Cleisthenes, electing Isagoras as archon, with the support of Cleomenes. On a personal level, Cleisthenes wanted to return to Athens; however, he also probably wanted to prevent Athens becoming a Spartan client state. Outmaneuvering the other nobles, he proposed to the Athenian people a radical program in which political power would be invested in the peoplea [...] "democracy". The Athenian people thus overthrew Isagoras, repelled a Spartan attack under Cleomenes, and invited Cleisthenes to return to Athens, to put his plan into action. The establishment of the democracy was to radically change Athens:"And so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Athenians found themselves suddenly a great power...they gave vivid proof of what equality and freedom of speech might achieve" ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode an F and criticized the episode's plot and, most notably, its ending. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that the episode diluted the characters of Doggett and Scully in a [...] "mechanical plot", writing [...] "'Salvage' would never have made a great episode, but if it had only bothered {{to give a little}} more depth to Doggett and Scully, it might still have been an entertaining one." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris referred to the episode as an [...] "assembly line monster-of-the-week episode" [...] and criticized it for failing to make the audience truly empathetic to Ray Pearce's plight. However, Vitaris did praise the make-up in the episode, noting that [...] "that makeup is [...] William's performance [...] he is an astonishing sight." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B–". He applauded the way the guest star was allowed to [...] "take over" [...] the episode, but felt that the de-emphasis on Scully and Doggett rendered their scenes [...] "boring". Ultimately, VanDerWerff noted that the problem with <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two halves of the story—Dogget and Scully investigation, and Ray's plight—were largely unconnected.|$|E
