40|$|AbstractEnhanced Recovery After Surgery {{protocol}} in colorectal surgery allows shortening {{length of}} hospital stay and reducing complication rate. Despite the clear guidelines and conclusive evidence their full implementation {{and putting them}} into daily practice meets certain difficulties, especially in the early stage. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse the course of implementation of the ERAS protocol into daily practice on the basis of adherence to the protocol. Group included 92 patients (43 F/ 49 M) with colorectal cancer submitted to laparoscopic resection during the years 2013 - 2014. Perioperative care in all of them based on ERAS protocol consisting of 16 items. Its principles and discharge criteria were based on the guidelines of the ERAS Society guidelines. The entire analysed group of patients was divided into 3 subgroups (30 patients) depending on the time from ERAS protocol implementation. We analysed the compliance with the protocol and its influence on length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and readmission rate in different subgroups. The average compliance with the protocol differed significantly between groups and was 65 % in group 1, 83. 9 % in group 2 and 89. 6 % in group 3. The compliance with subsequent protocol elements was different. The length of stay and complication rate was statistically different in analysed subgroups. The whole group demonstrated an inverse correlation between compliance and length of stay. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the introduction of the ERAS protocol is a gradual process, and its compliance at the level of 80 % or more requires at least 30 patients and the period of about 6 months. The <b>initial</b> <b>derogation</b> from the assumed proceedings is inevitable and should not discourage further action. Particular emphasis in the initial stage should be put on continuous training of personnel of all specialties and continuous evaluation of the results...|$|E
