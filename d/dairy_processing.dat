5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were {{lacking the}} MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular <b>dairy</b> <b>processing.</b> However, more {{recent advances in}} technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat globule, allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form.

5|$|The {{content of}} MFGM in dairy {{products}} {{varies depending on}} the processing involved. During <b>dairy</b> <b>processing</b> such as churning or decreaming, the MFGM is disrupted and preferentially distributed into aqueous phases such as buttermilk, butter serum, or certain type of whey.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Arlington's largest {{employers}} remained its shingle mills and saw mills. Other industries, including <b>dairy</b> <b>processing,</b> mechanical shops, stores, and factories, became prominent after World War I, {{during a period}} of growth for the city. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced {{all but one of the}} mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; the young men built structures and conducted firefighting in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city's sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934.|$|E

[...] Dr. Gerber was based in Zürich, had studied at the University of Zürich, and worked for two years at the Swiss-American Milk Company in Little Falls, New York.

[...] Hunziker wrote several of the leading <b>dairy</b> <b>processing</b> texts, which continue to be cited. [...] After leaving Purdue University, Hunziker managed research and operations at a large, national condensary, continued to drive ADSA's standardization and publishing efforts, represented the U.S. at international dairy congresses, and facilitated dairy industry improvements across the globe.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{management}} of costs {{is used as}} a performance indicator by private companies in various sectors and, more recently, in public institutions, which offer free products and services to society. This article aimed to analyze the costs and revenues generated from the Production and Practice Labs (PPL) of Dairy Cattle and <b>Dairy</b> Products <b>Processing</b> from IFMG Campus Bambuí, to check the contribution of the revenues generated by these laboratories in reducing dependence on federal funds used to support these activities. The study was delimited with an investigation of the time series monthly revenues, costs and expenses of PPL analyzed from January 2012 to June 2014. The methodology used to determine the costs of Dairy Cattle production, was the operating cost and <b>Dairy</b> Products <b>Processing</b> cost absorption. The results demonstrate that both dairy farming as <b>dairy</b> products <b>processing</b> activity depended on federal funds to support them throughout the study period. The econometric analysis showed that domestic consumption revenue of Dairy Cattle PPL (domestic consumption of fresh dairy + animals for slaughter) was significant at 1 % to reduce dependence on federal funds. Therefore is seems that for every increase in R$ 1. 00 in the revenue of internal consumption from the dairy cattle lab reduced the deficit or transfer by the federation in R$ 1. 32...|$|R
