60|$|She {{stuck her}} hands {{deeply into the}} pockets of her <b>dust-coat,</b> and a china-blue eye {{regarded}} Melville from under the brim of the boldly trimmed bonnet.|$|E
60|$|And Billie Dore {{detached}} {{herself from}} the group, a trim vision in blue. She wore a <b>dust-coat</b> and a motor veil, and her eyes and cheeks were glowing from the fresh air.|$|E
6000|$|He murmured some indignant remark {{below his}} breath, and walked off. The shabby-looking {{passenger}} was pacing {{up and down}} the platform outside in a badly-made <b>dust-coat.</b> As they passed their lips moved. The Count's seemed to mutter, 'C'est un coup manqué.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{these are}} but experiments. All {{things in this}} new land are moving farther on: the wine-vats and the miner's {{blasting}} tools but picket for a night, like Bedouin pavilions; and to-morrow, to fresh woods! This stir of change and these perpetual echoes of the moving footfall, haunt the land. Men move eternally, still chasing Fortune; and, fortune found, still wander. As we drove back to Calistoga, the road lay empty of mere passengers, but its green side was dotted with the camps of travelling families: one cumbered with a great waggonful of household stuff, settlers going to occupy a ranche they had taken up in Mendocino, or perhaps Tehama County; another, a party in <b>dust-coats,</b> men and women, whom we found camped in a grove on the roadside, all on pleasure bent, with a Chinaman to cook for them, and who waved their hands to us as we drove by.|$|R
6000|$|Each pony had his sais, his groom, {{who lived}} and ate and slept with the animal, and had betted {{a good deal}} more than he could afford on the result of the game. There was no chance of {{anything}} going wrong, but to make sure, each sais was shampooing the legs of his pony to the last minute. Behind the saises sat as many of the Skidars' regiment as had leave to attend the match--about half the native officers, and a hundred or two dark, black-bearded men with the regimental pipers nervously fingering the big, beribboned bagpipes. The Skidars were what they call a Pioneer regiment, and the bagpipes made the national music of half their men. The native officers held bundles of polo-sticks, long cane-handled mallets, and as the grand stand filled after lunch they arranged themselves by ones and twos at different points round the ground, so that if a stick were broken the player would not have far to ride for a new one. An impatient British Cavalry Band struck up [...] "If {{you want to know the}} time, ask a p'leeceman!" [...] and the two umpires in light <b>dust-coats</b> danced out on two little excited ponies. The four players of the Archangels' team followed, and the sight of their beautiful mounts made Shiraz groan again.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Love of the Empire,' I answered, as Mr. Lingnam tripped up in <b>dust-coat</b> and binoculars. 'Now, Mr. Lingnam {{will tell}} us exactly {{what he wants to}} see. He {{probably}} knows more about England {{than the rest of us}} put together.' ...|$|E
60|$|The boys, now six in number, {{raised a}} slight cheer; for {{at that moment}} Mr. Lavender, in a broad-brimmed grey felt hat and a holland <b>dust-coat,</b> came out through his garden-gate {{carrying}} a pile of newspapers and pamphlets so large that his feet, legs, and hat alone were visible.|$|E
60|$|Both set to work, in {{the wind}} and rain. It was far from a {{pleasant}} task, {{and despite the fact that}} each had donned a <b>dust-coat,</b> both were pretty well soaked before the limb was gotten away from the car. Then Roger made another inspection of the automobile.|$|E
60|$|It {{was clear}} that his voice faltered. We felt {{at least he was}} a man of feeling. He was {{obviously}} frightened. His coolness forsook him. He shook hands as in a dream, and rushed downstairs for his <b>dust-coat.</b> Almost as he closed the front door, a new guest entered, just missing him in the vestibule.|$|E
60|$|Here she {{not only}} {{procured}} food and whiskey, but added a long <b>dust-coat</b> and hat of her father's to her burden. They {{would serve as a}} disguise for him and hide that heroic figure, which she thought everybody must now know as she did. Then she rejoined him breathlessly. But he put the food and whiskey aside.|$|E
6000|$|Oswald {{did as he}} {{was told}} without demur, and in about a minute more {{presented}} himself again, with the mark of the Beast certainly most effectually obliterated, at least so far as outer appearance went. His blue tie, light <b>dust-coat,</b> and borrowed grey trousers, made up an ensemble much more like an omnibus conductor out for a holiday than a gentleman of the period in correct evening dress. 'Now mind,' Ernest said seriously, as he opened the door, 'whatever you do, Oswald, if you stew to death for it--and Schurz's rooms are often very close and hot, I can assure you--don't for heaven's sake go and unbutton your <b>dust-coat.</b> If you do they'll see at once you're a wolf in sheep's clothing, and I shouldn't be at all surprised if they were to turn and rend you. At least, I'm sure Max would be very much annoyed with me for unsocially introducing a plutocratic traitor into the bosom of the fold.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lavender {{put it down}} in a glow of exultation. [...] "I shall {{translate}} {{words into}} action," [...] he thought; [...] "I shall at once visit a rural district where German prisoners {{are working on the}} land, and see that the farmers do their duty." [...] And, forgetting in his excitement to eat his breakfast, he put the journal in his pocket, wrapped himself in his <b>dust-coat</b> and broad-brimmed hat, and went out to his car, which was drawn up, with Blink, who had not forgotten her last experience, inside.|$|E
6000|$|For {{an instant}} he was sorely tempted {{to lift his}} eyes to her face, but he checked himself; then he gently took her <b>dust-coat</b> from her {{shoulders}} and shook it out, wiped the dust from her face and eyes with his own handkerchief, held her hat and blew the dust from it with a vivid memory of performing the same service for Mrs. Horncastle only an hour before, while she arranged her hair; and then, lifting her again into the buggy, said quietly, as he took his seat beside her and grasped the reins:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{walked along}} briskly in the {{direction}} of Marylebone, and stopped at last at a dull, yellow-washed house, which bore on its door a very dingy brass plate, inscribed in red letters, 'M. et Mdlle. Tirard. Salon de Danse.' Ernest opened the door without ringing, and turned down the passage towards the salon. 'Remember,' he said, turning to Harry Oswald by way of a last warning, with his hand on the inner door-handle, 'coûte que coûte, my dear fellow, don't on any account open your <b>dust-coat.</b> No anti-social opinions; and please bear in mind that Max is, in his own way, a potentate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, my dear fellow, we must rectify you, anyhow, {{before you}} go. Let me see; luckily you've got your <b>dust-coat</b> on, and you needn't take that off; it'll do splendidly to hide your coat and waistcoat. I'll lend you a blue tie, which will at once {{transform}} your upper man entirely. But you show the cloven hoof below; the trousers will surely betray you. They're absolutely inadmissible {{under any circumstances}} whatsoever, as the Court Circular says, and you must positively wear a coloured pair of Herbert's instead of them. Run upstairs quickly, there's a good fellow, {{and get rid of}} the mark of the Beast as fast as you can.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned and}} looked at me. [...] "Ha, old Ten Per Cent!" [...] he called out, struggling. [...] "It's you, then, is it? Never, never to you, sir!" [...] And as he spoke, he somehow flung his arms {{straight}} out behind him, and let the <b>dust-coat</b> slip off, which it easily did, the sleeves being new and smoothly silk-lined. The suddenness of the movement threw me completely off my guard, and off my legs as well. I was clinging to the coat and holding him. As the support gave way I rolled over backward, in the mud of the street, and hurt my back seriously. As for Colonel Clay, with a nervous laugh, he bolted off at full speed in his evening coat, and vanished round a corner.|$|E
6000|$|Never {{before in}} our lives had we had such a close shave of {{catching}} and fixing the redoubtable swindler. We burst down the stairs in a body, and rushed out into Fifth Avenue. The pretended poet had only a hundred yards' start of us, and he saw he was discovered. But he was an excellent runner. So was I, weight for age; and I dashed wildly after him. He turned round a corner; it proved to lead nowhere, and lost him time. He darted back again, madly. Delighted {{with the idea that}} I was capturing so famous a criminal, I redoubled my efforts--and came up with him, panting. He was wearing a light <b>dust-coat.</b> I seized it in my hands. [...] "I've got you at last!" [...] I cried; [...] "Colonel Clay, I've got you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be, and scootin' out o' this," [...] said Breckenridge grimly. [...] "It's {{all very well}} to 'know nothin';' but here Phil Larrabee's friends hev just picked him up, drilled through with slugs and deader nor a crow, and now they're lettin' loose Larrabee's two half-brothers on you. And you must go like a derned fool and leave these yer things behind you in the bresh," [...] he went on querulously, lifting Madison Clay's <b>dust-coat,</b> hat, and shotgun from his horse, which stood saddled at the door. [...] "Luckily I picked {{them up in the}} woods comin' here. Ye ain't got more than time to get over the state line and among your folks thar afore they'll be down on you. Hustle, old man! What are you gawkin' and starin' at?" ...|$|E
60|$|He did,--holding her rather tightly, I fear, as they clambered up the {{remaining}} slope, for {{it seemed to}} him as a last embrace. As he lifted her to the road bank, the shouts came nearer; and glancing up, he saw two men and a woman running down the hill toward them. He turned to Eugenia. In that instant she had slipped the tattered <b>dust-coat</b> from her shoulder, thrown it over her arm, set her hat straight, and was calmly awaiting them with a self-possession and coolness that seemed to shame their excitement. He noticed, too, with the quick perception of unimportant things which comes to some natures at such moments, that she had plucked a sprig of wild myrtle from the mountain side, and was wearing it on her breast.|$|E
60|$|These mysterious {{articles}} were followed, however, by others which were more within their range of comprehension--by {{a pair of}} dumb-bells, a purple cricket-bag, a set of golf clubs, and a tennis racket. Finally, when the cabman, all top-heavy and bristling, had staggered off up the garden path, there emerged in a very leisurely way from the cab a big, powerfully built young man, with a bull pup under one arm and a pink sporting paper in his hand. The paper he crammed {{into the pocket of}} his light yellow <b>dust-coat,</b> and extended his hand as if to assist some one else from the vehicle. To the surprise of the two old ladies, however, the only thing which his open palm received was a violent slap, and a tall lady bounded unassisted out of the cab. With a regal wave she motioned the young man towards the door, and then with one hand upon her hip she stood in a careless, lounging attitude by the gate, kicking her toe against the wall and listlessly awaiting the return of the driver.|$|E
6000|$|... "O ETERNAL GULLIBLE!--Since I saw you on Lake George, I {{have run}} back to London, and {{promptly}} come out again. I had business to transact there, indeed, which I have now completed; the excessive attentions of the English police sent me once more, like great Orion, [...] "sloping slowly to the west." [...] I returned to America {{in order to see}} whether or not you were still impenitent. On the day of my arrival I happened to meet Senator Wrengold, and accepted his kind invitation solely that I might see how far my last communication had had a proper effect upon you. As I found you quite obdurate, and as you furthermore persisted in misunderstanding my motives, I determined to read you one more small lesson. It nearly failed; and I confess the accident has affected my nerves a little. I am now about to retire from business altogether, and settle down for life at my place in Surrey. I mean to try just one more small coup; and, when that is finished, Colonel Clay will hang up his sword, like Cincinnatus, and take to farming. You need no longer fear me. I have realised enough to secure me for life a modest competence; and as I am not possessed like yourself with an immoderate greed of gain, I recognise that good citizenship demands of me now an early retirement in favour of some younger and more deserving rascal. I shall always look back with pleasure upon our agreeable adventures together; and as you hold my <b>dust-coat,</b> together with a ring and letter to which I attach importance, I consider we are quits, and I shall withdraw with dignity. Your sincere well-wisher, CUTHBERT CLAY, Poet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Joe," [...] said Mr. Lavender to his {{surprised}} chauffeur, [...] "serve my lunch. Give me a large helping, and a {{glass of}} ale." [...] And, paler than his holland <b>dust-coat,</b> he sat resolutely down on the bole of a beech, with Blink on her haunches beside him. While Joe was filling a plate with pigeon-pie and pouring out a glass of foaming Bass, Mr. Lavender stared at the three Germans and suffered the tortures of the damned. [...] "I will not flinch," [...] he thought; [...] "God helping me, I certainly will not flinch. Nothing shall prevent my going through with it." [...] And his eyes, more prominent than a hunted rabbit's, watched the approach of Joe with the plate and glass. The three men also followed the movements of the chauffeur, and it seemed to Mr. Lavender that their eyes were watering. [...] "Courage!" [...] he murmured to himself, transfixing a succulent morsel with his fork and conveying it to his lips. For fully a minute he revolved the tasty mouthful, which he could not swallow, while the three men's eyes watched him with a sort of lugubrious surprise. [...] "If," [...] he thought with anguish, [...] "if I were a prisoner in Germany! Come, come! One effort, it's only the first mouthful!" [...] and with a superhuman effort, he swallowed. [...] "Look at me!" [...] he cried to the three Germans, [...] "look at me! I--I--I'm going to be sick!" [...] and putting down his plate, he rose and staggered forward. [...] "Joe," [...] he said in a dying voice, [...] "feed these poor men, feed them; make them drink; feed them!" [...] And rushing headlong {{to the edge of the}} grove, he returned what he had swallowed--to the great interest of Brink. Then, waving away the approach of Joe, and consumed with shame and remorse at his lack of heroism, he ran and hid himself in a clump of hazel bushes, trying to slink into the earth. [...] "No," [...] he thought; [...] "no; I am not for public life. I have failed at the first test. Was ever so squeamish an exhibition? I have betrayed my country and the honour of public life. These Germans are now full of beer and pigeon-pie. What am I but a poltroon, unworthy to lace the shoes of the great leaders of my land? The sun has witnessed my disgrace." ...|$|E
