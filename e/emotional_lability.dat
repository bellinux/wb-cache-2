5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. <b>Emotional</b> <b>lability</b> leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E

50|$|Nonsuicidal self-injury {{disorder}} (NSSID) is {{a mental}} disorder {{that refers to}} the deliberate destruction of the surface of ones own body without suicidal intent. These behaviors include cutting, burning, scraping skin, hitting, and biting oneself and are primarily inflicted to cause bleeding, bruising, or pain. Individuals engage in these behaviors with no intent to end their life, but instead {{with the expectation that}} the injury will cause minor or moderate physical pain. Studies have found that compared to adults and children, the prevalence of NSSI is highest among adolescents, with an estimation of 14 to 15% in community samples, and 40% in psychiatric samples engaging in NSSI. The prevalence of NSSI among adolescents could be due to the heightened <b>emotional</b> reactivity and <b>lability</b> experienced by adolescents during a period of development in which key neurobiological changes are occurring.|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms that}} control the range and stability of emotions are unknown, yet this knowledge is critical for understanding mood disorders, especially bipolar illness. Here, we show that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulates these features of emotional responsiveness. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing GR specifically in forebrain. These mice display {{a significant increase in}} anxiety-like and depressant-like behaviors relative to wild type. Yet, they are also supersensitive to antidepressants and show enhanced sensitization to cocaine. Thus, mice overexpressing GR in forebrain have a consistently wider than normal range of reactivity in both positive and negative emotionality tests. This phenotype is associated, in specific brain regions, with increased expression of genes relevant to emotionality: corticotropin-releasing hormone, serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine transporters, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine 1 A receptor. Thus, GR overexpression in forebrain causes higher “emotional lability” secondary to a unique pattern of molecular regulation. This finding suggests that natural variations in GR gene expression can contribute to the fine-tuning of <b>emotional</b> stability or <b>lability</b> and {{may play a role in}} bipolar disorder...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Hepatitis C virus {{infection}} is a slowly progressive chronic {{disease and the}} most common cause of chronic liver disease. Presently, interferon alfa based therapies, with or without ribavirin, are standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The most troublesome psychiatric side effects of interferon therapy in our patients are: insomnia, irritability, anxiety, mood changes, short temper, <b>emotional</b> and affective <b>lability,</b> impaired cognitive function, apathy, loss of motivation and the most serious depression with or without suicidal ideas. Material and methods In our study we treated 82 patients chronically infected with HCV divided into 3 groups: the first group of 31 patients (20 male and 11 female) received IFN-alfa in standard doses of 3 MU three times a week (t. i. w) during 24 weeks; the second group of 36 patients (25 male and 11 female) received IFN-alfa, 3 MU t. i. w plus ribavirin 1000 - 1200 mg per day during 24 weeks; the third group of 15 patients (11 male and 4 female) received IFN-alfa, 3 MU t. i. w plus ribavirin 1000 - 1200 mg per day during 48 weeks. The follow-up period after therapy in all groups lasted 24 weeks. Results During treatment, we observed at least one psychiatric side effect in 21 (26 %) patients: insomnia in 11 (13 %), <b>emotional</b> and affective <b>lability</b> in 9 (11 %), anxiety, irritability and short temper in 8 (10 %), impaired cognitive function in 7 (8 %) apathia and loss of motivation in 6 (7 %) treated patients. Depression, the most serious side effect, was established in 8 (10 %) patients. All of these side effects were observed during later stages of treatment (between 5 th and 22 nd weeks of treatment). The incidence of all psychiatric side effects was significantly higher in women than in men (p < 0, 01). We observed higher prevalence of depression among patients with history of alcohol and drug abuse. Treatment was temporarily discontinued (from 2 to 4 weeks) in all patients with depression, but it was not permanently discontinuated in any patient due to psychiatric side effects. Conclusion Interferon causes psychiatric disorders that are usually mild and reversible. They disappear either spontaneously, while patients are still receiving therapy or after temporary cessation of interferon alfa therapy. ...|$|R

ASD were reported predominantly in congenital and early childhood forms of DM 1. We describe dizygotic twin boys with ASD who were referred for routine laboratory genetic testing and in whom karyotyping, FMR 1 gene testing, and single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis yielded negative results. The father of the boys was later diagnosed with suspected DM 1, and testing revealed characteristic DMPK gene expansions in his genome {{as well as in}} the genomes of both twins and their elder brother, who also suffered from ASD. In accord with previous reports on childhood forms of DM 1, our patients showed prominent neuropsychiatric phenotypes characterized especially by hypotonia, developmental and language delay, <b>emotional</b> and affective <b>lability,</b> lowered adaptability, and social withdrawal. The experience with this family and multiple literature reports of ASD in DM 1 on the one side but the lack of literature data on the frequency of DMPK gene expansions in ASD patients on the other side prompted us to screen the DMPK gene in a sample of 330 patients with ASD who were first seen by a geneticist before they were 10 years of age, before the muscular weakness, which may signal DM 1, usually becomes obvious. The absence of any DMPK gene expansions in this cohort indicates that targeted DMPK gene testing can be recommended only in ASD patients with specific symptoms or family history suggestive of DM 1.

40|$|Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), {{as defined}} by the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000), is a {{multifaceted}} mental illness characterized by pervasive instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, affect and behavior. Despite a growing consensus that the etiological basis of BPD stems from a combination of biological vulnerability and an early developmental history characterized by invalidation, abuse and/or neglect (e. g., Clarkin, Marziali, & Munroe-Blum, 1991; Linehan, 1993), the reasons for the diversity of troubling symptoms (e. g., self-injury, suicidality, mood reactivity, relationship difficulties) remain unclear. Psychopathology theorists differ in their conceptualization of the fundamental problems (e. g., impulsivity vs. identity disturbance vs. emotion dysregulation) underlying BPD and {{further research is needed to}} clarify which features are central to the maintenance of the difficulties associated with the disorder. In the current research, the some of the tenets of Linehan’s (1993) biosocial theory of BPD and the core constructs implicated in her conceptualization of the disorder were explored empirically in several samples of undergraduate university students. According to the biosocial theory, difficulties regulating emotions represent the core pathology in the disorder and contribute causally to the development and expression of all other BPD features. The emotional dysregulation is proposed to emerge from transactional interactions between individuals with biological vulnerabilities (i. e., a highly arousable temperament, sensitive to both positive and negative emotional stimuli) and specific environmental influences (i. e., a childhood environment that invalidates their emotional experience). The theory asserts that the dysregulation affects all aspects of emotional responding, resulting in (i) heightened emotional sensitivity, (ii) intense and more frequent responses to emotional stimuli, and (iii) slow return to emotional baseline. Furthermore, Linehan proposed that individuals with BPD lack clarity with respect to their emotions, have difficulties tolerating intense affect, and engage in maladaptive and inadequate emotion modulation strategies. As a result of their dysfunctional response patterns during emotionally challenging events, individuals with BPD fail to learn how to solve the problems contributing to these emotional reactions. In accordance with this theory, a number of hypotheses were tested. First, it was hypothesized that the interaction between temperamental sensitivity and an adverse childhood environment would predict BPD features over and above that predicted by either construct independently. Second, it was hypothesized that BPD traits would be predicted by high levels of <b>emotional</b> dysregulation (affect <b>lability),</b> problems across different aspects of emotional experience (e. g., intensity, awareness, clarity), and deficits in emotion regulation skills (e. g., poor distress tolerance, self-soothing). Based on the initial findings of the research, a series of competing hypotheses were tested that addressed the nature of the emotional, cognitive and motivational mechanisms that may underlie maladaptive behavior in BPD more directly. Prior to testing these hypotheses, it was important to select a set of measures that would best represent these constructs within an undergraduate population. The purpose of Studies 1 a and 1 b (N = 147 and N = 56, respectively) was to determine the reliability and validity of a series of self-report measures that assess BPD features and to select one questionnaire with high sensitivity (percentage of cases correctly identified) and high specificity (percentage of noncases correctly identified) as a screener for BPD within undergraduate students by comparing the results of the questionnaires against a “gold standard” criterion diagnosis of BPD (as assessed by two semi-structured interviews: DIB-R and IPDE-I). The second goal of these studies was to conduct a preliminary exploratory analysis of the association of scores on the BPD measures and constructs that have been hypothesized to be relevant to the development and maintenance of BPD symptoms (e. g., “Big Five” personality factors, emotional experience, impulsivity). Overall, the findings of Studies 1 a and 1 b indicated that screening for BPD in an undergraduate population is feasible and there are several questionnaires that may help in the identification of participants for future studies. Specifically, the McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSI-BPD; Zanarini et al., 2003), International Personality Disorder Examination DSM-IV Screening Questionnaire (IPDE-S; Loranger, 1999) and Borderline Personality Questionnaire (BPQ; Poreh et al., 2006) were all found to be internally consistent and valid screening measures. Furthermore, the results of correlation and regression analyses between dimensions of the “Big Five” and scores on the BPD measures were consistent with previous findings in the literature that BPD is associated with higher scores on neuroticism, lower scores on agreeableness, and to a lesser degree, lower scores on conscientiousness and extraversion. The similarity in results between the current and past studies suggested that individuals in the present samples showed characteristics consistent with that seen in both clinical and nonclinical populations with BPD traits. The results also provided support for the notion that individuals with BPD have a lower threshold (i. e., greater sensitivity) for both sensory and affective stimuli, as well as higher amplitude of emotional response (i. e., greater reactivity) to such stimuli. Furthermore, the findings suggested that those with BPD traits may lack understanding of their emotional state, may be unable to effectively regulate their emotional state, and that their impulsive behavior may be driven by negative affect. The purpose of Study 2 (N = 225) was to test some of the specific tenets of Linehan’s (1993) biosocial theory. The results suggested that BPD traits are associated with numerous dimensions of temperament [e. g., higher levels of negative affect; lower levels of positive affect; lower levels of effortful control; low sensory threshold (i. e., greater sensitivity) for both sensory and affective stimuli; ease of excitation (i. e., greater reactivity to sensory and affective stimuli) ] and childhood environment (e. g., authoritarian parenting style, invalidating parenting, neglect, abuse). An examination of the interactions between dimensions of temperament and childhood environment suggested that interactions between (i) ease of excitation (greater reactivity to sensory and affective stimuli) and environment and (ii) trait negative affect and environment, predicted BPD symptoms over and above the temperament and environment variables alone. The results also suggested that a number of other factors are associated with BPD symptoms, including: increased attention to (or absorption in) emotional states, poor <b>emotional</b> clarity, affect <b>lability</b> (particularly anger), poor distress tolerance, and negative urgency (impulsive behavior in the context of negative affect). The association between BPD symptoms and difficulties identifying feelings seemed to be mediated by affect lability and negative urgency. Self-soothing and self-attacking did not predict BPD traits over and above the other variables. Wagner and Linehan (1999) also proposed that the intense emotions (and emotional dysregulation) experienced by those with BPD interferes with cognitive functioning and effective problem solving, resulting in poor decisions and the observed harmful behaviors. Other researchers have suggested that the repetitive, self-damaging behavior occurring in the context of BPD may reflect impairments in planning and failure to consider future consequences (e. g., van Reekum et al., 1994). Proponents of this view suggest that individuals with BPD show greater intensity and <b>lability</b> in their <b>emotional</b> response to their environment because they are unable to inhibit or moderate their emotional urges (i. e., impulsivity is at the core of the disorder). The purpose of Study 3 (N = 220) was to characterize decision making in an undergraduate sample of individuals with BPD traits and to ascertain the relative contribution of individual differences in the following areas to any deficits identified in decision making: emotional experience (e. g., increased affective reactivity or lability); reinforcement sensitivity (e. g., sensitivity to reward and/or punishment); impulsivity; executive functioning (measured by an analogue version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test); and reversal learning. Decision making was assessed using modified versions of two Iowa Gambling Tasks (IGT-ABCD and IGT-EFGH; Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1994; Bechara, Tranel, & Damasio, 2000) that included reversal learning components (i. e., Turnbull et al., 2006). The results of Study 3 showed that participants in the BPD group demonstrated deficits in decision-making as measured by the IGT-ABCD but not on the IGT-EFGH. The results [interpreted in the context of reinforcement sensitivity models, the somatic marker hypothesis (Damasio, 1994) and the “frequency of gain” model e. g., Chiu et al. 2008) ] suggested that decision making under uncertainty may be guided by gain-loss frequency rather than long-term outcome for individuals with BPD traits. The results failed to show consistent associations between BPD symptoms and performance on either version of the IGT. Individual differences in emotional experience, executive functioning or reversal learning did not account for the decision-making problems of the BPD group on the IGT-ABCD...|$|R

2500|$|While {{people with}} BPD feel {{euphoria}} (ephemeral or occasional intense joy), they are especially prone to dysphoria (a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction), depression, and/or feelings of {{mental and emotional}} distress. Zanarini et al. recognized four categories of dysphoria that are typical of this condition: extreme emotions, destructiveness or self-destructiveness, feeling fragmented or lacking identity, and feelings of victimization. Within these categories, a BPD diagnosis is strongly associated {{with a combination of}} three specific states: feeling betrayed, [...] "feeling like hurting myself", and feeling out of control. Since there is great variety in the types of dysphoria experienced by people with BPD, the amplitude of the distress is a helpful indicator of borderline personality disorder. In addition to intense emotions, people with BPD experience emotional [...] "lability"; or in other words, changeability. Although the term <b>emotional</b> <b>lability</b> suggests rapid changes between depression and elation, the mood swings in people with this condition actually fluctuate more frequently between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety.|$|E
2500|$|PCS, which shares {{symptoms}} with {{a variety}} of other conditions, is highly likely to be misdiagnosed in people with these conditions. [...] Cognitive and affective symptoms that occur following a traumatic injury may be attributed to mTBI, but in fact be due to another factor such as post-traumatic stress disorder, which is easily misdiagnosed as PCS and vice versa. [...] Affective disorders such as depression have some symptoms that can mimic those of PCS and lead to a wrongful diagnosis of the latter; these include problems with concentration, <b>emotional</b> <b>lability,</b> anxiety, and sleep problems. Depression, which is highly common in persistent PCS, can worsen other PCS symptoms, such as headaches and problems with concentration, memory, and sleep. PCS also shares symptoms with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and exposure to certain toxins. Traumatic brain injury may cause damage to the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, and deficiencies of pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism) can cause similar symptoms to post-concussion syndrome; in these cases, symptoms can be treated by replacing any hormones that are deficient.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{support for}} the Freudian model comes from {{findings}} of high rates of childhood sexual abuse in conversion patients. [...] Support for the dissociation model comes from studies showing heightened suggestibility in conversion patients,. However, critics argue {{that it can be}} challenging to find organic pathologies for all symptoms, and so the practice of diagnosing patients who suffered with such symptoms as having hysteria led to the disorder being meaningless, vague and a sham-diagnosis, as it does not refer to any definable disease. Furthermore, throughout its history, many patients have been misdiagnosed with hysteria or conversion disorder when they had organic disorders such as tumours or epilepsy or vascular diseases. This has led to patient deaths, a lack of appropriate care and suffering for the patients. Eliot Slater, after studying the condition in the 1950s, stated: [...] "The diagnosis of 'hysteria' is all too often a way of avoiding a confrontation with our own ignorance. This is especially dangerous when there is an underlying organic pathology, not yet recognised. In this penumbra we find patients who know themselves to be ill but, coming up against the blank faces of doctors who refuse to believe in the reality of their illness, proceed by way of <b>emotional</b> <b>lability,</b> overstatement and demands for attention ... Here is an area where catastrophic errors can be made. In fact it is often possible to recognise the presence though not the nature of the unrecognisable, to know that a man must be ill or in pain when all the tests are negative. But it is only possible to those who come to their task in a spirit of humility. In the main the diagnosis of 'hysteria' applies to a disorder of the doctor–patient relationship. It is evidence of non-communication, of a mutual misunderstanding ... We are, often, unwilling to tell the full truth or to admit to ignorance ... Evasions, even untruths, on the doctor’s side are among the most powerful and frequently used methods he has for bringing about an efflorescence of 'hysteria'".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders and mental disorder symptoms in Graves' disease (and thyroid disease in general), which {{are similar to those}} in patients with organic brain disease. These manifestations are diverse, affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. The vast majority of patients with hyperthyroidism meet criteria for some psychiatric disorders, and those with milder presentations are probably not entirely free of mental symptoms such as <b>emotional</b> <b>lability,</b> tension, depression and anxiety. Anxiety syndromes related to hyperthyroidism are typically complicated by major depression and cognitive decline, such as in memory and attention. Some studies contradict the psychological findings. For example, a large 2002 study found [...] "no statistical association between thyroid dysfunction, and the presence of depression or anxiety disorder." [...] In one study on hospitalised elderly patients, over half had cognitive impairment with either dementia or confusion. However, a controlled study on 31 Graves' disease patients found that while patients had subjective reports of cognitive deficits in the toxic phase of Graves' thyrotoxicosis, formal testing found no cognitive impairment and suggested the reported symptoms may reflect the affective and somatic manifestations of hyperthyroidism. Notably, a literature review of 2006 notes methodology issues in the consistency of Graves' disease diagnostic criteria, which might explain the apparently contradicting findings. These researchers found many reports about residual complaints in patients who were euthyroid after treatment, with a high prevalence of anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder, as well as elevated scores on scales of anxiety, depression and psychological distress.
