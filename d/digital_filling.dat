The CRT used was a low-cost entertainment-quality television tube, and hence had a very poor deflection band width. Settling time for the CRT system was about 10 microseconds. A technique was developed and made operational which displayed a whole dot-matrix character in a time which was less than one settling time of the display system. It is an application of the existing technique called sinusoidal scan to the display of dot-matrix characters. A data compression technique was also invented and implemented. It allows up to a 75 percent reduction {{in the size of}} the stored character tables which are normally associated with dot-matrix displays. The technique involves a <b>digital</b> algorithm which <b>fills</b> in dots between given dots in a matrix.

40|$|Assessment of {{engineering}} status of railway tunnels {{with a long}} working lifespan causes the necessity of definition of the actual stress-strain state of construction design, {{taking into account the}} results of inspection of its engineering status. static analysis of lining in this case is performed by finite elements method. In the article the example of such analysis is given. The tunnel is strengthened by the composite tunnel lining consisting of an inner layer of masonry body and a shotcrete outer layer built while rebuilding operation. In response to the inspection considerable variances of the actual lining concrete power of resistance from design value have been revealed, as well as local destructions of a lining and internal voids. It has been estimated that influence of lining concrete resistance power nonhomogeneity leads to decrease in carrying capacity on average by 17. 3 %. Consideration of inner and outer defects can reduce the carrying capacity by 2 - 3 times. While that sort of assessment not always allows to reveal dangerous processes in the considered geotechnical system and to realize effective protection measures promptly. In this case it is reasonable to use information modeling on the basis of BIM technologies. In relation to railway tunnels the further enhancement is needed. The following sequence {{of engineering}} status assessment of a tunnel while information modeling is proposed: carrying out essential geotechnical and geophysical researches on the route of a tunnel; tunnel structures monitoring system development and deployment, collection and analysis of data; regular control of a tunnel by the railcar with the measuring station; creation of a tunnel <b>digital</b> model, <b>filling</b> it with data, regular updating and checking calculations; development and implementation of essential repair actions...|$|R

I didn’t find the billboard especially interesting, but {{one of my friends}} hails from Kohler, Wisconsin, and I thought he might enjoy seeing that his hometown is known in a Chinese city that I’m fairly certain he had never heard of before I announced I would be spending the summer there. At the time, I didn’t give much thought to the billboard itself, or the thousands of other advertisements affixed to the sides of buildings, encircling construction sites, or coating the exteriors of Hangzhou’s buses. They simply surrounded me, providing a backdrop for the city’s more compelling sights; the moody and misty West Lake, I thought, was far more photogenic than the façades of the luxury car dealerships lining its shore.

That massive wave of electronic devices will also invade everyday objects, turning them into smart entities, keeping their native features and characteristics while seamlessly promoting them to {{a new class of}} thinking and reasoning everyday objects. Although there are strong expectations that most of the users’ needs can be fulfilled without their intervention, there are still situations where interaction is required. This paper presents work being done in the field of human-computer interaction, focusing on smart home environments, while being a part of a larger project called Aging Inside a Smart Home. This initiative arose as {{a way to deal with}} a large scourge of our country, where lots of elderly persons live alone in their homes, often with limited or no physical mobility. The project relies on the mobile agent computing paradigm in order to create a Virtual Butler that provides the interface between the elderly and the smart home infrastructure. The Virtual Butler is receptive to user questions, answering them according to the context and knowledge of the AISH. It is also capable of interacting with the user whenever it senses that something has gone wrong, notifying next of kin and/or medical services, etc. The Virtual Butler is aware of the user location and moves to the computing device which is closest to the user, in order to be always present.

For mission scientist, planning a research aircraft mission within the context of meeting the science objective is a complex task because it requires real time situational awareness of the weather conditions that affect the aircraft track. Multiple aircraft are often involved in the NASA field campaigns the coordination of the aircraft with satellite overpasses, other airplanes and the constantly evolving dynamic weather conditions often determine the success of the campaign. A flight planning tool is needed to provide situational awareness information to the mission scientist and help them plan and modify the flight tracks successfully. Scientists at the University of Alabama Huntsville and the NASA Marshal Space Flight Center developed the Waypoint Planning Tool (WPT), an interactive software tool that enables scientist to develop their own flight plans (also known as waypoints), with point and click mouse capabilities on a <b>digital</b> map <b>filled</b> with time raster and vector data. The development of this Waypoint Planning Tool demonstrates the significance of mission support in responding to the challenges presented during NASA field campaigns. Analyses during and after each campaign helped identify both issues and new requirements, initiating the next wave of development. Currently the Waypoint Planning Tool has gone through three rounds of development and analysis processes. The development of this waypoint tool is directly affected by the technology advances on GIS/Mapping technologies. From the standalone Google Earth application and simple KML functionalities to the Google Earth Plugin and Java Web Start/Applet on web platform, {{as well as to the}} rising open source GIS tools with new JavaScript frameworks, the Waypoint planning Tool has entered its third phase of technology advancement.

40|$|Purpose Thallous (201 Tl) {{chloride}} is a single-photon emission {{computed tomography}} (SPECT) tracer mainly used for assessing perfusion and viability of myocardial tissue. 201 Tl emits X-rays around 72 keV and gammas at 167 keV, {{and has a}} half-life of 73 h. Regulations allow an intrinsic contamination up to 3 – 5 %, which is mainly caused by 200 Tl (368 keV; 26 h) and by 202 Tl (439 keV; 12. 2 days). Contra-intuitive to the low-level percentages in which these contaminants are present, their impact may be significant because of much higher gamma camera sensitivity for these high-energy photon emissions. Therefore, we investigate {{the effects of the}} contaminants in terms of detected fractions of photons in projections and contrast degradation in reconstructed images. Methods Acquisitions of a <b>digital</b> thorax phantom <b>filled</b> with thallous (201 Tl) chloride were simulated with a validated Monte Carlo tool, thereby, modelling 1 % of contamination by 200 Tl and 202 Tl each. In addition, measurements of a thorax phantom on a dual-headed gamma camera were performed. The product used was contaminated by 0. 17 % of 200 Tl and 0. 24 % of 202 Tl at activity reference time (ART). This ART is specified by the manufacturer, thereby, accounting for the difference in half-lives of 201 Tl and its contaminants. These measurements were repeated at different dates associated with various contamination levels. Results Simulations showed that, with 1 % of 200 Tl and 202 Tl, the total contamination in the 72 keV window can rise up to one out of three detected photons. For the 167 keV window, the contamination is even more pronounced: more than four out of five detections in this photopeak window originate from contaminants. Measurements indicate that cold lesion contrast in myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging is at maximum close to ART. In addition to a higher noise level, relative contrast decreases 15 % 2 days early to ART, which is explained by an increase in 200 Tl contamination. After ART, contrast decreased by 16 % when the 202 Tl contamination increased to the maximal allowed limit. Conclusions Contra-intuitive to the low-level percentages in which they are typically present, penetration and downscatter of high-energy photons from 200 Tl and 202 Tl significantly contribute to thallous (201 Tl) chloride images, thereby, reducing contrast and adding noise. These findings may prompt for improved production methods, for updated policies with regard to timing of usage, and they also render the usefulness of adding the high photopeak window (167 keV) questionable. A window-based correction method for this contamination is advisabl...|$|R

In this study we will investigate how selected profiles use Instagram to communicate their personal brands. The study is restricted to examining the Instagram accounts of four known Swedish profiles: Fredrik Eklund, Zara Larsson, Kenza Zouiten and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. When this study was conducted they had over twelve million followers together. In this paper we will investigate the study objects’ published footage, and based on the material we will conduct a quantitative content analysis and a qualitative text analysis. In the quantitative analysis we intend to examine trends in the published photo material, and in the qualitative we will conduct a semiotic analysis to gain a deeper level of understanding of what the strategic communication behind the photos looks like. The theoretical framework is based on scientific articles and research literature on social media, personal branding, self-presentation and communication strategies. Based on our analysis we can identify trends in the profiles’ publications of images showing that they mostly shoot photos in working environments with focus on themselves, to inspire their followers. We can also see that the individuals are strategically working to communicate the most favorable side of themselves to their followers. These different components are what run the study objects’ successful personal branding on Instagram. ...|$|R
