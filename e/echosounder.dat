25|$|Operation Deepscan was {{conducted}} in 1987. Twenty-four boats equipped with <b>echosounder</b> equipment were deployed across {{the width of the}} loch, and simultaneously sent acoustic waves. According to BBC News the scientists had made sonar contact with an unidentified object of unusual size. The researchers returned, re-scanning the area. Analysis of the <b>echosounder</b> images seemed to indicate debris {{at the bottom of the}} loch, although there was motion in three of the pictures. Adrian Shine speculated, based on size, that they might be seals which had entered the loch.|$|E
25|$|Beam {{trawling}} {{is used in}} the flatfish {{fisheries in}} the North Sea. They are equipped with equipment for hauling the net and stowing it aboard. Typically an <b>echosounder</b> and sonar is used for finding fish.|$|E
25|$|For {{acoustic}} hydrography and bathymetry, {{the ship}} had a deep-water <b>echosounder,</b> a shallow-water echosounder-lOOKhz, and a hydrographic survey sounder. To process data, she had the National Ocean Services Hydrochart system, which employed a PDP/8E computer to acquire and process hydrographic data in real time, generate a real-time position-corrected plot of sounding data, provide steering commands to the helmsman, and generate a punched paper tape for shore-based processing of sounding dara.|$|E
25|$|Trawler/Purse seiners – are {{designed}} so the deck arrangement and equipment, including a suitable combination winch, {{can be used}} for both methods. Rollers, blocks, trawl gallows and purse davits need to be arranged so they control the lead of warps and pursing lines {{in such a way as}} to reduce the time needed to convert from one type to the other. Typical fish detection equipment includes a sonar and an <b>echosounder.</b> These vessels are usually designed as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.|$|E
25|$|The boilers of Tarmo were {{converted}} for {{heavy fuel oil}} in 1950, which increased her endurance from one week {{to more than one}} month in normal ice conditions and quadrupled her range. Furthermore, the number of stokers tending the boilers could be reduced from 15 to 9. Her superstructure was also expanded and the crew accommodation was brought up to modern standards. However, as late as in 1952 she still lacked a gyrocompass, <b>echosounder</b> and even a radar, all of which were standard equipment on board the merchant ships she assisted during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|Folger Pinnacle, located atop {{a shallow}} reef, has dense mats of sponges, ascidians and encrusting algae. There are {{numerous}} types of sessile (bottom attached) organisms including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, tunicates, and barnacles. Since {{this is a}} rockfish conservation area, {{there is a wide}} variety of rockfish (yellowtail, China, quillback, Puget Sound, black, and blue) in addition to many other fish (kelp greenling, lingcod, flatfish, wolfeels), molluscs (giant Pacific octopus, mussles, swimming scallops, and snails), and echinoderms (seastars, sea cucumbers, and urchins). An <b>echosounder</b> installed at Folger Deep shows evidence of a dense zooplankton community and schools of fish in the water column, while hydrophones regularly record the songs of whales and dolphins in the area.|$|E
25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an <b>echosounder,</b> and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E
25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an <b>echosounder,</b> although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E
500|$|During her repairs, {{work was}} carried out to straighten, {{reconstruct}} and strengthen her hull. Her armour belt was also extended and thickened. Her armament was updated with newer 2-pounder pom-pom mountings, and her anti-aircraft armament improved with eighteen 20mm Oerlikon guns in five twin and eight single mountings, replacing two quadruple 0.5-inch Vickers guns. Belfast also received new fire control radars for her main, secondary and anti-aircraft guns. Her November 1942 radar fit included one Type 284 set and four Type 283 sets to direct the main armament, three Type 285 sets for the secondary guns, and two Type 285 sets for the 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns. She also received a Type 273 general surface warning radar, Type 251 and 252 sets for {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) purposes, and a Type 281 and Type 242 for air warning. Her 1942 electronics suite also included a Type 270 <b>echosounder.</b> Due to her increased topweight, a bulge was introduced into her hull amidships to improve stability and provide extra longitudinal strength. Her beam had increased to [...] and her draught to [...] forward and [...] aft. Her displacement had risen to tons.|$|E

2500|$|The Katanpää-class vessels will be {{equipped}} with an extensive array of equipment to search for, locate and destroy naval mines, ranging from two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and two remotely operated vehicles (ROV) to hull-mounted sensors. The larger AUV, HUGIN (High Precision Untethered Geosurvey and Inspection system), which is manufactured by Kongsberg Maritime, is over four meters long and weighs over [...] It {{is equipped with a}} multibeam <b>echosounder</b> (MBES), a smaller version of the one mounted on the hull of the vessel. This instrument is used to collect topographic information of the seabed and a synthetic aperture side-scanning sonar can be used to detect and classify targets. The smaller AUV, REMUS 100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit), weighs only [...] and can be used to collect information of the sea floor with its side-scanning sonar at depths of up to 100 metres. Two ROVs, a Double Eagle by Saab Underwater Systems of Sweden and SeaFox I by Atlas Elektronik of Germany, can be used to identify and destroy naval mines. The hull-mounted sensors include a Kongsberg EM-710 RD multibeam <b>echosounder</b> and a TOPAS (Topographic Parametric Sonar) sediment <b>echosounder</b> with jets that can penetrate the uppermost strata of the seabed. In addition the vessels will {{be equipped}} with American-made Klein Associates Klein 5500 towed side-scanning sonars. Underwater positioning is provided with Kongsberg HiPAP 500 (High Precision Acoustic Positioning) system. The vessels follow a toolbox principle in which a suitable combination of sensors and equipment is selected individually for each mission according to the task and environmental conditions.|$|E

In 1989 she underwent a major upgrade involving the installation of Hydrochart II, which employed a Microvax computer system to acquire and process hydorgraphic data. Hydrochart II gave her the capability to generate bottom contour charts with a swath [...] width of approximately two-and-a-half times the water depth, ranging from 10 ...|$|E
2500|$|Methane cycling and {{carbonate}} formation by microorganisms in chemosynthetic environments {{have implications}} for the control of greenhouse gases. [...] Methane can be trapped and stored under the seabed as a gas hydrate, and under different conditions, can either be controlled by microbial consumption, or can escape into the surrounding seawater, and ultimately the atmosphere. Our understanding of the biological controls of methane seepage and feedback mechanisms for global warming is limited. The distribution and structure of cold seep communities can act as an indicator for changes in methane fluxes in the deep sea, e.g. by seafloor warming. [...] Using multibeam <b>echosounder</b> data and 3D seismic data with in situ studies at seep sites, and by investigating the life histories of fauna at such ecosystems, HERMIONE scientists aim to understand more about their interconnectivity and resilience, and the implications for climate change.|$|E
50|$|The primary tool in {{fisheries}} acoustics is {{the scientific}} <b>echosounder.</b> This instrument operates {{on the same}} principles as a recreational or commercial fishfinder or <b>echosounder,</b> but is engineered for greater accuracy and precision, allowing quantitative biomass estimates to be made. In an <b>echosounder,</b> a transceiver generates a short pulse which is sent into the water by the transducer, an array of piezoelectric elements arranged to produce a focused beam of sound. In order {{to be used for}} quantitative work, the <b>echosounder</b> must be calibrated in the same configuration and environment in which it will be used; this is typically done by examining echoes from a metal sphere with known acoustic properties.|$|E
