25|$|Adding to her {{significance}} as an <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship,</b> City of Adelaide is {{the last}} survivor of the timber trade between North America and the United Kingdom. As this trade peaked {{at the same time}} as conflicts in Europe, a great mass of refugees sought cheap passage on the timber-trade ships, that would otherwise be returning empty, creating an unprecedented influx of new immigrants in North America.|$|E

25|$|RMS Asturias was a Royal Mail Lines {{ocean liner}} {{that was built}} in Belfast in 1925. She served in the Second World War as an armed {{merchant}} cruiser until she was crippled by a torpedo in 1943. She was out of action until 1948 {{when she returned to}} civilian service as an <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship.</b> She became a troop ship in 1954 and was scrapped in 1957.|$|E
25|$|She was {{returned}} to the US Navy, then laid up as Archer before being sold into merchant service and converted to a passenger ship, Anna Salén. She was used to take emigrants to Australia and Canada in the early 1950s. She was sold and renamed Tasmania and after further service as an <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship</b> was converted back to a cargo ship. She was later sold and renamed Union Reliance. She was scrapped after a collision and fire in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Asturias {{years as}} an <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship</b> were {{interrupted}} by several voyages as a troop ship. One was in September 1953, when she brought UK troops from South Korea to Gibraltar {{on their way home}} from the Korean War. The troops were 530 British soldiers who had been prisoners of war in North Korea. Most were members of the Gloucestershire Regiment who had been captured {{two and a half years}} earlier at the Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951. She reached Southampton on 16 September, where her troops were greeted by family members and a large contingent of the Gloucestershire Regiment.|$|E

50|$|The data {{collected}} {{is based on}} the passenger manifests of the <b>emigrant</b> <b>ships.</b> These lists had to be presented to the American immigration authorities upon arrival in the United States.

25|$|During {{the last}} week of June, Sam Brannan, leader of the Mormon <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship</b> Brooklyn, met the company near Green River, Wyoming. He {{reported}} to Young about his group's successful journey and their settlement in what is today San Francisco, California. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leader’s focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, wild fruit, timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.|$|E
2500|$|SS Patria was an [...] French {{ocean liner}} built in 1913 for Compagnie française de Navigation à vapeur Cyprien Fabre & Cie (Fabre Line), for {{whom she was}} first a transatlantic liner and then an <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship.</b> From 1932 Fabre Line leased her to Services Contractuels des Messageries Maritimes, who ran her between the south of France and the Levant. After the fall of France in June 1940 the British {{authorities}} in Mandatory Palestine seized her in the Port of Haifa and placed her under {{the management of the}} British-India Steam Navigation Company. In November 1940 the Zionist movement planted a bomb aboard which sank her with the loss of between 260 and 300 lives. Patria remained a wreck in Haifa port until she was scrapped in 1952.|$|E

25|$|Even those {{passengers}} who escaped typhus {{and other diseases}} were weakened by the journey. The Senate Committee of the United States on Sickness and Mortality in <b>Emigrant</b> <b>Ships</b> described the newly disembarked emigrants as 'cadaverous' and 'feeble'.

50|$|In December 1848, a cholera {{epidemic}} {{was brought}} to New Orleans by <b>emigrant</b> <b>ships.</b> Within a few weeks it was carried to all the principal cities on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.

60|$|The {{finding of}} an {{individual}} in a large <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship</b> may not inaptly {{be compared to the}} finding of a needle in a haystack. Foreseeing the difficulty, the missionary asked Captain Bream how he proposed to set about it.|$|E
50|$|From 1854, Robert's son Charles Edward Bright {{became the}} firm's {{representative}} in Australia, and later {{partner in the}} firm. Great Britain continued to operate on the England-Australia route for almost thirty years, interrupted only by two relatively brief sojourns as a troopship—first during the Crimean War and later during the Indian Mutiny. Gradually, she came to earn a reputation for herself as the most reliable of the <b>emigrant</b> <b>ships</b> to Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Locally, it is {{held that}} Fernleigh was built during the 1860s as a holiday house for William Taylor, {{who had arrived}} in Brisbane in 1849 on Chaseley, one of <b>emigrant</b> <b>ships</b> {{organised}} by the Rev Dr John Dunmore Lang. [...] It is possible however, that references to Taylor at Cleveland during this period derive from his purchase of land, {{in the vicinity of}} Fernleigh, in the 1851 land sale.|$|R
60|$|It {{was agreed}} among us, {{that the great}} {{humanities}} of the present day are a proper ground on which all sects can unite, and that if any feared the extension of wrong sentiments, they had only to supply <b>emigrant</b> <b>ships</b> more abundantly with the Bible. Mr. C. {{said that this is}} a movement exciting very extensive interest, and that they hoped Mrs. Chisholm would visit Liverpool before long.|$|R

50|$|While about 65 Norwegians emigrated via Sweden and {{elsewhere}} in the intervening years, no <b>emigrant</b> <b>ships</b> left Norway for the New World until the 1836 departures of the Den Norske Klippe and Norden. In 1837, a group of immigrants from Tinn emigrated via Gothenburg to the Fox River Settlement, near present-day Sheridan, Illinois. But it was the writings of Ole Rynning (1809-1838), who traveled to the U.S. on the Ægir in 1837 that energized Norwegian immigration.|$|R
5|$|In 1852, Great Britain {{made her}} first voyage to Melbourne, Australia, {{carrying}} 630 emigrants. She excited great interest there, with 4,000 people paying a shilling each to inspect her.

50|$|A bad {{harvest in}} Ireland in 1879, {{combined}} with Irish political turmoil, caused many Irish people to emigrate to America. In articles and letters to newspapers and reviews, O'Brain exposed the awful conditions {{that existed in}} the Queenstown (Cobh) lodging houses, on board the <b>emigrant</b> <b>ships,</b> and in the dock slums of New York, where the Irish had to stay upon landing. A notable piece she wrote was the Horrors of the Immigrant Ship which appeared in the Pall Mall Gazette May 6, 1881.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} side, perhaps, a {{magnificent}} New York Liner, huge as a seventy-four, and suggesting {{the idea of}} a Mivart's or Delmonico's afloat, would give way to a Sidney <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship,</b> receiving on board its live freight of shepherds from the Grampians, ere long to be tending their flocks on the hills and downs of New Holland.|$|E
60|$|That {{she was an}} <b>emigrant</b> <b>ship</b> was {{apparent}} from the great number of human beings--men, women, and children--who crowded her decks.
