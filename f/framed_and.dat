5|$|The station {{includes}} the lighthouse, three lighthouse keeper residences, and various buildings. The lighthouse {{is made of}} sandstone and topped by a concrete gallery and a cast iron lantern. The residences and most other structures are timber <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> fibro clad.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to {{the mosque}} complex is via a two-storey edifice built of red {{sandstone}} which is elaborately decorated with <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> carved paneling {{on each of}} its facades. The edifice features a muqarna, an architectural feature from the Middle East that was first introduced into Mughal architecture with construction of the nearby and ornate Wazir Khan Mosque.|$|E
5|$|The White House, {{originally}} {{dating back}} to 1750, is timber <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> was extended in 1830 {{and again in the}} 1960s. The exterior is covered in hung slates, which caused extensive damage to the original frame which required extensive repairs in 1994. The 1797 chimneys are pointed in shape, to stop birds nesting and draw smoke up from the fire. The lawn {{in front of the building}} was the house's original turning circle, with the road once being a thoroughfare from Chingford to Waltham Abbey.|$|E

5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
5|$|Ivall's Farm House is on {{the south}} side of the road near the Star Inn. It is a timber <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> cruck-built (A-frame) tiled roof {{building}} with a lobby entrance, previously a farmhouse, originally built around 1600. The south end dates to the 18th century.The tiled roof, with four small gabled dormers, half-hipped at the north west angle, was restored in the late 20th century. It became a Grade II listed building on 31 July 1963. Holt Cottage is a small thatched cottage situated on the edge of the village and was built in 1503. A Grade II listed building since 31 May 1985, much of the current building dates to the 17th and early 19th centuries. The roof is half-hipped at the south end and hipped at the north, with painted brickwork in monk bond.|$|E

5|$|Rabi {{suggested}} to Edoardo Amaldi that Brookhaven {{might be a}} model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw science {{as a way of}} inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> hung it on the wall of his home office.|$|E
5|$|The main {{components}} of the design are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, of which five smaller ones are each <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> supported by four naked youths or Ignudi. At either end, and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve {{men and women who}} prophesied the birth of Jesus. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E
5|$|The river curves to {{the east}} along the {{southern}} edge of Mayfield, passing a sewage works on the south bank and crossing under an abandoned railway embankment and a road at St Dunstan's Bridge. A tributary joins from the south, which once drove Moat Mill. The mill house dates from the seventeenth century, is timber <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> has been faced with red brick on the ground floor while the attached three-storey mill building dates from the following century. It has been converted into a house, although most of the mill machinery is still present, but has been isolated from the living space by glass panels.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been huge {{attention}} paid to equiangular tight <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> their constructions, {{due to the fact}} that the relationship between these <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> quantum information theory was established. One of the problems which has been studied is the relationship between equiangular tight <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> covering graphs of complete graphs. In this thesis, we will explain equiangular tight <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> covering graphs of complete graphs and present the results that show the relationship between these two concepts. The latest results about the constructions of equiangular tight frames from projective geometries and Steiner systems also has been presented...|$|R

5|$|The three keepers' cottages were {{constructed}} in 1928–1930. The head keeper's house is located {{close to the}} lighthouse, and on the tallest ground, and also includes a small fenced garden. The assistant keeper residence is located right to the west, but geographically lower. The second assistant residence is located at {{some distance from the}} main cluster of buildings, to the south, and even lower. The residences are square one storey structures, timber <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> fibro clad, with central rooms, no corridors, enclosed verandahs and hipped roofs. The head keeper's house and the second assistant's house have corrugated fibrous cement rood while the first assistant house has a newer corrugated zinc/aluminium alloy (Zincalume) metal roof. A museum was set in the second assistant's quarters in 1988. Two spherical steel rainwater tanks are set next to each of the houses.|$|E
5|$|The three sheds {{surrounding}} the lighthouse are the workshop to the south, the former powerhouse {{to the west}} and the fuel store to the north. They are all rectangular structures, timber <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> fibro clad with corrugated fibrous cement gable roofs. The workshop appears to be built on the remains of one of the early stone buildings, lying on a plinth with sandstone steps. It consists of two rooms with pivoting sash windows and timber framed doors and no internal lining. The former powerhouse and the fuel store have reinforced concrete floors, fibro lining, double-hung sash windows and double timber framed doors.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, {{the three}} are <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> {{arrested by the}} {{authorities}} under various charges. Thomson and Thompson are cleared and released, but Tintin is kidnapped by the Arab insurgent Bab El Ehr, who mistakenly believes that Tintin has informations for him concerning an arms delivery. Tintin escapes and encounters an old enemy, Dr. Müller, sabotaging an oil pipeline. He reunites with Thomson and Thompson during a sandstorm and eventually arrives in Khemed's capital city of Wadesdah. When Tintin narrates the sabotage orchestrated by Müller to the Emir Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, one of the Emir's attendants, Ali Ben Mahmud, informs the Emir that his son Prince Abdullah is kidnapped. Tintin suspects that Müller is responsible and assures the Emir that he would rescue Abdullah.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} effects of <b>framing</b> <b>and</b> default {{settings}} in annuity demand after conducting a survey-based experiment with over 3, 000 members of a Dutch occupational pension plan. The {{participants were asked to}} allocate their real projected pension accrual between a life annuity and a partial lump sum. In particular, we investigated the joint effects of consumption <b>and</b> investment <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> gain <b>and</b> loss <b>frames.</b> We present strong evidence for <b>framing</b> <b>and</b> default setting effects in annuity demand. We also find robust evidence of individual characteristics of influence annuity demand, highlighting the importance of heterogeneity among participants. <b>Framing</b> <b>and</b> default effects remain significant when we control for individual characteristics. We conclude Dutch plan members generally welcome the partial lump sum option over full annuitization. <b>Framing</b> <b>and</b> default settings are generally capable of predictively steering annuity demand. The precise effect framing may have also depends on the institutional environment, which predefines the perspective through which individuals filter annuities...|$|R

5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures <b>framed</b> <b>and</b> hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

50|$|Newer {{suspension}} <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> fork designs {{have reduced}} weight, increased amount of suspension travel, and improved feel. Many lock out the rear suspension while the rider is pedaling hard or climbing, {{in order to}} improve pedaling efficiency. Most suspension <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> forks have about 4-6 inches (100-150 mm) of suspension travel. More aggressive suspension <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> forks made for downhill racing and freeriding have as much as 8 or 9 inches (200 or 230 mm) of suspension travel.|$|R
40|$|This article {{critically}} reviews current <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>framing</b> {{research in}} media and communication studies. It is first argued that most authors fail {{to distinguish between}} ‘frame’ and ‘framing’ and therewith produce a conceptual confusion and imprecision that is not conducive to the field. Second, {{it is argued that}} current <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>framing</b> research ignore sociological research about news production and news audiences that reached its zenith in the 1980 s and is still conceptually and methodologically relevant to much current <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>framing</b> research. As a result, a notion of power is absent from most current <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>framing</b> research. By discussing — on the basis of key literature — what a news ‘frame’ is, how it comes about and how it is of consequence successively, these claims are substantiated and research directions for improving the field are indicated...|$|R
