40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the pressure drop characteristics of residential duct system components that are either not available or not thoroughly (sometimes incorrectly) described in existing duct design literature. The tests were designed to imitate cases normally found in typical residential and light commercial installations. The study included three different sizes of flexible ducts, under different compression configurations, splitter boxes, supply boots, and a fresh air intake hood. The experimental tests conformed to ASHRAE Standard 120 P – Methods of Testing to Determine Flow Resistance of HVAC Air Ducts and Fittings. The flexible duct study covered compressibility and bending effects on the total pressure drop, and the results showed that the available published references tend to underestimate the effects of compression in flexible ducts that can increase pressure drops by up to a factor of nine. The supply boots were tested under different configurations including a setup where a flexible duct <b>elbow</b> <b>connection</b> was considered {{as an integral part of}} the supply boot. The supply boots results showed that diffusers can increase the pressure drop by up to a factor of two in exit fittings, and the installation configuration can increase the pressure drop by up to a factor of five. The results showed that it is crucial for designers and contractors to be aware of the compressibility effects of the flexible duct, and the installation of supply boots and diffusers...|$|E
30|$|As a non-wood natural bio-composite, bamboo has {{attracted}} worldwide attention in construction, transportation, stationery commodity and even daily articles {{due to its}} abundant resource, excellent mechanical performances and environmental protection [1]. Based on the better understanding of bamboo structural, physical and mechanical performance [2], bamboo is extremely potential to be utilized as an engineering structure material [3]. However, lack of strong and reliable connection restricts its further application in construction. At present, there are many types of connections used in timber structures in the residential or commercial houses, including nailed connections [4], bolted connections [5], dowel connections [6 – 9] and adhesive bonded steel connection. Epoxy bonded steel connection, which is used in bamboo timbers, is that a threaded steel bar is placed into predrilled holes in timber members and bonded with epoxy resin. The embedded steel bar with the epoxy bonding agent allow a strong connection to be made with increased stiffness of the joint and the structure could be also kept for its excellent esthetic appeal and fire resistance without any cover [10, 11]. So epoxy bonded steel connection has been extensively used in column-base, beam-column and <b>elbow</b> <b>connections</b> [12, 13] {{for quite a long}} time since the first study by Riberholt [14, 15]. There are two different types of the epoxy bonded steel connection classified by the different implant bar number: single bar connecting bar and multitude bar connection. However, there are studies on the epoxy bonded steel connection in bamboo glulam, better analyze the performance of epoxy bonded steel connection into bamboo glulam could explore its utilization [16]. The ratio of depth and diameter of glued-in rods are the main factors influencing pull-out connection strength of timber [17].|$|R
40|$|Tubular hollow light guides {{are found}} in many {{lighting}} and daylighting systems to transport collected light into deep spaces of building interiors. Linear straight guides are popularly used due to their high optical efficiency, but non-linear guides with bent sections are sometimes required to fulfill some installation restrictions. The optical performance of such bent guides is, however, unknown. This article presents the development, validation, and application of an optical model to compute the transmittance of light guides with and without bends. The model {{is based on the}} ray-tracing technique and can handle segmented guides with <b>connection</b> <b>elbows.</b> Measurement of the light transmittance of a light guide with two <b>connection</b> <b>elbows</b> is conducted using an outdoor large integrating box to benchmark the model. The model predictions are in good agreement with the measurement and public data for vertical light guides without bends. The model predictions for bent light guides installed in a northern mid-latitude location show that orienting the middle pipe section of the guide toward the northern direction results in better control of sunlight and solar heat gains than other orientations.

40|$|Abstract. Elements {{of water}} supply {{systems such as}} pipes, <b>elbows,</b> tee <b>connections,</b> …etc., are made of {{polymeric}} materials. They are sub-jected to erosion by streams of water and contaminants. The objective of this work is to investigate the erosion resistance of the polymers that are locally used to produce such components. Three materials were examined, namely: High pressure PVC (HP-PVC), Low pressure PVC (LP-PVC), and Polypropylene (PP). Four types of water were used to erode the polymeric specimens: Distilled water (DiW), De-salinated water (DeW), Sea water (SW), and untreated deep ground (Well) water (WW). The effects of water stream velocity and eroding time on the erosion wear behaviour of the polymers were examined. The work was conducted under controlled environment of 23 °C tem-perature and 40 % humidity. Results show that erosive wear of all ma-terials increases {{with the increase in}} stream velocity and/or eroding time. It also indicates that at certain values of velocity and/or eroding time the increase in rate was more pronounced. In addition the pres-ence of water contaminants has drastic effects on the erosion volume. Results also show that HP-PVC has the highest erosion resistance...|$|R
