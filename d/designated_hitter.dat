5|$|Edgar Martínez Award: {{given to}} the best <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> (DH) (American League).|$|E
5|$|The Edgar Martínez Outstanding <b>Designated</b> <b>Hitter</b> Award, {{commonly}} referred to as the Edgar Martínez Award and originally known as the Outstanding <b>Designated</b> <b>Hitter</b> Award, has been presented annually to the most outstanding <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> (DH) in the American League (AL) in Major League Baseball (MLB) since 1973. The award is voted on by club beat reporters, broadcasters and AL public relations departments. All players with a minimum of 100 at bats at DH are eligible. It was given annually by members of the Associated Press who are beat writers, broadcasters, and public relations directors. The Associated Press discontinued the award in 2000, but it was picked up by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, which has administered it since.|$|E
5|$|Ramirez {{made his}} major league debut on September 2, 1993 against the Minnesota Twins, going hitless in four at bats as the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Shikoku Island League uses <b>designated</b> <b>hitters.</b>|$|R
500|$|Martínez set {{the records}} for the highest batting average and on-base {{percentage}} in a <b>designated</b> <b>hitter's</b> winning season with his [...]356 and [...]479 marks, respectively, in 1995. Manny Ramírez' slugging percentage of [...]647 is best among all winners at the position. Ortiz hit 54 home runs during the 2006 season, when he won his third consecutive award, and his 2005 total of 148 runs batted in is tied with Rafael Palmeiro's 1999 mark for best among <b>designated</b> <b>hitters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wayne Ulaky {{produced}} the recording with studio musicians under the fictitious name of Pine Tree John and the <b>Designated</b> <b>Hitters.</b> The lead vocal {{was performed by}} John Lincoln Wright, also {{a former member of}} the Beacon Street Union.|$|R
5|$|The {{prize is}} {{presented}} to outfielders irrespective of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and one right fielder. In addition, only National League pitchers receive a Silver Slugger Award; lineups in the American League include a <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> in place of the pitcher in the batting order, so the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> receives the award instead.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Reds allowed Nashville {{to use a}} <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> (DH) {{in their}} lineups. However, this {{allowance}} was later revoked, as the Reds {{were a part of}} the National League which did not use a DH. Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum: if Cincinnati would not let the Sounds use a DH in their lineups, they would not renew their contract and would look for a new major league affiliate. The Reds did not budge on their decision to prohibit the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter,</b> so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979. Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate.|$|E
5|$|Only National League {{pitchers}} {{receive a}} Silver Slugger Award; lineups in the American League include the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter,</b> who replaces the pitcher in the batting order, so the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> receives the award instead. Mike Hampton {{has won the}} most Silver Sluggers as a pitcher, earning five consecutive awards with four different teams from 1999 to 2003. Tom Glavine is a four-time winner (1991, 1995–1996, 1998) with the Atlanta Braves. Rick Rhoden (1984–1986), Don Robinson (1982, 1989–1990), and Carlos Zambrano (2006, 2008–2009) each own three Silver Sluggers. Two-time winners include the inaugural winner, Bob Forsch (1980, 1987), and Fernando Valenzuela (1981, 1983), who won the Cy Young Award, the Rookie of the Year Award, and the Silver Slugger in his first full major league season. The most recent winner is Jake Arrieta.|$|E
50|$|Qualifying for the Team USA roster as {{a relief}} pitcher, she was {{converted}} to <b>designate</b> <b>hitter</b> by manager Julie Croteau. As a side note, {{she was one}} of four teenagers to qualify for the Team USA roster in 2006.|$|R
50|$|One {{technique}} {{the league}} uses {{to strengthen its}} ties to the locales where it plays is to have those players who come from Shikoku play for their home teams. Even {{if they are not}} regulars, they often appear as <b>designated</b> <b>hitters,</b> pinch hitters, relief pitchers, and substitutes.|$|R
25|$|The Triple-A National Championship Game {{consists}} of a single nine-inning game to determine a champion. The only championship game to ever go beyond the prescribed nine innings was the 2009 contest which went to eleven innings. The host league's team serves as the home team. <b>Designated</b> <b>hitters</b> bat {{in place of the}} pitchers.|$|R
5|$|Darin Erstad won a Gold Glove as a {{first baseman}} in 2004 after winning two awards in the outfield (2000, 2002), making him the only player to win the award as an infielder and an outfielder. In 1999, Palmeiro won the Gold Glove with the Texas Rangers while only {{appearing}} in 28 games {{as a first}} baseman; he appeared in 135 games as a <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> that season, resulting in some controversy over his selection.|$|E
5|$|Hideki Matsui, the 2009 winner, {{batted in}} six {{runs in the}} sixth game of the 2009 World Series, tying Richardson's record of most runs batted in for a single World Series game. Matsui became the first Japanese-born player to win the award, {{as well as the}} first player to win it as a {{full-time}} <b>designated</b> <b>hitter.</b> He is also the only player named both a World Series and a Japan Series MVP.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> (DH) rule is in effect, {{each team}} has a tenth player whose sole {{responsibility}} is to bat (and run). The DH {{takes the place of}} another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.|$|E
50|$|The {{defensive}} {{team has}} nine {{players on the}} field. The offensive team can use three jokers (similar to <b>designated</b> <b>hitters)</b> during one half-inning {{in addition to the}} nine players in the regular batting order. The offensive team can continue batting until three players have been put out or one round of the batting order has been completed without at least two runs scored.|$|R
5000|$|Youth Education in the Arts, stylized as YEA!, is a {{non-profit}} organization based in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It affords young members {{the opportunity to participate}} in pageantry events worldwide. They have programs that include the 10 time World Champion Cadets, the 2016 DCA World Champion Cadets2, the 2014 Open Class World Champion Cadets Winter Percussion, Xcape Dance Studio, the <b>Designated</b> <b>Hitters,</b> and USBands.|$|R
50|$|On April 22, 2009, All-Star balloting {{began on}} MLB.com with eight {{position}} players (excluding pitchers and <b>designated</b> <b>hitters)</b> {{from each of}} the 30 teams being nominated for fans to vote. As with last year, only 25 email ballots could be cast and voting officially ended at 11:59 ET on July 2. Final rosters, {{with the exception of the}} final vote, were announced on July 5.|$|R
5|$|On June 30, in a 12-6 {{win over}} the Oakland Athletics at Oakland Alameda Coliseum, Bumgarner was started at pitcher hitting for himself in an American League ballpark, {{the first time this}} was {{intentionally}} done in the Majors since , according to SportsCenter, and only the fifth time since the creation of the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> rule in 1973. He went 1 for 4, opening the third inning with a double and starting a six-run rally.|$|E
5|$|Through the 2012 season, Huff had hit 242 career home runs, tying him for 217th all-time with Dusty Baker, Sal Bando, Wally Berger, Roy Campanella, and J. D. Drew. In {{addition}} to {{being used as a}} <b>designated</b> <b>hitter,</b> he has played at five different positions in his career: first base, third base, left field, right field, and second base.|$|E
5|$|As {{with each}} All-Star Game since 1970, the eight {{starting}} position players (with no <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, {{and a second}} fan balloting to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.|$|E
5000|$|Major League Baseball (MLB) players, scouts, and sabermetricians {{describe}} {{play in the}} NPB as [...] "AAAA"; {{less competitive}} than in the MLB, but more competitive than in AAA minor league baseball. Play in the Pacific League {{is similar to that}} in American League baseball, with the use of <b>designated</b> <b>hitters,</b> unlike the Central League, which has no DH rule and is closer to National League baseball.|$|R
50|$|The Central League (Sentoraru Rīgu) or Ce League (Se Rīgu) {{is one of}} the two {{professional}} baseball leagues that constitute Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan. The winner of the league championship plays against the winner of the Pacific League in the annual Japan Series. It currently consists of six teams from around the country. Unlike the Pacific League, <b>designated</b> <b>hitters</b> are not used during Central League home games.|$|R
5000|$|Ortiz {{finished}} {{his career with}} 541 home runs, which ranks 17th on the MLB all-time home run list, 1,768 RBIs (22nd all-time) and a [...]286 batting average. Among <b>designated</b> <b>hitters,</b> he is the all-time leader in MLB history for home runs (485), runs batted in (RBIs) (1,569), and hits (2,192). Regarded {{as one of the}} best clutch hitters of all time, Ortiz had 11 career walk-off home runs during the regular season and 2 during the postseason.|$|R
5|$|Cliff Lee {{pitched a}} {{complete}} {{game in the}} Phillies' Game1 victory, allowing only one unearned run, while Chase Utley hit two home runs. In Game2, solo home runs by Mark Teixeira and Hideki Matsui helped the Yankees win by a score of 3–1. After a rain delayed start, Game3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total runs {{en route to a}} Yankee victory. The Yankees won Game4 by scoring the decisive three runs in the ninth inning after an alert base running play by Johnny Damon. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game5, aided by Utley's second two–home run game of the series. The Yankees secured their World Series championship with a Game 6 victory in which Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player and the first full-time <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> to win the award; Matsui was the series' MVP despite starting only the three games that were played at Yankee Stadium, since the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> position is not used in NL ballparks.|$|E
5|$|Designated hitters (DH) only {{receive a}} Silver Slugger Award in the American League because the batting {{order in the}} National League {{includes}} the pitcher; therefore, pitchers receive the National League award instead. David Ortiz has won the most Silver Sluggers as a <b>designated</b> <b>hitter,</b> capturing four consecutively from 2004 to 2007, and winning again in 2011, 2013 and 2016. Two players are tied with four wins. Paul Molitor won the award four times with three different teams: the Milwaukee Brewers in 1987 and 1988; the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, when the team won the World Series; and the Minnesota Twins in 1996. Edgar Martínez won the award four times with the Seattle Mariners (1995, 1997, 2001, 2003). Don Baylor won the Silver Slugger three times in four years (1983, 1985–1986) as a <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> with the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, and Frank Thomas won it twice with the Chicago White Sox (1991, 2000). Harold Baines won the award while playing for two separate teams in the same season; he was traded by the White Sox to the Texas Rangers {{in the middle of}} the 1989 season. Víctor Martínez is the most recent winner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> Johnny Grubb {{with the bases loaded}} and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that Tony Gwynn was unable to see. Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, but was unable to prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely game-winning RBI.|$|E
5000|$|In baseball, {{a fourth}} outfielder is a backup outfielder, {{who does not}} have the hitting skills to {{regularly}} play in the corner outfield, but does not have the fielding skills to play center field; for these players, this often leads to playing time that has been called [...] "erratic and unpredictable". Often, fourth outfielders are outfield prospects who have not settled on one outfield position when arriving in the Major Leagues, veteran players seeking additional playing time to extend their careers, or part-time position players who double as <b>designated</b> <b>hitters.</b>|$|R
25|$|The game itself {{consists}} of a single nine-inning game to determine a champion. The only All-Star game to ever go beyond the prescribed nine innings was the 2004 game held in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, at McCoy Stadium. Triple-A rules restricted the game from going beyond 10innings, but the International League scored {{in the bottom of}} the 10th inning, avoiding a tie game as the result. The league in which the host city competes is considered the home team for the game and the other team is designated the visiting team. <b>Designated</b> <b>hitters</b> bat in place of the pitchers.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Goff, Shughart and Tollison [1997] {{attribute}} the American League's higher hit-batsman rate since 1973 to moral hazard: pitchers {{who no longer}} bat no longer face retaliation. We argue that retaliation is more efficiently directed at sluggers than at weak-hitting pitcher, and show that American League <b>Designated</b> <b>Hitters</b> (DH's) are plunked more frequently than are National League pitchers. We also offer a new estimating equation and update GST's sample. We show that the DH's effect on hit batsmen is no longer statistically significant. However, the point estimates are close to our prediction, which does not rely on moral hazard...|$|R
5|$|The series {{shifted to}} Citi Field, the home stadium of the Mets, for Game 3. Yordano Ventura {{started for the}} Royals and Noah Syndergaard started for the Mets. The {{ceremonial}} first pitch was thrown by Mike Piazza to catcher Kevin Plawecki. With no <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> (DH) in NL parks, the Mets started Michael Conforto, their DH for Game 2, in the outfield instead of Juan Lagares, and the Royals did not start Kendrys Morales, their regular DH.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first with}} an Alex Rodriguez walk opening {{the bottom of}} the second inning {{followed}} by a two-run home run by <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a triple by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on a sacrifice fly from Jimmy Rollins {{in the top of the}} third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with the bases loaded in {{the bottom of the}} third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was replaced defensively in the top of the fourth by Jerry Hairston, Jr.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, the American League {{decided to}} adopt the <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> rule. On April 6, opening the season at Fenway Park, Ron Blomberg of the Yankees became the first <b>designated</b> <b>hitter</b> in Major League history. Red Sox pitcher Luis Tiant walked Blomberg in his first plate {{appearance}} of the game. Later that year at Fenway Park, with the score tied 2–2 {{in the top of}} the ninth, Yankees catcher Thurman Munson attempted to score from third base on a missed bunt by Gene Michael. He crashed into Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk resulting in a fight with Munson punching Fisk in the face. The rivalry intensified in the 1970s with the fans too, as just a year later in 1974 at Fenway Park, Yankees first baseman Chris Chambliss was struck in the right arm with a dart thrown from the stands after hitting an RBI ground-rule double. Two years later, Yankee outfielder Lou Piniella would crash into Fisk feet first in an attempt to score in the sixth inning of a game at Yankee Stadium. The two benches cleared while Piniella and Fisk brawled at home plate. After the fight apparently died down and order appeared to be restored, Sox pitcher Bill Lee and Yankee third baseman Graig Nettles and center fielder Mickey Rivers began to exchange words, resulting in another fight. Lee suffered a separated left shoulder from the tilt and missed the next 51 games of the 1976 season. He would continue to pitch until 1982. The 1976 season saw the Yankees win the pennant, but lose to the Big Red Machine in the 1976 World Series, just like the Red Sox had done a year prior in the 1975 World Series in which Carlton Fisk hit his famous home run off of the left field foul pole at Fenway Park.|$|E

50|$|The {{rules are}} the same as in the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament. It is a single {{elimination}} tournament with nine inning games. Games are declared official after seven complete innings in the case of suspension (due to weather, et cetera), except for the championship game which must be played to completion. For the regional tournaments, games are ended if one team leads by at least ten runs after five innings or seven runs after seven innings, except in the championship games. <b>Designated</b> <b>hitters</b> are not used. Four umpires are used, except for night games in which two outfield line umpires are added.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Martin Dalena (born June 26, 1960 in Fresno, California) is {{a former}} Major League Baseball <b>designated</b> hitter/pinch <b>hitter</b> who played for the Cleveland Indians in 1989. He weighed 200 pounds and was 5'11" [...] in height. Dalena, who threw {{right-handed}} but batted left, attended Fresno State University.|$|R
