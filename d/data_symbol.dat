5000|$|Obviously, no <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> {{contains}} more than four consecutive matching bits, and because the patterns [...] and [...] are excluded, no <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> begins or ends with more than three identical bits.Thus, the longest run of identical bits that will be produced is 6. (I.e. this is a (0,5) RLL code, with a worst-case running disparity of +3 to −3.) ...|$|E
50|$|Like MC-CDMA, CI-OFDM spreads each <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> in the {{frequency}} domain. That is, each <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> is carried over multiple OFDM subcarriers. But unlike MC-CDMA, which uses binary-phase Hadamard codes (code values of 0 or 180 degrees) or binary pseudonoise, CI codes are complex-valued orthogonal codes. In the simplest case, CI code values are coefficients of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. Each row or column of the DFT matrix provides an orthogonal CI spreading code which spreads a <b>data</b> <b>symbol.</b> Spreading is achieved by multiplying a vector of data symbols by the DFT matrix to produce a vector of coded data symbols, then each coded <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> is mapped to an OFDM subcarrier via an input bin of an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). A block of contiguous subcarriers may be selected, or to achieve better frequency diversity, non-contiguous subcarriers distributed over a wide frequency band can be used. A guard interval, such as a cyclic prefix (CP), {{is added to the}} baseband CI-OFDM signal before the signal is processed by a radio front-end to convert it to an RF signal, which is then transmitted by an antenna.|$|E
40|$|Methods and {{apparatus}} {{are disclosed}} which estimate transmitted <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> from a received Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) signal by utilizing intrinsic interference as parity information. For each intrinsic interference symbol, a corresponding estimated parity symbol is obtained {{based on one}} or more of the received <b>data</b> <b>symbols.</b> The transmitted <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> are then estimated by identifying a set of <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> which provide a closer match between the intrinsic interference symbols and estimated parity symbols obtained based on the estimated transmitted <b>data</b> <b>symbols,</b> relative to a match between the intrinsic interference symbols and the estimated parity symbols obtained based on the received <b>data</b> <b>symbols...</b>|$|R

The <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> are modulated by quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK). Further, we set the average power of the pilots to be equal to the average power of the <b>data</b> <b>symbols.</b>|$|R

For the general case of correlated <b>data</b> <b>symbols,</b> R_x_ 0 ≠βI_a_ 0, β > 0, while R_x_ 0 = E{x_ 0 x_ 0 ^H}= βI_a_ 0 for the case of uncorrelated <b>data</b> <b>symbols.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One {{entry is}} a <b>data</b> <b>symbol,</b> denoted by the type [...] "D". Many functions, {{including}} both user-defined functions and library functions are also present.|$|E
50|$|For {{the case}} of MC-DS-CDMA where OFDM is used as the {{modulation}} scheme, the data symbols on the individual subcarriers are spread in time by multiplying the chips on a PN code by the <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> on the subcarrier. For example, assume the PN code chips consist of {1, -1} and the <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> on the subcarrier is -j. The symbol being modulated onto that carrier, for symbols 0 and 1, will be -j for symbol 0 and +j for symbol 1.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{alternative}} possibilities exist {{as to how}} this frequency domain spreading can take place, such as by using a long PN code and multiplying each <b>data</b> <b>symbol,</b> di, on a subcarrier by a chip from the PN code, ci, or by using short PN codes and spreading each <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> by an individual PN code [...] - [...] i.e. di is multiplied by each ci and the resulting vector is placed on Nfreq subcarriers, where Nfreq is the PN code length.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} Cyclone codes {{which are}} rateless erasure resilient codes. They combine Pair codes with Luby Transform (LT) codes by computing a code symbol from a random set of <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> using bitwise XOR and cyclic shift operations. The number of <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> is chosen {{according to the}} Robust Soliton distribution. XOR and cyclic shift operations establish a unitary commutative ring if <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> have a length of $p- 1 $ bits, for some prime number $p$. We consider the graph given by code <b>symbols</b> combining two <b>data</b> <b>symbols.</b> If $n/ 2 $ such random pairs are given for $n$ <b>data</b> <b>symbols,</b> then a giant component appears, which can be resolved in linear time. We can extend Cyclone codes to <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> of arbitrary even length, provided the Goldbach conjecture holds. Applying results for this giant component, it follows that Cyclone codes have the same encoding and decoding time complexity as LT codes, while the overhead is upper-bounded by those of LT codes. Simulations indicate that Cyclone codes significantly decreases the overhead of extra coding symbols...|$|R

50|$|As {{an example}} of how the 2D {{spreading}} on VSF-OFCDM works, if you take the first <b>data</b> <b>symbol,</b> d0, and a spreading factor in the time domain, SFtime, of length 4, and a spreading factor in the frequency domain, SFfrequency of 2, then the <b>data</b> <b>symbol,</b> d0, will be multiplied by the length-2 frequency-domain PN codes and placed on subcarriers 0 and 1, and these values on subcarriers 0 and 1 will then be multiplied by the length-4 time-domain PN code and transmitted on OFDM symbols 0, 1, 2 and 3.|$|E
50|$|Since each <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> {{occupies}} {{a much wider}} bandwidth (in hertz) than the data rate (in bit/s), a ratio of signal to noise-plus-interference (if defined as signal power divided by total noise plus interference power in the entire transmission band) of less than 0 dB is feasible.|$|E

This {{is half the}} bandwidth, or double the transmission time for a specific <b>data</b> <b>symbol,</b> as used in 802.11a.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{iterative}} joint DA/DD channel estimation algorithm for known symbol padding (KSP) OFDM. The pilot symbols {{used to estimate}} the channel are not only located in the guard interval, but also {{on some of the}} OFDM carriers. Initially, the channel is estimated using the pilot symbols only. Next, a decision is made with respect to the transmitted <b>data</b> <b>symbols.</b> We consider both hard and soft decision of the <b>data</b> <b>symbols.</b> The decisions on the <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> are then used to update the channel estimate in a joint DA/DD estimation algorithm. The algorithm iterates between data detection and channel estimation until convergence is reached. At high SNR, the MSE performance of the iterative estimator converges to the MSE performance of the case where all <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> are prior known at the receiver, i. e. the all pilot DA estimator. It turns out that the MSE performance of hard decision of the <b>data</b> <b>symbols</b> reaches the MSE of the all pilot DA estimator at lower SNR than that of soft decision of the data symbols; this is caused by some approximations needed to simplify the estimation algorithm.

50|$|In the {{simplest}} case of CI-OFDM, the spreading matrix is S = F (i.e., ΛC = I, so the CI spreading matrix {{is just the}} NxN DFT matrix). Since OFDM’s over-sampled DFT is KxN, with K>N, the basic CI spreading matrix performs like a sinc pulse-shaping filter which maps each <b>data</b> <b>symbol</b> to a cyclically shifted and orthogonally positioned pulse formed from a superposition of OFDM subcarriers. Other versions of CI can produce alternative pulse shapes by selecting different diagonal matrices ΛC.|$|E

The receiver can now also use polynomial interpolation to recover the lost packets, provided he receives k symbols successfully. If the order of F is less than 2b, where b {{is the number of}} bits in a symbol, then multiple polynomials can be used.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the scheme}} name suggests, eight bits of data are {{transmitted}} as a 10-bit entity called a symbol, or character. The low five bits of data are encoded into a 6-bit group (the 5b/6b portion) {{and the top}} three bits are encoded into a 4-bit group (the 3b/4b portion). These code groups are concatenated together to form the 10-bit symbol that is transmitted on the wire. The data symbols are {{often referred to as}} D.x.y where x ranges over 0 - 31 and y over 0 - 7. Standards using the 8b/10b encoding also define up to 12 special symbols (or control characters) that can be sent in place of a <b>data</b> <b>symbol.</b> They are often used to indicate start-of-frame, end-of-frame, link idle, skip and similar link-level conditions. At least one of them (i.e. a [...] "comma" [...] symbol) needs to be used to define the alignment of the 10 bit symbols. They are referred to as K.x.y and have different encodings from any of the D.x.y symbols.|$|E
