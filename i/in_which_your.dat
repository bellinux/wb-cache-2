25|$|Although {{it is not}} {{expressly}} mentioned, it may be {{seen that}} Musashi indicated that when one learned the areas <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> craft requires (carpentry, farming, fine art or battle) {{and is able to}} apply them to any given situation, one is experienced enough to show others wisdom, as foreman of craftsmen or as a general of an army.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the single campaign is {{a number of different}} battle scenarios, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> pre-selected force will combat a number of enemy forces. Winning the scenario will award the player gold. Between battles the game switches to a map of the area, with the location of their army denoted by a figure of their champion. The player is then able to select his or her army and move to another location. This will bring up a force selection screen, and the player will then have to select a limited number of troops and heroes to play the next scenario with. Although the campaign is for the most part linear, there are also optional side quests, which although mostly unrelated to the main story will usually result in the heroes acquiring additional gold, troops or equipment {{that can be used in}} the campaign. As well as traditional large scale battles there are also Duel scenarios in which a hero character of your choice will enter straight into a duel with an enemy champion, with victory of either champion immediately ending the scenario.|$|E
500|$|In practice, Fellini {{shot his}} films while playing taped music because, as he {{explained}} in a 1972 interview, [...] "it puts you in a strange dimension <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> fantasy stimulates you". For La Strada, Fellini used a variation by Arcangelo Corelli {{that he planned to}} use on the sound track. Rota, unhappy with that plan, wrote an original motif (with echoes of the [...] "Larghetto" [...] from Dvořák's Opus 22 Serenade for Strings in E major [...] ) with rhythmic lines matched to Corelli's piece that synchronize with Gelsomina's movements with the trumpet and Il Matto's with the violin.|$|E

500|$|John S. Barbour Jr. of the Piedmont’s Culpeper County was {{the first}} Unionist to break away into the secessionist camp. While “resolutely {{protecting}} slave labor” he was for encouraging manufacturing and commercial interests in Virginia against those of the North. He asked what would do more to promote Virginia's growth, participation “in a hostile confederacy <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> [...] power will be but 11 out of 150 , or in a friendly confederacy {{where it will be}} 21 out of 89 ?” In the South was a government to join [...] "in full working order, strong, powerful and efficient ..." [...] Henry A. Wise tried to move the Convention into a [...] "Spontaneous Southern Rights Convention" [...] to immediately install a secessionist government in Virginia, but on April 4, almost two-thirds of the Convention voted against secession, and a three-man delegation was sent to consult with Lincoln who had resolved to protect Federal property in the South.|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} interview, {{he was asked}} if his perfect idea of {{encounter}} was the same as described in the track, one <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> partner is screaming to you, [...] "Give it to me, baby, give it to me, motherfucker" [...] and having attracted the attention of the cops due to the violent noises you are making with your partner outside while [...] "trying to get in". To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger. When I was a kid, pop could be dangerous but still massive. Michael Jackson would grab his crotch. Prince would rock assless chaps".|$|E
500|$|One analyst {{said that}} the {{settlement}} was likely to mute his public pronouncements and lawsuits against the company. However, upon the game's 2008 release, Thompson called Grand Theft Auto IV [...] "the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio," [...] and asked Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to [...] "pursue and file criminal charges against [...] Target and Best Buy". He also {{sent a letter to}} Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick's attorney, addressed to Zelnick's mother, in which Thompson accused her son of [...] "doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of GTA: IV to teen boys in the United States, a country <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> son claims you raised him to be a 'a Boy Scout'. ... More like the Hitler Youth, I would say." [...] On May 1, 2008 Thompson appeared on the CNN Headline News program Glenn Beck, asserting that the game's sexual content made its sale to minors illegal, and that he was working with law enforcement to have criminal prosecutions brought. Thompson also {{filed a complaint with the}} Chicago Transit Authority about poster ads for the game at Chicago, Illinois bus stops.|$|E

500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coated with thickly layered vocal harmonies, [...] "Shadows" [...] was co-written and {{produced}} by Propellerheads' Alex Gifford. Rolling Stone said the following of the track: [...] " [...] keeps a dry funk drumbeat, {{a dab of}} piano chords, some low clarinet lines and, finally, a swarm of seraphic, multitracked voices; it's {{one of the many}} songs on the album that build up to moments of cinematic perfection, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> goose bumps are exactly the ones Wainwright intended." [...] The programmed beats on [...] "The Tower of Learning" [...] were contributed by contemporary composer Damien LeGassick.|$|E

2500|$|Otello laments {{his fate}} (Dio! mi potevi scagliar tutti i mali / [...] "God, {{you could have}} thrown every evil at me" [...] ). When Iago calls out [...] "Cassio is here!" [...] Otello hides as Iago and Cassio enter. Cassio says {{he had hoped to}} see Desdemona here, for he wanted to know whether she had been {{successful}} with Otello (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Vieni; l'aula è deserta / [...] "Come, the hall is deserted"). Iago asks him to tell of his adventures with that woman. Cassio asks which woman, and, softly, so that Otello cannot hear, Iago says [...] "Bianca" [...] (the name of Cassio's actual lover). As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems to be telling Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago's urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it—for it is Desdemona's—and holds it out where he knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Questa è una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca / [...] "This is a spiderweb <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>your</b> heart is caught").|$|E
