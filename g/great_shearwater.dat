25|$|Tubenosed seabirds, {{which come}} ashore only to breed and {{spend most of}} their life {{wandering}} close {{to the surface of the}} oceans, have a long narrow area of visual sensitivity on the retina This region, the area giganto cellularis, has been found in the Manx shearwater, Kerguelen petrel, <b>great</b> <b>shearwater,</b> broad-billed prion and common diving-petrel. It is characterised by the presence of ganglion cells which are regularly arrayed and larger than those found in the rest of the retina, and morphologically appear similar to the cells of the retina in cats. The location and cellular morphology of this novel area suggests a function in the detection of items in a small binocular ﬁeld projecting below and around the bill. It is not concerned primarily with high spatial resolution, but may assist in the detection of prey near the sea surface as a bird flies low over it.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, chinstrap penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern fulmar {{is by far the most}} common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape petrel, Antarctic prion, Wilson's storm petrel, black-bellied storm petrel, subantarctic skua, southern giant petrel, snow petrel, slender-billed prion and Antarctic tern. Kelp gull is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the king penguin, wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, Campbell albatross, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross, light-mantled albatross, northern giant petrel, Antarctic petrel, blue petrel, soft-plumaged petrel, Kerguelen petrel, white-headed petrel, fairy prion, white-chinned petrel, <b>great</b> <b>shearwater,</b> common diving petrel, south polar skua and parasitic jaeger.|$|E
500|$|This long-winged petrel is [...] {{long with}} an [...] wingspan, {{and an average}} weight of 290g (10.3in).

40|$|International audienceBackground: Among {{the most}} {{widespread}} seabirds in the world, shearwaters of the genus Puffinus are also some of the deepest diving members of the Procellariiformes. Maximum diving depths are known for several Puffinus species, but dive depths or diving behaviour have never been recorded for <b>great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> (P. gravis), the largest member of this genus. This study reports the first high sampling rate (2 s) of depth and diving behaviour for Puffinus shearwaters. Methodology/Principle Findings: Time-depth recorders (TDRs) were deployed on two female <b>great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> nesting on Inaccessible Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, recording 10 consecutive days of diving activity. Remote sensing imagery and movement patterns of 8 males tracked by satellite telemetry {{over the same period}} were used to identify probable foraging areas used by TDR-equipped females. The deepest and longest dive was to 18. 9 m and lasted 40 s, but most (> 50 %) dives were < 2 m deep. Diving was most frequent near dawn and dusk, with < 0. 5 % of dives occurring at night. The two individuals foraged in contrasting oceanographic conditions, one in cold (8 to 10 °C) water of the Sub-Antarctic Front, likely 1000 km south of the breeding colony, and the other in warmer (10 to 16 °C) water of the Sub-tropical Frontal Zone, at the same latitude as the colony, possibly on the Patagonian Shelf, 4000 km away. The cold water bird spent fewer days commuting, conducted four times as many dives as the warm water bird, dived deeper on average, and had a greater proportion of bottom time during dives. Conclusions/Significance: General patterns of diving activity were consistent with those of other shearwaters foraging in cold and warm water habitats. <b>Great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> are likely adapted to forage {{in a wide range of}} oceanographic conditions, foraging mostly with shallow dives but capable of deep diving...|$|R
40|$|Primary, {{tail and}} body moult of three seabirds from Tristan da Cunha {{archipelago}} were studied by castnetting offshore south Brazil from February 2006 to August 2007. Timing, duration and synchronization of primary and tail moult are described {{relative to the}} annual calendar. Body moult overlapped breeding in Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses (Thalassarche chlororhynchos), but tail and primary moult did not. Spectacled petrels (Procellaria conspicillata) had protracted body moult, whereas primary and tail moult were completed by August. We documented onset of primary moult during chick-rearing in spectacled petrels and <b>great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> (Puffinus gravis) of unknown breeding status, and suggest that the south-west Atlantic Ocean holds important numbers of moulting birds of both species during the summer–early autumn. The albatrosses and the spectacled petrels replaced rectrices alternately. <b>Great</b> <b>shearwaters</b> replaced rectrices outward, starting at the central pair. Primary, tail and body moult largely overlap in all three species, suggesting that the metabolic costs of primary moult may not be overly restrictive.

40|$|We {{describe}} the seabird {{community and the}} distribution of seabirds in the Flemish Cap in the summer of 2002. Data were collected by means of sixty-six 300 m wide boat transects of varied length {{in the first half of}} July. A total of 802 seabirds and 8 species were counted within census transects. Over 70 % of seabirds were <b>Great</b> <b>Shearwaters</b> (Puffinus gravis), followed by Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) with 17. 1 % of the seabirds recorded. The number of seabirds recorded per census transect was, on average, very low (mean = 10. 68, SD = 19. 54) and no seabirds were observed in 20 transects. Overall seabird abundance was 8. 78 birds km- 1 (n = 66, SD = 16. 98). Seabird abundance and seabird species richness were not evenly distributed across the Flemish Cap but seemed to concentrate at the edges of the southern half of the study area. This pattern suggests that seabirds were mostly distributed in the area of confluence of the North Atlantic Current with the Labrador Current.

50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>shearwater</b> {{feeds on}} fish and squid, which it catches {{from the surface}} or by plunge-diving. It readily follows fishing boats, where it indulges in noisy squabbles.

50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>shearwater's</b> {{relationships}} are unclear.

Alternatively (Austin 1996, Austin et al. 2004), it could be a monotypic subgenus (Ardenna sensu stricto), an Atlantic representative of the light-billed Hemipuffinus group (pink-footed shearwater and flesh-footed shearwater).|$|R
