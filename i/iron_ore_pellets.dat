2500|$|Because of {{the high}} mineralization, several mines have opened in the belt. Sherman Mine, {{northwest}} {{of the town of}} Temagami, was a major producer of iron ore. Mining operations began in 1968, and workings consisted of seven open pits: North Pit, East Pit, South Pit, West Pit and three relatively small open pits known as the Turtle Pits. A railroad was built from the Ontario Northland Railway to Sherman Mine in the 1960s to make transportation and shipping of iron ore easier and faster across Ontario. To the north, Temagami North was constructed as a resource town in the 1960s to supply Sherman Mine. With an average overall grade of 25% iron, the mine produced approximately 10,700tons of crude ore per day and its mill capacity was [...] of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> per year. Operations at Sherman Mine ceased in 1990 after its owner Dofasco announced that they would be closing the mine. The municipality of Temagami made several approaches to Dofasco before the closer of Sherman Mine, offering a partnership in the community's future in terms of shared funding for a Sherman Park. However, it was informed during discussions with Dofasco's media executives that in the future they could not be counted on for maintenance funds for parks or anything else that was being done in partnership with the community. This caused a large attitudinal change from a few months earlier when the mine was associated with much of Temagami. The closure also {{had a significant impact on}} the economy of Temagami. There is still iron ore at Sherman Mine, but Dofasco were able to obtain it more cheaply elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Cold Compressive {{strength}} is {{considered as one}} of the important parameter of fitness to assess the pellet for metallurgical processing in blast furnace or DRI. During the pellet production Cold Compressive strength should be monitored to control the process. For this an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was modelled in this paper using MATLAB ® toolbox to predict the cold compressive strength of the <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>pellet.</b> Pellet size, Bentonite and green pellet moisture was taken as input variables and cold compressive strength as output variable. Various architectures of ANFIS were tested to obtain a model having lowest Mean Relative Percentage error (MRPE). It was found that MRPE of 1. 1802 % was obtained with 3 membership function for each input and the type of membership function used was triangular with output to be constant. The training was done using hybrid algorithm (mixed least squares and back propagation). The simulated values obtained from the ANFIS model was found close to the actual values, thus the model can act as a guide for the operator and thereby helps to attain the desired objective in <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>pellet</b> process...|$|R

40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{radiative}} heat transfer in a 580 kW(th) pilot scale test furnace that resembles a full-scale rotary kiln for <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>pellet</b> production. The aim is to quantify the {{radiative heat transfer}} in coal and cofiring flames and also to study the possibility to model the radiative heat transfer for such combustion conditions. Three combustion cases of coal and cofiring are studied, and an evaluation is made using a detailed radiation model. The test furnace is cylindrical and refractory lined but does not rotate and no <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>pellet</b> bed material is included. In-flame measurements of temperature, gas composition, particle concentration, radiative intensity, and radiative heat flux are conducted for the different fuels and fuel combinations. Overall, the differences in measured radiative intensities and heat fluxes among the three studied fuel cases are minor, which implies that introduction of renewable fuels by cofiring in a full-scale rotary kiln should be feasible with respect to heat transfer conditions. In the model, the furnace is treated as an axisymmetric and infinitely long cylinder, and gas properties are calculated with a statistical narrow-band model, while particle properties are calculated using Mie theory. The modeling results show reasonable to good predictivity compared to the measured intensity data. This indicates that the experimental data is of good quality but also indicates the potential use of the model in full-scale rotary kiln calculations in future work...|$|R

40|$|High arsenic {{level in}} natural waters, {{and in the}} ground, is {{nowadays}} a worldwide problem. Soil stabilization is a low-cost technology aiming to reduce the arsenic mobility in soil preventing the migration of the contaminant into the environment. Addition of iron oxides to arsenic contaminated soils has been proposed as an effective remediation technique. The aim of the present work was to re-use <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> broken <b>pellets,</b> i. e. a waste from mining industry, to immobilize arsenic within soil. A treatment was developed to increase the surface area of the <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> broken <b>pellets</b> and therefore increasing its adsorption efficiency. Four different iron oxides were evaluates: metallic iron grid, fine magnetite powder, <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> broken <b>pellets</b> and broken pellets modified by the developed treatment. Spherical nanoparticle aggregates covering {{the surface of the}} broken pellets were observed upon the application of the developed treatment. The immobilization performance of the iron oxide materials was evaluates for soil with and without plants. Soil pore water samples were collected and analysed after 11, 30 and 54 days. At the end of the experiment, the trace-element content of the plant shoots was analysed and a sequential extraction was performed for bulk and rhizosphere samples. While the zerovalent iron significantly reduced the mobility of arsenic in the contaminates soil, both in the presence and absence of plants, the other three iron oxide amendments did not significantly reduced the mobility of arsenic in the soil.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of a project which aim is to develop a process {{integration}} model for the Swedish <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> company LKAB's production system in Malmberget. Within the facility, there are two pelletising plants which were started up 1973 and 2006, respectively. Both pelletising plants are using the straight grate induration furnace, and they are the most energy intense process units within the facility. Basically a straight grate induration furnace consists of three different zones, i. e. a drying zone, a firing zone and a cooling zone, and their purpose is to upgrade crude <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> to the final product of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> <b>pellet.</b> As an initial step of the project, the mass and energy flows within a straight grate induration furnace have been analysed.
