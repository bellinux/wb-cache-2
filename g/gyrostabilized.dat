50|$|Along with Elmer Sperry, Norden {{worked on}} the first <b>gyrostabilizing</b> {{equipment}} for US ships, and became known for his contributions to military hardware. In 1913, he left Sperry and formed his own company. In 1920, he started work on the Norden bombsight for the United States Navy. The first bombsight was produced in 1927. It was essentially an analog computer, and bombardiers were trained in great secrecy {{on how to use}} it. The device was used to drop bombs accurately from an aircraft, supposedly accurate enough to hit a 100-foot circle from an altitude of 21,000 feet—but under actual combat situations, such an accuracy was never achieved.|$|R

50|$|Gimbal lock {{constrains}} maneuvering, and {{it would}} be beneficial to eliminate the slip rings and bearings of the gimbals. Therefore, some systems use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber to mount a <b>gyrostabilized</b> platform. These systems can have very high precisions (e.g., Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere). Like all <b>gyrostabilized</b> platforms, this system runs well with relatively slow, low-power computers.|$|E
5000|$|AIRS is a Fluid-suspended <b>gyrostabilized</b> {{platform}} system, {{as opposed}} to one using a Gimballed <b>gyrostabilized</b> platform. It consists of a beryllium sphere floating in fluid. Jet nozzles are used to stabilize the inertial platform as commanded from the sensors. This design not only eliminates the problem of gimbal lock, but also makes it extremely accurate (drift less than 1.5×10−5 °/h), accurate enough so any further improvement would give a negligible benefit to the missile's CEP.|$|E

50|$|The big {{disadvantage}} of this scheme {{is that it}} uses many expensive precision mechanical parts. It also has moving parts that can wear out or jam, and is vulnerable to gimbal lock. The primary guidance system of the Apollo spacecraft used a three-axis <b>gyrostabilized</b> platform, feeding data to the Apollo Guidance Computer. Maneuvers had to be carefully planned to avoid gimbal lock.|$|E
50|$|Some systems {{place the}} linear accelerometers on a {{gimballed}} <b>gyrostabilized</b> platform. The gimbals are {{a set of}} three rings, each {{with a pair of}} bearings initially at right angles. They let the platform twist about any rotational axis (or, rather, they let the platform keep the same orientation while the vehicle rotates around it). There are two gyroscopes (usually) on the platform.|$|E
50|$|The new frame appears, in our comoving {{coordinate}} chart, to be spinning, {{but in fact}} it is <b>gyrostabilized.</b> In particular, {{since our}} observer with the green world line in the figure is presumably riding a nonspinning dust particle (otherwise spin-spin forces would be apparent in the dynamics of the dust), he in fact observes nearby radially separated dust particles to be rotating clockwise about his location with angular velocity a. This explains the physical meaning of the parameter which we found in our earlier derivation of the first frame.|$|E
5000|$|Computing Fermi {{derivatives}} {{shows that}} the frame field just given is in fact spinning {{with respect to a}} <b>gyrostabilized</b> frame. The principal reason why is easy to spot: in this frame, each Hagihara observer keeps his spatial vectors radially aligned, so [...] rotate about [...] as the observer orbits around the central massive object. However, after correcting for this observation, a small precession of the spin axis of a gyroscope carried by a Hagihara observer still remains; this is the de Sitter precession effect (also called the geodetic precession effect).|$|E
50|$|The Light Tank M2 {{series was}} the most {{important}} pre-war US tank. These light tanks were mechanically very reliable, with good mobility. However, they had a high silhouette — from the use of an air-cooled radial engine for power — and poor armor. Only a few saw combat, on Guadalcanal. Their importance {{lies in the fact that}} they formed the basis for the much more successful Light Tank M3 (a.k.a. Stuart) series beginning in 1941. The Stuart was an improvement of the M2, with heavier armor and a 37 mm gun. From the M3A1 version, this gun was <b>gyrostabilized.</b>|$|E
50|$|In premium systems, {{the angular}} sensors are usually {{specialized}} transformer coils {{made in a}} strip on a flexible printed circuit board. Several coil strips are mounted on great circles around the spherical shell of the <b>gyrostabilized</b> platform. Electronics outside the platform uses similar strip-shaped transformers to read the varying magnetic fields produced by the transformers wrapped around the spherical platform. Whenever a magnetic field changes shape, or moves, it will cut the wires of the coils on the external transformer strips. The cutting generates an electric current in the external strip-shaped coils, and electronics can measure that current to derive angles.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also often}} {{desirable}} {{to ensure that}} the spatial triad carried by each observer does not rotate. In this case, the triad can be viewed as being <b>gyrostabilized.</b> The criterion for a nonspinning inertial (NSI) frame is again very simple:This says that as we move along the worldline of each observer, their spatial triad is parallel-transported. Nonspinning inertial frames hold a special place in general relativity, because they are as close as we can get in a curved Lorentzian manifold to the Lorentz frames used in special relativity (these are special nonspinning inertial frames in the Minkowski vacuum).|$|E

40|$|Summary—The {{large-scale}} TsNIIMASH ballistic {{facility was}} built in 1992 through modernization of the large shock tunnel. Having 0. 5 m caliber, the facility is 200 m long.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{response}} of a <b>gyrostabilized</b> platform subjected to a transient torque has been analyzed by deliberately introducing non-linearity into the command of the servomotor. The resulting third-order non-linear differential equation has been solved by using a transformation technique involving the displacement variable.

The effect of deliberate addition of non-linearity with a view to achieving the ideal response—that is, to bring the platform back to its equilibrium position with as few oscillations as possible—has been investigated. The conditions under which instability may set in on account of the small transient input and small non-linearity has also been discussed. The analysis is illustrated by means of a numerical example.

In {{order to}} realize the high {{precision}} tracking control of the vehicular eletro-optical tracking turntable with the car body’s vibration, {{it is necessary to}} design a high performance turntable servo system and a set of high precision eletro-optical tracking control scheme.

The second part of the paper presents details of standard <b>gyrostabilized</b> platform leveling by scheme ?accelerometer?gyroscope?platform?. In the third part a possibility to use PID-control for coarse leveling by ?accelerometer?platform? scheme is discussed. Gyrocompassing mode is the subject of the last fourth part. Results. Calculation formulas for determining the coefficients of the PID control, dynamic and precision characteristics of gyrocompassing mode for gyroscope proportional control law are obtained. The results of computational modeling of the process of leveling for multiple selection criteria of the coefficients of the PID-control are brought. Conclusions. It is concluded that using of standard Butterworth forms and integral criterion of minimum weighted error module allows us to bring and provide the necessary precision.
