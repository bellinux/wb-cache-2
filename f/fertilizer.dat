5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate <b>fertilizer,</b> and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the <b>fertilizer,</b> and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based <b>fertilizer</b> that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the <b>fertilizer</b> (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the <b>fertilizer</b> less explosive.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{investigation of}} fertilization {{began at the}} Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1843 by John Bennet Lawes.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres.

5000|$|Inorganic <b>fertilizers</b> are {{generally}} {{less expensive and}} have higher concentrations of nutrients than organic <b>fertilizers.</b> Also, since nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium generally {{must be in the}} inorganic forms to be taken up by plants, inorganic <b>fertilizers</b> {{are generally}} immediately bioavailable to plants without modification.
