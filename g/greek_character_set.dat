40|$|The Coptic {{alphabet}} developed out of {{a history}} of attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet, beginning soon after Alexander the Great’s conquest of Egypt {{toward the end of the}} fourth century BCE. Various selections of characters from the Demotic writing system (which was the last of the native Egyptian writing systems, after the Hieroglyphic and Hieratic systems) were used in addition to the <b>Greek</b> <b>character</b> <b>set</b> in order to represent Egyptian phonemes that were not represented there, and eight of these Demotic characters eventually became a standard part of the Coptic writing system, graphically conformed to the Greek alphabet as written in literary manuscripts around the turn of the third century C...|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Adobe {{released}} the OpenType version called Lithos Pro, which included Adobe CE, Adobe Western 2, <b>Greek</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> support, and small caps in the lowercase positions. OpenType features include alternates, case forms, proportional lining figures, small caps.|$|R
50|$|This is an {{expanded}} version of Frutiger Next W1G. It added Greek (from Frutiger Next <b>Greek)</b> and Cyrillic <b>character</b> <b>sets,</b> but advertised OpenType features {{were reduced to}} superscript and subscript. Only an OpenType version has been produced.|$|R
50|$|The full Underground Pro Set {{contains}} nineteen Pro OpenType fonts and 58 Basic OpenType fonts, covering extended Latin, <b>Greek,</b> Cyrillic <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> Weights are {{expanded to}} six: Thin, Light, Book, Medium, Demi, Heavy. Underground, Underground CY, Underground GR support extended Latin, Cyrillic, <b>Greek</b> <b>characters</b> respectively. The Latin sub-family contains medium weight Titling fonts, which feature underscored and/or overscored Latin small letters. Pro fonts include extensive OpenType features, including eleven stylistic sets with stylistic alternates inspired by early signs, Johnston's calligraphy and draft designs for Johnton and geometric sans designs such as Futura. Following {{the lead of}} Johnston's original, P22 decided not to offer an italic.|$|R
50|$|ISO 5428:1984, <b>Greek</b> {{alphabet}} coded <b>character</b> <b>set</b> for {{bibliographic information}} interchange, is an ISO standard for an 8-bit character encoding {{for the modern}} Greek language. It contains a set of 73 graphic characters and is available through UNIMARC. In practice it is now superseded by Unicode.|$|R
50|$|The family {{includes}} five font weights in two widths (Normal and Condensed), {{each with}} italics. The entire family includes extended characters such as arrows, fractions, Euro sign, lozenge, mathematical symbols, extra accented Latin letters, and superscript numeral figures. Alternate glyphs include rounded dots, old style figures, and alternate cedilla. With time Eastern European, <b>Greek</b> and Cyrillic <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> {{have been added}} as well.|$|R
50|$|Palatino's early {{digitisation}} {{intended for}} PostScript use is very widely used or cloned. Later Palatino digitisations have different features and spacing. In 1999, Zapf revised Palatino for Linotype and Microsoft, called Palatino Linotype. The revised family incorporated extended Latin, <b>Greek,</b> and Cyrillic <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> Linotype released {{a more complex}} redesign named Palatino nova, together with digitisations of some of Zapf's other Renaissance-inspired designs and Aldus. Zapf also created a matching Palatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal design in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The film {{is based}} on the story of the <b>Greek</b> mythological <b>character</b> Electra. <b>Set</b> in the city of Argos a few years after the Trojan war, that story {{revolves}} around the vengeance that Electra and her brother Orestes take on their mother Clytemnestra and step father Aegisthus for the murder of their father, Agamemnon. There are many adaptations of the story. The 2011 film is particularly inspired by the plays Electra by Sophocles, Electra by Euripides, Oresteia by Aeschylus and Mourning Becomes Electra by Eugene O’Neill.|$|R
5000|$|The Segoe UI {{typeface}} is {{the default}} font for Aero with languages that use Latin, <b>Greek,</b> and Cyrillic <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> The default font size is also increased from 8pt to 9pt to improve readability. In the Segoe UI typeface prior to Windows 8, the numeral zero ("0") is narrow, while capital letter [...] "O" [...] is wider (Windows 8's Segoe UI keeps this difference), and numeral one ("1") has a top hook, while capital letter [...] "I" [...] has equal crown and base (Windows 8's [...] "1" [...] has no base, and the [...] "I" [...] {{does not have}} a crown or base).|$|R

2500|$|Prior to Unicode, {{support for}} sampi in {{electronic}} encoding was marginal. No common 8-bit codepage for Greek (such as ISO 8859-7) contained sampi. However, lowercase and uppercase sampi were provided {{for by the}} [...] <b>Greek</b> alphabet coded <b>character</b> <b>set</b> for bibliographic information interchange. In Beta code, lowercase and uppercase sampi are encoded as [...] "#5" [...] and [...] "*#5" [...] respectively. In the LaTeX typesetting system, the [...] "Babel" [...] package allows accessing lowercase and uppercase sampi through the commands [...] "\sampi" [...] and [...] "\Sampi". Non-Unicode (8-bit) fonts for polytonic Greek sometimes contained sampi mapped to arbitrary positions, but usually not as a casing pair. For instance, the [...] "WP Greek Century" [...] font that came with WordPerfect had sampi encoded as 0xFC, while the popular [...] "Wingreek" [...] fonts had it encoded as 0x22. No encoding system prior to Unicode 5.1 catered for archaic epigraphic sampi separately.|$|R
25|$|CP/M {{used the}} 7-bit ASCII set. The other 128 {{characters}} {{made possible by}} the 8-bit byte were not standardized. For example, one Kaypro used them for <b>Greek</b> <b>characters,</b> and Osborne machines used the 8th bit set to indicate an underlined character. WordStar used the 8th bit as an end-of-word marker. International CP/M systems most commonly used the ISO 646 norm for localized <b>character</b> <b>sets,</b> replacing certain ASCII characters with localized characters rather than adding them beyond the 7-bit boundary.|$|R
