40|$|Procedures {{based on}} DNA {{hybridization}} and PCR were developed for quality control of Rhizobium inoculants. Inoculants for pea and goat’s rue were produced by Elomestari Ltd., Juva, Finland, in sterile dry fine peat {{by the standard}} procedure used by the company. The inoculants contained Rhizobium <b>galegae</b> HAMBI 1174 and HAMBI 1207 and an R. leguminosarum biovar viciae strain, 16 HSA, either solely or in combinations {{of two or three}} strains. DNA was isolated from 1 -g samples of each peat inoculant and analyzed by nonradioactive DNA-DNA hybridization and by PCR. The hybridization probes were total DNAs from pure cultures of R. <b>galegae</b> HAMBI 1207 and R. leguminosarum biovar viciae 16 HSA and a 264 -bp strain-specific fragment from the genome of R. <b>galegae</b> HAMBI 1174.

40|$|Rhizobia are agriculturally {{important}} {{bacteria that}} possess {{the ability to}} fix nitrogen for their host legumes, an attribute ascribed {{to the presence of}} symbiosis-related genes usually clustered on plasmids called symbiotic plasmids (pSyms). Many pSyms have been proven self-transmissible, capable of transferring themselves to other bacteria through conjugation, thereby propagating their symbiotic features. Rhizobium <b>galegae</b> symbiovar (sv.) officinalis has a pSym, on which typical conjugation genes have been revealed. A Type IV secretion system (T 4 SS) functioning as a conjugation system has also been computationally predicted on a chromid, another replicon in R. <b>galegae</b> sv. officinalis. In addition, the transfer of the pSym of R. <b>galegae</b> sv. officinalis to a non-nodulating mutant strain of R. <b>galegae</b> sv. orientalis has been previously observed under laboratory conditions. Therefore, this thesis was aimed at investigating the self-transmissibility of the pSym of R. <b>galegae</b> sv. officinalis and the necessity of the T 4 SS’ presence for the pSym transfer. Two derivatives of the R. <b>galegae</b> sv. officinalis were generated with one strain cured of its pSym by using Tn 5 -mob-sacB transposon and the other strain excised the T 4 SS from the chromid by Cre-lox site specific recombination system. Conjugation were then performed between these two derivatives as well as between the wild-type strain and the plasmid-cured derivative, followed by the host plant nodulation tests. The tests showed no formation of a single nodule in either pair, which was unexpectedly inconsistent with the previous experimental observation. No solid explanations could be proposed at this stage. It might be due to the low transfer frequency resulted from complex associations with subtle environmental signal molecules or recipient cell recognition that presumably disabled the transmissibility of the pSym...|$|R

40|$|Rhizobia are soil {{bacteria}} {{able to fix}} atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with leguminous plants. In response to a signal cascade coded by genes of both symbiotic partners, a specific plant organ, the nodule, is formed. Rhizobial nodulation (nod) genes trigger nodule formation through the synthesis of Nod factors, a family of chitolipooligo-saccharides that are specifically recognized by the host plant at the first stages of the nodulation process. Here, we present the organization and sequence of the common nod genes from Rhizobium <b>galegae,</b> a symbiotic member of the Rhizobiaceae. This species has an intriguing phylogenetic position, being symbiotic among pathogenic agro-bacteria, which induce tumors instead of nodules in plant shoots or roots. This apparent incongruence raises special interest in {{the origin of the}} symbiotic apparatus of R. <b>galegae.</b> Our analysis of DNA sequence data indicated that the organization of the common nod gene region of R. <b>galegae</b> was similar to that of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum, with nodIJ downstream of nodABC and the regulatory nodD gene closely linked to the common nod operon. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses of the nod gene sequences showed a close relationship especially between the common nodA sequences of R. <b>galegae,</b> S. meliloti, and R. leguminosarum biovars viciae and trifolii. This relationship in structure and sequence contrasts with the phylogeny based on 16 S rRNA, which groups R. <b>galegae</b> close to agrobacteria and separate from most other rhizobia.

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies of the {{taxonomy}} of bacteria were initiated {{in the last}} quarter of the 19 th century when bacteria were classified in six genera placed in four tribes based on their morphological appearance. Since then {{the taxonomy}} of bacteria has been revolutionized several times. At present, 30 phyla belong to the domain Bacteria, which includes over 9600 species. Unlike many eukaryotes, bacteria lack complex morphological characters and practically phylogenetically informative fossils. It is partly due to these reasons that bacterial taxonomy is complicated. Due to the improvement of methods to obtain sequence level characters plus new methods for their analyses, the taxonomy of bacteria has also been improved. However, there is still no official classification of prokaryotes. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a process in which bacteria reduce inert nitrogen gas to biologically useful ammonia. The symbiotic interaction between rhizobia and legumes (Fabaceae or Leguminosae) is important both in natural systems and in agriculture. Rhizobia is a general name for a group of bacteria that can enter symbiosis with legumes. Until 1982, all these were classified into one single bacterial genus, Rhizobium. The number of rhizobial genera increased to 17 by the year 2011, from which five genera, Rhizobium, Allorhizobium, Agrobacterium, Ensifer (syn. Sinorhizobium), and Shinella were accommodated in the family Rhizobiaceae. The genus Agrobacterium, a group of mostly pathogenic bacteria, was placed among the beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) in the family Rhizobiaceae. That resulted in several taxonomic issues regarding the family Rhizobiaceae. The main nomenclatural issue regarding the genus Agrobacterium resulted from transferring this genus to the genus Rhizobium. Moreover, the phylogenetic position of the former nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium <b>galegae</b> complex was not clear. This group of bacteria was in previous studies clustered with either Agrobacterium or Rhizobium or placed in a lineage separately from other genera of the family Rhizobiaceae. During the last decade, the number of the rhizobial species increased dramatically, especially in the genus Rhizobium. However, Rhizobium is an inappropriate genus name for some of the species assigned to the genus. To resolve some of the major taxonomic uncertainties of the family Rhizobiaceae, two separate multilocus sequencing analyses (MLSA) were performed. In the first study, an MLSA of 114 rhizobial strains was performed by using six housekeeping genes (atpD, glnA, glnII, recA, rpoB, and thrC). The first MLSA study was focusing on the phylogeny of the taxa belonging to the former Rhizobium <b>galegae</b> complex and the genus Agrobacterium. In the second MLSA, a total of 100 strains representing 81 species of the family Rhizobiaceae were studied using four housekeeping genes namely 16 S rRNA, atpD, recA, and rpoB. Based on these results, we proposed delineation of two new genera, Neorhizobium gen. nov. and Pararhizobium gen. nov., and 16 new species combinations, Neorhizobium <b>galegae</b> comb. nov., Neorhizobium huautlense comb. nov., Neorhizobium alkalisoli comb. nov., Agrobacterium nepotum comb. nov., Agrobacterium pusense comb. nov., Agrobacterium skierniewicense comb. nov., Allorhizobium vitis comb. nov., Allorhizobium taibaishanense comb. nov., Allorhizobium paknamense comb. nov., Allorhizobium oryzae comb. nov., Allorhizobium pseudoryzae comb. nov., Allorhizobium borbori comb. nov., Pararhizobium giardinii comb. nov., Pararhizobium capsulatum comb. nov., Pararhizobium herbae comb. nov., and Pararhizobium sphaerophysae comb. nov. (Paper I and II). A total of 159 bacterial strains were isolated from the nodules of the Chinese specimens of the plant genus Glycyrrhiza L. The results of the study showed that 29 true symbiotic strains belong to the genus Mesorhizobium. To estimate the phylogenetic position of the 29 isolates an MLSA was performed for 59 mesorhizobial strains by using three housekeeping genes 16 S rRNA, recA, and rpoB. Moreover, the phylogeny of three symbiotic genes (nodA, nodC, and nifH) of these 59 mesorhizobial strains was investigated. The results of MLSA showed that 21 test strains belong to the species M. tianshanense, M. gobiense, M. temperatum, M. muleiense, M. amorphae, M. alhagi, and M. camelthorni, whereas eight test strains might belong to a novel species of Mesorhizobium. The results of the analyses of accessory genes in this study showed that the mesorhizobial strains isolated from the plant genus Glycyrrhiza have probably acquired some genetic material from other rhizobia co-evolving with Glycyrrhiza and other legumes (Paper III). ...|$|R

To help trace the evolution of these genes in the legumes-and possibly, the acquisition of new functions for nodulation-apyrase-containing BACs were sequenced from three legume genomes. Genomic sequences from Medicago truncatula, Glycine max and Lotus japonicus were compared {{to one another and}} to corresponding regions in Arabidopsis thaliana. A phylogenetic analysis of apyrase homologs from these regions and sequences from other legume species, as well as other plant families, identified a potentially legume-specific clade that contains a well-characterized soybean (G. soja) apyrase, Gs 52, as well as homologs from Dolichos, Lotus, Medicago and Pisum. Sister clades contain homologs from members of Brassicaceae, Solanaceae, Poaceae and Fabaceae. Comparisons of rates of change at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the Gs 52 and sister clades show rapid evolution in the potentially legume-specific Gs 52 clade. The genomic organization of the apyrase-containing BACs shows evidence of gene duplication, genomic rearrangement, and gene conversion among Gs 52 homologs. Taken together, these results suggest a scenario of local apyrase gene duplication in an ancestor of the legumes, followed by functional diversification and increased rates of change in the new genes, and further duplications in the <b>Galegae</b> (which include the genera Medicago and Pisum). The study also provides a detailed comparison of genomic regions between two model genomes which are now being sequenced (M. truncatula and L. japonicus), and a genome from an economically important legume species (G. max) ...|$|R

This shows that the constitutive LPS receptor in BMC from C 3 H/HeJ and C 57 BL/ 10 ScCr mice is fully able to trigger a complete signalling cascade. Results of cross-inhibition of the binding of radiolabelled LPS indicated that active LPSs (from R. species Sin- 1 and R. <b>galegae)</b> and inactive LPSs (from S. enterica and B. pertussis) bind to the same site of the constitutive LPS receptor of C 3 H/HeJ cells. Furthermore, binding of R. species Sin- 1 LPS, and signalling induced by this LPS, were both inhibited by pre-exposure of C 3 H/HeJ cells to B. pertussis lipid A. This correlation between binding and signalling suggests that in C 3 H/HeJ cells, the constitutive receptor, which recognizes a large panel of LPSs from different origins, appears selectively unable to be activated by some particular LPSs, such as those of Enterobacteria and Bordetella...|$|R
