25|$|The {{first serious}} {{concerns}} about driver safety occurred on Friday afternoon. Dr. Steve Olvey, CART Director of Medical Affairs, would later report that two drivers <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and disoriented after running their cars at over , and that they felt they could not control their cars. The identities of the two drivers were not disclosed, but Tony Kanaan and Alex Zanardi later claimed they experienced the symptoms. Adrian Fernandez also reported to the media he was experiencing dizziness. Olvey said in his 25 years of working in motorsports, {{it was a problem}} he had never experienced.|$|E
25|$|Despite poor health, Grand Duke Andrei {{lived to}} be 77 years old, an age reached by few in the Romanov family. He surpassed the {{longevity}} record held by his great-uncle, Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich, by almost six months. On the morning of 31 October 1956, Grand Duke Andrei worked in his study. Having finished a letter on his typewriter, he <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy,</b> went to his bed to lie down and died suddenly. He was buried wearing the uniform of the Horse Guard Artillery Brigade, which he had commanded during World War I. Matilda Kshesinskaya died in Paris in December 1971 at age 99. Prince Vladimir Romanovsky-Krasinsky died unmarried and childless in France in 1974, three years after his mother.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Turkish Ministry of Youth and Sports, {{during the}} Men's 1500 metres, Vahram Papazyan had a [...] "fabulous tempo" [...] and {{was leading the}} race which {{positioned}} him for first place. However, when about 20â€“25 meters remained in the race, Papazyan suddenly <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and collapsed.|$|E
60|$|A {{wave of the}} azalea scent {{drifted into}} June's face; she <b>felt</b> sick and <b>dizzy.</b>|$|R
60|$|The captive {{was right}} in his surmise. The tea had been drugged, and soon poor Dave <b>felt</b> so <b>dizzy</b> he had {{to rest on the}} bed. He tried several times to rouse up, and then his senses forsook him completely.|$|R
60|$|Leland {{contrived}} {{to drive}} {{two of the}} loaded train, though his head was aching and he <b>felt</b> very <b>dizzy.</b> When at last {{he was about to}} turn off into a second sledge-track, the Sergeant pulled up his horse beside him.|$|R
2500|$|Karen sought {{therapy for}} her eating {{disorder}} with psychotherapist Steven Levenkron in New York City. In April, she briefly returned to Los Angeles for recording, including a Carpenter / Bettis tune [...] "You're Enough" [...] and a Roger Nichols / Dean Pitchford song, [...] "Now". Richard noticed that while Karen's {{interpretation of the}} songs was as strong as ever, he felt the timbre was weak owing to her poor health. He was unimpressed with Levenkron's treatment of Karen, which he considered worthless. In September, Karen called Levenkron to say her heart was [...] "beating funny" [...] and she <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and confused. Admitting herself into hospital later that month, she was hooked up to an intravenous drip; she ended up gaining [...] in eight weeks. On November 8, she left the hospital and despite pleas from family and friends, she announced that she was returning home to California {{and that she was}} cured. Her last public appearance was on January 11, 1983, for a photo session celebrating 25 years of the Grammy Awards.|$|E
60|$|Ferris got {{upon his}} feet slowly. His head <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> {{from the shock}} he had received.|$|E
60|$|He {{no longer}} <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and sick; {{the fear of}} Mr. Lord had dispelled all that, and he felt strong and active again.|$|E
60|$|Alison <b>felt</b> {{physically}} <b>dizzy,</b> but she contrived to ask {{another question}} or two, {{and then went}} out, utterly cast down and desperate, into the steadily falling rain. She {{was alone in the}} big western city, with very little money in her purse and no idea as to what she should do.|$|R
6000|$|Said Carl to Ruth, [...] "Not that there's any dancing, but I <b>felt</b> you'd get <b>dizzy</b> if you climbed {{any higher}} in that aeroplane." ...|$|R
60|$|She went to {{the window}} for air--the pain about her heart was dreadful. And, leaning there against the shutter, she <b>felt</b> quite <b>dizzy</b> from the {{violence}} of a struggle that refused coherent thought or feeling, and was just a dumb pull of instincts, both so terribly strong--how terribly strong she had not till then perceived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; we'll {{go on in}} a minute. I don't {{know what}} was the matter; <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and couldn't keep my balance. Think I needed a rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|Much {{against his}} will Godfrey found himself bound to obey, and looked her [...] "in the eye." [...] A few moments later he <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy,</b> and after that he remembered no more.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few seconds}} Cliffe <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy.</b> His head was unsteady, his knees seemed weak, and {{as he tried to}} get down he lost his balance. Falling {{from the top of the}} barricade, he plunged heavily into the trench, where his senses left him.|$|E
60|$|After two {{or three}} minutes' {{cautious}} work they lifted Festing out of the hole. He was unconscious and his arm looked short and distorted. Charnock <b>felt</b> horror-struck and <b>dizzy,</b> but pulled himself together.|$|R
60|$|Jane Porter sank {{weak and}} {{trembling}} {{against the side}} of the boat. She <b>felt</b> sick and <b>dizzy.</b> And now, if Spider should not draw the 1875 piece she must endure the whole horrid thing again.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{tried to}} rise to his feet, but his head whirled so, and he <b>felt</b> so <b>dizzy</b> and sick {{from the effects of}} his fall, that he was obliged to sit down again until he should feel able to stand. Meanwhile the crowd around the wagon paid no {{attention}} to him, and he lay there quietly enough, until he heard the hateful voice of Mr. Lord asking if his boy were hurt.|$|R
6000|$|The Cockney came over, feinted in an {{absent-minded}} manner, made {{swift and}} confusing circles {{with his left}} hand, and hit Bill Wrenn on the aforesaid bloody nose, which immediately became a bleeding nose. Bill Wrenn <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and, sitting on a grain-sack, listened amazedly to the Cockney's apologetic: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seemed to}} me {{something}} in my head snapped, at that moment. I <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and furious. I remember seeing a great sharp bowie-knife on the table; I remember something about catching it, and flying upon him; and then all grew dark, and I didn't know any more,--not for days and days.|$|E
60|$|An {{answer at}} {{which some of}} the {{audience}} could have smiled, so well did it accord with her habits. The prisoner again insisted on her defining the mode of his becoming bound to the agreement. Rachel took time for consideration, and Alison Williams, sitting between Lady Temple and Colonel Keith, <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> with anxiety for the answer. It came at last.|$|E
60|$|Bill <b>felt</b> {{positively}} <b>dizzy.</b> He groped back in {{his memory}} for facts. He had gone out for his walk after dinner. They had dined at eight. He had been walking some time. Why, in Heaven's name, this was the quickest thing in the amatory annals of civilization! His brain was too numbed {{to work out a}} perfectly accurate schedule, but it looked as if she must have got engaged to this Pickering person before she met him, Bill, in the road that night.|$|R
60|$|Rammer in hand, Walter edged {{closer and}} closer to the muzzle of the Polly. The Brooklyn was moving up and down over the long green waves, sending the spray flying on both sides of the bow. He gave one look down, <b>felt</b> himself growing <b>dizzy,</b> and then kept his eyes on the gun.|$|R
60|$|It was {{certainly}} poetic justice that Fred should get seasick {{and that the}} malady should affect him far more seriously than it did Hans. The medicine given to the German lad made him feel better {{in less than an}} hour, while poor Fred suffered until noon of the next day. None of the other boys were affected. The ladies and the girls <b>felt</b> rather <b>dizzy,</b> and Mrs. Stanhope had to lie down until the next forenoon, but by the evening of the next day all were around as before, and then seasickness became a thing of the past.|$|R
60|$|Every one <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy,</b> {{and there}} was no space for aught but action. Perhaps Albinia was glad of the hurry, she could not talk to Gilbert till she had learnt to put faith in him, and she would rather do him {{substantial}} kindnesses than be made the sharer of feelings that had too often proved like the growth of the seed which found no depth of earth.|$|E
60|$|Several {{soldiers}} who had been taken sick on the march to Oswego had been left behind, but now others were overcome by {{the heat and the}} glare of the sun on the water, and one batteau had to be turned into a floating hospital. At one time Dave himself <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy,</b> but he said nothing, for he well knew that Lieutenant Naster would have no mercy on him, sick or well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{may have}} to hurt you worse than this presently," [...] said the philosopher imperturbably as he dragged Beresteyn--who by now <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and helpless--to the nearest chair and {{deposited}} him there. [...] "Were you not her brother, I believe I should crack your obstinate skull; as it is ... I will leave you here to take counsel with reason and honesty until I have finally disposed of my Lord of Stoutenburg." ...|$|E
60|$|Her fingers {{clutched}} his arm {{as they passed}} along the promenade and down the corridor into the street. The car was waiting, {{and in a moment}} or two {{they were on their way}} to Hampstead. She was beginning to look a little more natural, but she still clung to him. Arnold <b>felt</b> his head <b>dizzy</b> as though with strong wine.|$|R
50|$|In 1932, when Birriel was 16 years old, {{he started}} to grow at an {{alarming}} rate. One day, he went to visit a doctor because he <b>felt</b> sick with <b>dizzy</b> spells {{and because he was}} also feeling weak. The doctor informed Birriel that for some unknown reason, his pituitary gland had developed a tumor. Even though the condition did not have a known cure, it was still treatable.|$|R
60|$|Charnock <b>felt</b> {{faint and}} <b>dizzy,</b> but {{tried to think}} when the fellow banged the door. It looked as if Wilkinson knew why he had come, and had stolen away after seeing the {{struggle}} begin. Moreover he had friends who might go after him and tell him {{what had happened to}} the foreman. Then he remembered that the locomotive engineer had been ordered to move some cars, and set off for the track.|$|R
60|$|Plunging {{into the}} dust {{he noticed that}} it had an acrid smell, {{and a moment later}} he <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy.</b> Then he was {{conscious}} of an intolerable headache and a feeling of nausea. He could hardly see; he was losing control of his limbs; but he struggled on and, overtaking the others, helped to drag out an unconscious man. Then he sat down, gasping, and found it difficult to prevent himself from slipping off the stone.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought of}} the old feud and hatred; I thought of my pride and traditions. They seemed like the dust and ashes of outworn things--things to be smiled at and cast aside. I took out all the letters I had written--all except the last one--sealed them up in a parcel and {{directed}} it to Alan Fraser. Then, summoning my groom, I bade him ride to Glenellyn with it. His look of amazement almost made me laugh, but after he was gone I <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and frightened at my own daring.|$|E
60|$|Mowgli sat down, muttering, {{with his}} face in his hands. All manner of strange {{feelings}} that he had never felt before were running over him, exactly as though he had been poisoned, and he <b>felt</b> <b>dizzy</b> and a little sick. He drank the warm milk in long gulps, Messua patting him on the shoulder from time to time, not quite sure whether he were her son Nathoo of the long ago days, or some wonderful Jungle being, but glad to feel that he was at least flesh and blood.|$|E
5000|$|Prather was {{inspired}} to open the site by {{the popularity of the}} nearby Oregon Vortex which opened to the public in 1930. According to a newspaper report, Prather bought 3 acres on the hill in 1940 after he <b>felt</b> slightly <b>dizzy</b> while walking and was interested in his dizziness. The newspaper also reported that during further exploration of his property he found his compass jittering and he then built his [...] "crazy house" [...] and opened the site to the public in June 1941, where tour guides lead visitors through the Mystery Spot on a daily basis. The site is what is known as a gravity hill and was {{the first of its kind}} to be built in California. The guides perform various demonstrations to showcase the unusual phenomena that Prather stumbled upon.|$|R
6000|$|But {{while the}} last word was in my ears, the whole group vanished, {{and there was nothing}} between me and the Chinese printed folding-screen that stood before the door. I was cold and trembling; I could only totter forward and throw myself on the sofa. This strange new power had {{manifested}} itself again [...] . But was it a power? Might it not rather be a disease--a sort of intermittent delirium, concentrating my energy of brain into moments of unhealthy activity, and leaving my saner hours all the more barren? I <b>felt</b> a <b>dizzy</b> sense of unreality in what my eye rested on; I grasped the bell convulsively, like one trying to free himself from nightmare, and rang it twice. Pierre came with a look of alarm in his face.|$|R
60|$|His head, however, {{hurt him}} {{too much for him}} to {{continue}} the strain of thought, and, after a while, he dozed off to sleep. When he awoke, a faint light was streaming in through a slit, two or three inches wide, high up on the wall. He still <b>felt</b> faint and <b>dizzy,</b> from the effects of the blow. Parched with thirst, he tried to call out for water, but scarce a sound came from his lips.|$|R
