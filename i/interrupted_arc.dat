5000|$|The impact {{distorted}} the Witwatersrand Basin which was laid down {{over a period}} of 250 million years between 950 and 700 million years before the Vredefort impact. The overlying Ventersdorp lavas and the Transvaal Supergroup which were laid down between 700 and 80 million years before the meteorite strike, were similarly distorted by the formation of the 300 km wide crater. These rocks form partial concentric rings round the crater center today, with the oldest, the Witwatersrand rocks, forming a semicircle 25 km from the center. Since the Witwatersrand rocks consist of several layers of very hard, erosion resistant sediments (e.g. quartzites and banded ironstones), they form the prominent arc of hills that can be seen to the NW of the crater center in the satellite picture above. The Witwatersrand rocks are followed, in succession, by the Ventersdorp lavas at a distance of about 35 km from the center, and the Transvaal Supergroup, consisting of a narrow band of the Ghaap Dolomite rocks and the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks, which together form a 25 - 30 km wide band beyond that. From about halfway through the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks around the crater center, the order of the rocks is reversed. Moving outwards towards where the crater rim used to be, the Ghaap Dolomite group resurfaces at 60 km from the center, followed by an arc of Ventersdorp lavas, beyond which, at between 80 and 120 km from the center, the Witwatersrand rocks re-emerge to form an <b>interrupted</b> <b>arc</b> of outcrops today, of which the Johannesburg group is the most famous, because it was here that gold was discovered in 1886. It is thus possible that {{if it had not been}} for the Vredefort impact this gold would never have been discovered.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimTo present {{practical}} {{examples of}} our new algorithm for reconstruction of 3 D dose distribution, based on the actual MLC leaf movement. BackgroundDynaLog and RTplan files were used by DDcon software to prepare a new RTplan file for dose distribution reconstruction. Materials and methodsFour different clinically relevant scenarios {{were used to assess}} the feasibility of the proposed new approach: (1) Reconstruction of whole treatment sessions for prostate cancer; (2) Reconstruction of IMRT verification treatment plan; (3) Dose reconstruction in breast cancer; (4) Reconstruction of <b>interrupted</b> <b>arc</b> and complementary plan for an interrupted VMAT treatment session of prostate cancer. The applied reconstruction method was validated by comparing reconstructed and measured fluence maps. For all statistical analysis, the U Mann–Whitney test was used. ResultsIn the first two and the fourth cases, there were no statistically significant differences between the planned and reconstructed dose distribution (p= 0. 910, p= 0. 975, p= 0. 893, respectively). In the third case the differences were statistically significant (p= 0. 015). Treatment plan had to be reconstructed. ConclusionDeveloped dose distribution reconstruction algorithm presents a very useful QA tool. It provides means for 3 D dose distribution verification in patient volume and allows to evaluate the influence of actual MLC leaf motion on the dose distribution...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The medium-voltage dc (MVDC) {{architecture}} shows {{potential for}} future ship power systems. Components of the MVDC system are fairly well established; {{with the exception}} of circuit breakers. The main problem with the breakers in dc systems is the absence of a zero crossing in the current needed to extinguish an <b>interrupting</b> <b>arc.</b> Options for breakers in MVDC systems include over-sizing traditional ac breakers, hybrid mechanical/semiconductor breakers, and solid-state breakers. The recently introduced z-source breaker is most similar to the solid-state breaker, but has the additional feature of automatically responding to faults quickly and without the need for fault detection. Furthermore, the z-source breaker isolates the generation source from the fault current.

5000|$|Another way to {{mitigate}} arc flash {{is to use}} a triggered current limiter or commutating current limiter which inserts a low rated continuous current current limiting fuse that melts and <b>interrupts</b> the <b>arc</b> flash within 4 ms.

40|$|Abstract – The {{results of}} {{electro-discharge}} proc-esses in vacuum arc interrupters on the developed and constructed synthetic test stand are described. The stand ensures a current amplitude up to 100 kA {{with a duration}} of 10 ± 1 ms at a voltage up to 5 kV and an amplitude of transient recovery voltage up to 40 kV. It contains two circuits working synchro-nously: a current pulse generator with the total capacity of 0. 073 F (with a power of ~ 0. 9 MJ at 5 kV) and a voltage pulse generator with an operating volt-age 40 kV (with the power equal to 0. 32 MJ at 40 kV). There is also a complex of control and measuring equipment which allows one to register current through the circuit-breaker being tested, measure arc voltage when the circuit-breaker contacts are opened and determine the form of the transient recovery voltage curve.

40|$|Interruptions during film growth {{have been}} {{discussed}} by researchers to assist in understanding the evolution of stress in physical vapour deposition films. A change in intrinsic stress {{is directly related to}} microstructure, hence careful analysis of stress in films can provide valuable structure–stress correlated information. In this study we discuss the use of combining two X-ray diffraction (XRD) stress analysis methods to elucidate the effect of interruptions during growth on the residual stress of TiN films. The sin 2 ψ and crystallite group method (CGM), scanning the (220) peaks from all grains in the film and only (111) oriented crystallites respectively, were used to analyse residual stress in standard and <b>interrupted</b> cathodic <b>arc</b> TiN films 1. 5, 3. 5 and 6. 5 μm thick, grownon high-speed steel substrates. The sin 2 ψ method does not reveal any changes in stresswith interruptions, however, measurements using the CGMshow increased compressive stress and increased a 0 in the resultant TiN films. A comparison of results from both XRD methods indicates that an increased compressive stress from interruptions could be due to an increased number of defects in (111) oriented grains during the interruptions which would also affect a 0 as evident. In both methods, compressive stresses are found to decrease with increased thickness of films...|$|R
50|$|An early form of {{circuit breaker}} was {{described}} by Thomas Edison in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used fuses.

40|$|A vacuum {{interrupter}} is a switching device used in vacuum circuit breakers, which are widely employed in medium voltage circuits for interrupting the short-circuit fault currents. The {{vacuum interrupter}} is the chamber {{in which the}} arc extinction and hence the current interruption takes place. On the occurrence of a fault, the breaker mechanism separates the contacts of the vacuum interrupter. As the contacts separate, an arc is established between the contacts. The arc evolves in the contact space and extinguishes {{at or near the}} current zero, thus interrupting the current. The processes of arc ignition, evolution and extinction are very complex. These processes are fundamental to the design and the performance of the vacuum interrupter and hence the circuit breaker. The evolution of the arc predominantly depends on the short-circuit current, the design and metallurgy of the contacts. The evolution of the vacuum arc has been the focal point of considerable research activity. Significant effort has been concentrated to understand the various modes of the arc, the transition between the modes, the arc movement and the dependency on the contact design and finally the effect of the arc evolution on the current interruption performance of the vacuum interrupter. The voltage across the contacts during the arcing, termed as the arc voltage, has been a focal point of several research projects. Research has shown that the arc voltage depends strongly on the mode and the evolution process of the arc. The dependency is observed with respect to the magnitude {{and the nature of the}} arc voltage. This dependency has been established through the comparison of the arc voltage trace and the actual arc photographs. The arc voltage is thus an important parameter in understanding the arcing process in the <b>interrupter.</b> <b>Arc</b> voltage could also be utilised to compare the arcing behaviour in vacuum interrupters with different contact geometries and metallurgies. Having understood how the arc voltage depends on the arc modes and how it can be used to analyse the arcing performance of the interrupter, this work aims to establish experimentally the dependency of the arc voltage on fundamental parameters of the short-circuit current and the contact design. The variation of the arc voltage is studied with respect to the magnitude of the short-circuit current. It is seen that the magnitude of the arc voltage is higher, for a higher short-circuit current. This dependency is also reflected in the nature of the arc voltage waveform. The effect of cumulative short- circuit operations has been understood through the study of arc voltage variation with respect to the accumulated arcing time. It has been found that the arc voltage consistently decreases as the accumulated arcing time increases. The effect of the contact diameter on the arc evolution has been studied by comparing the arc voltage variations for contacts of different diameters for the same short-circuit current. It is observed that the variation of arc voltage with respect to the contact diameter depends on the type of contact. In the case of radial magnetic field contacts, it has been observed that the arc voltage is lower for a contact with lower diameter. Whereas in the case of axial magnetic field contacts there is an inverse relation between the contact diameter and the arc voltage. Finally, the effect of the type and distribution of the magnetic field on the arc voltage variation as well as the contact erosion has been studied. In general, the observations show that the arc voltage magnitude for the radial magnetic field geometry is higher than the axial magnetic field geometry. Also, there is a significant difference in the appearance of the arc voltage waveforms for the arcs under the two types of magnetic fields. Finite element simulations and short-circuit evaluations have shown that the axial magnetic field contact system with 90 deg coil orientations yield a more uniform distribution of the flux density and hence lower erosion of the contacts. These results show a clear dependence of the arc voltage on the various above mentioned parameters. Thus the arc voltage could be utilised as a diagnostic parameter during the evaluation of the vacuum interrupter. In the present scenario, significant research is being done to increase the breaking capacity of the interrupters. This calls for optimization of design of the existing contacts and the design of novel contact geometries. The arc voltage would be used as an important diagnostic tool in this process. Also, the utilization of vacuum interrupter in high voltage and extra high voltage circuits is being explored. This application requires increase in the contact gap or series connection of gaps. The arc behaviour in longer gaps and gaps connected in series would be an important research area. Again the arc voltage could be used to study the arc evolution in these specialised conditions. The experiments in this research work have been performed on commercial vacuum interrupters. For a dedicated research on vacuum <b>arcs</b> and vacuum <b>interrupter</b> contacts, development of a vacuum arc research facility has also been attempted as a part of this research work...|$|R
