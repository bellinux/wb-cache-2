40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} of the gravitational and inertial forces which act during aircraft flight upon the vestibular systems of the aircraft occupants reveals that {{in the absence of}} a visual horizon, certain illusory sensations are predictable for various acceleration environments. Horizontal forward applied acceleration results in a climbing (backward tilting) sensation; conversely, horizontal rearward applied acceleration results in a diving (forward tilting) sensation. During any attempt to achieve weightless-ness in aircraft parabolic flight, special care has to be taken to avoid unintended longitudinal (x-axis) accelerations. Recent flight tests established that the 'rotation sensation ' (Dzendolet, 1971; Gerathe-wohl, 1956) during entry into parabolic flight can be attributed tothe existence ofunintended longitu-dinal accelerations. However, the 'inversion illusion ' (Graybiel and Kellogg, 1966) felt by some human subjects at 0 g seems to be different from the rotation sensation and could be caused by the diminished pressure forces of the otoliths on the maculae. The 'inversion illusion ' of man correlates well with the blind fish diving behavior observed uring aircraft parabolic flight (yon Baumgarten etal., 1969, 1972). It is suggested that the fish low g diving response and the human <b>inversion</b> <b>illusion</b> are due to the substitution of a predominately shearing force of low magnitude as a vestibular eference in place of a normal, predominately pressure force. This hypothesis indicates that vestibular senses alone cannot provide meaningful postural orientation tosimulated or actual gravity of a magnitude below that of Earth's gravity. 1...|$|E

40|$|Oman - The early mission {{operational}} {{problems caused}} by space motion sickness have been largely resolved in recent years. This has been achieved by appropriate timeline adjustments, voluntary head movement restriction, and judicious use of promethazine. Crew members now simply accept that some symptoms "come with the job," and usually last only a few days. But as more people have flown longer flights, we've seen cases of space sickness and <b>inversion</b> <b>illusion</b> that take several weeks to resolve. Visual reorientation illusions continue throughout long flights, and occasionally cause difficulties. EVA astronauts sometimes suddenly fear they will {{fall out of the}} payload bay or off of the RMS or Strella arms. Orientation and navigation in three dimensions in the MIR station reportedly does not come naturally, because modules have different visual verticals. It is clear that the neurovestibular problems of spaceflight have not disappeared. After return to Earth, many crew members are disoriented and ataxic in the first hour after return, and require assistance leaving the vehicle, Flight surgeons say that the longer the mission, the stronger the aftereffects, certain of which last for weeks. We do not yet know how to predict who will be afflicted. Looking ahead to 3 - 4 month long voyages to Mars, it seems obvious that if cruise is in O-G, the crew may encounter neurovestibular problems on arrival. Artificial G may be broadly effective as a countermeasure for many of the physiological changes of spaceflight, but from the neurovestibular perspective, it is a double-edged sword. We know that the Coriolis stimulus resulting from rotation is potentially disorienting and nauseogenic. But we don't yet know how much artificial G will be enough, nor how successfully people can adapt to a specific angular velocity and hypo G level. Development of countermeasures remains a big challenge for our neurovestibular community. Maintaining an interdisciplinary perspective is important. Three examples were presented at this meeting: 1) Transgenic animal experiments suggest that in addition to the light illumination cycle, vestibular inputs may also serve as an important input to the circadian system. 2) Radiation can cause important CNS effects in animals, including loss of spatial memory. 3) As described in our session, otolith inputs may contribute to cardiovascular regulation of orthostatic tolerance. Over the past three days, we've all enjoyed catching up with old friends, and making many new ones. On behalf of my colleagues, I want to thank Al Coats and the USRA DSLS staff for the great job they did in running this meeting. And keeping the emphasis on fun. And also my Co- Chair, Mal Cohen, who had more stamina than many of us, despite major surgery only three weeks ago. Mal and I have written a few lines describing each of the seventeen papers in our session, to give you a quick over-view, and as a guide to the full abstracts, We have grouped them under five themes: preflight and inflight countermeasurements, postlanding posture and locomotion deficits: assessment and prediction, adaptive processes, relationships among physical simuli, perceptions, and eye movements, vestibular contribution to human autonomic responses, and implications and recommendations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract All representationalists {{maintain}} {{that there is}} a necessary connection between an experience’s phenomenal character and intentional content; but there is a disagreement amongst representationalists regarding the nature of those inten-tional contents that are necessarily connected to phenomenal character. Russellian representationalists {{maintain that}} the relevant contents are composed of objects and/or properties, while Fregean representationalists maintain that the relevant contents are composed of modes of presentation of objects and properties. According to Fregean representationalists such as David Chalmers and Brad Thompson, the Fregean variety of the view is preferable to the Russellian variety because the former can accommodate purported counterexamples involving spec-trum <b>inversion</b> without <b>illusion</b> and colour constancy while the latter cannot. I maintain that colour constancy poses a special problem for the Fregean theory in that the features of the theory that enable it handle spectrum <b>inversion</b> without <b>illusion</b> cannot be extended to handle colour constancy. I consider the two most plausible proposals regarding how the Fregean view might be developed in order to handle colour constancy—one of which has recently been defended by Thompson (Australas J Philos 87 : 99 – 117, 2009) —and argue that neither is adequate. I con-clude that Fregean representationalism is no more able to accommodate colour constancy than is Russellian representationalism and, as such, ought to be rejected...|$|R

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and {{is not to be}} disseminated broadly. Schizophrenia patients are less susceptible to depth <b>inversion</b> <b>illusions</b> (DIIs) in which concave faces appear as convex, but what stimulus attributes generate this effect and how does it vary with clinical state? To address these issues, we had 30 schizophrenia patients and 25 well-matched healthy controls make convexity judgments on physically concave faces and scenes. Patients were selectively sampled from three levels of care to ensure symptom heterogeneity. Half of the concave objects were painted with realistic texture to enhance the convexity illusion; the remaining objects were painted uniform beige to reduce the illusion. Subjects viewed the objects with one eye while laterally moving in front of the stimulus (to see depth via motion parallax) or with two eyes while remaining motionless (to see depth stereoscopically). For each group, DIIs were stronger with texture than without, and weaker with stereoscopic information than without, indicating that patients responded normally to stimulus alterations. More importantly, patients experienced fewer illusions than controls irrespective of the face/scene category, texture, or viewing condition (parallax/stereo). Illusions became less frequent as patients experienced more positive symptoms and required mor...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{summarizes}} the spatial disorientation problems and navigation difficulties described by astronauts and cosmonauts, and relates them to research findings on orientation and navigation in humans and animals. Spacecraft crew are uniquely free to float in any relative orientation {{with respect to}} the cabin, and experience no vestibular and haptic cues that directly indicate the direction of “down”. They frequently traverse areas with inconsistently aligned visual vertical cues. As a result, most experience “Visual Reorientation Illusions” (VRIs) where the spacecraft floors, walls and ceiling surfaces exchange subjective identities. The illusion apparently results from a sudden reorientation of the observer’s allocentric reference frame. Normally this frame realigns to local interior surfaces, but in some cases it can jump to the Earth beyond, as with “Inversion Illusions” and EVA height vertigo. These perceptual illusions make it difficult for crew to maintain a veridical perception of orientation and place within the spacecraft, make them more reliant upon landmark and route strategies for 3 D navigation, and can trigger space motion sickness. This chapter distinguishes VRIs and <b>Inversion</b> <b>Illusions,</b> based on firsthand descriptions from Vostok, Apollo, Skylab, Mir, Shuttle and International Space Station crew. Theories on human “gravireceptor” and “idiotropic” biases, visual “frame” and “polarity” cues, top-down processing effects on object orientation perception, mental rotation and “direction vertigo” are discussed and related to animal experiments on limbic head direction and place cell responses. It is argued that the exchange in perceived surface identity characteristic of human VRIs is caused by a reorientation of the unseen allocentric navigation plane used by CNS mechanisms coding place and direction, as evidenced in the animal models. Human VRI susceptibility continues even on long flights, perhaps because our orientation and navigation mechanisms evolved to principally support 2 D navigation.

40|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} on vision to remain {{spatially}} oriented. Although gravitational down cues are missing, most astronauts maintain a subjective vertical -a subjective sense of which way is up. This is evidenced by anecdotal reports of crewmembers feeling upside down (<b>inversion</b> <b>illusions)</b> or feeling that a floor has become a ceiling and vice versa (visual reorientation illusions).

None of the crew's subjective vertical indications became more independent of environmental cues in weightlessness. Three who were either strongly dependent on or independent of stationary visual cues in preflight tests remained so inflight. One other became more visually dependent inflight, but recovered postflight. Susceptibility to illusions of circular self-motion increased in flight. The time to the onset of linear self-motion illusions decreased and the illusion magnitude significantly increased for most subjects while free floating in weightlessness. These decreased toward one-G levels when the subject 'stood up' in weightlessness by wearing constant force springs. For several subjects, changing the relative direction of the subjective vertical in weightlessness-either by body rotation or by simply cognitively initiating a visual reorientation-altered the illusion of convexity produced when viewing a flat, shaded disc. It changed at least one person's ability to recognize previously presented two-dimensional shapes. Overall, results show that most astronauts become more dependent on dynamic visual motion cues and some become responsive to stationary orientation cues. The direction of the subjective vertical is labile in the absence of gravity. This can interfere with the ability to properly interpret shading, or to recognize complex objects in different orientations...|$|R

40|$|There is {{something}} {{it is like}} to see a bright red cardinal, to touch a stucco wall, or to hear an ambulance pass by. Each of these experiences has a distinctive phenomenal character. But in virtue of what {{it is like to}} have a particular experience [...] in virtue of the experience's phenomenal character [...] the world is presented to the subject as being a certain way. The dissertation is concerned with the nature of this "phenomenal content". In Chapter One I argue that there is such a thing as phenomenal content, understood as intentional content that supervenes necessarily on phenomenal character. The rest of the dissertation is concerned with the nature of this phenomenal content, and in particular the phenomenal content of visual experiences. In Chapter Two I present and critique the dominant view about phenomenal color content, what I call "standard Russellianism". According to standard Russellianism, the content of color experience consists solely in the representation of specific mind-independent physical color properties. I present an argument against such views based on the possibility of spectrum <b>inversion</b> without <b>illusion.</b> Further, I argue that such views fail to properly accommodate the phenomenon of color constancy. In Chapter Three, I address a different form of Russellian theory of phenomenal content advocated by Sydney Shoemaker. I present my own positive view of phenomenal color content in Chapter Four. There I argue that color content is a kind of Fregean content, involving modes of presentation of colors. In particular, I argue that phenomenal color content involves indexical, response-dependent, and holistic modes of presentation. Finally, in Chapter Five I turn to the spatial aspects of visual experience. I argue against Russellianism for spatial phenomenal content, based on the consideration of a kind of spatial Twin Earth thought experiment. In its place, I argue that spatial phenomenal content is also a kind of Fregean content...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Binocular depth <b>inversion</b> {{represents}} an <b>illusion</b> of visual perception, serving to invert {{the perception of}} implausible hollow objects, e. g. a hollow face into a normal face. Such inversion occurs frequently, especially when objects with {{a higher degree of}} familiarity (e. g. photographs of faces) are displayed. Cognitive factors are assumed to override the binocular disparity cues of stereopsis. The hypothesis was tested that during mild and moderate alcohol withdrawal, and severe and mild alcohol intoxication, the central nervous system is unable to correct implausible perceptual hypotheses. Measurements of binocular depth inversion in perception of three-dimensional objects were performed in 10 patients with severe alcohol intoxication, in 10 subjects with mild alcohol intoxication, in nine patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal treated with carbamazepine, in 10 patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal without any pharmacological treatment, in 11 patients with mild alcohol withdrawal and in 10 healthy volunteers. The binocular depth inversion scores were highly elevated in the severely intoxicated patients group and in the group with moderate withdrawal symptoms without carbamazepine treatment, in comparison to the healthy volunteers. The data demonstrate a strong impairment of binocular depth inversion in moderate alcohol withdrawal and during severe alcohol intoxication. This supports the view that these states may be accompanied by a disorganization of the interaction between sensory input and top-down component. The effects of carbamazepine are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} experiment {{represents a}} merger and scientific extension of two investigations also in {{development for the}} 1998 Neurolab space shuttle mission. On earth, gravity provides a reference that influences how we recognize objects in our field of view, perceive their shape, orientation, and our expectations of how they behave when thrown or dropped. The orientation of familiar visual objects and surfaces in turn influence our own perceived orientation. Gravity also helps {{the central nervous system}} align the various frames of reference used in movement control. All these processes are fundamentally altered in weightlessness, as evidenced by the visual reorientation, <b>inversion,</b> and proprioceptive <b>illusions</b> frequently reported in-orbit by astronauts, and also by the surprisingly long lasting aftereffects seen, particularly after prolonged space flight. This experiment utilizes the Human Research Facility Computer Workstation and virtual environment generation accessories originally developed for the Neurolab as a tool to study these processes during and after long duration (1 - 3 month) orbital flight. Restrained and free-floating subjects wear a wide field of view, color stereo head mounted display, and view controlled visual scenes in five different test paradigms which assess: 1) the influence of scene symmetry, rotation, haptic cues, and expected orientation on self tilt (Virtual Tilting Room Test), 2) the onset of x-axis illusory linear self-motion without haptic cues (Linear Vection Test) 3) the effect o...|$|R
50|$|The {{apparent}} aim of Baroque sculptors such as Bernini was {{to achieve}} the possibility for marble to appear as both solid and translucent, and to imply a plasticity and weightlessness that is radically at odds with its material quality. Michelangelo too, was masterful at creating the impression of flesh from marble, as seen in his David. However Chromy references this tradition with an <b>inversion</b> of the <b>illusion</b> of stone as flesh. First of all there is no positive analogue {{of the human body}} with which we can engage in the view of soft tissue, which almost always demands at least partial nudity. Instead the work is dominated by the folds of cloth and the absent volume of a body, which implies weight — so much weight in fact that we can call this a building (or an architectural sculpture) even a 'chapel', and as such it perhaps has more in common with the use of marble in architecture than in sculpture.In contrast to Rachel Whiteread's procedure of making positive volumes out of negative space, Chromy constructs a negative space out of a solid volume: the human body. The marble therefore becomes a material of strength, a structural material, rather than one that engages in the illusion of weightlessness — in this way it is a different approach to Chromy's works in bronze which, like the sculptures of Ancient Greece, appear to defy gravitational forces by capturing the dynamism of the human body, many of which {{can be seen in the}} National Archaeological Museum of Athens, which contains the richest collection of artifacts from Greek antiquity worldwide.|$|R
