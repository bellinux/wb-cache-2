40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>distribution</b> of luminous <b>satellite</b> galaxies {{with respect to}} the symmetry axes of isolated host galaxies in a Lambda-CDM universe. The selection of hosts and satellites is based upon three somewhat different algorithms, all of which yield nearly identical results. In projection on the sky, the satellites are located preferentially close to the major axes of the host halos resulting in a substantially flattened <b>distribution</b> of <b>satellites.</b> The flatness of the <b>satellite</b> <b>distribution</b> compares remarkably well with the flatness of the dark mass associated with the host galaxies. The degree to which the satellites are distributed anisotropically {{with respect to the}} major axes of the projected host halos is, however, grossly in excess {{of the degree to which}} satellites in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are distributed anisotropically with respect to the major axes of the images of the host galaxies. This may be an indication that the mass and light of the SDSS hosts is not in perfect alignment on the sky. To investigate this we use a number of prescriptions in which the angular momentum vectors of the host galaxies are closely aligned with the principle axes of the surrounding dark mass, in order to assign position angles to images of the hosts. When the <b>distribution</b> of the <b>satellites</b> is then computed with respect to the major axes of the images of the hosts, the anisotropy in the <b>distribution</b> of <b>satellite</b> galaxies is reduced to a level that is comparable to the anisotropy shown by the SDSS satellites. Lastly, the anisotropy in the <b>distribution</b> of the <b>satellites</b> persists to projected radii r_p ∼ 500 kpc and likely reflects preferential mass accretion along filaments. [Abridged...|$|R

Because analog channels took up an entire transponder on the satellite, and each satellite had a fixed number of transponders, dishes were usually equipped with a modified polar mount and actuator to sweep the dish across the horizon to receive channels from multiple satellites. Switching between horizontal and vertical polarization was accomplished by a small electric servo motor that moved a probe inside the feedhorn throat at the command of the receiver (commonly called a [...] "polarotor" [...] setup). Higher-end receivers did this transparently, switching polarization and moving the dish automatically as the user changed channels.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} satellites {{of isolated}} galaxies in SDSS and examine their angular distribution. Using mock catalogues generated from cosmological N-body simulations, we {{demonstrate that the}} selection criteria used to select isolated galaxies and their satellites must be very strict in order to correctly identify systems in which the primary galaxy dominates its environment. The criteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly group members. We refine a set of selection criteria for which the group contamination {{is estimated to be}} less than 7 % and present a catalogue of the resulting sample. The angular <b>distribution</b> of <b>satellites</b> about their host is biased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for red disc galaxies, but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i. e. it is the colour of the host that determines the <b>distribution</b> of its <b>satellites</b> rather than its morphology. The similar anisotropy measured in this study as in studies that were dominated by groups implies that group-specific processes are not responsible for the angular <b>distribution.</b> <b>Satellites</b> that are most likely to have been recently accreted show a tendancy to lie along the same axis as the surrounding large scale structure.

Correlations between reflectance values and aircraft measurements illustrate the potential of estimating cloud droplet size distribution and marine atmospheric boundary layer aerosol composition and concentration through use of satellite data.

The satellites were identified using typical redshift space criteria and, hence, the sample includes both genuine satellites {{and a large number}} of interlopers. As expected from previous work, the 3 D locations of the satellites are well-fitted by a combination of a Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) density profile and a power law. At fixed stellar mass, the NFW scale parameter, r_s, for the <b>satellite</b> <b>distribution</b> of red hosts exceeds that for the <b>satellite</b> <b>distribution</b> of blue hosts. In both cases the dependence of r_s on host stellar mass is well-fitted by a power law. For the satellites of red hosts, r_s^red∝ (M_∗ / M_sun) ^ 0. 71 ± 0. 05 while for the satellites of blue hosts, r_s^blue∝ (M_∗ / M_sun) ^ 0. 48 ± 0. 07. For hosts with stellar masses greater than 4. 0 E+ 10 M_sun, the <b>satellite</b> <b>distribution</b> around blue hosts is much more concentrated than it is around red hosts with the same stellar mass. We perform model fits to the projected (2 D) locations of the satellites and find that, {{with the exception of the}} satellites of the most massive red hosts, the 2 D analysis accurately recovers the values of r_s obtained from the 3 D analysis. Therefore, even in the limit of a large number of interlopers, the 3 D distribution can be recovered using 2 D information alone. The spatial <b>distribution</b> of the <b>satellites</b> of red hosts traces that of the hosts' halos; however, the spatial <b>distribution</b> of the <b>satellites</b> of blue hosts is more concentrated that of the hosts' halos by a factor of 2.

Dedicated links to White Sands and other facilities would enable direct access to space payloads and sensor data. Intersatellite links to a second generation ATDRS, called Advanced Space Data Acquisition and Communications System (ASDACS), would eliminate one satellite hop and enhance controllability of experimental payloads by reducing path delay.
