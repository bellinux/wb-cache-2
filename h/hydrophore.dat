5000|$|For this reason, the UK {{domestic}} water system has traditionally (prior to 1989) employed a [...] "cistern feed" [...] system, where the incoming supply {{is connected to}} the kitchen sink and also a header/storage tank in the attic. Water can dribble into this tank through a 12 mm pipe, plus ball valve, and then supply the house on 22 or 28 mm pipes. Gravity water has a small pressure (say ¼ bar in the bathroom) so needs wide pipes allow higher flows. This is fine for baths and toilets but is frequently inadequate for showers. A booster pump or a <b>hydrophore</b> is installed to increase and maintain pressure. For this reason urban houses are increasingly using mains pressure boilers (combies) which {{take a long time to}} fill a bath but suit the high back pressure of a shower.|$|E
50|$|The current {{appearance}} of the principal palace {{dates back to the}} 17th and 18th centuries. By the end of the 16th century, the garden was enriched with many fountains fed by a gigantic wheel <b>hydrophore,</b> to ensure proper irrigation. In 1704, four gates and gateways were built with huge embellished acroterions (ornaments) in red stone, decorated with plants made of wrought iron. During {{the first half of the}} 18th century, the wall was refined along the external perimeter by a balustrade made of Istria Stone on which vases and half-length portraits of important persons were placed. A statue of Theophrastus was built beside the south door, as well as a statue of Solomon, (signed by Antonio Bonazza), local point for the east door and the four seasons fountain, which was enriched with 18th-century portraits made of Carrara marble. In the first half of the 19th century, greenhouses and a botanic theatre were built and half-length portraits of eminent botanists such as Carl Linnaeus were placed on the cornice. One of the greenhouses still maintains these historic arches and small cast-iron columns.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} optimal {{management}} {{of a water}} distribution system includes {{the determination of the}} operation regime for each <b>hydrophore</b> station. The optimal operation of a water distribution system means a maximum attention to assess the demands of the water, with minimum electrical energy consumption. The analysis of load profiles corresponding to a water distribution system can be the first step that water companies must make to assess the electrical energy consumption. This paper presents a new method to assess the electrical load in water distribution systems, taking into account the time-dependent evolution of loads from the <b>hydrophore</b> stations. The proposed method is tested on a real urban water distribution system, showing its effectiveness in obtaining the electrical energy consumption with a relatively low computational burden...|$|E

30|$|In addition, the {{hydrophobic}} interactions {{also played}} an important role in docking result. The good illustration was the difference in one methyl group at carbon number 6 of rhamnoside ring (IUPAC name) of quercitrin compared to quercetin- 3 -galactoside structure [Fig.  4 (2, 3)]. This conduct to 9.3  kcal/mol binding affinity of quercitrin compared to 8.8  kcal/mol of quercetin- 3 -galactoside.
