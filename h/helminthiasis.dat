25|$|Chronic <b>helminthiasis</b> {{may cause}} severe morbidity. <b>Helminthiasis</b> {{has been found}} to result in poor birth outcome, poor {{cognitive}} development, poor school and work performance, decreased productivity, poor socioeconomic development, and poverty.|$|E
25|$|Soil-transmitted <b>{{helminth}}iasis</b> (STH) {{is a type}} of helminth infection (<b>helminthiasis)</b> {{caused by}} different species of roundworms. It is caused specifically by those worms which are transmitted through soil contaminated with faecal matter and are therefore called soil-transmitted helminths. Three types of soil-transmitted <b>helminthiasis</b> can be distinguished: ascariasis, hookworm infection and whipworm infection. These three types of infection are therefore caused by the large roundworm A. lumbricoides; the hookworms Necator americanusor Ancyclostoma duodenale; and by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura respectively.|$|E
25|$|As many as 135,000 die {{annually}} from soil transmitted <b>helminthiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Areas {{with the}} highest {{prevalence}} of <b>helminthiasis</b> are tropical and subtropical areas including sub-Saharan Africa, central and east Asia, and the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} high {{mobility}} and lower standards of hygiene, school-age children are particularly vulnerable to <b>helminthiasis.</b> Most children from developing nations will {{have at least one}} infestation. Multi-species infections are very common.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helminthiasis</b> {{has been}} found to result in poor birth outcome, poor {{cognitive}} development, poor school and work performance, poor socioeconomic development, and poverty. Chronic illness, malnutrition, and anemia are further examples of secondary effects.|$|E
25|$|If {{complications}} of <b>helminthiasis,</b> such as intestinal obstruction occur, emergency surgery may be required. Patients who require non-emergency surgery, for instance for removal of worms from the biliary tree, can be pre-treated with the anthelmintic drug albendazole.|$|E
25|$|Hookworm {{infected}} about 428 {{million in}} 2015. Heavy infections {{can occur in}} both children and adults but are less common in adults. It is rarely fatal. Hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted <b>helminthiasis</b> and classified as a neglected tropical disease.|$|E
25|$|Chronic immune {{responses}} to <b>helminthiasis</b> {{may lead to}} increased susceptibility to other infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria. There is conflicting information about whether deworming reduces HIV progression and viral load and increases CD4 counts in antiretroviral naive and experienced individuals.|$|E
25|$|About 0.8 to 1.2 {{billion people}} {{globally}} have ascariasis, {{with the most}} heavily affected populations being in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia. This makes ascariasis {{the most common form}} of soil-transmitted <b>helminthiasis.</b> As of 2010 it caused about 2,700 deaths a year, down from 3,400 in 1990. Another type of Ascaris infects pigs. Ascariasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of <b>helminthiasis</b> depend on a number of factors including: the site of the infestation within the body; the type of worm involved; the number of worms and their volume; the type of damage the infesting worms cause; and, the immunological response of the body. Where the burden of parasites in the body is light, there may be no symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Soil-transmitted <b>helminthiasis</b> and {{schistosomiasis}} are {{the most}} important helminthiases, and are among the neglected tropical diseases. This group of helmianthiases have been targeted under the joint action of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies and non-governmental organizations through a project launched in 2012 called the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, which aims to control or eradicate certain neglected tropical diseases by 2020.|$|E
25|$|Helminth eggs {{contained}} in wastewater, sewage sludge or human excreta {{are not always}} infectious, i.e. able to cause the disease <b>helminthiasis.</b> Fertilized eggs and unfertilized eggs can exist side by side. Unfertilized eggs are identifiable under the microscope by their elongated shape. No larvae can hatch from these kinds of eggs. Therefore, unfertilized eggs do not pose a danger to human health.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{and control}} {{measures}} to prevent soil-transmitted <b>helminthiasis</b> are the following: availability {{of clean water}} for personal and domestic uses, improved access to sanitation which includes the use of properly functioning and clean toilets by all community members, education on personal hygiene such as hand washing and hygienic and safe food preparation; eliminating the use of untreated human faeces as fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helminthiasis</b> (plural helminthiases), {{also known}} as worm infection, is any macroparasitic disease of humans and other animals in which {{a part of the}} body is {{infected}} with parasitic worms, known as helminths. There are numerous species of these parasites, which are broadly classified into tapeworms, flukes, and roundworms. They often live in the gastrointestinal tract of their hosts, but they may also burrow into other organs, where they induce physiological damage.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{can be a}} {{consequence}} of health issues such as gastroenteritis or chronic illness, especially the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Diarrhea and other infections can cause malnutrition through decreased nutrient absorption, decreased intake of food, increased metabolic requirements, and direct nutrient loss. Parasite infections, in particular intestinal worm infections (<b>helminthiasis),</b> {{can also lead to}} malnutrition. A leading cause of diarrhea and intestinal worm infections in children in developing countries is lack of sanitation and hygiene.|$|E
25|$|In {{regions where}} <b>helminthiasis</b> is common, mass {{deworming}} treatments may be performed, particularly among school-age children, {{who are a}} high-risk group. Most of these initiatives are undertaken by the World Health Organization (WHO) with positive outcomes in many regions. Deworming programs can improve school attendance by 25 percent. Although deworming improves the health of an individual, outcomes from mass deworming campaigns, such as reduced deaths or increases in cognitive ability, nutritional benefits, physical growth, and performance, are uncertain or not apparent.|$|E
25|$|Infection occurs {{by eating}} food or drink {{contaminated}} with Ascaris eggs from feces. The eggs hatch in the intestines, burrow through the gut wall, and {{migrate to the}} lungs via the blood. There they break into the alveoli and pass up the trachea, where they are coughed up and swallowed. The larvae then pass through the stomach {{for a second time}} into the intestine, where they become adult worms. It is a type of soil-transmitted <b>helminthiasis</b> and {{part of a group of}} diseases called helminthiases.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{can reach}} the soil when {{polluted}} wastewater, sewage sludge or human excreta are used as fertilizer. Such soil is often characterized by moist and warm conditions. Therefore, the risk of using contaminated wastewater and sludge in agricultural fields is a real problem, especially in poor countries, where this practice is prevalent. Helminth eggs are regarded as the main biological health risk when applying sewage sludge, fecal sludge or fecal matter on agricultural soils. The eggs are the infective stage of the helminths’ life cycle for causing the disease <b>helminthiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even {{in areas}} of high prevalence, the {{frequency}} and severity of infection is not uniform within communities or families. A small proportion of community members harbour the majority of worms, and this depends on age. The maximum worm burden is at {{five to ten years}} of age, declining rapidly thereafter. Individual predisposition to <b>helminthiasis</b> for people with the same sanitation infrastructure and hygiene behavior is thought to result from differing immunocompetence, nutritional status, and genetic factors. Because individuals are predisposed to a high or a low worm burden, the burden reacquired after successful treatment is proportional to that before treatment.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of setting {{treatment}} standards and reuse legislation, {{it is important to}} be able to determine the amount of helminth eggs in an environmental sample with some accuracy. The detection of viable helminth eggs in samples of wastewater, sludge or fresh feces (as a diagnostic tool for the infection <b>helminthiasis)</b> is not straight forward. In fact, many laboratories in developing countries lack the right equipment or skilled staff required to do so. An important step in the analytical methods is usually the concentration of the eggs in the sample, especially in the case of wastewater samples. A concentration step may not be required in samples of dried feces, e.g. samples collected from urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helminthiasis</b> {{may cause}} chronic illness through {{malnutrition}} including vitamin deficiencies, stunted growth, anemia, and protein-energy malnutrition. Worms compete directly with their hosts for nutrients, but {{the magnitude of}} this effect is likely minimal as the nutritional requirements of worms is relatively small. In pigs and humans, Ascaris has been linked to lactose intolerance and vitamin A, amino acid, and fat malabsorption. Impaired nutrient uptake may result from direct damage to the intestinal mucosal wall or from more subtle changes such as chemical imbalances and changes in gut flora. Alternatively, the worms’ release of protease inhibitors to defend against the body’s digestive processes may impair the breakdown of other nutrients. In addition, worm induced diarrhoea may shorten gut transit time, thus reducing absorption of nutrients.|$|E
