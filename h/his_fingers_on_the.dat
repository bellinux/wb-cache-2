5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E
500|$|In 1921, the Commodores hired Wallace Wade as an {{assistant}} and posted an undefeated, 7–0–1 record. [...] "The Texas game, sparked by McGugin's unforgettable oratory, was the big one." [...] "Instead of hammering detailed strategy into them," [...] coach Dan McGugin had taken his team to the nearby grave of former Vanderbilt quarterback Curry in Marlin, Texas. In a noted speech just before the teams took to the field, referring to this grave, McGugin tapped <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor and began: Vanderbilt went on to upset the Longhorns 20–0. Later the same season, Vanderbilt faced Georgia in a contest for the Southern crown, tying the game late on an onside-kick-from-scrimmage 7–7.|$|E
2500|$|... "As soon as I {{touched upon}} the {{question}} of Jews and Judaism, the serenity of the meeting ended at once. Hitler turned his back to me, {{went to the window}} and started drumming <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pane [...] Still, I went on, voicing our complaints. Hitler suddenly turned around, went to a small table from which he took a water glass and furiously smashed it on the floor. In the face of such diplomatic behavior, I had to consider my mission terminated".|$|E

2500|$|Mesmer treated {{patients}} both {{individually and}} in groups. With individuals {{he would sit}} in front of his patient with his knees touching the patient's knees, pressing the patient's thumbs in his hands, looking fixedly into the patient's eyes. Mesmer made [...] "passes", moving his hands from patients' shoulders [...] down along their arms. He then pressed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> patient's [...] hypochondrium region (the area below the diaphragm), sometimes holding his hands there for hours. Many patients felt peculiar sensations or had convulsions that were regarded as crises and supposed to bring about the cure. Mesmer would often conclude his treatments by playing some music on a glass armonica.|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E

60|$|He tapped with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, and Tuppence felt {{again the}} intense power that {{radiated}} from the man.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he drew a}} pistol from his pocket, and pointed it at her with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trigger.|$|R
60|$|The King, who {{was rather}} inattentively engaged in drawing the Provost's nose with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window-pane, heard {{the last two}} words.|$|R
60|$|Platt struck <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{table with}} a gesture of sudden, {{illuminating}} satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy nodded. McEachern drummed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, {{and gazed}} thoughtfully at him.|$|E
60|$|He paused, and thoughtfully drummed with <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{backs of}} the non-existent, {{unattainable}} books.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid that's true; I made it," [...] Ferguson admitted; but Kermode, laying <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rent wood, {{looked up}} at his companion.|$|R
60|$|But in {{his turn}} he opened Mr. Furlong's door {{and put down}} <b>the</b> paper, laying <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> column for a moment without a word.|$|R
60|$|A shot {{rang out}} in the evening air. Hyacinth stooped down from his perch and put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bolt. The sow pressed furiously against the door.|$|R
60|$|Appleby {{stiffened}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rifle at his hip, {{and stared}} at the last figure with growing astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{said nothing}} for a moment, {{drumming}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> writing table. At last he heaved something of a sigh.|$|E
60|$|The {{policeman}} was plainly not unmoved {{by these}} arguments. He drummed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, and stared thoughtfully at Jimmy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has {{my father}} a hundred wives!" [...] {{interrupted}} <b>the</b> savage, laying <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{shoulder of the}} trapper, {{with a look of}} curious interest in the reply.|$|R
60|$|The Yankee smiled, put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of <b>his</b> nose, and, wishing them {{success in}} {{whatever}} line of life {{they chose to}} undertake, went on with his work.|$|R
6000|$|... "No use, young fellah," [...] said Lord John, with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chart. [...] "Seventeen {{from the}} right and second from the left. This is the cave sure enough." ...|$|R
60|$|Damer set his lips, and drummed with <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. Then he made {{a little}} deprecatory gesture, and glanced at Hallam.|$|E
60|$|After Orcutt {{departed}} he sat {{for awhile}} whistling a tune, from a popular musical play, keeping time by drumming with <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> desk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Montmorency, {{spreading}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flat counter. [...] "It's all ready, sir. I've {{attended to}} all your suggestions er--about the br--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{constant}} oppression, Aung Zaw {{has kept}} <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{political and social}} pulse of Myanmar. He was labeled an [...] "Enemy of The State" [...] by former military regimes.|$|R
60|$|He laid <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sick man's pulse. But the doctor's {{step and}} voice stopped him. Then the nurse came in, {{following}} Vimpany. She was an elderly, quiet-looking French woman.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned the}} berserk round, {{took off the}} gold ring which he had placed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day of the fight and put the silver one in its place.|$|R
60|$|Here the Baronet paused. He seemed lost in thought, and sat looking {{upon the}} floor and {{drumming}} with <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arm of his chair.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Pym {{rose and}} planted {{the points of}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, as {{he did when he}} was {{specially}} confident of the clearness of his reply.|$|E
6000|$|Mendham had <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door-handle. [...] "I {{have seen}} quite enough," [...] he said. [...] "It may be {{this is simply}} a foolish attempt at a hoax, Hilyer." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Trotwood,' said Mr. Dick, laying <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of <b>his</b> nose, {{after he}} had shaken hands with me. 'Before I sit down, I wish to make an observation. You know your aunt?' ...|$|R
60|$|Horace spoke, laying <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telegram. <b>His</b> {{voice had}} {{changed with the}} change in his face. The tone was low and trembling: {{no one would have}} {{recognized}} it as the tone of Horace's voice.|$|R
