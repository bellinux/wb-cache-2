25|$|There was {{criticism}} in the Indian media that the commission did not examine all <b>facts</b> <b>available</b> to it. Specific areas {{of concern for the}} media was the method of recording evidence, lack of initiative to dig into the disconnect in facts of the Aamir Sohail – Mohammad Azharuddin toss, lack of questioning and evidences against people involved in betting and match-fixing, not considering the tapes of interview by Outlook with Rashead Latif (where he named five Indian cricketers involved in match fixing and which he subsequently backed out).|$|E
500|$|When police {{conduct a}} search, the {{amendment}} {{requires that the}} warrant establish probable cause {{to believe that the}} search will uncover criminal activity or contraband. They must have legally sufficient reasons to believe a search is necessary. In Carroll v. United States (1925), the Supreme Court stated that probable cause to search is a flexible, common-sense standard. To that end, the Court ruled in Dumbra v. United States (1925) that the term probable cause means [...] "less than evidence that would justify condemnation", reiterating Carrolls assertion that it merely requires that the <b>facts</b> <b>available</b> to the officer would [...] "warrant a man of reasonable caution" [...] in the belief that specific items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime. It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false. A [...] "practical, non-technical" [...] probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required. In Illinois v. Gates (1983), the Court ruled that the reliability of an informant is to be determined based on the [...] "totality of the circumstances." ...|$|E

Processing and composition of services may really benefit from all such heterogeneous information.|$|R

50|$|His mother, Margaret, {{began an}} {{unsuccessful}} {{action in the}} courts for custody of John Graham, away from the care of George Buchanan. The case was continued on two accounts in 1578, and was never brought to trial, or the records regarding the custody action have been destroyed or are otherwise unavailable. George Buchanan soon died, and young earl John Graham was sent to live with John Graham of Fintry, {{in the northern part}} of Menteith. The <b>facts</b> <b>available</b> from the case of Margaret tend to point to a birthdate of 1571 for John Graham, while the <b>facts</b> <b>available</b> in most other sources point to an approximate birthdate of 1574.|$|E

5000|$|The Court in Terry v.

5000|$|In {{reaching}} its decision, the Court noted that [...] "reasonableness", not consent, is the touchstone of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence; the Constitution only prohibits [...] "unreasonable" [...] searches and seizures. Therefore, the constitutional validity {{of a police}} determination of consent to enter is not judged by whether the police were correct in their assessment, but by whether, based on the <b>facts</b> <b>available</b> at the moment, it was reasonable {{to conclude that the}} consenting party had authority over the premises.|$|E

30|$|Processes {{of patient}} care have become {{increasingly}} complex and interdisciplinary. This may be especially attributed to advances in technology—including diagnosis as well as treatment—but also because of advances in regulation and continuous diversification of medical specialties. However, while healthcare itself has advanced in technology and understanding of disease, its business and management models have hardly changed since the 1950 s [1]. This is surprising since both innovative and well-established economic tools are widely applied in other industries and in <b>fact</b> <b>available</b> to be applied in the healthcare sector with moderate effort as well.|$|R
30|$|Warschauer and Ames (2010) are {{academics}} in {{the education}} field; but their paper gives surprisingly good attention {{to the issue of}} how frequently devices got out of service, what service was required to re-commission them, and what service was in <b>fact</b> <b>available.</b> Champions of proposed devices sometimes forget the life-cycle cost of an electronic device in a student’s hands. It is not the purchase price alone that matters, but the total life-cycle cost. Apart from cost is the sense of loss, sense of guilt and disappointment that a student experiences when a device is broken, lost or damaged.|$|R
50|$|Immigration {{decisions}} may be appealed {{by either}} {{side with the}} Board of Immigration Appeals. However, the BIA does not generally accept new evidence regarding the original case, but instead, simply aims {{to determine whether the}} previous court made an incorrect judgment based on the law or the <b>facts</b> <b>available</b> to it at that time. It is therefore critical that all the arguments and facts be presented in the original removal proceeding. BIA appeals are generally handled through paper, with physical hearings very rare.|$|E

5000|$|Keppel {{initiated}} the famous study {{of race relations}} in the United States by the Swedish social economist Gunnar Myrdal, deliberately appointing, during 1937, an [...] "outsider" [...] and a non-American to manage the study {{on the theory that}} the task should be performed by someone unencumbered by traditional attitudes or earlier conclusions. Widely heralded, Myrdal's book American Dilemma (1944) had no immediate public policy effect, although it was later much cited in legal challenges to segregation. Keppel believed foundations should make the <b>facts</b> <b>available</b> to the public and let them speak for themselves. His cogent writings about philanthropy left a lasting impression on the foundation field and influenced the organization and leadership of many new foundations.|$|E
50|$|Other more advance models {{include those}} based on Bayesian networks, which are causal {{probabilistic}} models commonly used for risk analysis and decision support. Based {{on this kind}} of mathematical modelling, Constantinou et al., have developed models for predicting the outcome of association football matches. What makes these models interesting is that, apart from taking into consideration relevant historical data, they also incorporate all these vague subjective factors, like availability of key players, team fatigue, team motivation and so on. They provide the user with the ability to include their best guesses about things that there are no hard <b>facts</b> <b>available.</b> This additional information is then combined with historical facts to provide a revised prediction for future match outcomes. The initial results based on these modelling practices are encouraging since they have demonstrated consistent profitability against published market odds.|$|E
50|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Isaiah {{appears in the}} Life of Theodosius of Kiev (Житие Феодосия Печерского). According to the biographer of Theodosius, in 1062 prince Iziaslav I of Kiev selected Isaiah, a monk of Pechersk Lavra, to the newly instituted Demetrios Monastery, and in 1077 secured appointment of Isaiah as the Bishop of Rostov. Isaiah is mentioned in the Primary Chronicle twice: in 1088 Isaiah has consecrated St. Michael's church in Vydubitsy; in 1089 Isaiah and metropolitan John jointly consecrated the Church of Theotokos in Pechersk Lavra. Both these facts are reproduced in the Life of Isaiah of Rostov; these were actually all the <b>facts</b> <b>available</b> to the medieval biographer. He converted a routine mention of Isaiah' presence in Kiev in 1089 into a tale of magical instant flight from Rostov to Kiev and back. However, the year and circumstances of Isaiah' death remain unknown.|$|E

30|$|In practice, LCAs may be {{organized}} for any lawful purpose, {{whether or not}} for profit (Dean and Geu 2008; Geu and Dean 2009 a). Similar to its predecessors in Wyoming and Minnesota, the earliest draft of the ULCAA targeted the formation and development of value-added ventures in the agricultural sector. In 2005, however, the Uniform Law Commission removed agriculture as the explicit beneficiary of the act by not providing a specific definition to avoid confusion and uncertainty. Instead, the ULCAA places emphasis on rural development, where rural is not synonymous with agricultural. Although the ULCAA provides many examples with farmer cooperatives as the primary subject, the LCA structure is in <b>fact</b> <b>available</b> to various collectives of producers and investors.|$|R
