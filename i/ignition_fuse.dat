50|$|A typical cherry bomb {{contains}} {{a core of}} explosive composition (e.g., flash powder or, less commonly, black powder) which is generally encapsulated inside a paper cup, which is in turn most commonly surrounded by a layer (approx. one-quarter inch thick) of sawdust infused with a mild adhesive (usually sodium silicate). An <b>ignition</b> <b>fuse</b> is inserted into a hole drilled into the hardened sawdust sphere, {{all the way down}} to reach the explosive composition. The fuse extends outside the sphere approximately one to one and a half inches. Once the fuse is ignited, it takes about three to four and a half seconds to reach the explosive composition and initiate explosion of the firework.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} the large ones were not particularly more useful than a cannon firing canister shot or grapeshot. Since {{they were still}} mounted on a carriage, they could be as hard to aim and move around as a cannon, and the many barrels took as long or longer to reload. They also tended to be relatively expensive since they were more complex than a cannon, due to all the barrels and <b>ignition</b> <b>fuses,</b> and each barrel had to be individually maintained and cleaned.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{exploding}} wire {{phenomenon is}} well researched {{due to its}} vast and practical applications which include, {{but are not limited}} to, shock wave generation, pulsed power, Z pinch physics, plasma <b>ignition,</b> <b>fuses,</b> and fusing applications. However, the focus of this research is on a surrogate for exploding wires. In this research, metallized capacitor grade– polypropylene film was used as an alternative for the traditional wire of a uniform diameter. The films that were studied have a broad variety of thicknesses ranging from 7 micron to 5 mil, lengths ranging from 5. 08 cm to 19. 05 cm, and sheet resistances of 1 ohm/square and 7 ohms/square. These films were used to study the effect of film properties on the transient plasma generation mechanism when exposed to a rapid high voltage discharge. The effect of these properties {{can be seen in the}} current waveform, similar to that of a uniform diameter exploding wire. By precisely understanding how the film properties affect the transient plasma formation, one can fine tune these variables to control the resulting characteristic pulse wave shape to fit a desired application...|$|R
50|$|A {{suitcase}} bomb {{was discovered in}} the station by an explosive-detection dog on 6 June 2003. After the evacuation of the entire building, the police destroyed the {{suitcase bomb}}. The bomb consisted of a standard wheeled suitcase which contained an alarm clock, a pressure cooker, explosives and stones {{as well as an}} <b>ignition</b> device with <b>fuse.</b> According to experts, this bomb was capable of exploding.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of oxyliquits is that, once mixed, they {{are sensitive to}} sparks, shock, and heat, in addition to reported cases of spontaneous ignition. The power relative to weight is high, but the density is low, so the brisance is low as well. <b>Ignition</b> by a <b>fuse</b> alone is sometimes unreliable. The charge should be detonated within 5 minutes of soaking, but even after 15 minutes it may be capable of exploding, even though weaker and with production of carbon dioxide.|$|R
50|$|Visco is a 2-3-mm-diameter cord with a {{black powder}} core. There are three {{external}} layers to visco fuse. First, a layer of string is wound around the core, then a second, less tight, layer of string is wound {{in the opposite direction}} to prevent unraveling. The last layer is a low-nitrate nitrocellulose lacquer that keeps the fuse from falling apart. The last layer helps to make the visco fuse water resistant and to prevent moisture from degrading the black powder core. Unlike dynamite safety fuse, visco fuse burns with a visible external flame. After <b>ignition,</b> most visco <b>fuses</b> can burn underwater.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other major}} problem {{concerned}} the intentional ignition of the gunpowder charges. To provide some {{protection from the}} blast and the fumes, a nominated miner ignited {{the far end of}} the fuse which was intended to burn at a known rate. The miners, therefore, knowing the length of the fuse, could estimate the delay between <b>ignition</b> of the <b>fuse</b> and the <b>ignition</b> of the main charges. However, early fuses, known as filled [...] "quills", had a tendency to either burn irregularly, [...] "flash off", or break—either by separation or by [...] "pinching" [...] in the shot hole due to the tamping process. They could also be damaged allowing moisture in, which could cause them to smoulder instead of burn and introduce a long delay. If the main charge failed to ignite, this was known as a misfire or [...] "hang fire", and the miners would need to wait before returning to the work face to set new fuses. Increasingly, miners in Cornwall in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were becoming badly injured as a result of suspecting that there had been a misfire and returning to the work face just as a smouldering damp quill ignited the gunpowder charges.|$|R
