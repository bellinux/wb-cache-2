With its great advantages of geometrical and material flexibility and its ability of cutting hard-to-machine materials, the technology is spreading more and more among industry. Thorough understanding of the relevant processes is essential for achieving the demanded high quality output, especially in three-dimensional machining.

In contrast to testing methods, that can demonstrate the presence of faults in a system, formal methods can prove their absence. A department of the telecommunications company Ericsson AB in Gothenburg, Sweden, uses the UML-RT language to model software used in WCDMA radio base stations. These concurrent and reactive systems can be modeled in the Eclipse-based RSARTE environment. Previous work underlines a need of narrowing the gap between software development tools used in industry and formal verification tools. This thesis examines the feasibility of using model checking to verify properties of UMLRT capsules. We present a prototype tool for generating verification models in the Promela language for the model checker Spin. The tool is implemented as a model-to-text transformation using the <b>JET</b> <b>tool</b> and is integrated into RSARTE. The result of the work establishes that it, for a subset of constructs in UML-RT, is possible to automate generation of verification models {{that can be used}} to demonstrate properties of the original UML-RT capsules.

30|$|The rotary {{water jetting}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} techniques for horizontal well cleanup. The jet flow is used to remove plugging particles from sand control screens to recover their permeability. Currently, the operation optimization of this technique depends mainly on experience due to absence of applicable evaluation and design models for removing plugging materials. This paper presents an experimental setup to simulate the cleanup process of plugged screens by rotary water jetting on the surface and to evaluate the performance of a <b>jetting</b> <b>tool.</b> Using real plugged screens pulled from damaged wells, a series of tests were performed, and the qualitative relationships between the cleanup efficiency and various operational parameters, such as the type of fluids used, flow rate, mode of tool movement, etc., were obtained. The test results indicated that the cleanup performance was much better when the rotary <b>jetting</b> <b>tool</b> moved and stopped periodically for a certain time than that when it reciprocated at a constant speed. To be exact, it was desirable for the rotary <b>jetting</b> <b>tool</b> to move for 1.5 – 2 m and stop for 2 – 4 min, which was called the “move-stop-move” mode. Good cleanup performance could be obtained at high flow rates, and the flow rate was recommended to be no lower than 550 – 600 L/min. The test results also indicated that complex mud acid was better than clean water in terms of cleanup performance. Good cleanup efficiency and high screen permeability recovery could be achieved for severely plugged screens. Rotary jetting is preferred for the cleanup of horizontal wells with severely plugged screens, and the screen permeability recovery ratio may reach 20 % if optimized operation parameters were used.|$|R

The parallel guidance gearbox forms an end-member of the kinematic chain. The translation axis and the rotation axis essentially run parallel to one another.

The gearbox is arranged and designed so that it makes possible {{the guidance of the}} working axis of the end-effector from a position where the working axis lies on the line arising through extension of the rotation axis onto a position where the working axis lies at a distance from this line.

40|$|Cutting {{processes}} play a centrao role in food industry. Beyond {{the conventional}} processing with mechanic tools {{the use of}} high-pressure <b>jet</b> <b>tools</b> provides process-immanent advantages. Thus, with high-pressure jet the processing of foods {{can be carried out}} highly flexible. In many fields of the food industry compound materials with different properties must be cut (e. g. pizza-paste/filling, biscuit/chocolate, cheese/rind, etc.). The high-pressure <b>jet</b> offers a <b>tool</b> that can operate quite independently of the specific material characteristics. Because of the small mechanical loads of the substance during the cutting, it is possible to cut different materials simultaneously without deforming the substance, destroying the joint of splitting brittle materials. Moreover, the permanently renewing cutting medium avoids contamination by the cutting tool. By integrating an appropriate software support like CAD/CAM systems, different variants of the high-pressure jet can be realised without modify ing the tool. Through the high flexibility lf the jet, the cutting path can be fit to the current demanded geometry. Thus a minimisation of waste as well as an exact portioning by weight and form is possible. After a general introduction, this papaer describes the technique of high-pressure jet facilities and the using potentials of this technique, particularly in the food industry. Moreover, we formulate requirements for the process and compare it with conventional mechanical cutting processes...|$|R

40|$|In the Middle East, {{extended}} reach horizontal wells (on {{the order}} of 25, 000 feet of horizontal displacement) are commonly acid stimulated by jetting acid out of drill pipe. The acid is jetted onto {{the face of the}} openhole wellbore as the drill pipe is withdrawn from the well. The jetting action helps to remove the drilling fluid filter cake and promote the acid to penetrate into the formation and form wormholes to stimulate the well. However, with very long sections of wellbore open to flow, the acid placement and subsequent wormhole distribution and penetration depths are uncertain. This study has modeled the acid jetting process using a comprehensive model of acid placement and wormhole propagation in a horizontal well. It is presumed that the acid <b>jetting</b> <b>tool</b> removes the drilling mud filter cake, so that no filter cake exists between the end of the drill pipe and the toe of the well. Correspondingly, the model also assumes that there is an intact, low-permeability filter cake on the borehole wall between the end of the drill pipe and the heel of the well. The drill pipe is modeled as being withdrawn from the well during the acid jetting treatment, as is done in practice. The acidizing simulator predicts the distribution of acid and the depths of wormholes formed as functions of time and position during the acid jetting treatment. The model shows that the acid jetting process as typically applied in these wells preferentially stimulates the toe region of the horizontal well. Comparisons of the simulation predictions with published data for acid jetting treatments in such wells showed good general agreement. Based on the simulation study, this study presents recommendations for improved acid jetting treatment procedures to improve the distribution of acid injected into the formation...|$|R
