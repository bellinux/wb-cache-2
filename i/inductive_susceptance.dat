50|$|Note that (as shown above) {{the signs}} of reactances become {{reversed}} in the admittance domain; i.e. capacitive susceptance is positive and <b>inductive</b> <b>susceptance</b> is negative.|$|E
40|$|The alternating-current {{response}} of a quantum point contact (QPC) is numerically investigated using the nonequilibrium Green function method {{combined with an}} effective mass theory. We found that the susceptance of a QPC increases stepwise with increasing gate voltage, when {{the width of the}} quantization plateau in the gate voltage-conductance curve is narrower than the width of the region where the conductance changes gradually. We also show that the height of a susceptance step is proportional to the ac-bias frequency. These simulation results are in excellent qualitative agreement with recent experimental results. Moreover, we found that the transition from capacitive susceptance to <b>inductive</b> <b>susceptance</b> occurs with increasing gate voltage. The capacitive-inductive transition point is independent of the ac-bias frequency, but it does depend on the contact width...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of input}} admittance, over the {{frequency}} range 300 Mcs/s. to 900 Mcs/s., {{were made on}} four different types of triodes represented by the HY 75, 826, 388, 957. A coaxial resonant line {{was used as the}} measuring device. It was found that the cold tube input admittance increases rapidly with increasing frequency over the normally used range, passing through alternant poles and zeros. This indicates that another usefull range of tube operation may be obtained at frequencies higher than the first series resonant frequency. Also the <b>inductive</b> input <b>susceptance</b> observed in that range may be found usefull. An indication of transit time effects was also obtained though it would appear that in most high frequency triodes the top frequency limit is mainly determined by the cold tube circuit effects...|$|R
