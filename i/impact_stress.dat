500|$|The {{function}} of pachycephalosaur domes has been debated, and Stegoceras {{has been used}} as a model for experimentation in various studies. The dome has mainly been interpreted as a weapon used in intra-specific combat, a sexual display structure, or a means for species recognition. The hypothesis that the domed skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs were used for butting heads was first suggested by American palaeontologist Edwin Colbert in 1955. In 1970 and 1971, Galton elaborated on this idea, and argued that if the dome was simply ornamental, it would have been less dense, and that the structure was ideal for resisting force. Galton suggested that when Stegoceras held its skull vertically, perpendicular to the neck, force would be transmitted from the skull, with little chance of it being dislocated, and the dome could therefore be used as a battering-ram. He believed it was unlikely to have been used mainly as defence against predators, because the dome itself lacked spikes, and those of the parietosquamosal shelf were in an [...] "ineffective" [...] position, but found it compatible with intra-specific competition. Galton imagined the domes were bashed together, while the vertebral column was held in a horizontal position. This could either be done while facing each other while dealing blows, or while charging each other with lowered heads (analogous to modern sheep and goats). He also noted that the rigidity of the back would have been useful when using the head for this purpose. In 1978, Sues agreed with Galton that the anatomy of pachycephalosaurs was consistent with transmitting dome-to-dome <b>impact</b> <b>stress,</b> based on tests with plexi-glass models. The impact would be absorbed through the neck and body, and neck ligaments and muscles would prevent injuries by glancing blows (as in modern bighorn sheep). Sues also suggested that the animals could have butted each other's flanks.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess whether}} the {{transient}} <b>stresses</b> of foot <b>impact</b> {{with the ground}} {{are similar to those}} found during midstance loading and if the location of high stress correlate with the sites most commonly associated with mechanically induced osteoarthritis (OA). We compared <b>impact</b> <b>stresses</b> in subchondral bone between two subject-specific, three-dimensional, finite-element models of the equine metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint-one with advanced OA and one healthy, and with similar published data on the stresses that occur at midstance. Two right MCP joints (third metacarpal and proximal phalanx) were scanned using micro-computed tomography (μCT). Images were segmented, and meshed using modified 10 -node quadratic tetrahedral elements. Bone material properties were assigned based on the bone density. An impact velocity of 3. 55 m/s was applied to each model and contact pressures and stress distribution were calculated for each. In a separate iteration, the third metacarpal was loaded statically. A sampling grid of 160 equidistant points was superimposed over selected slices, and average peak stresses were calculated for 6 anatomical regions. Within-region maximal peak and average von Mises stresses were compared between healthy and OA bones in both midstance and impact loading. Average <b>impact</b> <b>stresses</b> across all regions, in both locations (palmar and dorsal) were greater in the OA model. Highest <b>impact</b> <b>stresses</b> were located in the dorsal medial condyle in the healthy (12. 8 MPa) and OA (14. 1 MPa) models, and were lowest in the palmar medial and lateral parasagittal grooves in the healthy (5. 94 MPa) and OA (7. 07 MPa) models. The healthy static model had higher peak (up to 49. 7 % greater) and average (up to 38. 6 % greater) stresses in both locations and across all regions compared to the OA static model. Under simulated footfall a trot, loading on the dorsal aspect of the third metacarpal at <b>impact</b> created <b>stresses</b> similar to those found during midstance. The high accelerations that occur under impact loading are likely responsible for creating the high stresses, as opposed to midstance loading where the high stresses are the result of high mass loading. Although the stress magnitudes were found to be similar among the two loading conditions, the location of the high stress loading occurred in sites that are not typically associated with osteoarthritic changes...|$|R
40|$|A {{photoelastic}} {{stress analysis}} technique {{has been used}} to determine the contact stresses in an automotive chain drive tensioner. The tensioner in normal operation is subject to high magnitude, short duration <b>impact</b> <b>stresses.</b> These stresses are known to cause surface damage, wear, and surface pitting. In order to adequately design the drive system layout, a means for stress quantification is needed. A replica tensioner was made from epoxy resin and tested in a variety of configurations. A simple model has been created to relate the chain link load to the resulting tensioner sub-surface stress field. This model {{has been used to}} correlate the observed and predicted location of isochromatic fringes, and hence to evaluate the chain link load from the photoelastic fringe pattern. A series of static load tests were performed to calibrate the apparatus. The tensioner specimen was then assembled in a chain drive test facility. The apparatus was used to run a chain under realistic engine loading conditions. A high-speed digital camera was used to capture sequences of photoelastic images, which were then used to find the impact loading caused by individual links in the chain. Once the load was determined the contact model was used to determine the magnitude and location of the resultant peak <b>stresses.</b> Measured <b>impact</b> <b>stresses</b> were found to be several times higher than those which would have been calculated from a static analysis.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the spiral tooth over the straight tooth is that they engage more gradually. The contact between the teeth starts {{at one end of}} the gear and then spreads across the whole tooth. This results in a less abrupt transfer of force when a new pair of teeth come into play. With straight bevel gears, the abrupt tooth engagement causes noise, especially at high speeds, and <b>impact</b> <b>stress</b> on the teeth which makes them unable to take heavy loads at high speeds without breaking.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{actions of}} snow {{avalanches}} on slightly inclined protection structures like snow sheds are a complex dynamic phenomenon. The <b>impact</b> <b>stresses</b> (normal and tangential) evolve {{not only in}} time but also in space. To better understand these actions {{so as to be}} able to design such structures, several studies have been conducted. Experimental measurements have been performed on a full-scale avalanche test site at Col du Lautaret (French Alps) where an instrumented plate with force sensors has been set up in an avalanche path. At each artificial release of an avalanche, the <b>impact</b> <b>stresses</b> and their temporal variations were measured. This real-scale approach is completed by a laboratory-scale experimental approach using granular flows in an inclined channel where normal and tangential forces on a basal plate are measured. The experimental results show that the impact effect is very important, particularly at the location of the rupture of slope formed by the shed. However, the stresses decrease rapidly when the distance to the rupture of slope increases. Finally, to assess the dynamic effect of the avalanche loading on the structure, dynamic simulations with a simplified multi-fiber model have been conducted. The results show that the dynamic effect is not negligible but is not critical for the structure...|$|R

50|$|Vocal fold nodules {{are thought}} {{to be the result of}} vocal fold tissue trauma caused by {{excessive}} mechanical stress. During phonation, the vocal folds undergo many forms of mechanical stress. One example of such stress is the <b>impact</b> <b>stress</b> caused by the collision between the left and right vocal fold surfaces during vibration. This stress is thought to reach its maximum in the mid-membranous region of the vocal folds, at the junction of the anterior 1/3rd and posterior 2/3rd, the most common site of nodule formation. Vocal overuse (speaking for long periods), abuse (yelling), or misuse (hyperfunction) may produce excessive amounts of mechanical stress by increasing the rate and/or force with which the vocal folds collide. This may lead to trauma that is focalized to the mid-membranous vocal fold and subsequent wound formation. Repeated or chronic mechanical stress is thought to lead to the remodeling of the superficial layer of the lamina propria. It is this process of tissue remodeling that results in the formation of benign lesions of the vocal folds such as nodules.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2014, {{researchers}} {{began studying}} and testing graphene as a material {{for use in}} body armor. Graphene is manufactured from carbon and is the thinnest, strongest, and most conductive material on the planet. Taking the form of hexagonally arranged atoms, its tensile strength {{is known to be}} 200 times greater than steel, but studies from Rice University have revealed it is also 10 times better than steel at dissipating energy, an ability that had previously not been thoroughly explored. To test its properties, the University of Massachusetts stacked together graphene sheets only a single carbon atom thick, creating layers ranging in thickness from 10 nanometers to 100 nanometers from 300 layers. Microscopic spherical silica [...] "bullets" [...] were fired at the sheets at speeds of up to 3 km (1.9 mi) per second, almost nine times the speed of sound. Upon impact, the projectiles deformed into a cone shape around the graphene before ultimately breaking through. In the three nanoseconds it held together however, the transferred energy traveled through the material at a speed of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) per second, faster than any other known material. If the <b>impact</b> <b>stress</b> can be spread out over a large enough area that the cone moves out at an appreciable velocity compared with the velocity of the projectile, stress will not be localized under where it hit. Although a wide impact hole opened up, a composite mixture of graphene and other materials could be made to create a new, revolutionary armor solution.|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} {{recognition}} {{and long term}} memories, corticosterone has variable effects. Studies show that the modification of certain chemical and brain processes that affect corticosterone levels can also <b>impact</b> <b>stress</b> effects on memory. In studies on rats, the fluctuations of corticosterone concentration are shown to prevent stress’ impairment of recognition memory in lower amounts. These lower levels seem {{to be linked to}} the rescue of stress-induced attenuation of CA1 long-term potentiation. When researchers looked at stress effects on LTM, they found many outcomes. In multiple studies, the formation of LTM (tested 24 h later) was found to be enhanced by corticosterone in some studies, while the persistence of LTM (tested at least 1 wk later) was only assisted by corticosterone in the late phase of memory consolidation and reconsolidation. Stress facilitates the consolidation but disrupts the reconsolidation of emotional memory. As mentioned previously, the persistence of LTM is selectively enhanced when stress and corticosterone are administered during the late phase after acquisition, but it is disrupted when stress and corticosterone are administered during the late phase after retrieval of memory. With regards to the persistence of LTM, there is a restricted time window between acquisition or retrieval where persistence is affected. These studies found that while persistence of LTM is selectively affected based on stage of memory, the formation of LTM is left intact after a certain length of time. Up to this point, studies have not agreed {{as to whether or not}} these processes are dependent on corticosterone or what even happens based on corticosterone in these processes and how memory is ultimately affected.|$|E

50|$|Assuming {{the proper}} EN {{formulation}} is selected {{to deliver the}} desired stress level, a reduction in compressive stress or even a shift to tensile is possible under certain conditions and must be avoided. Operating an EN bath outside of its recommend guidelines will <b>impact</b> <b>stress.</b> As a plater desires to push a process to plate faster, raising the pH is often the first button to push. When the pH is increased the deposit phosphorus drops, compressive stress is reduced and {{this can lead to}} negative results. Platers are commonly surprised to find a process that was plating with no stress cracks or adhesion failure the day before is now producing failures. A simple view of the record books or quick analysis reveals the culprit. An even more common contributor to an increase in an EN deposits tensile nature is bath age. It has been well documented that an EN process designed to produce a compressive deposit will stop doing so after a certain bath age (roughly 5 metal turnovers). It is at this point where the presence of reaction by products, sodium orthophosphate, begins to contribute to tensile stress. One can continue to plate in this bath but must be fully aware that stress will increase and could lead to adhesion and/or cracking failures. This is most evident, again, with thicker films. Figure 13 represents this phenomenon. There are certain additives that, when used carefully, can reduce the tensile stress even as the EN bath ages.The photos in figure 14 are of two identical parts, each plated in the same bath but at different bath ages. The part on the right was plated in a relatively new bath whereas {{the one on the left}} was plated in a bath nearly 10 metal turnovers old. You’ll note the clear evidence of flaking and separation due to the high tensile stress.|$|E
