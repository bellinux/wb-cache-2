5|$|The extreme {{steepness}} {{and depth}} of the Black Canyon formed {{as the result of}} several <b>geologic</b> processes acting together.

5|$|The <b>geologic</b> map of Georgia (a state {{within the}} United States) is a {{special-purpose}} map made to show geological features. Rock units or <b>geologic</b> strata are shown by colors or symbols to indicate {{where they are}} exposed at the surface. Structural features such as faults and shear zones are also shown. Since the first national geological map, in 1809, {{there have been numerous}} maps which included the geology of Georgia. The first Georgia specific <b>geologic</b> map was created in 1825. The most recent state-produced <b>geologic</b> map of Georgia, by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is 1:500,000 scale, and was created in 1976 by the department's Georgia Geological Survey. It was generated from a base map produced by the United States Geological Survey. The state geologist and Director of the Geological Survey of Georgia was Sam M. Pickering, Jr. Since 1976, several geological maps of Georgia, featuring the state's five distinct <b>geologic</b> regions, have been produced by the federal government.|$|E

5|$|The Chronister dig site {{is located}} atop the Ripley Formation. The land around the Chronister home and dig site sits atop {{sandstone}} from the Lower Ordovician Period or Canadian Epoch. It {{is located in}} a section of the Ozarks affected by erosion and filled with chert and sandstone debris. In addition, the region has been impacted by frequent faulting, leading to the combination of rocks from different <b>geologic</b> periods. As a result, it is difficult to create an accurate <b>geologic</b> map of the area.|$|E
5|$|The current <b>geologic</b> map of Georgia was {{produced}} in 1976. It was put together mainly in two parts from two teams representing {{the northern and southern}} portion of the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{next two}} periods of <b>geologic</b> history, the Ordovician and the Silurian, are {{missing from the}} Grand Canyon sequence. Geologists {{do not know if}} sediments were {{deposited}} in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if they were never deposited in the first place. Either way, this break in the <b>geologic</b> history of the area spans about 65million years. A type of unconformity called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.|$|E

5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular <b>geologic</b> formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular <b>geologic</b> formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable <b>geologic</b> features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to <b>geologic</b> scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the <b>geologic</b> features of the Earth are better explained {{as the result of}} the same gradual <b>geologic</b> forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the consensus that the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth was shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas. As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam {{and water to}} the surface through the geyser's internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three <b>geologic</b> conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain.|$|E
5|$|I-68 crosses into Washington County at Sideling Hill Creek and ascends Sideling Hill. The {{road cut}} {{that was built}} into Sideling Hill for I-68 can be seen for several miles in each direction, {{and has become a}} tourist {{attraction}} {{as a result of the}} <b>geologic</b> structure exposed by the road cut.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, Georges Cuvier {{published}} his {{findings on the}} differences between living elephants and {{those found in the}} fossil record. His analysis identified mammoths and mastodons as distinct species, different from any living animal, and effectively ended a long-running debate over whether a species could become extinct. In 1788, James Hutton described gradual geological processes operating continuously over deep time. In the 1790s, William Smith began the process of ordering rock strata by examining fossils in the layers while he worked on his <b>geologic</b> map of England. Independently, in 1811, Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart published an influential study of the <b>geologic</b> history of the region around Paris, based on the stratigraphic succession of rock layers. These works helped establish the antiquity of the Earth. Cuvier advocated catastrophism to explain the patterns of extinction and faunal succession revealed by the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a {{study of}} how the orbits of Saturn's moons should have changed due to tidal effects {{suggested}} that all of Saturn's satellites inward of Titan, including Enceladus (whose <b>geologic</b> activity was used to derive the strength of tidal effects on Saturn's satellites), may have formed as little as 100 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>geologic</b> record, the K–Pg {{event is}} marked by a thin layer of {{sediment}} called the K–Pg boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks. The boundary clay shows high levels of the metal iridium, which is rare in the Earth's crust, but abundant in asteroids.|$|E

5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} <b>geologic</b> record, a major unconformity, affected the region. Geologists {{do not know what}} happened to the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they do know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally below the surface of a shallow sea.|$|E
5|$|No record {{exists for}} the next 1.2billion years of Jerome's <b>geologic</b> history. Evidence from the Grand Canyon, further north in Arizona, {{suggests}} that thick layers of sediment may have been laid down atop the ore bodies and later eroded away. The gap in the rock record {{has been called the}} Great Unconformity.|$|E
5|$|Publication of the 1980 paper brought {{criticism}} from the <b>geologic</b> community, and an often acrimonious scientific debate ensued. Ten years later, and after Alvarez's death, evidence of a large impact crater called Chicxulub was found {{off the coast of}} Mexico, providing support for the theory. Other researchers later found that the end-Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs may have occurred rapidly in <b>geologic</b> terms, over thousands of years, rather than millions of years as had previously been supposed. Others continue to study alternative extinction causes such as increased volcanism, particularly the massive Deccan Traps eruptions that occurred around the same time, and climate change, checking against the fossil record. However, on March 4, 2010, a panel of 41 scientists agreed that the Chicxulub asteroid impact triggered the mass extinction.|$|E
5|$|Several {{million years}} after the {{formation}} of Mare Serenitatis, lavas began to upwell from the Moon's interior. As {{a result of these}} lavas, rock and soil samples from the area that were collected by Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt gave insight to the natural history and <b>geologic</b> timeline of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Smyth, Kemp, and Cushing's {{field work}} in the Adirondacks yielded {{detailed}} <b>geologic</b> maps of the challenging region. Smyth described the nature and origins of the area's rocks and mineral deposits. His conclusions were still largely accepted {{at the time of}} his death in 1937.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota <b>geologic</b> {{formations}} and deposits {{range in}} age from several billion to several thousand years, and the age of the rocks generally decreases as one moves from west to east across the state. The oldest <b>geologic</b> formations in the state were created over two billion years ago during the Precambrian, and consist of metamorphic and igneous rocks. These form the central core of the Black Hills, but they can also be found in two isolated locations in eastern South Dakota near Milbank and Sioux Falls. Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills; these were created between roughly 540 and 250 million years ago. This area features rocks such as limestone which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a <b>geologic</b> repository. The recommendation to use a <b>geologic</b> repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent erosion lasting 300million years {{stripped}} much of {{the exposed}} sediments and the mountains away. This reduced the very high mountains to small hills a few tens to hundreds of feet (tens of meters) high. Geologist John Wesley Powell called this major gap in the <b>geologic</b> record, which is also seen {{in other parts of}} the world, the Great Unconformity. Other sediments may have been added but, if they ever existed, were completely removed by erosion. Such gaps in the <b>geologic</b> record are called unconformities by geologists. The Great Unconformity is one of the best examples of an exposed nonconformity, which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above igneous or metamorphic rocks.|$|E
