25|$|The cult of {{the mother}} goddess is treated as an {{indication}} of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one, typically associated with Shaktism. The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess. In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai. Among the early Dravidians the practice of erecting memorial stones “Natukal or Hero Stone had appeared, and it continued <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> after the Sangam age, down to about 16th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 17th century the eastward {{movement}} of Russian people was slowed by the internal {{problems in the}} country during the Time of Troubles. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. While Cossacks came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russian people came by the Arctic Ocean. These were Pomors from the Russian North, who already had been making fur trade with Mangazeya {{in the north of}} the Western Siberia <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> In 1607 the settlement of Turukhansk was founded on the northern Yenisey River, near the mouth of the Lower Tunguska, and in 1619 Yeniseysky ostrog was founded on the mid-Yenisey {{at the mouth of the}} Upper Tunguska.|$|E
25|$|After {{the siege}} General Díaz was {{informed}} that Hungarian troops {{are present in the}} city. At the moment the Hungarian cavalry found shelter in the National Palace, when Díaz personally sent for Major Csizmadia and granted him a meeting. The two had known each other <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> as Csizmadia served as a prison lieutenant in Puebla when Díaz was held as captive there. On one occasion Díaz refused to be taken to the bathroom by a low-rank prison guard when Csizmadia offered to personally escort him there, which was an unusual courtesy. He even invited the General for a lunch at his house, who accepted it. The lieutenant dealt with his inmate amicably and they even attended a bullfight together. Díaz only refused a closer friendship to evolve because he feared to having been labeled pro-Imperialist, and that would have ruined his image. On 20 September 1865 he successfully escaped from the prison using a rope and a dagger with the acquiescence and consent of the Hungarian officer. He praised Csizmadia's generous and noble attitude towards him several times in his later memoirs. This was the reason he was looking for the captured Csizmadia after the siege and allowed him and his Hungarian regiment to move to Vera Cruz and to be taken home {{on the board of the}} Austrian ship SMS Novara along with the rest of the Austrian corps. Csizmadia also helped to negotiate the same terms of surrender for the Austrians as well.|$|E

500|$|On August 19, 2003, Twain's concert film Up! Live in Chicago premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{and drew}} in over 8.87 million viewers, {{therefore}} becoming the second-most-viewed concert film on television, behind Celine Dion's A New Day... Live in Las Vegas (2003). Following its success on television, NBC was interested again in collaborating with Twain {{for a second}} prime time special. Twain accepted the offer, but desired to deviate from high-elaboration, and perform a show much more stripped and intimate than the one filmed for Up! Live in Chicago or those included in her Up! Tour (2003–04). She explained, [...] "I {{wanted to go back}} to something stripped-down and rootsy. I've been doing big concerts <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and I love it, but I just want that contrast." [...] Ergo, she turned to singer and fiddler Alison Krauss, head of the bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station, whom she had collaborated with on numerous instances; Krauss and her band backed Twain in her performance of [...] "Forever and for Always" [...] at the 2003 CMT Music Awards, and recorded a duet with Twain for [...] Twain described her decision to be completely influenced by her desire to [...] "break the music down", and that Alison Krauss and Union Station were her only choice for the television special.|$|E

2500|$|The prehistoric {{period during}} which Lower Paleolithic {{settlements}} existed in the Tamil Nadu region has been estimated to span the period from about 5000 BCE until around 3000 BCE. [...] For most of the lower Paleolithic stage, humans lived close to river valleys with sparse forest cover or in grassland environments. The population density was very low and so far only two localities of this lower Palaeolithic culture {{have been found in}} south India. Archaeological research has uncovered evidence of fossil remains of animals and primitive stone implements around the northern Tamil Nadu that could be dated to belong to around 3,000,000 BCE. Humans in South India, belonging to the species of Homo erectus, lived in this primitive 'old stone age' (Palaeolithic) <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> using only crude implements such as hand axes and choppers and subsisting as hunter-gatherers.|$|E
2500|$|He {{played the}} piano <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> but then decided to quit and take up the guitar. He started to take an {{interest}} in the theatre and joined a local amateur company at the town's chitalishte – a common Bulgarian Art House, where a variety of different arts could be trained and practiced. Very soon it became like a home to him: rehearsing plays on the stage, studying the guitar in the basement, reading and writing poetry in the attic, writing music for his own lyrics. It was not long before he made his acting debut as the King in Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost. At the age of 18 he established himself as a songwriter, performing his first solo concert. Additionally he formed a rock band called [...] "Alleya Alya" [...] which made several studio recording sessions, all of them now missing.|$|E
2500|$|.....Then further west, The Tibetans {{encountered}} a distinctly foreign nation—Shangshung, with its capital at Khyunglung. Mt. Kailāśa (Tise) and Lake Manasarovar formed {{part of this}} country, whose language has come down to us through early documents. Though still unidentified, {{it seems to be}} Indo-European.... Geographically the country was certainly open to India, both through Nepal and by way of Kashmir and Ladakh. Kailāśa is a holy place for the Indians, who make pilgrimages to it. No one knows how long they have done so, but the cult may well go back to the times when Shangshung was still independent of Tibet. How far Zhangzhung stretched to the north, east and west is a mystery... We have already had an occasion to remark that Shangshung, embracing Kailāśa sacred Mount of the Hindus, may once have had a religion largely borrowed from Hinduism. The situation may even have lasted <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> In fact, about 950, the Hindu King of Kabul had a statue of Vişņu, of the Kashmiri type (with three heads), which he claimed had been given him by the king of the Bhota (Tibetans) who, in turn had obtained it from Kailāśa." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the team}} {{expanded}} to two cars for the 1986 season. In 1988 Minardi switched to Cosworth engines, and in 1989 it became top entrant for Pirelli's return to Formula One. The team was moderately {{successful in the}} midfield through the late 1980s and early 1990s, giving a succession of Italian drivers their first chance at the top level, including Alessandro Nannini, Pierluigi Martini and Gianni Morbidelli. Martini in particular was synonymous with Minardi, eventually having three spells with the team. He drove for them on their debut in 1985, scored their first point in the 1988 United States Grand Prix, although he had been running 5th <b>for</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> during the race until being passed by Tyrrell's Jonathan Palmer, took their only front-row start at 1990 USA Grand Prix (aided by special Pirelli tyres; several of their other drivers had surprise qualifying results that day), their only lap leading a race in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix, where he finished 4th, and scored their joint-best F1 result up to that point.
