5|$|The first condition, {{suggested}} by an influential paper written by Kenneth Rogoff & Carmen Reinhart has been disputed due to major calculation errors. In fact, the average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90% is not <b>dramatically</b> <b>different</b> from when debt/GDP ratios are lower.|$|E
5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in <b>dramatically</b> <b>different</b> tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E

5000|$|Petals can differ <b>dramatically</b> in <b>different</b> species. The {{number of}} petals in a flower may hold clues to a plant's classification. For example, flowers on eudicots (the {{largest group of}} dicots) most {{frequently}} have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals, {{although there are many}} exceptions to this rule.|$|R
5|$|Seabirds' life {{histories}} are <b>dramatically</b> <b>different</b> {{from those of}} land birds. In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for up to ten years), and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species will only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin's auklet), and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids), only one egg a year.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range is <b>dramatically</b> <b>different</b> {{in climate}} from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and {{features}} trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Halo: The Flood {{cracked the}} Publishers Weekly Top Ten Bestsellers List for Paperbacks, but {{critical}} reception {{to the novel}} was less positive than Eric Nylund's Fall of Reach or other Halo novels. The repetitive fight scenes and <b>dramatically</b> <b>different</b> characterization of the protagonist compared to Nylund's work were seen as major flaws, and Dietz's style of writing was alternatively praised and lambasted. The next Halo novel, , would serve {{to bridge the gap}} between Combat Evolved and its sequel, Halo 2.|$|E

A {{model of}} coevolutioinary genetic {{algorithms}} (COGA) con-sisting of two populations coevolving on two-bit landscapes is investiga-ted {{in terms of}} the effects of random partnering strategy, different po-pulation updating schemes, and changes in mutation rate and evolution rate.

High-OH sample exhibits better X-ray irradiation resistivity than low-and medium-OH samples. After irradiation, OH content of low-and medium-OH samples increases 37. 5 % and 11 %, respectively; in contrast, OH content of high-OH sample decreases <b>dramatically.</b> The <b>different</b> OH content changes among the samples are discussed regarding the proposed inter-conversion reactions involving Si-H and Si-OH during the irradiation...|$|R
5|$|Wine critics {{considered}} white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels {{have more}} fruit and less cloying sweetness. Nevertheless, {{the success of}} this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own {{at the end of the}} 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste <b>dramatically</b> <b>different,</b> both are made from the same (red) grapes, processed in a different way.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways <b>dramatically</b> <b>different</b> from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E
5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals {{could see that}} gays and lesbians were not <b>dramatically</b> <b>different</b> from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure {{that she would be}} fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.|$|E

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a particularly tractable model for investigating such global differences, since infections can be unambiguously identified. VZV is spread by aerosol to cause chickenpox, which, in temperate countries, is a relatively benign childhood infection; yet in tropical countries it tends to occur at later age, a trend associated with markedly increased severity including complications, hospitalization, and overall burden of care...|$|R

The morphology of SAF particles is characterized by scanning electron microscopy and magnetic properties by alternating gradient magnetometry. The attachment of silane molecules is verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and colloidal stability is studied using dynamic light scattering. These two silanes change the surface chemical properties of SAFNPs <b>dramatically</b> in <b>different</b> ways, which in turn affects the stability of these particles...|$|R

50|$|CAK varies <b>dramatically</b> in <b>different</b> species. In {{vertebrates}} and Drosophilia, CAK is a trimeric protein complex {{consisting of}} Cdk7 (a Cdk-related protein kinase), cyclinH, and Mat1. The Cdk7 subunit {{is responsible for}} Cdk activation while the Mat1 subunit is responsible for transcription. The CAK trimer can be phosphorylated on the activation segment of Cdk7 subunit. However, unlike other Cdks, this phosphorylation is might not be essential for CAK activity. In the presence of Mat1, activation of CAK does not require phosphorylation of the activation segment. However, {{in the absence of}} Mat1, phosphorylation of the activation segment is required for CAK activity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Russia's {{performance}} and China's performance under capitalism have differed <b>dramatically</b> because <b>different</b> arrangements governing {{the determination of}} prices and work practices evolved during the transition process. In Russia, the arrangement, which conferred monopoly rights to industry groups left over from socialism, prevented the adoption of better technology. In China, the arrangement that evolved contained no such monopoly elements. The key factor in determining which arrangement evolved was the strength of industry relative to the central government {{at the start of}} the transition.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the magnetization reversal process of the new artificial spin ice lattice at external magnetic field and different lattice parameters. The results demonstrate some interesting phenomena which are different from Kagome lattice. There are four typical sub-structures emerged in the vortex lattice, which are clockwise and counter-clockwise hexagons, and frustrated + 3 q and - 3 q vertices. The occurrence frequency of the four sub-structures change <b>dramatically</b> at <b>different</b> lattice parameter. The new lattice can be partially frustrated at different lattice parameter...|$|R

Much like their heat content, nutritional content can vary <b>dramatically</b> between <b>different</b> pepper types. In this study, a diverse set of chile pepper types were examined for nutrient content. Some pepper types were found to have high levels of vitamin A, vitamin C, or folate. Correlations between nutrient content, species, cultivation status, or geographic region were limited. Varietal selection or plant breeding offer tools to augment nutrient content in peppers. Integration of nutrient rich pepper types into diets that already include peppers could help combat nutrient deficiencies by providing a significant portion of recommended daily nutrients...|$|R

Direct simulation of diffusion faces {{the problem of}} absence of statistical stability as the diffusion times vary <b>dramatically</b> between <b>different</b> realisations and soil samples. We propose an approximation to the original leaching problem which is fast to simulate and is shown to give reliable approximation to the exit times in {{the whole range of}} parameter values including the problematic values that exhibit extreme behaviour. In addition, we have shown that a completely different type of pore structure, such as produced by tunnels through the soil, does not greatly affect diffusive properties when we are not close to the percolation threshold...|$|R
40|$|Various {{methods of}} searching for supersymmetric dark matter are {{sensitive}} to WIMPs with different properties. One consequence {{of this is that}} the phenomenology of dark matter detection can vary <b>dramatically</b> in <b>different</b> supersymmetric breaking scenarios. In this paper, we consider the sensitivities to supersymmetric dark matter of different detection methods and techniques {{in a wide variety of}} supersymmetric breaking scenarios. We discuss the ability of various astrophysical experiments, such as direct experiments, gamma-rays satellites, neutrino telescopes and positron and anti-proton cosmic ray experiments, to test various supersymmetry breaking scenarios. We also discuss what information can be revealed about supersymmetry breaking by combining results from complementary experiments. We place an emphasis on the differences between various experimental techniques. Comment: 43 pages, 17 figure...|$|R

40|$|Tasks {{partitioning}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging issues in large scale parallel simulations. The simulation performance may vary <b>dramatically</b> if <b>different</b> partition schemes are used. This paper presents a spatial partition method named fine-grained spatial partition for parallel simulation of large scale wildfire. The fine-grained spatial partition is inspired by the four color theorem. It divides a cell space into many smaller regions and allocates adjacent regions to different processing units. Because no adjacent regions are on the same processing units, a fire started in one region will quickly spreads out to adjacent regions and thus achieves a higher degree of parallelism regardless where the fire is started. Experiment results are collected and compared with that of a uniform spatial partition. 1...|$|R

Using recent theories of economic growth and new data sets (Larson and al., 1999) as a guide, this study finds some empirical regularities between agricultural labour productivity growth, investment and education, as also for environmental factors, for 44 countries during the period 1980 - 1993. We find strong evidence that where agricultural investment and educated people rates are higher, agricultural labour productivity grows faster. Secondly, geographical factors as well as freer trade influence growth. Finally, we find evidence of conditional convergence, which means that cross-country agricultural productivity does not converge to {{the same level of}} steady state but that productivity in each country converges to its own long-run equilibrium. growth, labour productivity, convergence, Labor and Human Capital, Productivity Analysis,...|$|R
