25|$|Depending on the {{temperature}} {{at which it}} is applied, asphalt is categorized as <b>hot</b> <b>mix,</b> warm mix, or cold mix. <b>Hot</b> <b>mix</b> asphalt is applied at temperatures over 300°F (150°C) with a free floating screed. Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of 200–250°F (95–120°C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> asphalt would cool {{too much on the}} long trip from the asphalt plant to the construction site.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem was}} caused by heavy rain over the weekend prior to the game, which made the dirt in the sliding pits and pitcher's mound so soft that the cutouts {{covering}} them in the football configuration became mushy and uneven. Even when new dirt was shoveled on top, it quickly became just as saturated as the old dirt. The problem was solved by using asphalt <b>hot</b> <b>mix,</b> which allowed for a solid, level playing surface, but required a jackhammer for removal whenever the stadium was converted from football back to baseball (between August and October of each year).|$|E
40|$|Fatigue life {{of asphalt}} <b>hot</b> <b>mixes</b> is given as a {{function}} of both stiffness and tensilestrains induced {{in the bottom of the}} wearing courses of flexible pavements. In conventional as-phalt <b>hot</b> <b>mixes</b> the increase of stiffness leads to a decrease of fatigue life. However, this work shows that there is an increase of both fatigue life and stiffness of asphalt rubber <b>hot</b> <b>mixes</b> in comparison with the asphalt <b>hot</b> <b>mixes</b> produced with straight binders. In this work laboratory tests were performed in asphalt <b>hot</b> <b>mixes</b> with dense and gap gradation produced with straight binder (AC 50 / 70) and asphalt rubber binder manufactured by the wet process.

25|$|The 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens {{was the most}} significant {{to occur in the}} contiguous 48 U.S. states in recorded history (VEI = 5, 0.3cumi, 1.2km3 of material erupted), exceeding the destructive power and volume of material released by the 1915 {{eruption of}} California's Lassen Peak. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the mountain that created a huge bulge and a fracture system on Mount St. Helens' north slope. An earthquake at 8:32am on May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten, gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure. The rock responded by exploding into a very <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> of pulverized lava and older rock that sped toward Spirit Lake so fast that it quickly passed the avalanching north face.|$|E
