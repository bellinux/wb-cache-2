5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential <b>details</b> <b>to</b> learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting {{in the use of}} genuine military equipment as models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over the <b>details</b> <b>to</b> be incorporated into designs. In contrast, the British interest in accurately depicting real weaponry from the war was far less common on German monuments, where usually stylised medieval weapons and armour were used.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{published}} in serial form {{during the winter}} of 1834/35, Le Père Goriot is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute <b>details</b> <b>to</b> create character and subtext.|$|E
5|$|The Coinage Act of 1864 {{passed into}} law on April 22 of that year. After {{entering}} circulation several months later, the bronze cent and two-cent piece circulated in trade without being hoarded.

These duties continued until 14 June 1944, when the entire squadron was relocated to Luganville Seaplane Base, Espiritu Santo. After the relocation, three aircraft were <b>detailed</b> <b>to</b> conduct antishipping patrols, and one aircraft for air-sea rescue.|$|R
5|$|A secret {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} M. W. Kellogg for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the Manhattan District contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate a full-scale production plant. Unusually, the contract did not require any guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because {{the scope of the}} project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed to defer any financial <b>details</b> <b>to</b> a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.|$|E
5|$|At Production I.G, Hiroyuki Kitakubo {{directed}} the animation scenes, wrote the screenplay {{and did the}} storyboards; Toshihiro Kawamoto was animation supervisor and a character designer. The scenes are noticeably different {{when compared to the}} film namesake directed by Mamoru Oshii, because the game is colored using a full digital technique. The scenes are a combination of cel animation and backgrounds that were rendered in three dimensions to ensure smooth transitions for the camera movement. Adobe Photoshop was used to add the finishing <b>details</b> <b>to</b> the scenes.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1962, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara visited South Vietnam and {{was taken}} on an {{inspection}} tour of the country, accompanied by Diệm and Thảo. Perhaps because Thảo divulged the tour <b>details</b> <b>to</b> Vietcong guerrillas, each of McNamara's stopovers was punctuated by bloody attacks on nearby ARVN installations. For example, when McNamara was in Bình Dương Province, five government soldiers were killed. As he flew from Đà Lạt north to Đà Nẵng near the Demilitarized Zone, he was greeted by a Vietcong bombing of a southbound troop train, which killed 27 and wounded 30 Civil Guard members.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} <b>details</b> <b>to</b> the character designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Nothing came of the proposal, which The Times of London {{called one}} of the most loathsome stories of the war. Historians believe that the SS, {{including}} its commander, Heinrich Himmler, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and perhaps even Adolf Hitler. Whatever its purpose, the proposal was thwarted by the British government. They arrested Brand in Aleppo (then under British control), where he had gone to propose Eichmann's offer to the Jewish Agency, {{and put an end to}} it by leaking <b>details</b> <b>to</b> the media.|$|E
5|$|Numerous easter {{eggs and}} secrets {{were added to}} the game to fuel the {{exploration}} efforts and wild speculation of many gamers. One of the most notable features is the pieces of cheese hidden on every level. These were deliberately placed by one of the game's artists as a graphical oddity for the player's confusion. The face of actor Robin Williams was used for Daniel Carrington, while the face of Shigeru Miyamoto along with faces of other Nintendo executives and game journalists can be seen on enemy guards and as selectable avatars in the multiplayer mode. The ranking system of the Combat Simulator awards a special username and password to skilled players. Rare had originally intended these <b>details</b> <b>to</b> allow access to password-protected parts of the official Perfect Dark website, but these sections were never implemented.|$|E

5|$|Remember Me {{features}} platforming, {{exploration and}} melee combat. The {{game is played}} as Nilin from a third-person view and introduces the mechanic of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying <b>details</b> <b>to</b> change the target's recollection of the outcome. Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained. On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles {{in the form of}} riddles she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story.|$|E
5|$|The China National Space Administration offers NASA the Taiyang Shen, a {{classified}} booster rocket that {{can carry a}} payload to Mars. Meanwhile, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a trajectory to divert Hermes back to Mars for a rescue {{more than two years}} earlier, using the Chinese booster to resupply Hermes for an additional eighteen months. Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the <b>details</b> <b>to</b> Hermes. The crew unanimously vote for the plan, and NASA — powerless to stop them — resupplies Hermes as it uses Earth's gravity to slingshot back to Mars.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the Bhikshuka Upanishad is unknown, as is its date of composition. It was {{probably}} composed in the late medieval to modern era, most likely in the 14th or 15th century. The text has ancient roots, as its contents are identical in key <b>details</b> <b>to</b> chapter 4 of the Ashrama Upanishad, which is dated to about the 3rd century CE. Both texts mention four types of mendicants with nearly identical life styles. The two texts have a few minor differences. The much older Ashrama Upanishad, for example, mentions that each type aspires to know their self (Atman) for liberation, while the Bhikshuka specifies that they seek this liberation through a yogic path.|$|E

5|$|Hirokazu Yashuhara of Sonic Team went to England and {{fine-tuned}} {{the game}} {{due to lack}} of time for communication. Technical and scheduling issues caused Sato to change the game design, leading to a dispute with producer Yuji Naka, and Sato removed his name from the credits. The game's final release would be first in North America on 18 November 1997, with releases in other regions occurring in late 1997 for the Sega Saturn, and into 1998 for the PC version. The PC versions allowed the user to alter graphics <b>details</b> <b>to</b> get the game to run optimally on different computers. Options include allowing to change between software rendering and 3D acceleration, or adjusting the game's draw distance, affecting how soon objects in the distance are visible. Like many other previous Sonic games during this time period, a largely unrelated Sonic R game was released as a Tiger Electronics LCD handheld game around the same time in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, Allied {{military}} representatives {{pushed to}} threaten the Ottoman government for the affair, while the French simultaneously explored the possibility of reaching a modus vivendi with Kemal. The Allied Supreme Council, {{which at the time}} was working out the <b>details</b> <b>to</b> a peace treaty that it would present to the Ottoman government, deliberated on how best to respond. Some of the delegates present, including Prime Minister David Lloyd-George, insisted that strong pressure should be brought to bear against the Ottoman government to prevent new atrocities, but the other diplomats were skeptical of the idea. The officials also agreed that the Ottoman government should dismiss Kemal from office, although they admitted that such a move was impractical, since the Ottoman government held no control over Kemal, who was leading a counter Turkish government in Anatolia. A decision was finally reached on 10 March. British, French and Italian leaders agreed to authorize the formal occupation of Constantinople, which was carried out by the forces under General George F. Milne's command on the morning of 16 March.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels do not provide enough <b>details</b> <b>to</b> satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E
