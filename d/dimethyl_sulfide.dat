40|$|Volatile and {{nonvolatile}} compounds, {{which could}} contribute to flavor, were analyzed in salmon. One hundred twenty-three volatile compounds were identified in the headspace of two different samples of cooked salmon, including lipid-derived volatiles, Maillard-derived volatiles, sulfur volatiles, Strecker aldehydes, nitrogen heterocyclic compounds, terpenes, and trimethylamine. Significant differences between samples were found for 104 of the volatiles. Although the levels of free cysteine and methionine were low in the salmon, sulfur volatiles were formed in the cooked fish, demonstrating that there were sufficient sulfur amino acids present for their formation. Notable differences in sulfur compounds between the samples suggested that small changes in sulfur amino acids could be responsible.

40|$|Abstract 15 Volatile {{organic sulfur}} {{compounds}} (VOSCs) are important sources of unpleasant odor 16 in wastewater systems. However, {{the study of}} VOSCs is usually hindered by their 17 complicated measurement method and highly reactive nature. In this work, a static 18 headspace method utilising gas chromatography (GC) with a sulfur 19 chemiluminescence detector (SCD) was developed to quantitatively analyze VOSCs 20 in wastewater matrices. The method has low detection limits and requires no pre- 21 concentration treatment. Three typical VOSCs, namely methanethiol (MT), <b>dimethyl</b> 22 <b>sulfide</b> (DMS) and <b>dimethyl</b> disulfide (DMDS), were chosen as examples for this 23 study. The calibration curves of all three compounds covering a wide range from 0. 5 24 ppb to 500 ppb showed good linearity (R 2 > 0. 999). The method detection limits (MDL) 25 were 0. 08, 0. 12 and 0. 21 ppb for MT, DMS and DMDS, respectively. The 26 reproducibility (relative standard deviation) was approximately 2 %. The recovery 27 ratio of MT, DMS and DMDS in spiked wastewater samples were 83 ± 4 %, 103 ± 4 % 28 2 and 102 ± 3 %, respectively. Sample preservation tests showed that VOSCs in 29 wastewater samples could be preserved in vials without headspace under acidified 30 conditions (pH ~ 1. 1) for at least 24 h without significant changes (< 1. 8 ppb).

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we report the {{oxidation}} of volatile organosulfur compounds (VOC) catalyzed by the enzyme chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago. VOC {{are regarded as}} atmospheric pollutants due to their unpleasant odor and low detection threshold.

Product analysis showed that sulfides were oxidized to their respective sulfoxides whereas thiols were oxidized to the corresponding disulfides. The identified products showed significantly lower vapor pressure than the parental compounds; thus, the products are not considered atmospheric pollutants.

The liquid phase, consisting of 15 % organic solvent and 85 % buffer, was contacted with the gaseous phase, consisting of a substrate-enriched air stream. Using dimethyl disulfide as model substrate, we found that only enzymatic oxidation occurred in this system; by controlling the enzyme and peroxide concentration, we found that the substrate is transferred to the aqueous phase where 1 mol of enzyme converted approximately 12, 400 mol of substrate, thus highlighting the potential of enzymatic treatment of malodorous gaseous streams...|$|R
25|$|The {{remaining}} trace (<1% volume) compounds give flatus its smell. Historically, compounds such as indole, skatole, ammonia {{and short}} chain fatty acids {{were thought to}} cause the smell of flatus.

It is known that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan, MM (also known as methanethiol, MT), <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) are present in flatus. The benzopyrrole volatiles indole and skatole have a mothball smell, and therefore probably do not contribute greatly to the characteristic smell of flatus.|$|E
25|$|Many oxidating agents {{can be used}} as {{alternatives}} to oxoammonium oxidants. Activated manganese dioxide, which is able to oxidize only allylic, benzylic, or other activated positions, is cheaper than TEMPO and operationally simple to use. Chromium-based reagents such as pyridinium chlorochromate {{can also be used to}} convert alcohols to carbonyl compounds; although the mechanism of chromium oxidations is well understood, the stoichiometric generation of chromium wastes is a disadvantage of this class of oxidants. Oxidations employing dimethyl sulfoxide, such as the Swern and Moffatt reactions, involve no heavy metals and oxidize a wide variety of substrates. However, the unpleasant odor generated during these reactions (<b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfide)</b> is often cited as a disadvantage. Oxoammonium oxidations are preferred to DMSO methods for reactions of diols and acetylenic alcohols. Dess-Martin periodinane is a highly selective, mild oxidant of alcohols, whose primary disadvantages are difficulties with preparation and safety.|$|E
500|$|Like other stinkhorn fungi, C.ruber bioaccumulates {{the element}} manganese. It has been {{postulated}} that this element {{plays a role}} in the enzymatic breakdown of the gleba with simultaneous formation of odorous compounds. Compounds like <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfide,</b> aldehydes, and amines—which contribute to the disagreeable odor of the gleba—are produced by the enzymatic decarboxylation of keto acids and amino acids, but the enzymes will only work in the presence of manganese. A chemical analysis of the elemental composition of the gelatinous outer layer, the embryonic receptacle and the gleba showed the gelatinous layer to be richest in potassium, calcium, manganese, and iron ions. Calcium ion stabilizes the polysaccharide gel, protecting the embryonic receptacle from drying out during the growth of the egg. Potassium is required for the gelatinous layer to retain its osmotic pressure and retain water; high concentrations of the element are needed to support the rapid growth of the receptacle. The high concentration of elements suggests that the gelatinous layer has a [...] "placenta-like" [...] function—serving as a reservoir from which the receptacle may draw upon as it rapidly expands.|$|E

In this study, we investigated how temperature regimes in the presence and absence of the sucking insect Myzus persicae affected volatile organic compound emissions in Arabidopsis over three time periods (0 - 24 h, 24 - 48 h, and 48 - 72 h). Headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to evaluate Arabidopsis volatile organic compounds. The results showed that under laboratory conditions, eight volatile classes [alcohols (mainly 2 -ethyl-hexan- 1 -ol), ketone (6 -methyl hept- 5 -en- 2 -one), esters (mainly (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate), aldehydes (mainly phenylacetaldehyde), isothiocyanates (mainly 4 -methylpentyl isothiocyanate), terpenes (mainly (E,E) -α-farnesene), nitrile (5 -(methylthio) pentanenitrile), and <b>sulfide</b> (<b>dimethyl</b> trisulfide) ] were observed on plants exposed to stress combinations, whereas emissions of six volatile classes were observed during temperature stress treatments alone (with the exception of nitriles and sulfides).

40|$|The cycling of the radiatively {{important}} gas carbonyl sulfide (OCS) was {{studied in}} surface {{waters of the}} Sargasso Sea. In August 1999, surface OCS concentrations averaged 8. 6 pmol L 21, showed minor diel variations, and varied little with depth. An OCS precursor, total dissolved organic sulfur (DOS), was lowest at the surface (40 nmol L 21) and increased with depth. The photoproduction rate of OCS from in situ incubations averaged 9. 6 pmol L 21 h 21, whereas dark production was 7. 0 pmol L 21 h 21. Apparent quantum yields were 1025 – 1027 from 313 – 436 nm and varied with the water depth irradiated. In March 2000, there were strong diel variations in surface OCS (highest in late afternoon; overall average, 16. 9 pmol L 21). Depth profiles in the afternoon showed surface water maxima and decreases with depth, whereas DOS had a surface maximum of 419 nmol L 21 and decreased with depth. Dark production was 4. 0 pmol L 21 h 21. Modeling of the diel cycle suggested a photoproduction rate of 16. 4 pmol L 21 h 21.

40|$|This thesis {{will explore}} the {{diagnostic}} and monitoring potential of exhaled breath for various infectious diseases. The specific infections studied include Borrelia hermsii, salmonella enterica, and two forms of endotoxin. Samples of breath were collected from mice both individually and in {{groups as well as}} from rats. The animals were awake and restrained in a breath sample tower for a majority of the studies. One study was also conducted using awake unrestrained rats in a glass bulb that was designed for breath sample collection by the Rowland Blake lab. In addition to the breath samples, feces samples were obtained from mice infected with salmonella enterica and incubated in bioreactors from which the headspace was collected for analysis. Samples were collected in evacuated stainless steel canisters. Blank samples were also collected to determine concentrations in the air used during sampling. All samples, excluding the feces samples, were analyzed for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide concentrations using gas chromatography. Several samples were also analyzed for various volatile organic compounds using the Rowland Blake non-methane hydrocarbon gas chromatography system. The results of the gas chromatography measurements were analyzed to determine if differences existed between infected and uninfected samples throughout each study. This was accomplished statistically, as well as visually using plots. 	The results of the Borrelia and endotoxin studies revealed {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of CO/CO 2 in the breath of the infected mice and rats, with a dose response being observed for the endotoxin study.

Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass on their tip which has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of carrion to attract flies and other insects.

An Austrian study demonstrated that blow-flies (species Calliphora vicina, Lucilia caesar, Lucilia ampullacea and Dryomyza anilis) also feed on the slime, and soon after leaving the fruit body, they deposit liquid feces that contain a dense suspension of spores. The study also showed that beetles (Oeceoptoma thoracica and Meligethes viridescens) are attracted to the fungus, but seem to have less of a role in spore dispersal as they tend to feed on the hyphal tissue of the fruiting body.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Chemical EngineeringJennifer L. AnthonyZeolites and zeolite-like {{materials}} have well-ordered structures and pores creating varying capacities for molecules based upon size, functional groups, polarity, and intermolecular forces making the materials useful for molecular sensing {{as well for}} molecules that are considered hazardous at very low concentrations with reproducible results because of these properties. This study will identify and characterize applications for zeolite and zeolite-like materials in gas and liquid phases based upon the dominating {{physical and chemical properties}} of the materials. The properties of interest include liquid phase ion exchange capacities, selectivities, gas/vapor phase adsorption capacity, and initial adsorption uptake rate. Zincosilicates have similar framework structures to aluminosilicate zeolites; however, they have distinct advantages over traditional zeolites. Zincosilicates typically have a higher ion density, lack “cages” in their structure which leads to all the cations being accessible for ion exchange, and have the ability to form three-membered rings which lead to large void spaces in their structure. These features lead to high capture capacities for divalent heavy metal mercury ions. In this work, the potential to use zincosilicates as ion exchangers such as VPI- 7, VPI- 9 and VPI- 10 is presented. Results have shown that zincosilicates have capture capacities greater than traditional zeolites, even greater than those that have been synthesized with functional groups intended to increase metal sorption capacities. The selectivity coefficients in a binary ion exchange system were successfully modeled using the Gibbs-Donnan selectivity model. The selectivities for the zincosilicates were Pb>Na>Hg>K>Ca. Zeolites are also able to adsorb chemical species and therefore can be used as the recognition element in sensing devices. The sorption capacity of 2 -chloroethyl ethyl <b>sulfide,</b> <b>dimethyl</b> methanephosphonate, ethanol, and n-butanethiol were examined with zeolites 13 X, 4 A, MCM- 41, VPI- 7, VPI- 9, and ZSM- 5.

Zeolite 13 X had the highest equilibrium and initial uptake rate for most compounds tested, whereas the low surface area zincosilicates, VPI- 7 and VPI- 9, had the lowest capacity. Based on these results, a piezoelectric device with an array of zeolites can be successfully employed as a sensor...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern with air and odor {{emissions}} from agricultural facilities. A supplementary research project was conducted to complement the U. S. National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The overall goal of the project was to establish odor and chemical emission factors for animal feeding operations. The study was conducted over a 17 -month period at two freestall dairies, one swine sow farm, and one swine finisher facility. Samples from a representative exhaust airstream at each barn were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags and analyzed by trained human panelists using dynamic triangular forced-choice olfactometry. Samples were simultaneously analyzed for 20 odorous compounds (acetic acid, propanoic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, guaiacol, phenol, 4 -methylphenol, 4 -ethylphenol, 2 -aminoacetophenone, indole, skatole, dimethyl disulfide, diethyl disulfide, <b>dimethyl</b> trisulfide, hydrogen <b>sulfide,</b> and ammonia). In this article, which is part 6 of a six-part series summarizing results of the project, we investigate the correlations between odor concentrations and odor activity value (OAV), defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odor threshold for that compound. The specific objectives were to determine which compounds contributed most to the overall odor emanating from swine and dairy buildings, and develop equations for predicting odor concentration based on compound OAVs. Single-compound odor thresholds (SCOT) were statistically summarized and analyzed, and OAVs were calculated for all compounds. Odor concentrations were regressed against OAV values using multivariate regression techniques. Both swine sites had four common compounds with the highest OAVs (ranked high to low: hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, butyric acid, isovaleric acid). The dairy sites had these same four compounds in common in the top five, and in addition diethyl disulfide was ranked second at one dairy site, while ammonia was ranked third at the other dairy site. Summed OAVs were not a good predictor of odor concentration (R 2 = 0. 16 to 0. 52), underestimating actual odor concentrations by 2 to 3 times. Based on the OAV and regression analyses, we conclude that hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, isovaleric acid, ammonia, and diethyl disulfide are the most likely contributors to swine odor, while hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methyl phenol, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid are the most likely contributors to dairy odors...|$|R
