40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{of these}} therapies have been {{compared}} against placebos, {{but have not}} been directly compared against each other. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of several commonly used drugs for AIS directly or indirectly. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published prior to April 2013 for AIS therapies. The primary outcome measures were the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and the clinical effective rate. A fixed-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression are performed; lastly, performed a mixed treatment comparison was performed through the Bayesian methods. RESULTS: Outcome of efficacy of therapies for acute ischemic stroke are as followed: All of the therapies mentioned above yielded results a more effective result than placebo, Sodium ozagrel (RR 3. 86, 95 %CI 3. 18 - 4. 61); Sodium ozagrel + <b>edaravone</b> (RR 9. 60, 95 %CI 7. 04 - 13. 06); <b>Edaravone</b> (RR 4. 07, 95 %CI 3. 30 - 5. 01); <b>Edaravone</b> + Kininogenase (RR 15. 33, 95 %CI 10. 03 - 23. 05). The significant difference in efficacy between <b>edaravone</b> monotherapy and Sodium ozagrel + <b>edaravone</b> was evident (RR 0. 43, 95 %CI 0. 08 - 0. 61) and was also significant between efficacy of <b>edaravone</b> + Kininogenase and Sodium ozagrel (RR 4. 00, 95 %CI 2. 47 - 6. 24). The differences between the risk and benefit were not significant when comparing Sodium ozagrel and <b>edaravone</b> or <b>edaravone</b> + Kininogenase and Sodium ozagrel + <b>Edaravone</b> for AIS. Outcome of the defect of neurological function: Placebo served {{a significant difference in}} treating the defects of neurological function compared with Sodium ozagrel (WMD = - 3. 11, 95 %CI - 4. 43 to - 1. 79), Sodium ozagrel + <b>edaravone</b> (WMD = - 6. 25, 95 %CI - 7. 96 to - 4. 54) and <b>Edaravone</b> + Kininogenase (WMD =  - 3. 47, 95 %CI - 5. 73 to - 1. 21).

In this study we used <b>edaravone</b> for attenuating of METH-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. The groups (six rats in each group) were as follows: control, METH (5 mg/kg IP) and <b>edaravone</b> (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, IP) was administered 30 min before METH. After 24 hours, animals were killed, heart tissue was separated and mitochondrial fraction was isolated and oxidative stress markers were measured. <b>Edaravone</b> significantly (p< 0. 05) protected the heart against lipid peroxidation by inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. <b>Edaravone</b> also significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the levels of heart glutathione (GSH). METH administration significantly (p< 0. 05) disrupted mitochondrial function that <b>edaravone</b> pre-treatment significantly (p< 0. 05) inhibited METH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Protein carbonyl level also increased after METH exposure, but was significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased with <b>edaravone</b> pre-treatment.

40|$|Background: Antioxidants and the {{duration}} of treatment after noise exposure on hearing recovery are important. We investigated the protective effects of an antioxidant substance, <b>edaravone,</b> and its slow-release dosage form, <b>edaravone</b> solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), in steady noise-exposed guinea pigs. Methods: SLNs loaded with <b>edaravone</b> were produced by an ultrasound technique. <b>Edaravone</b> solution or <b>edaravone</b> SLNs were administered by intratympanic or intravenous injection after the 1 st day of noise exposure. Guinea pigs were exposed to 110 dB sound pressure level (SPL) noise, centered at 0. 25 - 4. 0 kHz, for 4 days at 2 h/d. After noise exposure, the guinea pigs underwent auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold measurements, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected in their cochleas with electron spin resonance (ESR), and outer hair cells (OHCs) were counted with silvernitrate (AgNO 3) staining at 1, 4, and 6 days.

40|$|Conclusion. It is {{suggested}} that simultaneous treatment with the radical scavenger <b>edaravone</b> has an effective protective effect against tobramycin ototoxicity in rat. Even if the <b>edaravone</b> treatment is postponed for 7 days, it can still prevent hearing loss, but a 14 day delay cannot protect from ototoxicity. Objectives. With the aim of alleviating hearing loss caused by aminoglycoside ototoxicity, we performed a trial to assess the hearing protective efficacy of the radical scavenger <b>edaravone.</b> Materials and methods. In part one of the study, 21 male Sprague-Dawley albino rats were used; 2 rats served as controls {{for the safety of}} <b>edaravone.</b> Eight rats each received 10 subcutaneous injections (s. c.) of tobramycin (160 mg/kg b. w.) once daily and saline injection intraperitoneally for 2 weeks.

40|$|Abstract Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurological}} disorder {{characterized by the}} degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems. Free radicals induced by oxidative stress {{are involved in the}} mechanisms of cell death in PD. This study clarifies the neuroprotective effects of <b>edaravone</b> (MCI- 186, 3 -methyl- 1 -phenyl- 2 -pyrazolin- 5 -one), which has already been used for the treatment of cerebral ischemia in Japan, on TH-positive dopaminergic neurons using PD model both in vitro and in vivo. 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA), a neurotoxin for dopaminergic neurons, was added to cultured dopaminergic neurons derived from murine embryonal ventral mesencephalon with subsequet administration of <b>edaravone</b> or saline. The number of surviving TH-positive neurons and the degree of cell damage induced by free radicals were analyzed. In parallel, <b>edaravone</b> or saline was intravenously administered for PD model of rats receiving intrastriatal 6 -OHDA lesion with subsequent behavioral and histological analyses. Results In vitro study showed that <b>edaravone</b> significantly ameliorated the survival of TH-positive neurons in a dose-responsive manner. The number of apoptotic cells and HEt-positive cells significantly decreased, thus indicating that the neuroprotective effects of <b>edaravone</b> might be mediated by anti-apoptotic effects through the suppression of free radicals by <b>edaravone.</b> In vivo study demonstrated that edaravone-administration at 30 minutes after 6 -OHDA lesion reduced the number of amphetamine-induced rotations significantly than edaravone-administration at 24 hours. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining of the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta revealed that <b>edaravone</b> might exert neuroprotective effects on nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems. The neuroprotective effects were prominent when <b>edaravone</b> was administered early and in high concentration.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether <b>edaravone</b> (Eda), a clinically available radical scavenger, directly protects cardiomyocytes from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, {{and whether}} the timing of its application is critical for protection. Cardioprotective effects of <b>edaravone</b> were tested in the modified cell-pelleting model of ischemia and under exogenous oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide: H 2 O 2) in isolated adult rabbit ventricular cells. Cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were detected using propidium iodide (PI) and DCFH-DA, respectively. These parameters were evaluated objectively using flow cytometory. Hypoxia and reoxygenation aggravated the proportion of dead cells from 32. 2 ± 1. 8 % (Baseline) to 51. 3 ± 2. 7 % (Control). When 15 μM <b>edaravone</b> was applied either throughout the entire experiment (Through) or only at reoxygenation (Reox), cell death was significantly reduced to 39. 9 ± 1. 8 % (P< 0. 01 vs Control) and 43. 3 ± 2. 5 % (P< 0. 05 vs Control), respectively. In contrast, when <b>edaravone</b> was applied 10 min after reoxygenation, its protective effect disappeared. Cardioprotection by <b>edaravone</b> was more remarkable than that afforded by other free radical scavengers, such as ascorbate and superoxide dismutase (SOD). There is {{a positive correlation between}} the cardioprotective effect of <b>edaravone</b> and the extent of ROS reduction. <b>Edaravone</b> blunted the H 2 O 2 -induced changes in electrical properties, and significantly prolonged the time to contracture induced by H 2 O 2 in single ventricular myocytes.

Here, we exam-ined the effects of <b>edaravone</b> on the dynamics of high-mobility group box- 1 (HMGB 1), which is a key mediator of ischemic-induced brain damage, during a 48 -h postischemia/reperfusion period in rats and in oxygen-glucose-deprived (OGD) PC 12 cells. HMGB 1 immunoreactivity was observed in both the cy-toplasm and the periphery of cells in the cerebral infarction area 2 h after reperfusion. Intravenous administration of 3 and 6 mg/kg <b>edaravone</b> significantly inhibited nuclear translocation and HMGB 1 release in the penumbra area and caused a 26. 5 10. 4 and 43. 8 0. 5 % reduction, respectively, of the total infarct area at 24 h after reperfusion.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMonocyte {{chemoattractant}} protein- 1 (MCP- 1) {{plays an}} important role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome. We have recently demonstrated that the administration of <b>edaravone</b> before reperfusion attenuated reperfusion injury in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). MethodsPlasma MCP- 1 levels were measured in 45 consecutive patients with AMI (<b>edaravone</b> group, n= 25; control group, n= 20). In the <b>edaravone</b> group, 30 mg <b>edaravone</b> was intravenously infused just before reperfusion. Plasma samples were obtained before and at 24 h, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after reperfusion. Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiac death, subacute thrombosis, or fatal arrhythmia. Heart failure requiring rehospitalization was evaluated at 12 months after reperfusion. ResultsPlasma MCP- 1 levels were not different between the two groups before reperfusion. Compared with the placebo group, the <b>edaravone</b> group had statistically lower maximum creatine kinase-MB levels (218 ± 31 IU/l versus 145 ± 21 IU/l, p< 0. 05) and plasma MCP- 1 levels on day 3 after reperfusion (873 ± 118 pg/ml versus 516 ± 66 pg/ml, p< 0. 05). Heart failure requiring rehospitalization occurred in four patients in the control group, but did not occur in the <b>edaravone</b> group (p< 0. 05). At 12 months after reperfusion, left ventricular ejection fraction was statistically higher in the <b>edaravone</b> group than in the control group (62 ± 2 % versus 54 ± 3 %, p< 0. 05). ConclusionEdaravone suppressed plasma MCP- 1, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduced rehospitalization due to heart failure. Suppression of plasma MCP- 1 level by <b>edaravone</b> might induce better prognosis for AMI patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Edaravone</b> {{has been}} shown to delay {{neuronal}} apoptosis, thereby improving nerve function and the microenvironment after spinal cord injury. <b>Edaravone</b> can provide a favorable environment for the treatment of spinal cord injury using Schwann cell transplantation. This study used rat models of complete spinal cord transection at T 9. Six hours later, Schwann cells were transplanted in the head and tail ends of the injury site. Simultaneously, <b>edaravone</b> was injected through the caudal vein. Eight weeks later, the PKH- 26 -labeled Schwann cells had survived and migrated {{to the center of the}} spinal cord injury region in rats after combined treatment with <b>edaravone</b> and Schwann cells. Moreover, the number of PKH- 26 -labeled Schwann cells in the rat spinal cord was more than that in rats undergoing Schwann cell transplantation alone or rats without any treatment. Horseradish peroxidase retrograde tracing revealed that the number of horseradish peroxidase-positive nerve fibers was greater in rats treated with <b>edaravone</b> combined withSchwann cells than in rats with Schwann cell transplantation alone. The results demonstrated that lower extremity motor function and neurophysiological function were better in rats treated with <b>edaravone</b> and Schwann cells than in rats with Schwann cell transplantation only. These data confirmed that Schwann cell transplantation combined with <b>edaravone</b> injection promoted the regeneration of nerve fibers of rats with spinal cord injury and improved neurological function...|$|E
40|$|Endoplasmic {{reticulum}} (ER) stress-induced {{cell death}} {{plays an important}} role in cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we investigated whether <b>edaravone</b> (3 -methyl- 1 -phenyl-pyrazolin- 5 -one), a free radical scavenger, can protect against ER dam-age induced by cerebral ischemia. In a mouse model of hyp-oxia/ischemia, treatment with <b>edaravone</b> reduced edema-corrected infarction volume, attenuated hemispheric swelling, and improved neurological status. Moreover, <b>edaravone</b> sup-pressed ER stress-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor phosphorylation, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) induction, and caspase- 12 activation. In mouse pri-mary cultured glial cells, <b>edaravone</b> attenuated ER stress as evidenced by inhibition of the induction of glucose regulated protein 78 and CHOP and XBP- 1 splicing under treatment wit...|$|E
