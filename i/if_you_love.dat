In early 2002, the track [...] "Honk <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> Fred Durst" [...] was released as a single. FMR then released tism.bestoff.

It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend not to be so hard on her, and if he really loves her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't you be so hard on me / <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> me, come and give me your everything".|$|E

[...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> the philosophy {{and culture of the}} Na'vi too much, you will be led into evil rather than away from it." [...] Outten further added: [...] "Cameron has done a masterful job in manipulating the emotions of his audience in Avatar. He created a world where it looks good and noble to live in a tree and hunt for your food daily with a bow and arrow.... Cameron said, Avatar asks us to see that everything is connected, all human beings to each other, and us to the Earth.' This is a clear statement of religious belief. This is pantheism.

500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television.

500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not cause you to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know better, if he loves you, let him come back. My fellas, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E
500|$|... "Glassheart" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a dubstep, dance, house and grime song that runs for 3:56 (three minutes, 56 seconds). According to Jenna Hally Rubenstein for MTV Buzzworthy, the song consists of a [...] "grimy, hazy beat", which she compared to [...] "Too Close" [...] (The Lateness of the Hour, 2011), a song performed by Alex Clare. Lyrically, the song is about Lewis' fear that her lover will break her heart. According to Lewis, the song is about protecting yourself, your heart, as well as your emotions. She continued to describe the song as [...] "poignant". The singer went on to reveal that she decided to name the album after the song. Lewis' [...] "crisp" [...] vocals can be heard above the instrumentation as she [...] "croons about the fragility of her heart" [...] as she performs the chorus lines [...] "So baby <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> me/ Let me know/ 'Cause everything hurts just like before/ You're about to tear this heart apart/ I love you like a glass heart." [...] The chorus is built on a [...] "transcendent house beat" [...] as Lewis delicately sings the lines [...] "Promise that we'll never fall apart/ And I'll love you with my Glassheart". The chorus is then followed by a [...] "euphoric instrumentation [...] collapses into a grimy dubstep break." [...] Rubenstein likened the lyrics to those performed by Blondie on her song [...] "Heart of Glass" [...] (Parallel Lines, 1978).|$|E

500|$|Released on June 7, 2005, the {{collection}} has received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine's Keith Uhlich rated it three stars out of five, praising {{the quality of}} the episodes included in the set, but ultimately finding that they were best viewed {{in the context of the}} [...] "standalone" [...] episodes which were omitted—singling out [...] "Conduit" [...] and [...] "The Jersey Devil" [...] as episodes which would aid the series' [...] "dual character study". Writing for IGN, Dan Iverson rated {{the collection}} eight out of ten, finding that the mythology-based episodes formed the basis of the relationship between the characters of Mulder and Scully. Making reference to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze", not included in the collection, he added that [...] "even though people watched the series to see little green men and liver-eating elastic monsters, it was the relationship between the two which made the series a total success". However, he found that the set's extra features material was sparse, describing it as being just enough [...] "to keep us from complaining". Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, finding that the featured episodes worked well together without losing cohesion, and stating that [...] "whether you are a casual viewer or a fan who already owns the season sets, owning The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1: Abduction is a must". Exclaim! Monica S. Kuebler felt negatively about the collection, noting that anyone who would be interested in it would be likely to already own the collected episodes through other releases, and asking [...] "should you buy Abduction? It all depends on how much five commentaries and a doc are worth to you, because chances are, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> the X-Files ... you've probably already bought the episodes included here at least once".|$|E
500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was written}} by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen (formerly of the band Junior Senior), and {{produced}} with Paul Blair (a.k.a. DJ White Shadow) and Fernando Garibay, while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York. The electropop song begins with Gaga's voice uttering the line [...] "It doesn't matter <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> him or capital H-I-M" [...] on a loop, backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass. As the synths change into a beat, Gaga belts out the song's first verse, followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion-backed chorus, [...] "I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way", which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being [...] "meant {{to be heard in}} a big space. It's fast and hard-hitting." [...] After the chorus she chants the line [...] "Don't be a drag, Just be a queen" [...] a number of times on top of handclaps, before moving to the second verse. After the second chorus an interlude follows, where Gaga chants the names of various communities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show, Glee, and the song [...] "There But For the Grace of God Go I" [...] by Machine. The music fades out for a moment as Gaga sings a cappella, before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Born This Way" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate dance beat tempo of 124 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major as Gaga's voice spans the tonal nodes of F3 to C5. [...] "Born This Way" [...] follows a chord progression of F5–F–E–B–F in the chorus.|$|E
