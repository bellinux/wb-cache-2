5000|$|Another release showed {{employees}} at two Arizona abortion facilities - Camelback Family Planning in Phoenix and the Tucson Women's Center in Tucson - instructing the investigator to suppress her reason for seeking the abortion. After {{hearing that the}} investigator desires to abort her fetus for being female, the Phoenix counselor tells her, [...] "Don't let it be known!," [...] while the surgical assistant in Tucson says, [...] "I'll just forget about it ... but <b>just</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> not <b>to</b> mention it the abortion doctor." [...] Sex-selective abortion is illegal in Arizona. Neither the two taped clinics nor the NAF took any action following the release.|$|R
5000|$|The role of Valerie was {{originated}} by actress Tina Andrews in 1975 on {{a recurring}} basis. In {{the summer of}} 1977, {{it was announced that}} Andrews would vacate the role of Valerie after two years to join the cast of the network's prime-time sitcom, Sanford Arms. On her departure from the role of Valerie, Andrews remarked [...] "It's like having your child grow up and leave home. You know it's for the best but hard to accept." [...] In addition to collecting a regular salary, Andrews appreciated the advantages of working on the soap. [...] "It was like a paid workshop. I kept my skills sharp." [...] Because she was not bound by a contract, [...] "I can take another job whenever I want. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> give the show time enough to write my character out of the story for that time. Andrews and the producers were working on an arrangement for her to continue taping when she was available, but plans changed when the actress booked several television films. Andrews last appeared in the role of Valerie on July 22 and was replaced by Rose Fonseca on a August 2; Fonseca was also on a recurring basis. Fonseca vacated the role in 1978, and last appeared on July 26. Actress Diane Sommerfield took over the role of Valerie on October 19, 1981 as a series regular. However, Sommerfield's tenure barely lasted a year and she last appeared on July 1, 1982.|$|R
40|$|When {{you hear}} the word "{{homeless}} " what comes to your mind? When you see {{out of the side}} of your eye a person holding a sign asking for money, what goes through your mind? Do you wonder if the homeless person is an addict or even crazy? Do you wonder if the person holding the sign is a scammer trying to prey on people's sympathy? Or do you feel compassion, but <b>just</b> <b>are</b> not <b>sure</b> how <b>to</b> help? These are all questions I have at one time or another thought. And while it is good to question what you see, I also think it is good to take the time to learn about what you are seeing and do something to help. It may be true that some people are homeless due to poor choices or that some people try to scam others. But if you think about it, how humbling it is to hold a sign and ask strangers for help, you will find yourself giving that homeless person the benefit of the doubt. Now take this thought a step further and put yourself in the place of a homeless person. A homeless person <b>is</b> <b>just</b> like you and me- they just don't have a roof over their head. According to the last biennial survey released by the Champaign County Continuum of Care for January 2013, there were 214 homeless people in Champaign County. The number has gone down from 549 homeless in January of 2011. But these numbers <b>are</b> <b>just</b> estimates that depend on the openness of the individuals asked. Plus the term homeless can cover a broad spectrum of individuals- from those with no shelter at all to those who stay on a friend’s couch. Another factor taken into account is how long the person has been homeless. A person is deemed chronically homeless if they have been homeless for over a year or been homeless four or more times in three years and have a disabling condition...|$|R
60|$|I long to {{see your}} papers, and dare say they are charming. At the same time, <b>just</b> because they <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> charming (and {{notwithstanding}} their kindness to me, notwithstanding that I live in a glass house myself, warmed by such rare stoves!) I am a little in fear that your generosity and excess of kindness may {{run the risk of}} lowering the ideal of poetry in England by lifting above the mark the names of some poetasters. Do you know, you take up your heart sometimes by mistake, to admire with, when you ought to use it only to love with? and this is apt to be dangerous, with your reputation and authority in matters of literature. See how impertinent I am! But we should all take care to teach the world that poetry is a divine thing, should we not? that is, not mere verse-making, though the verses be pretty in their way. Rather perish every verse I ever wrote, for one, than help to drag down an inch that standard of poetry which, for the sake of humanity as well as literature, should be kept high. As for simplicity and clearness, did I ever deny that they were excellent qualities? Never, surely. Only, they will not make poetry; and absolutely vain they are, and indeed all other qualities, without the essential thing, the genius, the inspiration, the insight--let us call it what we please--without which the most accomplished verse-writers had far better write prose, for their own sakes as for the world's--don't you think so? Which I say, because I sighed aloud over many names in your list, and now have taken pertly to write out the sigh at length. Too charmingly you <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> have written--and see the danger! But Miss Fanshawe is well worth your writing of (let me say that I am sensible warmly of that) {{as one of the most}} witty of our wits in verse, men or women. I have only seen manuscript copies of some of her verses, and that years ago, but they struck me very much; and really I do not remember another female wit worthy to sit beside her, even in French literature. Motherwell is a true poet. But oh, I don't believe in your John Clares, Thomas Davises, Whittiers, Hallocks--and still less in other names which it would be invidious to name again. How pert I am! But you give me leave to be pert, and you know the meaning of it all, after all. Your editor quarrelled a little with me once, and I with him, about the 'poetesses of the united empire,' in whom I couldn't or wouldn't find a poet, though there are extant two volumes of them, and Lady Winchilsea at the head. I hold that the writer of the ballad of 'Robin Gray' was our first poetess rightly so called, before Joanna Baillie.|$|R
