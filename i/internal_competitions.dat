30|$|In this article, we {{have shown}} that the {{solutions}} of the model considered are globally bounded. The local stability study revealed that the delay introduced in the feedback of the equation prey, which is essentially due to <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> between preys, has a real impact on the stability of the indoor fixed point (u^*,v^*). In effect, from a certain threshold of delay r_ 1, noted r^*_ 1, a change of stability of this unique positive internal fixed point is observed. We have built an appropriate Lyapunov’s functional to study the global stability of the fixed point (u^*, v^*). We retain that for a smallest length of the delay r_ 1 and for an <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> raised between the preys, this fixed point is globally asymptotically stable. This conclusion seems to be in line with reality. The faster preys reach maturity, the better they participate in the <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> between their species. This competition makes the interactions of all the species involved more dynamic.|$|R

Using the model in an empirical study of the Swedish railway sector, it is found that external competitive pressure is strong in most supply segments and, focusing on loss of scale advantages, that the transformation will result in significant costs. Comparing the potential for gains by competition against the costs, it is concluded that increased efficiency by <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> only seems possible to achieve for two train products: domestic combined transport and dedicated trains (both freight services).

40|$|An {{important}} issue that managers are facing in today’s intensive business environment {{is how to}} compensate their employees to keep them motivated. The trend is to be rewarded for the individual performances, which has increased the usage of commission based salary systems. Previous research suggests that commission salary provokes <b>internal</b> <b>competition,</b> while it damages cooperation. However, the main issue in feminine and masculine societies is what motivates people, which indicates {{that the effects of}} commission based salary systems needed to be examined from a cultural perspective. Therefore, with the main aim was to enhance the understanding of this, the problem was addressed by the overreaching research question: How do commission based salary systems affect cooperation and <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> in masculine and in feminine societies? To answer this, empirical data was acquired from Sweden and the United States. Sweden is recognized as the most feminine society, where social motives are dominating. The United States on the other hand, is recognized as a masculine society that encourages competition and where money is the main motivator. The empirical data derived from personal interviews with real estate agents that work with commission salary. Three case companies within each country were included in the study and three interviewees within each company participated. The findings showed that commission salary tends to increase the work effort, limit the cooperation, while it increases the <b>internal</b> <b>competition.</b> Nevertheless, the effects it has distinctively differs between the societies. In Sweden, the importance of group cohesion and interpersonal relationship results in a higher level of cooperation than in the United States. Despite that commission salary evokes <b>internal</b> <b>competition,</b> colleagues are colleagues above all in Sweden. In the United States however, cooperation mainly occurs when it serves the individual performances. Here, money and the own success are what matter the most and due to the competitive mindset, <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> becomes significantly more intensive in the United States than in Sweden. In contrary to Sweden, commission salary can turn colleagues into competitors, for better or for worse.  Master thesi...|$|R
40|$|In {{managing}} organisations {{for optimal}} performance, managers {{are faced with}} the dilemma of either positioning their employees to compete or collaborate internally within the organisation. <b>Internal</b> <b>competition</b> can motivate individuals and teams to strive to be the best and in so doing result in continuous incremental performance improvements. In contrast, internal collaboration can result in effective problem solving through knowledge sharing and innovation. Management is therefore faced with a challenging dilemma of how best to leverage these seemingly opposing tensions for optimal performance. This study investigated the key factors that drive the adoption of <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> and <b>internal</b> collaboration in organisations, the consequences of implementing either management approach, how levels of <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> and <b>internal</b> collaboration vary at different management levels in the organisation and finally whether a viable hybrid combination of both management approaches was possible. To this end a qualitative research study with an explorative design was conducted with twenty senior executives. The insights from these in-depth interviews formed the basis of the data that was analysed to produce the research findings in this study. The research identified drivers and outcomes of the management approaches under review. The <b>Internal</b> <b>Competition</b> and <b>Internal</b> Collaboration Hybrid Model (Figure 14) emerged from these research findings. This model was found to confirm while the management approaches are different there is an optimal way of combining them to allow managers to leverage competitive and collaborative tensions. In this way managers can achieve sustainable high performance within their organisation.
