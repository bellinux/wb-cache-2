5|$|The plot jumps {{forward to}} 1720 England, {{where the country}} is unknowingly {{approaching}} the South Sea Bubble economic collapse; Barbara has separated from her husband and conducted affairs with several men in Paris and London. Still in love with Roger despite his affair, she is unhappy and becomes horrified when she discovers {{that one of her}} jealous lovers, Lord Charles Russel, killed <b>Jemmy,</b> a young nobleman who she accidentally slept with for one night.|$|E
25|$|The three old net weavers who {{discovered}} Red Jason's shipwreck at Port Lewaigue (Chapter IX) are {{claimed to be}} based on real people. Caine describes them in his non-fictional 1891 book on the Isle of Man, The Little Manx Nation. Unlike <b>Jemmy,</b> Danny and Juan in the novel, the characters in reality were called <b>Jemmy,</b> Danny and Billy.|$|E

25|$|Through {{his brother}} <b>Jemmy,</b> Wilson forged {{links with the}} new Conservative leader Bonar Law. <b>Jemmy</b> {{had been on the}} {{platform}} in Belfast in April 1912 when Law addressed a mass meeting against Home Rule, and in the summer of 1912 he came to London to work for the Ulster Defence League (run by Walter Long and Charlie Hunter). At Charlie Hunter’s suggestion, Wilson dined with Law (23 June 1912). He was impressed by him and spent an hour and three quarters discussing Ireland and defence matters. That summer he began having regular talks with Long, who used Wilson as a conduit to try to establish cross-party defence agreement with Churchill.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{was elected}} to White's in 1889. Although White's {{membership}} books for the period do not survive, when his brother <b>Jemmy</b> {{was elected to}} Brooks's in 1894, his proposer and seconder were prominent members of the Anglo-Irish elite in London.|$|E

25|$|The United All England Eleven was {{established}} as a rival to the AEE. <b>Jemmy</b> Dean and John Wisden were the main organisers and other players to represent the UEE {{in its early years}} included John Lillywhite, Tom Lockyer, Jem Grundy, F P Miller, W Mortlock and T Sherman.|$|E
25|$|Darwin's first book, The Voyage of the Beagle, {{contains}} passages about <b>Jemmy</b> Button, a teenaged native Fuegian who {{was sold}} for a mother-of-pearl button {{and brought to}} England, an island nation. Darwin describes Button's character and demeanor and relates details about his capture and sale, explaining his unusual name, and about his return to his homeland, two years later.|$|E
25|$|While in the Falkland Islands, FitzRoy {{bought a}} {{schooner}} {{out of his}} own funds to assist with the surveying tasks he had been asked to complete. He had it refitted and renamed Adventure, hoping that the cost would be reimbursed by the Admiralty. They returned to the mission post but found only <b>Jemmy</b> Button. He had returned to native ways and refused the offer to go with them back to England.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 May the party left camp 69 to follow the Warrego {{downstream}} south-south-west. As Fisherman had to take <b>Jemmy's</b> place in rounding up the horses in the morning, he and Landsborough stayed behind {{the rest of the}} party to mark trees at the camp, catching up with the others in the evening.|$|R
6000|$|One {{evening the}} Major {{came into my}} little room to take {{a cup of tea}} and a morsel of buttered toast and to read <b>Jemmy's</b> newest letter which had arrived that {{afternoon}} (by the very same postman more than middle-aged upon the Beat now), and the letter raising him up a little I says to the Major: ...|$|R

25|$|The 23-year-old aristocrat FitzRoy {{proved an}} able {{commander}} and meticulous surveyor. In one incident {{a group of}} Fuegians stole a ship's boat, and FitzRoy took their families on board as hostages. Eventually he held two men, a girl and a boy, who was given the name of <b>Jemmy</b> Button, and these four native Fuegians were taken back with them when the Beagle returned to England on 14 October 1830.|$|E
25|$|Ende {{did not see}} {{his book}} as a children's book, but just wrote it for himself. He based the title {{character}} on <b>Jemmy</b> Button, a native Fuegian who, {{as a teenager in}} the 19th century, was sold for a mother-of-pearl button and taken to England. He later returned to his homeland on the HMS Beagle, by way of the Galapagos Islands, along with fellow passenger Charles Darwin, who later wrote about the episode.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the real-life}} <b>Jemmy</b> Button, Ende's Jim Button {{is brought to}} an island nation and is seen by the {{inhabitants}} as racially exotic, but is quickly accepted and becomes well liked. Shipping, which during England's colonial era, began bringing goods from around the globe, also {{plays an important role}} in Morrowland. Mrs. Whaat's grocery store is supplied from all corners of world once a week by Ende's own version of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company and Morrowland's mail arrives by ship.|$|E

60|$|The travelling-carriage, which, with <b>Jemmy's</b> thirty-seven {{boxes and}} my carpet-bag, was pretty well loaded, was sent {{on board the}} night before; and we, after breakfasting in Portland Place (little did I think it was the--but, poh! never mind), {{went down to the}} Custom House in the other carriage, {{followed}} by a hackney-coach and a cab, with the servants, and fourteen bandboxes and trunks more, which were to be wanted by my dear girl in the journey.|$|R
5000|$|Lakes Entrance, {{which lies}} almost at sea level, {{can be reached}} from Melbourne via Bairnsdale {{and the town of}} Kalimna to the north-west by a stretch of the Princes Highway, which snakes down and around a point {{protruding}} into the Gippsland Lakes known as [...] "Jemmy's Point". Spectacular views of The Entrance and of the Lakes can be seen from various look-outs on <b>Jemmy's</b> Point. The Princes Highway leaves the north-east side of the town through hilly countryside towards Nowa Nowa and Orbost.|$|R
25|$|The {{players were}} better paid by Clarke {{than they were}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club or the counties, but Clarke, who was captain as well as manager of the team, {{received}} {{by far the largest}} part of the profit. In 1852 some of the professionals, led by John Wisden and <b>Jemmy</b> Dean, were dissatisfied by Clarke's ungenerous and undemocratic behaviour and sought larger wages. They broke away from the team and created the United All-England Eleven. Other similar teams appeared from the late 1850s.|$|E
25|$|Social conditions, {{including}} the railways, were {{a key factor}} {{in the creation of the}} travelling All-England Eleven (AEE). The team was founded in Nottingham by William Clarke. The first AEE match was at Sheffield in September and they played others in Manchester and Leeds. The original AEE team was: William Clarke, <b>Jemmy</b> Dean, William Dorrinton, Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Joe Guy, Will Martingell, Tom Sewell, G Butler, VC Smith and William Hillyer. Other players who represented the AEE in its early days included George Parr, William Lillywhite, Nicholas Felix, William Denison, Thomas Box and OC Pell.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{supported}} Ulster Unionist {{opponents of}} the Third Irish Home Rule Bill, which was due to become law in 1914. Wilson had learned from his brother <b>Jemmy</b> (13 April 1913) about plans to raise 25,000 armed men and 100,000 “constables”, and to form a Provisional Government in Ulster {{to take control of}} banks and railways, which he thought “all very sensible”. It is unclear whether he actually envisaged armed insurrection or hoped that the Government would back off. Asked by Roberts (16 April 1913) to be chief of staff to the “Army of Ulster”, Wilson replied that if necessary he would fight for Ulster rather than against her.|$|E
6000|$|Paris grew dull to {{us after}} this, {{and we were}} more eager than ever {{to go back to}} London: for what should we hear, but that that monster, Tuggeridge, of the City--old Tug's black son, forsooth!--was going to contest <b>Jemmy's</b> claim to the property, and had filed I don't know how many bills against us in Chancery! Hearing this, we set off immediately, and we arrived at Boulogne, and set off in that very same [...] "Grand Turk" [...] which had brought us to France.|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} two days the wind was against them, and they made but little progress. Mrs. Harbolt spent most of her time on deck, thereby {{confining}} her husband to his evil-smelling quarters below. Matters were not improved for him by his treatment of the crew, who, resenting his rough treatment of them, were doing their best to starve him into civility. Most of the time he kept in his bunk—or rather <b>Jemmy’s</b> bunk—a prey to despondency and hunger of an acute type, venturing on deck only at night to prowl uneasily about and bemoan his condition.|$|R
6000|$|My dear {{the system}} {{upon which the}} Major {{commenced}} and as I may say perfected <b>Jemmy's</b> learning when he was so small that if the dear {{was on the other}} side of the table you had to look under it instead of over it to see him with his mother's own bright hair in beautiful curls, is a thing that ought to be known to the Throne and Lords and Commons and then might obtain some promotion for the Major which he well deserves and would be none the worse for (speaking between friends) L. S. D.-ically. When the Major first undertook his learning he says to me: ...|$|R
25|$|In March 1869, Forrest {{was asked}} to lead an {{expedition}} in search of Leichhardt, who had been missing since April 1848. A few years earlier, a party of Aborigines had told the explorer Charles Hunt {{that a group of}} white men had been killed by Aborigines a long time ago, and some time afterwards, an Aboriginal tracker named <b>Jemmy</b> Mungaro had corroborated their story and claimed to have personally been to the location. Since it was thought that these stories might refer to Leichhardt's party, Forrest {{was asked to}} lead a party to the site, with Mungaro as their guide and there to search for evidence of Leichhardt's fate.|$|E
25|$|Wilson had {{regarded}} {{himself as}} Irish {{and to the}} end of his life Currygrane, County Longford was the first address in his “Who’s Who” entry. In early July 1919 Wilson, in uniform and in an open car, had still been able to drive his mother there, the last time he ever visited the place. During the War of Independence, the IRA had confiscated the family guns and the house had been taken over by Auxiliaries. By 1921, he and his brothers had all had to leave, unable to access papers and valuables, his brother <b>Jemmy</b> living in impecunious circumstances at Rye in Sussex (Wilson had to pay for the schooling of Jemmy’s daughter) and it was unsafe for Wilson even to book a ferry crossing to Dublin under his own name. On the day Wilson's killers were hanged, Currygrane was burned to the ground, possibly as a reprisal although possibly as an unrelated part of the unrest in that county.|$|E
25|$|The Wilson family {{claimed to}} have arrived in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, with William of Orange in 1690, but may well {{have lived in the}} area prior to that. They prospered in the Belfast {{shipping}} business in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century and following the Encumbered Estates Act of 1849 became landowners in counties Dublin, Westmeath and Longford. Wilson’s father James, the youngest of four sons, inherited Currygrane in Ballinalee, County Longford (1,200 acres, worth £835 in 1878), making him a middle-ranking landowner, more than a large farmer but not a “Big House” Ascendancy landlord; by 1901 the Currygrane estate had 49 Catholic and 13 Protestant (10 of them the Wilson family) inhabitants. James Wilson served as a High sheriff, a Justice of the peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Longford, there being no elected local government in Ireland until 1898, and he and his oldest son <b>Jemmy</b> attended Trinity College, Dublin. There is no record of Land League activity on the estate, and as late as the 1960s the IRA leader Sean MacEoin remembered the Wilsons as having been fair landlords and employers. The Wilsons also owned Frascati, an eighteenth century house at Blackrock, near Dublin.|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this project is the {{continued}} study of {{a reversal of the}} earth’s magnetic field recorded from lavas in the Liverpool Range of New South Whales, Australia. This reverse-to-normal transition, recently dated at ~ 40 Ma, was first reported in Nature in 1986. [2] In March 2011 some 200 + cores were drilled from several sections about the volcanic range—Jemmy’s Creek, Bald Hill, Rock Creek, Yarraman, and Coolah Tops Road. Here we focus on paleomagnetic findings from samples drilled from the most extensive section, that being along the trail near <b>Jemmy’s</b> Creek. Results from alternating field demagnetization show the earth’s magnetic field was in the reverse direction for all 24 distinct lava outcrops sampled as well as some interesting behavior. The project also involved the rewriting and development of our software in FORTRAN 77 code in order for our output data to be compatible with an existing modern freeware program capable of graphing paleomagnetic analyses and plotting the results...|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} the will {{is a very complex}} one, but it {{involved}} leaving the entire estate valued at nearly £1,000,000, to Alderman Wood and three other executors. Eventually, after a long court case against Wood and the other three executor-beneficiaries, on 20 Feb 1839 Judge Jenner in an extremely long and detailed verdict at the Arches Prerogative Court, London, 'decided that the terms were made by conspiracy and fraud, and ordered that the whole of the immense property should be divided amongst two relations'. And yet, within a couple of years, this verdict was overturned on appeal by Lord Lyndhurst, and the four men (or family in the case of John Chadborn, <b>Jemmy's</b> lawyer, who had hanged himself in the interim) who had been accused of fraud were awarded what money and property was left after court costs were allowed for. The inheritance formed the basis of the Wood family fortunes (now the Page Woods)and also that of John Chadborn's daughter's family, the Prices.|$|R

[...] "Turk and the ba--," [...] laughs out my lord, looking at us. [...] "HURRA! THIS way, ma'am!" [...] And turning round a corner, he opened a door into a court-yard, where a number of boys were collected, and a great noise of shrill voices might be heard. [...] "Go it, Turk!" [...] says one. [...] "Go it, barber!" [...] says another. [...] "PUNCH HITH LIFE OUT!" [...] roars another, whose voice was just cracked, and his clothes half a yard too short for him! ...|$|R
