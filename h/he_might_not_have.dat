5|$|Brian Horrocks was {{the only}} son of Colonel Sir William Horrocks, a doctor in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Born in India, Brian {{returned}} to Britain, where he was educated at Bow School, Durham, later Uppingham School, Rutland, an English public school, and entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1913. His score was sixth-lowest of the 167 successful applicants for cadetships—even after the addition of 200 bonus points for an Officer Training Corps (OTC) certificate, which not all the other candidates had. An unpromising student, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> received a commission at all but for {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in August 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found {{he was unable}} to race effectively. He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December he announced his retirement. At the time the reasons for LeMond's increasing difficulties were not entirely known. At a loss, he speculated that a condition known as mitochondrial myopathy might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing against the current riders. In 2007, however, LeMond speculated that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had the condition after all, and suggested that lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible, the effects of which were increased by heavy training.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli was {{primarily}} a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This {{can be explained by}} the close relationship he saw between exegesis of scripture and theological reflection. Vermigli's method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed scripture alone held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly referred to them. He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.|$|E

5|$|While Oppenheimer {{seemed the}} logical person {{to direct the}} new laboratory, which became known as Project Y, he had little {{administrative}} experience; Bush, Conant, Lawrence and Harold Urey all expressed reservations about this. Moreover, unlike his other project leaders—Lawrence at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, Compton at the Metallurgical Project in Chicago, and Urey at the SAM Laboratories in New York—Oppenheimer {{did not have a}} Nobel Prize, raising concerns that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the prestige to deal with distinguished scientists. There were also security concerns; many of Oppenheimer's closest associates were active members of the Communist Party, including his wife Kitty, girlfriend Jean Tatlock, brother Frank, and Frank's wife Jackie. In the end, Groves personally issued instructions to clear Oppenheimer on 20 July 1943.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{seems to}} have {{received}} Luther's letter with the Theses {{around the end of}} November. He requested the opinion of theologians at the University of Mainz and conferred with his advisers. His advisers recommended he have Luther prohibited from preaching against indulgences in accordance with the indulgence bull. Albert requested such action from the Roman Curia. In Rome, Luther was immediately perceived as a threat. In February 1518, Pope Leo asked the head of the Augustinian Hermits, Luther's religious order, to convince him to stop spreading his ideas about indulgences. Sylvester Mazzolini was also appointed to write an opinion which would be used in the trial against him. Mazzolini wrote A Dialogue against Martin Luther's Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope, which focused on Luther's questioning of the pope's authority rather than his complaints about indulgence preaching. Luther received a summons to Rome in August 1518. He responded with Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences, in which he attempted to clear himself of the charge that he was attacking the pope. As he set down his views more extensively, Luther {{seems to have}} recognized that the implications of his beliefs set him further from official teaching than he initially knew. He later said <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> begun the controversy had he known where it would lead. The Explanations have been called Luther's first Reformation work.|$|E

25|$|Before 1902 White dated his {{photographs}} according {{to when the}} negative was made, even though <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> printed it that same year. For his later prints he often assigned two dates, one when the image was taken and another when it was printed.|$|E
25|$|Hayden's 1932 {{campaign}} saw {{him coming}} close to defeat. Votes against early payment of the World War I veterans' bonus and for prohibition, the Senate vote for repeal of prohibition not coming till 1933, {{caused him to}} lose support from his Depression-era constituents and he only won a plurality during the primary. Hayden later speculated {{that if he had}} faced only one opponent, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> won.|$|E
25|$|During Salleh's tenure, the Federal Court became officially {{the highest}} court in the land. Previously, its {{decisions}} could have been appealed to the British Privy Council, but due to concern over this colonial legacy, the link was officially cut. Salleh would later express regret over this, as he believed <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been fired had the link to the Privy Council been maintained. In 1985, the Federal Court was renamed the Supreme Court.|$|E
6000|$|... "My servant, Louis Rey, {{was very}} sombre and reserved," [...] says Peytel; [...] "he refused {{to call me}} in the morning, to carry my money-chest to my room, to cover the open car when it rained." [...] The Prosecutor disproves this by stating that Rey talked with the inn maids and servants, asked if his master was up, {{and stood in the}} inn-yard, {{grooming}} the horses, with his master by his side, neither speaking to the other. <b>Might</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> talked to the maids, and yet been sombre when speaking to his master? <b>Might</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> neglected to call his master, and yet have asked whether <b>he</b> was awake? <b>Might</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> said that the inn-gates were safe, out of hearing of the ostler witness? Mr. Substitute's answers to Peytel's statements are no answer at all. Every word Peytel said might be true, and yet Louis Rey <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> committed the murder; or every word might have been false, and yet Louis Rey might have committed the murder.|$|R
50|$|If {{a person}} {{deliberately}} gets drunk {{in order to}} commit a crime “that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> otherwise <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had the courage to commit,” the actio libera in causa rule provides that he will be guilty of that crime, even if his conduct was not voluntary {{at the time of its}} commission, because the original cause of that conduct (getting drunk) was within his conscious control at the time he did so.|$|R
50|$|Flying at 23,000 feet, Eagleston caught an FW 190 {{with a short}} burst, at 45 {{degrees of}} deflection. The enemy {{aircraft}} dove away steeply and Eagleston pursued. Both planes accelerated rapidly; the German went into a violent, unrecoverable spin. Crashing into the ground, the Focke Wulf-190 became Eagleston's first victory - which <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even <b>have</b> hit with his machine gun fire. On the Kiel mission of January 5, the group claimed 18 enemy aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Australia {{went into}} the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 confident. However, the semi-final against France at Sydney's Concord Oval, was lost 30–26. Australia then lost the third-fourth {{play-off}} match against Wales. While Australia's performances over the three years under coach Alan Jones were of a high standard, Jones had a polarising effect on the team with many players unhappy with his management style. Mark Ella, who retired after the 1984 season, stated that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> retired had Jones not been coach. Notably, there were deep ructions between coach Alan Jones and influential half-back Nick Farr-Jones. Before and during the 1987 World Cup Alan Jones increased his activities outside coaching Australia, including radio broadcasting. Following the World Cup Jones was removed as coach and Bob Dwyer—who had coached Australia in 1982 and 1983—returned to coach in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam {{repeatedly}} said in interviews {{that the character}} of Parnassus was meant autobiographically, a tale of an aging man with a vivid imagination {{in a world that}} doesn't listen any more. Still being caught in depression over the disruption of his last self-written project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, his constant struggle with the established studio system, as well as becoming aware of his progressing age, worried that he was going nowhere with his latest projects and that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> much time left, Gilliam put a number of references to sudden, tragic, and premature death into his script before the loss of Ledger became a reality. In fact, Gilliam felt compelled to emphasise time and again that upon the film's release many things might be mistaken as references to Ledger's fate but that the script wasn't changed apart from re-casting Tony with Depp, Farrell, and Law.|$|E
25|$|Verus {{continued}} eastward via Corinth and Athens, {{accompanied by}} musicians and singers {{as if in}} a royal progress. At Athens he stayed with Herodes Atticus, and joined the Eleusinian Mysteries. 1.869, 872; HA Hadrian 13.1. During sacrifice, a falling star was observed in the sky, shooting west to east. He stopped in Ephesus, where he is attested at the estate of the local aristocrat Vedius Antoninus, and made an unexpected stopover at Erythrae, where an elegiac poem in the voice of the local sibyl alludes to his visit. The journey continued by ship through the Aegean and the southern coasts of Asia Minor, lingering in the famed pleasure resorts of Pamphylia and Cilicia, before arriving in Antioch. It is not known how long Verus' journey east took; <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> arrived in Antioch until after 162. Statius Priscus, meanwhile, must have already arrived in Cappadocia; he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship.|$|E

50|$|Snorri {{therefore}} {{received an}} excellent education and made connections that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise <b>have</b> made. <b>He</b> attended {{the school of}} Sæmundr fróði, grandfather of Jón Loftsson, at Oddi, and never returned to his parents' home. His father died in 1183 and his mother as guardian soon wasted Snorri's share of the inheritance. Jón Loftsson died in 1197. The two families then arranged a marriage in 1199 between Snorri and Herdís, the daughter of Bersi Vermundarson. From her father, Snorri inherited an estate at Borg and a chieftainship. He soon acquired more property and chieftainships.|$|R
500|$|Biden {{had felt}} poorly {{physically}} during {{parts of the}} campaign, suffering repeated headaches {{and at one point}} in September 1987 having to halt a speech in New Hampshire for 15 minutes after feeling faint. [...] In February 1988, he suffered the first of two brain aneurysms that required life-saving surgery and seven months away from the Senate in order to convalesce. [...] Biden and others would speculate that had his campaign not ended early, the aneurysms might have been more severe or detected later and that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> lived out the year.|$|E
500|$|Milo says {{goodbye and}} drives {{back through the}} tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens {{the next day with}} plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, [...] "For Milo, who now knows the way." [...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> time to go, for {{there is so much to}} do right where he is.|$|E
500|$|In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton [...] the {{existence}} of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the theosophist Henry More, revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that [...] "Newton was not the first of the age of reason: He was the last of the magicians." [...] Newton's interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science. This was {{at a time when there}} was no clear distinction between alchemy and science. Had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> developed his theory of gravity. (See also Isaac Newton's occult studies.) ...|$|E

In the week leading up to the Cox Plate, the eventual Melbourne Cup winner, Media Puzzle, had burst into calculations by winning the Geelong Cup by more than three lengths, and Northerly would have been conceding 7.5 kilograms to the imported galloper.|$|R

500|$|Bourque {{joined the}} Blackhawks {{to start the}} 2005–06 season, and scored his first NHL goal against goaltender J. S. Giguere in his first game, a 5–3 loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. [...] He {{finished}} his rookie season with 16goals and 34points, good for fourth place in team scoring. The Hawks subsequently signed Bourque to a two-year contract extension. He endured an injury-plagued season in 2006–07, appearing in only 44games and scoring 7goals. He was rushed to hospital during a November 12, 2006, game against the Columbus Blue Jackets after suffering a deep cut to the neck from Nikolai Zherdev's skate during a scrum in the crease. The Blackhawks {{announced that he would}} miss 3–6 weeks following surgery to repair the laceration. Bourque considered himself fortunate that the injury was not worse, stating upon his return to action four weeks later that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> survived if the cut was a couple of millimetres deeper.|$|E
500|$|It {{had also}} been some time since a Copland piece had been {{appreciated}} widely by audiences. His opera The Tender Land had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet Dance Panels, {{despite the fact that}} he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—Connotations, Music for a Great City, Emblems and Inscape—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. [...] Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, [...] "By the sixties, serialism had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore." [...] Nonetheless, he did not want to be pigeonholed. He told American composer Walter Piston in 1963, [...] "People always want to shove me into the American idea more than I really want. Nobody wants to be an 'American' composer now as they did." [...] He told another friend, [...] "Young composers today wouldn't be caught dead with a folk tune!" [...] He heard a considerable amount of new music through his association with Tanglewood and might not have wanted to be left behind. At the same time, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> become totally at home with serialism. He confided to Verna Fine, [...] "I don't feel comfortable with the twelve-tone system, but I don't want to keep repeating myself." ...|$|E
