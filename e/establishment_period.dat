5|$|PlatinumGames {{was founded}} by the merger of Seeds Inc. and Odd Ltd. in October 2007. Seeds Inc. had been founded by Shinji Mikami, Atsushi Inaba, and Hideki Kamiya on August 1, 2006. Prior to {{establishing}} the company, the three worked for Capcom, and were {{key members of the}} Osaka-based Clover Studio, which specialized in making new and creative intellectual properties. They worked closely together developing popular Capcom franchises including: Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe and Ōkami. Most of these titles received critical acclaim, but under-performed commercially, leading to Capcom's decision to close the studio. Prior to the closure, the three founders had already left the studio to form their own company in mid-2006. In January 2006, the company expanded to 51 employees, including more former Capcom employees such as Masami Ueda, composer for the early Resident Evil games, and Mari Shimazaki, Ōkamis artist. Yusuke Hashimoto and Kenji Saito, who would eventually become PlatinumGames' directors, also joined during its <b>establishment</b> <b>period.</b> The new company revealed its existence by launching its website in February 2007.|$|E

40|$|Marginal {{lands are}} {{proposed}} {{as a viable}} option for producing biofeedstocks as these lands are not heavily engaged in agricultural production {{or may not be}} suitable for intensive row-crop food/feed production. However, meeting biofeedstock production goals will require large amount of marginal lands and the unintended consequences of producing biofeedstocks on marginal lands are not fully clear. The overall goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the productivity of biofeedstocks on marginal lands and the potential impacts on hydrologic and water quality processes from the land use conversion. ^ This study was conducted in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). First, the suitability of marginal lands in this region was evaluated for the growth of three candidate biofeedstock crops, switchgrass, Miscanthus and hybrid poplar. The evaluation was conducted using a fuzzy logic based land suitability evaluation method. Then, the simulation of switchgrass and Miscanthus growth during their <b>establishment</b> <b>periods</b> in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was improved. Finally, the model was used to evaluate the impacts on hydrologic and water quality processes due to production of switchgrass and Miscanthus on marginal lands in the UMRB region. ^ The results indicated that 23 % of the UMRB area included marginal lands. Among these lands, 40 % of them were poorly suitable for the production of biofeedstock crops. Biofeedstocks produced from these marginal lands could be converted to biofuels that contributed 14 to 25 % of the 132 billion liter biofuel goals set by the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) 2007. The model simulation results indicated that producing perennial biofeedstock crops on marginal land would reduce annual stream flow by 20 % and 29 % and sediment load by 26 % to 35 % at the watershed outlet. The reduction was less during the <b>establishment</b> <b>periods</b> of perennial grasses (first 2 to 3 years of switchgrass and 2 to 4 years of Miscanthus) than during the post <b>establishment</b> <b>periods.</b> ^ The results of this study indicated that marginal land in the UMRB region could be a viable choice of land resources for biofuel development and could be used to produce almost one quarter of biofuel production goals. At the same time, water quality in the watershed could be improved. The information could be used by stakeholders to create regional biofuel development and watershed management plans. ...|$|R

CPA permits up to a 20 -year planning horizon and uses the economic concepts of net present value, annual equivalence, and internal rate of return to analyze the potential profitability of a given enterprise. CPA also analyzes the financial feasibility of potential investments by generating annual net cash flows.

50|$|Ordu Mixed squad, {{composed}} of capable football players {{of these three}} teams, including Kara Ali, participated in the 1966 Turkish Junior Championship which was held in Mersin. The good play of the team and the second prize won in the competition made Mr. Orhan Şeref Apak, then-current President of the Turkish Football Federation, excited.As such, Apak stated to Kara Ali, the star of Ordu Mixed squad, that he wished to see Orduspor in the Turkish Second League and instructed for necessary action to be taken.

Very few people know that Mr. Ali Ataoğlu who was also serving as the Physical Training Regional Manager, received loan from the bank in his name {{for the purpose of}} using for Orduspor. Club managers of Ordugücü, Karadeniz İdman Yurdu, Yolaçspor, 19 Eylül and Ocakspor gathered at the Public Training Center and decided to unite and reorganize into one club and thus the foundations of Orduspor were laid. After long discussions on colors and logo, purple and white were chosen as the club colors and nut was chosen as the emblem of Orduspor. The color purple symbolizes passion and white represents honor.On 8 March 1967 the Temporary Board of Directors, Registrars and Auditors of Orduspor met at Çarşamba Karlıbel Office building and made the appointments. Instead of Ali Ataoğlu who could not hold the office of president due to being a public servant, İbrahim Köksal was elected as the first president of Ordu Sports Club.

The ministers, senators, members of parliament sharing this joy, in a convoy of nearly 100 vehicles passed through Ünye, Fatsa and Perşembe districts and entered the city under intense enthusiasm of the people and welcomed with flowers and cheers.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} fire severity and environmental conditions on conifer tree regeneration 1 1 years after an autumn wildfire in the western Oregon Cascade Range. Conifer tree seedlings, including those of Pseudotsuga menziesii, established promptly and at high densities following fire, in contrast to long <b>establishment</b> <b>periods</b> documented for many other sites. f? menziesii, Tsuga heterophylla and Thujaplicata comprised 99. 0 % of the seedlings measured in the study. Pseudotsuga seedling density was greater on sites that had burned with moderate and high severity compared to low fire severity. Tsuga seedling density was greater on north aspects than on south aspects. Tsuga and Thuja seedling densities were correlated with pre-fire conspecific basal area. Coexistence of the three principal conifer species was more likely on sites that burned with moderate severity. We attribute the rapid initial establishment of Pseudotsuga observed in this study to the persistence of a canopy seed bank-a biological legacy not normally associated with Pseudotsuga forests.

40|$|The {{process of}} the {{vegetation}} development on glacier moraines was surveyed in the lower stream area of Oobloyah Valley (80 ° 502 ̆ 7 N, 82 ° 452 ̆ 7 W), Ellesmere Island, high arctic Canada. Four glacier moraines, and an outwash plane with different <b>establishment</b> <b>periods</b> in the proglacial field of Arklio Glacier, were surveyed. The oldest moraine was estimated to have been established during the Full Glacial, ca. 25000 - 35000 years ago, and the youngest one during the Little Ice Age, ca. 250 years ago. The vegetation properties such as number of species per study plot, cover of vegetation, lichens and bryophytes showed constant increase the moraine age, suggesting directional vegetation development. Changes in the species composition were such that new species successively appeared during {{the establishment of the}} moraines without obvious replacement of the species. It was concluded that the manner of the vegetation development was directional-nonreplacement succession even under extreme high arctic environment, differing from the generally accepted view that under an extreme high arctic environment nondirectional-nonreplacement succession prevails. Vegetation physiognomy approached Cassiope tetragona-dominated dwarf shrub heath, which generally prevails in more southern regions than Ellesmere Island.

40|$|Perennial crop {{production}} is inherently dynamic due to several salient physical characteristics including an <b>establishment</b> <b>period</b> of several years, long lives in commercial production, and path-dependence of yields on input use and other exogenous {{factors such as}} weather.
