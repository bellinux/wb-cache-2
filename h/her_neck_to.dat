5|$|She is a {{supporter}} of the United States Democratic Party and the British Labour Party. Throughout her career, Lansbury supported a variety of charities, particularly those such as Abused Wives in Crisis that combated domestic abuse and those who worked toward rehabilitating drug users. In the 1980s, she began to support a number of charities engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In early life she had been a chain smoker, giving up the addiction cold turkey in the mid-1960s. In 1976 and 1987 she had cosmetic surgery on <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> prevent it from broadening with age, but has stated that she has not had surgery to make her face look younger. During the 1990s, she began to suffer from arthritis, in May 1994 had hip replacement surgery, and in 2005 had knee replacement surgery.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Five – Advice from a Caterpillar: The Caterpillar {{questions}} Alice and {{she admits}} to her current identity crisis, compounded by {{her inability to}} remember a poem. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that {{one side of the}} mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 1676, Malin Matsdotter {{was judged}} guilty as charged by a {{unanimous}} court on the testimonies {{of her daughters}} and sentenced to be executed. The method of execution {{was the subject of}} debate in the royal witchcraft commission, who was to decide between three alternatives; the first was the customary execution by decapitation followed by public burning of the corpse; the second was that she would be subjected to torture prior to the first alternative; and she third alternative was the she would be executed by being burned alive. The last alternative was given the majority vote. The clerical commissioner Carolinus stated in his vote that the honor of God should be regarded before the personal pain of Malin and that she should be given a taste of what was awaiting her in Hell after having seduced so many souls to Satan; commissioners Ivar and Noreus motivated their vote by the deterring effect such a method would have upon the public and her accomplices, and commissioner doctor Urban Hjärne suggested that she be tortured with hot iron prior to the execution, which would make her unconscious and unable to feel pain, because her death would otherwise be too cruel, but the suggestion was revoked with the view, expressed by a priest, that the honour of the name of God was more important than Malin's personal experience of pain; the method was also deemed necessary as an example to the public and to her accomplices. She was instead to have a bag of gunpowder secured around <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> make her death quicker.|$|E

The paramedics tore away the green sweater where the bleeding was taking place and applied a Vaseline gauze to Selena's wound, which stopped the surface bleeding. Selena's heartbeat was now very slow; a paramedic performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation to keep her blood circulating. Paramedic Richard Fredrickson said [...] "it was too late" [...] {{when he arrived in}} the lobby. He found a [...] "thick [...] from <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> her knees, all the way around on both sides [...] ". Fredrickson could not locate a pulse; when he placed his fingers on her neck, he felt only muscle twitches.|$|E
500|$|In his defence, Tabak {{claimed that}} the killing had not been sexually motivated, and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed {{when he tried to}} kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a [...] "flirty comment" [...] and invited him to drink with her. He said that after she screamed he held his hands over her mouth and around <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> silence her. He denied {{suggestions}} of a struggle, claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and [...] "... for about 20 seconds". He told the court that after dumping the body he was [...] "... in a state of panic".|$|E
500|$|The coroner's {{report came}} to light in The National Archives in 2008 and is {{compatible}} with an accidental fall as well as suicide or other violence.

To account for such oddities and evidence that she was ill, it was suggested in 1956 by Ian Aird, a professor of medicine, that Amy Dudley might have suffered from breast cancer, which through metastatic cancerous deposits in the spine, could have caused <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> break under only limited strain, such as a short fall or even just coming down the stairs.

500|$|Fuse found Athena {{difficult}} to design, {{due to her}} being both an assistant to Phoenix and Apollo, and a strong-willed attorney who wants to prove her capabilities in court. He designed her hairstyle based on how she would be standing on the left of Phoenix or Apollo when assisting them, making sure that it looked good from that perspective. He also created the hairstyle {{to be able to}} convey Athena's enthusiasm and energy through its movements. He gave Athena the little gadget named Widget, that hangs around <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>to</b> visually represent the mood matrix. As they wanted other characters {{to be able to see}} the mood matrix, it was decided to make Widget project the mood matrix as a hologram. The mood matrix itself, which needed to represent people's mental state visually, was a challenge for the art team. They eventually decided to use the vastness of outer space and the Earth in the design, and ended up using a portable planetarium as the base motif. This also influenced the mood matrix background music, which Fuse described as having an [...] "outer space feel".|$|E

When her daughter cried out and appealed to her to admit her crimes [...] "Malin delivered her daughter {{in the hands of}} the Devil and cursed her for eternity". The daughter in question would have been Maria Eriksdotter, as Anna Eriksdotter was herself in arrest as the time. The execution in itself was described: [...] "But though all of this was both horrifying and pathetic to look upon, those who suffered death did not shed one tear but stood by their standpoint of innocence with an unnatural courage". [...] Tradition claims that Malin Matsdotter did not scream but died in silence, in accordance with contemporary view that witches felt no pain.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West become {{involved}} in planning the coronation of Rezā Khan, and {{got to know the}} six-year old Crown Prince Mohammad Reza fairly well. She noted how the Persian court were obsessed with attempting to ensure the coronation was up to European standards and remarked [...] "there was no point, however humble, on which they would not consult their British friends", with their guidebook being a copy of [...] "the proceedings at Westminster Abbey for the Coronation of His Majesty George V". Much to her amusement, Sackville-West was asked by one Persian minister what a [...] "Rougedragon Poursuivant" [...] was, believing it was a type of animal. On the coronation day, Sackville described waking up to a [...] "Tehran spruce and furnished beyond recognition". At the Golestan Palace, the throne room which housed the fabled Peacock Throne had been [...] "repainted, the garden paved, such breaches in the walls as revealed the presence of rubbish-heaps were to be filled up". Observing the coronation of Rezā Khan upon the Peacock Throne, Sackville-West referred to the Shia clergymen as a [...] "bevy of bearded old men in long robes and turbans" [...] who appeared like the [...] "baleful chorus of a Greek play". Sackville-West noted that everyone seemed to dislike the Shia clerics and kept a distance from them. Rezā Khan was due to enter the throne room of the Golestan Palace at precisely 3 pm for the coronation, but Sackville-West noted how everyone become tense when the shah was half an hour late, which caused alarm as Rezā Khan was well known for his punctuality and had his ministers flogged if they were late to cabinet meetings. Finally, the main doors opened and in marched Rezā Khan, dressed in his finest uniform and wearing a blue clock, and everyone fell silent. Despite her disdain for the Persian monarchy as [...] "absurd", Sackville-West found the coronation captivating as she found herself craning <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> see Rezā Khan march up to the Peacock Throne. Walking besides him was his son, the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza, who she wrote was [...] "frightened, possessed himself of a corner of his father's clock". Finally, Sackville-West noted that Rezā Khan crowned himself. In her account of her visit to the former capital of Isfahan to see the Safavid palaces, Sackville-West's repeated use of the word [...] "we" [...] is misleading as it suggests that only Nicolson accompanied her to Isfahan, when in fact, Raymond Mortimer, her husband's lover also traveled in the same car with them.|$|E
