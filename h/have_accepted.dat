5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> these numbers, {{especially since}} the ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point. Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 being seen {{as more of a}} reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{the fleet}} sent by Darius {{consisted}} of 600 triremes. There {{is no indication}} in the historical sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during Xerxes's invasion in 480 BC. Among modern historians, some <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> this number of ships as reasonable; {{it has been suggested}} either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport ships, or that there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes.|$|E

5|$|As {{a member}} of the old Conservative {{government}} Cave left office on 23 January 1924. He was replaced by Lord Haldane, who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January. Haldane was in favour of the creation of a Ministry of Justice, and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under his control as the Lord Chancellor's Office was. Haldane was ill, however, and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter, and no large-scale reforms such as the creation of a Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through.|$|E

5|$|Béla was crowned king {{at least}} {{two months after the}} death of Stephen II, {{implying}} that his accession to the throne did not happen without opposition. Two violent purges were carried out among the partisans of his predecessors to strengthen Béla's rule. King Coloman's alleged son Boris tried to dethrone Béla but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of Béla's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. Bosnia and Split seem to <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> Béla's suzerainty around 1136.|$|E

5|$|His {{place in}} the genealogical {{tradition}} of the MacDonalds is the only reason for believing in his existence, a genealogical tradition that not all historians <b>have</b> <b>accepted.</b> Beyond his actual existence, there is little that is certain. Three entries in Irish annals may discuss him, though he is never named; a praise poem surviving from the Early Modern period may be descended from a poem originally written for him; a miracle in a Manx chronicle {{may or may not}} have Domhnall as its subject; and a doubtful charter surviving from a similarly late era was allegedly issued by him.|$|E

He later claimed to <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. Because he was not charged, he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E
5|$|Tham sees Yah {{as being}} a good match for Tono in personality, as she shows a {{willingness}} {{to serve as the}} traditional wife. The American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling writes that Yah's employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by Pane to cultural constraints; Indonesian readers at the time would not <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> Tono having an affair with someone of the same socio-economic status. Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok could tell the same story; he found her touching without being melodramatic, and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work.|$|E
5|$|The freeway segment {{northwest}} of Wyoming Avenue {{to the county}} line was previously known as James Couzens Highway after the street it replaced. That street was named {{after the death of}} James J. Couzens. Couzens was a former Commissioner of Detroit's Department of Street Railways from 1913 through 1915, after which he served as Police Commissioner from 1916 until 1918. He was Mayor of Detroit from 1919 until 1922 and United States Senator from Michigan from 1922 until his death on October 22, 1936. During his years of public service, he is said not to <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> a salary, giving it all to charity. After his death, Detroit renamed its section of Northwestern Highway after Couzens.|$|E

5|$|These {{numbers are}} (by ancient standards) consistent, {{and this could}} be {{interpreted}} that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis. Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number1,207 being seen {{as more of a}} reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliadand generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Until {{recently}} historians <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> {{an account}} of the time that Tecumseh was furious with Tenskwatawa for losing the battle, and that Tecumseh had threatened to kill his brother for making the attack. According to this story, the Prophet lost prestige after the battle and no longer served as a leader of the confederacy. In their subsequent meetings with Harrison, several Native leaders claimed that the Prophet's influence was destroyed; some accounts said that he was being persecuted by other leaders. Historians Alfred A. Cave and Robert Owens have argued that the Natives were probably trying to mislead Harrison, in an attempt to calm the situation, and that Tenskwatawa continued {{to play an important role}} in the confederacy.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historian}} Doukas, {{on the morning}} of 29 May 1453, the small postern called Kerkoporta was left open by accident, allowing the first fifty or so Ottoman troops to enter the city. The Ottomans raised their banner atop the Inner Wall and opened fire on the Greek defenders of the peribolos below. This spread panic, beginning the rout of the defenders and leading to the fall of the city. In 1864, the remains of a postern located on the Outer Wall {{at the end of the}} Theodosian Walls, between tower 96 and the so-called Palace of the Porphyrogenitus, were discovered and identified with the Kerkoporta by the Greek scholar A.G. Paspates. Later historians, like van Millingen and Steven Runciman <b>have</b> <b>accepted</b> this theory as well. However, excavations at the site have uncovered no evidence of a corresponding gate in the Inner Wall (now vanished) in that area, and it may be that Doukas' story is either invention or derived from an earlier legend concerning the Xylokerkos Gate, which several earlier scholars also equated with the Kerkoporta.|$|E
