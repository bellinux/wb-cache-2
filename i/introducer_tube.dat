500|$|The Eschmann {{tracheal}} <b>tube</b> <b>introducer</b> (often incorrectly {{referred to}} as a [...] "gum elastic bougie") is specialized type of stylet used to facilitate difficult intubation. This flexible device is [...] in length, 15 French (5mm diameter) with a small [...] "hockey-stick" [...] angle at the far end. Unlike a traditional intubating stylet, the Eschmann tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>introducer</b> is typically inserted directly into the trachea and then used as a guide over which the endotracheal tube can be passed (in a manner analogous to the Seldinger technique). As the Eschmann tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>introducer</b> is considerably less rigid than a conventional stylet, this technique {{is considered to be a}} relatively atraumatic means of tracheal intubation.|$|R
25|$|Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) {{achieved}} significant {{advances in}} techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943.

The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was , which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35° curved tip, permitting it to be steered around obstacles.|$|R

40|$|Tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>introducers</b> and stylets {{are highly}} {{successful}} devices {{for the management}} of various airway scenarios. Their first-line use is advocated in many difficult airway algorithms. Although they have been used for decades, the shape and design of introducers and stylets as well as their patterns of use are constantly evolving. Our purpose is to provide the clinician with an update on these different devices. We performed a systematic literature search from 2005 until May 2015, without language restrictions. The two authors independently retrieved all studies with the keywords "bougie", "gum elastic bougie", "stylet", "airway management", "tracheal tube introducer" and "extubation catheter". Our search did yield mostly observational and retrospective studies with small case numbers. The data was synthesized into a narrative review to provide the clinician with an update on the characteristics, indications and techniques of use as well as the dangers of different intubation aids. Today, numerous tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>introducers</b> and stylets exist with different indications, ranging from general to specific situations. Anesthetists should be familiar with the different devices, their characteristics and indications in order to use the right device at the right time in the right way...|$|R

We employed an <b>introducer</b> and <b>tubes</b> that were designed and adapted to solve specific problems of dilatation and intubation. Adequate tube functioning was obtained in 95 % of the patients, {{despite the fact that}} we treated some who had been previously considered to be unsuitable candidates. Complications were severe bleeding (1 %), perforation (7 %), early migration (15 %), late migration (8 %), obstruction (6 %), and pressure necrosis (3 %). The mortality rate due to the procedure was 4 %. In general, marked improvement of the quality of life was obtained. Mean survival time was 113 day...|$|R

30|$|Several reports {{state that}} most cases of {{anesthesia}} mumps resolve spontaneously with follow-up observation alone, {{it has been}} considered that rehydration therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs if needed are sufficient to treat it [1, 2]. However, there may be cases, such as the present case, in which patients suffer from severe complications, including upper airway obstruction [9, 10]. In our patient, the combined approach of a video laryngoscope and a gum elastic bougie <b>tube</b> <b>introducer</b> resulted in a successful re-intubation {{without the need for}} tracheostomy. Emergency tracheostomy might be often chosen because of difficult mask ventilation and the possibility of intubation difficulty for postoperative dyspnea and acute airway obstruction [10]. However, in cases involving massive edema and swelling of the neck, it is difficult to identify the location of the tracheostomy. Video laryngoscopes could well become the standard procedure for these types of patients who need emergency tracheal intubation. Hence, additional measures to treat these conditions are required, and conscientious follow-up observation is necessary.|$|R

The first clinician failed to either pass the Frova introducer or railroad the tube in six (3 %) and 10 (5 %) of the 203 patients respectively. The success rate by the first clinician was significantly influenced by the laryngeal view obtained (p < 0. 0001). There was only one failure to place the Frova introducer in the trachea by either the first or second clinician. Airway trauma was detected in 11 / 203 (5 %) patients. In six of these 11 patients blood was detected on tracheal suction; ‘distal hold up’ was elicited in five of these six.

40|$|IntroductionThe failed or {{difficult}} airway is a rare, but life-threatening situation. Alternative airway devices to direct laryngoscopy are essential aids to manage these scenarios successfully. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine which alternative airway devices are currently available in public emergency centres in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted in 15 emergency centres. Data regarding the availability of different classes of alternative airway devices were documented on a standardised data collection sheet by a single investigator via direct observation. Incomplete or non-functional equipment was classified as unavailable. Summary statistics were used to describe the data. ResultsTwenty-six different types of alternative airway devices were documented. Three centres (20 %) had no alternative airway device. Five centres (33. 3 %) stocked only one device, three centres (20 %) had two devices and four centres (26. 7 %) had more than two devices. Most centres (n= 12, 80 %) stocked supraglottic airways (only one centre (6. 7 %) had paediatric sizes). Tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>introducers</b> were available in five centres (33. 3 %). Four centres (26. 7 %) had video-laryngoscopes, but none had optical laryngoscopes. Retroglottic devices and needle cricothyroidotomy equipment were available in two centres (13. 3 %). Although surgical cricothyroidotomy equipment was available, the equipment was widely dispersed and only three centres (20 %) had pre-packed sets available. None of the specialised paediatric centres had needle cricothyroidotomy equipment readily available. DiscussionThe study demonstrated that Western Cape public emergency centres are currently inadequately stocked with regard to alternative airway devices. A guideline regarding the procurement and implementation of these devices is needed...|$|R
40|$|Study Objective: Laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) {{are often}} used as airway rescue devices where {{laryngoscopy}} is difficult. The LMA does not protect the airway and is preferably replaced with a cuffed endotracheal tube. There are reports of cases where an Eschmann tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>introducer</b> (ETTI) was successfully used to bridge between a standard LMA and an endotracheal tube. This project was designed to determine whether an Eschmann stylet can reliably be passed through an LMA into the trachea {{as a means of}} rescue intubation. Methods: Nineteen emergency medicine residents and attending physicians, who were participants in a cadaveric airway course, placed and inflated a size 4 LMA (The Laryngeal Mask Company Ltd., San Diego, CA) on each of six unembalmed human cadavers in the usual fashion. They then attempted to pass a lubricated, 15 Fr, reusable, coude-tipped ETTI (Portex, Smiths Medical, Keene, NH)) through the airspace/handle of the inflated LMA. The LMA was then deflated and removed while the ETTI was held in place. Investigators then determined the location of the ETTI by laryngoscopy. Results: Of 114 attempts at the rescue procedure, 59 resulted in placement of the bougie into the trachea, yielding an overall success rate of 52 % (95 % CI 48 %- 56 %). There {{were no significant differences in}} performance based on level of training of residents or years of experience of attending physicians. Conclusions: While not a primary difficult airway option, the use of a ETTI as a bridge device between LMA and endotracheal tube was successful about 50 % of the time.

5000|$|The pre-hospital setting {{provides}} unique {{challenges to}} {{management of the}} airway including tight spaces, neck immobilization, poor lighting, and often the added complexity of attempting procedures during transport. When possible, basic airway management should be prioritized including head-tilt-chin-lift maneuvers, and bag-valve masking. If ineffective, a supraglottic airway can be utilized to aid in oxygenation and maintenance of a patent airway. An oropharyngeal airway is acceptable, however nasopharyngeal airways should be avoided in trauma, particularly if a basilar skull fracture is suspected. Endotracheal intubation carries with it many risks, particularly when paralytics are used, as maintenance of the airway becomes a challenge if intubation fails. It should therefore be attempted by experienced personnel, only when less invasive methods fail or when it is deemed necessary for safe transport of the patient, to reduce risk of failure and the associated increase in morbidity and mortality due to hypoxia.Management of the airway in the emergency department is optimal given the presence of trained personnel from multiple specialties, as well as access to [...] "difficult airway equipment" [...] (videolaryngoscopy, eschmann tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>introducer,</b> fiberoptic bronchoscopy, surgical methods, etc.). Of primary concern is the condition and patency of the maxillofacial structures, larynx, trachea, and bronchi as these are all components of the respiratory tract and failure anywhere along this path may impede ventilation. Excessive facial hair, severe burns, and maxillofacial trauma may prevent acquisition of a good mask seal, rendering bag-valve mask ventilation difficult. Edema of the airway can make laryngoscopy difficult, and therefore in those with suspected thermal burns, intubation is recommended in attempts to quickly secure an airway prior to progression of the swelling. Furthermore, blood and vomitus in the airway may prove visualization of the vocal cords difficult rendering direct and video laryngoscopy, as well as fiberoptic bronchoscopy challenging. Establishment of a surgical airway is challenging {{in the setting of}} restricted neck extension (such as in a c-collar), laryngotracheal disruption, or distortion of the anatomy by a penetrating force or hematoma. Tracheotomy in the operating room by trained professionals is recommended over cricothyroidotomy in the case of complete laryngotracheal disruption or {{children under the age of}} 12.|$|R
