40|$|The {{quantitative}} determination of volatile compounds of Chardonnay wines using HS-SPME-GC × GC/TOFMS {{along with the}} determination of odor activity value (OAV) and relative odor contribution (ROC) of volatiles are reported for the first time. The use of GC × GC/TOFMS {{for the analysis of}} Chardonnay wine of Serra Gaucha resulted in the tentative identification of 243 compounds, showing the superior performance of this analytical technique for this specific varietal wine, considering that the number of compounds usually separated by 1 D-GC for this type of wine is lower. Furthermore, 42 compounds co-eluted in the first dimension and 34 of them were separated in the second dimension, while the others were resolved by spectral deconvolution (8), which indicates that the conventional 1 D-GC/MS may result in misleading results. The calculation of OAV and ROC allowed the determination of the volatile compounds that presented the greater contribution to wine aroma. Ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl butanoate, and beta-damascenone showed the highest OAV and ROC values, although other 43 compounds showed also potential to contribute to wine aroma.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} Sauternes wine aromas. In all wine extracts, polyfunctional thiols were revealed to have a huge impact. A very strong bacon-petroleum odor emerged at RI = 845 from a CP-Sil 5 -CB column. Two thiols proved {{to participate in this}} perception: 3 -methyl- 3 -sulfanylbutanal and 2 -methylfuran- 3 -thiol. A strong synergetic effect was evidenced between the two compounds.

40|$|A {{modification}} of the Dubinin-Radushkevich pore filling model by incorporation of the repulsive contribution to the pore potential, and of bulk non-ideality, is proposed in this paper for characterization of activated carbon using liquid phase adsorption. For this purpose experiments have been performed using ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> as adsorbates and the microporous-mesoporous activated carbons Filtrasorb 400, Norit ROW 0. 8 and Norit ROX 0. 8 as adsorbents. The repulsive contribution to the pore potential is incorporated through a Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential model, and the bulk-liquid phase non-ideality through the UNIFAC activity coefficient model. For the characterization of activated carbons, the generalized adsorption isotherm is utilized with a bimodal gamma function as the pore size distribution function. It is found that the model can represent the experimental data very well, and significantly better than when the classical energy-size relationship is used, or when bulk non-ideality is neglected. Excellent agreement between the bimodal gamma pore size distribution and DFT-cum-regularization based pore size distribution is also observed, supporting {{the validity of the}} proposed model.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} nomenclature for the aliphatic compounds {{especially the}} saturated hydrocarbons {{has been defined}} and applied to all esters reported in this dissertation. It can be shown that with the redefined nomenclature each conformer can be easily identified by name and since the conformational information {{is included in the}} notation it is also effective to indicate directly the geometry of the respective conformer. Totally four acetic acid esters (isoamyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, and methyl acetate), one isotopomer of the methyl acetate (methyl acetate-d 3 with an acetyl CD 3 rotor), <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> and ethyl butyrate were studied and reported in this dissertation. Supplemented by quantum chemical calculations, Molecular Beam Fourier Transform Micorawave (MB FTMW) spectroscopy is an outstanding method to study the structure and dynamics of these esters. In the study the MP 2 method with a basis set 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) was commonly used to optimize the geometries of the esters. Only in some cases the DFT calculations (B 3 LYP) were necessary, especially for esters with quite low vibrational energies such as found around the C-C bond (which is directly attached to the double bonded oxygen atom) of the <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate.</b> By analyzing the structures of the esters, it can be concluded that all esters are near prolate tops. The essential molecular constants such as the rotational constants A, B, and C and the centrifugal distortion constants DJ, DJK, DK, dj, and dk of all esters could be determined. The programs XIAM and BELGI were used for the global fit of the spectrum. Besides these constants the hindering barriers of the methyl tops are essential dynamical information of the molecules. All acetic acid esters seem to have similar internal torsion barriers for the acetyl methyl rotor which are all about 100 cm^- 1. Methyl acetate has one internal methyl rotor more than the other acetic acid esters which is attached to the single bonded oxygen atom (methoxyl group). For this methyl rotor a hindering barrier of 422 cm^- 1 was determined. Methyl acetate-d 3 with an acetyl CD 3 rotor was also investigated. From the spectroscopic results a hindering barrier for the methoxyl top of 422 cm^- 1 was found (which is the same height as it is found in methyl acetate). Finally, it has also been shown that nature does not prefer the antiperiplanar arrangements of the carbon atoms or CS symmetry in esters. Also the theoretical calculations always predict the esters with CS symmetry to be higher in energy. Moreover, this finding is also supported by the fact that most observed conformers in the microwave spectrum do not have any symmetry plane. Some conformers with CS symmetry might be observed under molecular beam conditions, but the intensities of the spectra were clearly weaker than those of the conformers with no symmetry planes...|$|E

40|$|Within {{this work}} the control {{software}} of a molecular beam FT microwave spectrometer {{has been developed}} and some fruit esters have been studied by microwave spectroscopy. With the spectrometer broad band scans can be performed and highly resolved measurements at certain frequencies can be carried out. The program package developed has a modular structure {{in order to allow}} for easy changes within the individual modules. Moreover, a user-friendly program surface has been developed. The individual hardware components of the spectrometer were controlled via a timer/counter board. This board allowed for short allocation times (a few ns) and enabled phase synchronous repetition of the experiment. When the control software of the fast A/D converter (up to 100 MS/s) was developed it was found, that the start of the recording showed some jitter with respect to the trigger signal. This problem has been solved by a special hard and software. The biggest disadvantage of the spectrometer is its narrow bandwidth due to the big quality factor of the resonator and the long time needed for sampling a broad frequency range. Within the spectroscopic part of this work some fruit esters (<b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> ethyl butyrate, isoamyl acetate, and ethyl acetate) were studied by microwave spectroscopy. These molecules are relatively large for microwave spectroscopy, but their vapour pressure turned out to be sufficient to observe them in the gas phase. At the beginning of the investigations broad band scans were carried out and the lines found were remeasured at high resolution. As a result of such an analysis the rotational constants of the respective molecules were obtained and compared with the quantum chemical predictions. When methyl internal rotation was observed, also the angles of the internal rotor axis with respect to the principal axes could be compared. In the case of <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> the analysis of the broadband scan yielded the rotational constants of one conformer. Some c-type transitions could be observed, thus a significant dipole moment component in c direction is present. By ab initio calculations a conformer was predicted which was in agreement with the observed rotational constants, however it showed up a mirror plane perpendicular to the c axis. This would cause a zero dipole moment in c direction which is in contradiction to the experimental results. In this case future ab initio calculations are necessary to find a geometry which is in agreement with the experimentally observed conformer. In the case of ethyl butyrate the evaluation of the spectrum yielded two sets of rotational constants which allowed an unambiguous assignment of two different conformers. Both conformers (EBU- 1 and EBU- 2) are near prolate tops. Isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate showed splittings due to low barrier internal rotation. In both cases the internal rotor is a methyl group. For each substance one conformer was found. The barrier to internal rotation was very close to 100 cm- 1 for both molecules.

A control wine in which MLF was suppressed was included. The MLF progress was monitored by use of infrared spectroscopy. Gas chromatographic analysis and capillary electrophoresis were {{used to evaluate the}} volatile aroma composition and organic acid profiles, respectively. Significant strain-specific variations were observed in the degradation of citric acid and production of lactic acid during MLF. Subsequently, compounds directly and indirectly resulting from citric acid metabolism, namely diacetyl, acetic acid, acetoin, and ethyl lactate, were also affected depending on the bacterial strain used for MLF. Bacterial metabolic activity increased concentrations of the higher alcohols, fatty acids, and total esters, with a larger increase in ethyl esters than in acetate esters. Ethyl lactate, diethyl succinate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl 2 -methylpropanoate, and ethyl propionate concentrations were increased by MLF. In contrast, levels of hexyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, 2 -phenylethyl acetate, and ethyl acetate were reduced or remained unchanged, depending on the strain and cultivar evaluated. Formation of ethyl butyrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl 2 methylbutryate, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> was related to specific bacterial strains used, indicating possible differences in esterase activity.

Alternatively; if the aroma profiles are re-evaluated by summing odor activity values (ΣOAV); four ester compounds ((1) ethyl butyrate (6, 160); (2) ethyl hexanoate (3, 608); (3) <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> (1, 592); and (4) ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate (942)) were identified as the key constituents of fresh strawberry aroma (SRD- 0). As the strawberries began to decay; isobutyl alcohol recorded the maximum OAV of 114 (relative proportion (RP) (SRD = 6) = 58. 3 %). However, as the decay process continued, the total OAV dropped further by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude—decreasing to 196 on SRD = 6 to 7. 37 on SRD = 9. The overall {{results of this study}} confirm dramatic changes in the aroma profile of strawberries over time, especially with the onset of decay...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The malty flavor defect {{produced}} by Streptococcus lactis var. maltigenes {{has been the}} cause of considerable economic distress to various segments of the dairy industry. This {{study was conducted in}} order to develop a more thorough understanding of the chemical nature of this defect, and to formulate a synthetic malty flavor preparation. An 18 hour malty culture and an acidified heated skim milk control were steam distilled using a specially designed, low temperature, reduced pressure glass apparatus fitted with ground glass ball or standard taper joints. After subsequent ethyl ether extractions, the aqueous distillates yielded flavor concentrates which were suitable for gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) and mass spectrometric analysis. Flavor component identifications were made on both a tentative and positive basis. Tentative identifications were made using the technique of GLC relative retention times. Identifications were considered positive when GLC retention data could be coupled with mass spectral data. Compounds positively identified as being present in the malty culture included acetaldehyde, 3 -methylbutanal, phenylacetaldehyde, ethanol, butanol, 2 -methylpropanol, 3 -methylbutanol, 2 -furfurol, phenethyl alcohol, acetone, butanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> ethyl octanoate, isoamyl acetate and toluene. Compounds tentatively identified included 2 -methylpropanal, pentanal, benzaldehyde, 2 -furfural, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl acetate, γ-octalactone, δ-octalactone, formic acid and acetic acid. In the heated skim milk control, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl acetate and methyl chloride were positively identified while pentanal, hexanal, octanal, nonanal, 2 -hexanone, 2 -octanone, ethyl formate, ethyl octanoate, methyl acetate, γ-octalactone and δ-octalactone remained as tentative identifications. Quantitative evaluations of the volatile constituents present in each of four strains of the malty culture were conducted using a gas entrainment, on-column trapping, GLC technique. From the quantitative data obtained from a 24 hour S. lactis var. maltigenes L/M- 20 culture, a synthetic malty flavor preparation, suitable for use in baked foods, was developed. This investigation used biscuits as a model system for the baking studies. The biscuits were prepared using the General Mills' Bisquick mix and a malty milk preparation replaced the normal milk requirement. The milk contained 1. 70 p. p. m. acetaldehyde, 34. 20 p. p. m. 3 -methylbutanal, 17. 90 p. p. m. 2 -methylpropanolr 90. 10 p. p. m. 3 -methylbutanol and 10. 00 p. p. m. diacetyl...|$|E
40|$|The plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), {{is a major}} pest {{of stone}} and pome fruit in eastern North America. I {{determined}} generalized olfactory and visual cues guiding plum curculios to host plants {{as a first step}} {{in the creation of a}} reliable monitoring trap for this important tree fruit pest. ^ Olfactory attraction of overwintered adults to volatiles from extracts of McIntosh apple tissues was evaluated in the laboratory using a still-air dual choice bioassay system to determine the most attractive odor sources. For hexane-extracted or water-extracted volatiles from McIntosh apple tissues (twigs, leaves or fruit) at seven phenological stages of development (pink through 5 weeks after bloom), greatest numerical responses were recorded to volatiles from extracts made between bloom and 2 weeks after bloom. ^ This same laboratory bioassay system was used to evaluate the influence of barometric pressure on degree of olfactory discrimination by adult females; response indices used as a measure of discrimination were significantly and positively correlated with barometric pressure. ^ Olfactory attraction of overwintered adults to individual volatile components of unripe plum odor was evaluated in the laboratory and in the field using baited boll weevil traps placed on the ground beneath the canopy of unsprayed apple trees. Two compounds, <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate</b> and limonene, were significantly attractive in both laboratory bioassays and field experiments. ^ Olfactory attraction of overwintered adults to volatiles released from same- and opposite-sex conspecifics alone, synthetic grandisoic acid alone, wild plums alone, or combinations of live single-sex conspecifics or grandisoic acid with plums was observed in the laboratory. Females may produce a sex pheromone attractive to males, but in general both male and females were strongly attracted to host plum volatiles and only mildly attracted to conspecific odors or synthetic grandisoic acid, with little evidence for synergy or enhancement of host plum odors when combined with conspecific odors or synthetic grandisoic acid. ^ Laboratory, semifield, and field experiments were conducted to determine the most visually-stimulating and acceptable version of a branch-mimicking trap (PVC cylinder topped with an inverted screen funnel) to capture adults in the canopy of host fruit trees. Tall cylinder traps (50 cm tall x 6 cm diam) coated with flat black latex paint were significantly more visually stimulating than cylinder traps of lesser height and/or different diameter. Lining inverted screen funnels with paper cones and joining cylinders to inverted screen funnels with wooden inserts increased surface acceptability of traps. ^ I conclude that a reliable monitoring trap for adult plum curculios should be baited with attractive host fruit volatiles, and a trap placed in the canopy of fruit trees should include visual cues provided by a supernormal branch-mimicking cylinder. ...|$|E
40|$|There are {{significant}} correlations between amino acid (AA) concentrations in grape must and wine aroma compounds. Solar radiation and water availability factors can affect fruit AA concentration and therefore influence {{the evolution of}} aroma compounds during alcoholic fermentation. This thesis investigates the effects of altering grapevine UV-B exposure and water availability on wine aroma compounds, focussing {{on the role of}} AAs in the process. Pinot noir vines growing in the Lincoln University vineyard and own-rooted, potted Pinot noir vines growing in a glasshouse were use in this study. In the glasshouse, different UV-B (+UV and -UV) and irrigation (+W and -W) treatments were established from veraison. A field trial water deficit treatment was not able to be put in place due to rainfall events, but fully exposed fruit (LR) was compared to fruit shielded from UV-B using PETG screens erected over the fruiting zone (PETG) and fruit shielded from full sun using shadecloth (SC). As small amounts of fruit were available for this study, micro-vinifications of 160 g and 100 g for the field and glasshouse study, respectively, were applied. HPLC analysis of wine AAs indicated UV-B radiation significantly decreased total AA concentrations and most individual AAs by a range of 41 % to 93 %. Water deficit in the glasshouse study increased total and some individual AAs by a range of 56 % to 90 %. This provided a good basis on which to investigate impacts of fruit AAs on wine aroma compounds. SPME-GCMS analysis of wine showed that concentrations of higher alcohols, fatty acids, esters and norisoprenoids were related to the consumption of AAs during yeast fermentation. From the pattern of results it can be concluded that direct catabolism of AAs into aroma compounds is less likely than their having an indirect effect on aroma compounds formation during alcoholic fermentation. As relationships exist between AA consumption during fermentation and wine aroma compounds, the effects of UV-B and irrigation treatments on aroma compounds (via affecting grape AAs) deserved additional investigation. In the glasshouse trial higher alcohols, fatty acids, esters, monoterpenes and C 13 -norisoprenoids were affected. +UV decreased the concentration of phenylethyl alcohol, hexanoic acid, ethyl acetate, ethyl isobutyrate, ethyl butanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl decanoate, and isoamyl acetate in wine, but did not affect isoamyl alcohol. UV-B exposure increased the concentration of linalool and decreased that of citronellol. On the other hand, water deficit in the glasshouse experiment increased most esters. For the field experiment β-damascenone in wines was unaffected by LR and PETG, but decreased by SC. Principal Components Analysis showed distinct separation of treatments: for example -UV-W tended to be more dominated by compounds related to fruity and floral aromas. These results suggest sunlight (and thus UV-B) exposure and water deficit have direct effects on fruit AAs, which leads to significant differences in some wine aroma compounds. Moreover, UV-B radiation and water deficit combined had interactive effects on wine aromas. Based on these results, water deficit could amplify the positive effects of UV-B exclusion on the formation of aroma compounds...|$|E
40|$|Within {{this thesis}} {{different}} odorants and flavors were investigated {{using a combination}} of quantum chemical calculations and microwave spectroscopy in order to obtain an idea of the conformational variety and dynamics of the different molecules under molecular beam conditions, where in contrast to static gas conditions at room temperature only the lowest energy conformers are present. Four blackcurrant odorants and four ethyl esters were investigated by means of molecular beam Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The first part of this thesis is focused on different types of blackcurrant odorants. Since some of them possess quite a low vapor pressure, a novel method using a pipe cleaner as a sample carrier was developed. This technique was also applied to ethyl valerate, one of the fruit esters investigated within this work. After the experimental difficulties due to the low vapor pressure of some substance had been removed, the spectra were recorded and assigned. The experimental rotational constants were used to validate calculations on the lowest energy conformers carried out at different levels of theory. Thereby, an overview of suitable methods and basis sets was obtained. Altogether, four blackcurrant odorants were investigated, two synthetic odorants (Cassyrane and its dihydro derivative), which are used in perfumery, and two natural sulfur-containing compounds (cat ketone and cassis mercaptan), which contribute to the odor of cassis in nature. In each case the most abundant conformers were assigned and the experimental constants were used to validate the quantum chemical calculations. In the case of Cassyrane and its dihydro derivative, the structures of the most abundant diastereomers were determined. Although microwave spectroscopy has recently moved into solving the structures of sizeable molecules, this is the first approach to determine the gas phase structure of odorants and show the usefulness of this method for structure-odor correlations. In the case of the sulfurous odorants, a methyl groups with an intermediate and a high barrier to internal rotation was present in cat ketone and cassis mercaptan, respectively. The barriers to internal rotation were determined accurately using the xiam code. In the case of cat ketone, only one strong conformer was assigned, while in the case of cassis mercaptan two conformers were found in the molecular beam. By comparison with the conformers obtained by numerous quantum chemical calculations finally the geometries of the conformers observed in the molecular beam could be determined. Due to a large amplitude motion within Cat ketone the assignment of E species transitions could not be carried out within experimental accuracy. Attempts to fit the E species arising from the internal rotation of the methyl group failed using the programs xiam, Erham, and spfit (Pickett’s program). This indicates that still some aspects of the molecular physics are not yet included in the theoretical approach. The second part of the thesis is focused on valerianic ethyl ester (<b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate)</b> and its structural isomers ethyl pivalate, ethyl valerate, and 2 -methyl ethyl butyrate. The investigated fruit esters turned out to possess large amplitude motions, causing difficulties for the prediction of the theoretical geometries at different levels of theory. The correct geometry could therefore not be predicted properly using quantum chemical calculations. Here, the experimental data were crucial to estimate the quality of the theoretical calculations. Nevertheless, the theoretical rotational constants were used as an initial guess to assign the spectra. Although in the case of small aliphatic esters, the structures are probably less meaningful for structure-odor correlation than in the case of Cassyrane and its dihydro derivative, the presented results are important to develop theoretical approaches in fragrance research and to describe the nature of a given system. This information might also be important for the choice of force fields, when it comes to molecular dynamics approaches of receptor odorant binding. Furthermore, the results provide an important contribution to the structure of small esters, since there is surprisingly little known about their dynamics and geometry...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Wine {{volatile}} {{composition is}} one of the most important constitutes of wine quality, and it is greatly influenced by number of factors. The studies herein were conducted to evaluate the grape and wine aroma affected by different vine nutrient status, vigor and crop levels of Oregon Pinot noir. In the first study, aroma potentials in early and late maturity Pinot noir grapes were investigated in two consecutive vintages. The grape samples were hydrolyzed under acidic conditions and the released odorants were studied by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). Forty-nine main odor-active compounds were detected in the AEDA. The odorants released with high flavor dilution values were 1 -hexanal, β-damascenone, guaiacol and vanillin, together with C₆ aldehydes and alcohols, 4 -vinylguaiacol, 4 -vinylphenol and 1 -octen- 3 -one. The concentrations of aroma-active compounds were further quantitated by SPME-GC-MS and SBSE-GC-MS. Comparing with early harvest grapes, late harvest grapes released more β-damascenone, vanillin, 4 -vinylguaiacol and 4 -vinylphenol in both years according to both AEDA and quantitation results, suggesting they were important aroma compounds that contribute to the characteristic of mature Pinot noir grapes. The second study evaluated the volatile composition of grape berries subjected to varying levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) supply. Pinot noir grapevines were grown in a pot-in-pot system for three years (beginning when they were 4 -years-old) and fertigated with either complete nutrition (Control) or with reduced levels of either N, P, or K supply while holding all other nutrients constant. Nitrogen was varied from 7. 50 mM total N supply (Control) to 1. 13 mM in five discreet treatments, while P and K supply were each varied in four discreet treatments with the lowest rate of 0 mM during fertigation events. Aroma volatiles in berries were determined in each year using SPME-GC-MS technique. Results showed that reducing N supply resulted in lower concentrations of C₆ compounds and total β-damascenone in berries across all three years. Low N supply had little impact on monoterpenes. Reducing N supply resulted in higher bound form α-terpineol in two of the three years. Compared to P and K, N supply showed a more profound influence on the volatile profiles of the grape berries, indicating the important role of N in the biosynthesis of berry volatile and volatile precursors. The volatile composition of resulting wines from the same study was also investigated. Results showed that reducing N supply increased the total phenolic content in wine across all years. N supply has a profound impact on wine volatiles with the greatest effect on yeast-derived esters and higher alcohols. In general, reducing N supply decreased straight-chain esters and many straight chain alcohols, but increased the branched-chain esters, and phenethyl ester and phenethyl alcohol in wine across all years. The effect of N supply on monoterpenes in wine was not consistent from year to year. Low N wines also had reduced levels of volatile sulfur compounds in 2 of 3 years. Compared to the Control, reducing N and K supply resulted in lower quantities of total β-damascenone across all years. Altering P supply did not have reproducible effects on wine volatiles from year to year. The third study investigated the composition of Pinot noir wines produced from vines with varying vegetative vigor levels and two crop levels over three vintages (2011, 2012, and 2013) in the cool climate viticulture region of western Oregon. Wine was produced from grapes grown with two inter-row floor management treatments (tilled or grass) and two crop levels, including full crop and half crop achieved through cluster thinning. Crop thinning treatments didn’t alter the wine volatile composition. Certain wine volatiles were affected by the vineyard floor management treatments. Wines produced from grapes grown in the Grass treatment (lower vigor) had higher levels of grape-derived compounds such as α-terpineol, β-citronellol, vitispirane and TDN compared to wines produced from the Tilled treatment. Wines from Grass treatment also had higher isoamyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl isobutyrate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>isovalerate,</b> and phenethyl acetate but lower levels of linalool, 1 -propanol and 1 -octanol. A subproject of this study investigated the carotenoid breakdown and C₁₃-norisoprenoids synthesis in Pinot noir grapes from vines of differing vigor and crop levels (yield). Carotenoid degradation and C₁₃-norisoprenoid synthesis during berry development with different vine balance was monitored from véraison to harvest in year 2013. Our data suggests that vineyard floor management had a greater influence than did cluster thinning on carotenoids composition in grapes. Grape berries from Tilled treatment vines have higher carotenoids and C₁₃-norisoprenoids than the grapes from Grass treatment vines. Multivariance analyses also showed some interactions between the vineyard floor treatments and cluster thinning treatments on the composition of carotenoids and C₁₃-norisoprenoids...|$|E
