40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} the respiratory health of <b>dock</b> <b>workers</b> who load grain cargoes. METHODS [...] The respiratory health of 118 <b>dock</b> <b>workers</b> who load grain cargoes in the ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert was {{compared with that}} of 555 grain elevator workers from the same regions. 128 civic workers were used as an unexposed control group. RESULTS [...] The prevalences of chronic cough and phlegm were at least as high in <b>dock</b> <b>workers</b> as those found in the elevator workers, and when adjusted for differences in duration of employment and smoking, <b>dock</b> <b>workers</b> had an eightfold higher risk of developing chronic phlegm than did civic workers. Symptoms of eye and skin irritation that were experienced at least monthly were highest for <b>dock</b> <b>workers.</b> Average percentage of the predicted FEV 1 and FVC for <b>dock</b> <b>workers</b> (mean 100. 6 % and 105. 3 % respectively) were similar to the civic workers but significantly higher than those found for elevator workers. Higher subjective estimates of duration of exposure to grain dust (hours/day) were associated with lower values of FEV 1. CONCLUSIONS [...] The more intermittent grain dust exposure patterns of <b>dock</b> <b>workers</b> may have allowed for some recovery of lung function, but chronic respiratory symptoms were less labile...|$|R

Afterward, Victor sends Nikki to a rehabilitation center for her alcoholism. Diane is murdered in August 2011, with Victor as a suspect. Nikki in fact murdered Diane in self-defense, causing Victor to falsely confess to murdering her to protect Nikki. While in jail, Victor marries his former daughter-in-law, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to push Nikki away, however when the entire murder plot is revealed, Nikki is not charged and Victor is freed. Victor and Sharon’s marriage is annulled and he reunites with Nikki, however, she leaves him when some of his past schemes involving Victoria’s marriage are exposed. To {{gain control of the}} cosmetics line Beauty of Nature, Victor slept with Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis). When Nikki reunites with Jack, Victor develops a genuine romance with Sharon to spite her. They marry a second time, however he disappears from town shortly after and Sharon believed he was abandoning her. She burned their prenuptial agreement and took over Newman Enterprises, while Jack and Tucker were buying up its stocks. While away, Victor had lost his memory and was working as a <b>dock</b> <b>worker</b> in Los Angeles; he was demanding better working conditions and the other workers planned to have him killed in an explosion, as a result, Genoa City believed Victor had died, but he returned shortly after. Upon his return, he annuls his marriage to Sharon and reunites with Nikki, just before Jack announces he is taking over Newman Enterprises, firing all of the Newman family and instating Adam. However, due to his addiction to pain killers, Jack gave up control of the company, leaving it to Adam.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1870s to early 1880s, spread of arc lighting, {{a type of}} {{brilliant}} outdoor street lighting that required high voltages {{in the range of}} 3000-6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair. That evening a drunken <b>dock</b> <b>worker,</b> looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had noticed before, managed to sneak his way into a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought it up at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Irvine Welsh {{was born}} in Leith, the port area of the Scottish capital Edinburgh. He states that he {{was born in}} 1958, though, {{according}} to the Glasgow police, his birth record is dated around 1951. When he was four, his family moved to Muirhouse, in Edinburgh, where they stayed in local housing schemes. His mother worked as a waitress. His father was a <b>dock</b> <b>worker</b> in Leith until bad health forced him to quit, after which he became a carpet salesman; he died when Welsh was 25. Welsh left Ainslie Park High School when he was 16 and then completed a City and Guilds course in electrical engineering. He became an apprentice TV repairman until an electric shock persuaded him to move on to a series of other jobs. He left Edinburgh for the London punk scene in 1978, where he played guitar and sang in The Pubic Lice and Stairway 13, the latter a reference to the Ibrox disaster. A series of arrests for petty crimes and finally a suspended sentence for trashing a North London community centre inspired Welsh to correct his ways. He worked for Hackney London Borough Council in London and studied computing {{with the support of the}} Manpower Services Commission.|$|E
25|$|In Brazil young Sigmund {{adopted the}} name Pedro and worked odd {{jobs as a}} <b>dock</b> <b>worker,</b> a road mender, a {{plantation}} labourer and, in 1895, a cook for a British intelligence expedition. Rosenblum allegedly saved both the expedition {{and the life of}} Major Charles Fothergill when hostile natives attacked them. Rosenblum seized a British officer's pistol and, with single-hand marksmanship, killed the attacking natives. Appropriately for a fantastic story, Major Fothergill rewarded Rosenblum with 1,500 pounds, a British passport and passage to Britain. There Pedro became Sidney Rosenblum. Andrew Cook asserts in Ace of Spies: The True Story of Sidney Reilly (p.32) that the evidence contradicts this tale of Brazil. Cook states that the arrival of Sigmund Rosenblum in London in December 1895 was from France, and was prompted by Rosenblum's unscrupulous acquisition of a large sum of money in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, a residential suburb of Paris, necessitating a hasty flight. According to Cook's account, Rosenblum and Yan Voitek, a Polish accomplice, waylaid two Italian anarchists on 25 December 1895 and robbed them of a substantial amount of revolutionary funds. One anarchist's throat was cut; the other, Constant Della Cassa, died from knife wounds in Fontainebleau Hospital three days later. By the time Della Cassa's death appeared in the newspapers police had learned that one of the assailants, whose physical description matched Rosenblum's, was already en route to Britain. Rosenblum's accomplice, Voitek, later related this incident as well as other dealings with Rosenblum to the British Secret Intelligence Service.|$|E

An attempt by the British authorities to protect the <b>dock</b> <b>workers</b> against harassment resulted in serious rioting on 3 October, during which at least one rioter was shot dead and several Sikh constables were injured. The British suspected, with good reason, that the disturbances had been fomented by the Chinese authorities in Guangdong province.|$|R

2500|$|Dockers {{complained that}} they have had a minimal rise in income in the last 10 years. Mr Lee, a <b>dock</b> <b>worker</b> for more than 20 years, said there had been two very low adjustments. [...] "Basically, there's no fringe benefits, we only had paid leave in recent years. My monthly income isn't steady. I earn HK$15,000–$16,000 (US$2,000) during the high season, and less than HK$10,000 (US$1,300) for the low season." [...] The workers demanded a 20% pay rise to a daily wage of HK$1,600, {{equivalent}} to a monthly salary of HK$24,000 based on 15 working days. Chan Chiu-wai, an organiser of the Confederation of Trade Unions, said that dock workers earned $167 a day for 24 consecutive hours' work, less than they received in 1997. Chan said staff often work shifts of up to 72 consecutive hours during high-season. [...] "For this work, the salary is very low, the working conditions are very poor and the hours are very long, so we are often in the position of being understaffed and the workers have to work many hours overtime," [...] Chan added.|$|E

[...] He also repeatedly referred to Camarata as [...] "Commie-Rat-A."
