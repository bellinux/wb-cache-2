25|$|Problem {{benzodiazepine}} use can {{be associated}} with various deviant behaviors, including drug-related crime. In a survey of police detainees carried out by the Australian Government, both legal and illegal users of benzodiazepines were found to be more likely to have lived on the streets, less likely to have been in full-time work and more likely to have used heroin or methamphetamines in the past 30 days from the date of taking part in the survey. Benzodiazepine users {{were also more likely to}} be receiving illegal incomes and more likely to have been arrested or imprisoned in the previous year. Benzodiazepines were sometimes reported to be used alone, but most often formed part of a poly drug-using problem. Female users were more likely than men to be using heroin, whereas male users were more likely to report amphetamine use. Benzodiazepine users were more likely than non-users to claim government financial benefits and benzodiazepine users who were also poly-drug users were the most likely to be claiming government financial benefits. Those who reported using benzodiazepines alone were found to be in the mid-range when compared to other drug using patterns in terms of property crimes and criminal breaches. Of the detainees reporting benzodiazepine use, one in five reported injection use, mostly of illicit temazepam, with some who reported injecting prescribed benzodiazepines. The injection was a concern <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>survey</b> due to increased health risks. The main problems highlighted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>survey</b> were concerns of dependence, the potential for overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with opiates and the health problems associated with injection of benzodiazepines.|$|E

[...] The soil was described as having a hog wallow (mound and swale) relief. [...] The depth to hardpan ranged from 1 foot to 6 feet. [...] The cementing agent for the hard pan was thought to be ferric hydrate [...] with some lime carbonates and probably silica. [...] About 74,500 acres (301km²) were mapped. The San Joaquin soil was next mapped in the Modesto-Turlock Area in 1909. and was described as having a [...] "brick red" [...] surface layer that was underlain by a [...] "ferruginous hardpan" [...] at depths of 15 to 60inches. [...] A red clay loam layer above the hardpan was recognized. [...] About 90,000 acres (360km²) were mapped. [...] In 1911, the San Joaquin soil was mapped in the Madera Area. [...] The concept of the soil did not change <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>survey.</b> [...] It was noted that the soil became saturated during the rainy season and became boggy and impassable except for well traveled roads.

2500|$|The {{following}} Adams administration, however, then {{refused to}} pay Ellicott for his work done <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>survey,</b> and even refused him access to his maps he had submitted with the report. He was forced to sell some of his possessions, including books from his library, {{in order to support}} his family. Finally the maps were released in 1803 under the subsequent Jefferson administration, and Ellicott published his Journal of Andrew Ellicott detailing the Florida survey, including the maps. When third President Thomas Jefferson offered him the post of Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory, Ellicott turned him down. His prior negative experiences with the government political administrations may {{have had something to do}} with this, but at the age of 49, he also wanted to spend more time with his family and feared that this new position might require him to travel too much. Instead, he accepted an offer by Pennsylvania governor Thomas McKean and took a position as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Land Office. The family moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Ellicott seemed content with a clerk's job that left him enough time for his own scientific and private interests and that provided a steady income for the family.

2500|$|A 2013 {{survey of}} 4,424 [...] {{readers of the}} US Consumer Reports {{magazine}} collected reliability data on 4,680 motorcycles purchased new from 2009 to 2012. The most common problem areas were accessories, brakes, electrical (including starters, charging, ignition), and fuel systems, {{and the types of}} motorcycles with the greatest problems were touring, off-road/dual sport, sport-touring, and cruisers. There were not enough sport bikes in the survey for a statistically significant conclusion, though the data hinted at reliability as good as cruisers. These results may be partially explained by accessories including such equipment as fairings, luggage, and auxiliary lighting, which are frequently added to touring, adventure touring/dual sport and sport touring bikes. Trouble with fuel systems is often the result of improper winter storage, and brake problems may also be due to poor maintenance. Of the five brands with enough data to draw conclusions, Honda, Kawasaki and Yamaha were statistically tied, with 11 to 14% of those bikes in the survey experiencing major repairs. Harley-Davidsons had a rate of 24%, while BMWs did worst, with 30% of those needing major repairs. There were not enough Triumph and Suzuki motorcycles surveyed for a statistically sound conclusion, though it appeared Suzukis were as reliable as the other three Japanese brands while Triumphs were comparable to Harley-Davidson and BMW. Three fourths of the repairs in the survey cost less than US$200 and two thirds of the motorcycles were repaired in less than two days. In spite of their relatively worse reliability <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>survey,</b> Harley-Davidson and BMW owners showed the greatest owner satisfaction, and three fourths of them said they would buy the same bike again, followed by 72% of Honda owners and 60 to 63% of Kawasaki and Yamaha owners.|$|E
