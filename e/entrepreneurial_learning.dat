40|$|Although {{organizational}} innovativeness {{has been}} regarded as propelling the market, <b>entrepreneurial</b> and <b>learning</b> orientation, as well as innovativeness relationships, much of the evidence to date remains anecdotal and speculative. In other words, little is known empirically about how these orientations contribute to a firm innovation.

In this context, a systematic framework was devised which tested the postulated market, <b>entrepreneurial</b> and <b>learning</b> orientations relationships collectively, their effect on innovativeness and the subsequent effect of innovativeness on business performance. Utilizing a sample of 238 Swiss watch manufacturing firms, we empirically examine the antecedents of firm innovativeness in this context.

40|$|Comprised of a {{cover story}} and five {{separate}} but interrelated articles, this dissertation explores <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning.</b> By connecting multiple theoretical perspectives, reviewing extant literature, using four qualitative datasets, and building theory inductively, the articles explain components to and mechanisms of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning.</b> This dissertation {{is one of the}} first to explore the essence of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> by incorporating non-entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs simultaneously, cognitive processes, and contextual variables.  Learning lies at the core of entrepreneurship, and scholars have even argued that a theory of entrepreneurship requires a theory of learning. The literature suggests that experiences in the context of entrepreneurship triggers <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning,</b> and that such learning relates to achieving ambitious goals, the discovery of new opportunities and better overall performance. <b>Entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> has also been highlighted in contexts outside entrepreneurship and as a mean to fostering future entrepreneurs and developing people’s entrepreneurial attributes and characteristics. The idea is that entrepreneurship is a way of thinking and acting and that <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> can be of use to anyone, even to those lacking entrepreneurial experience. <b>Entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> literature, both inside and outside the context of entrepreneurship, emphasizes triggers of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning,</b> but does not recognize components that enable those triggers to be recognized and acted on and the underlying mechanisms that distinguish <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> from other types of learning. This gap makes it difficult to assess what <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> is and how it can be enhanced for both entrepreneurs and people preparing for entrepreneurship. This dissertation explains how and why <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> can be understood as a simultaneous and active regulation of cognition, motivation, and emotions to achieve goals. This elaboration captures core components and the mechanism of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning,</b> and illustrates how it can be understood and enhanced in various contexts...|$|E
40|$|We {{addressed}} three {{research questions}} in this study: (1) What {{is the effect}} of market orientation on entrepreneurial success? (2) What is the relationship between market orientation and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> intensity?; and (3) To what extent could <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> intensity enhance the relationship of market orientation – entrepreneurial success? Drawing on marketing and learning literature, we proposed that market orientation and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> intensity infl uence entrepreneurial success. Based on resource-advantage theory, we believed that market orientation and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> intensity are complementary resources in enhancing the capability of fi rms to gain competitive advantage. Through a simple mediation analysis, we posited that market orientation positively impact entrepreneurial success through <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> intensity. Based on data collected, by using questionnaire survey involving 125 owners of established small and medium-sized service enterprises around Malaysia, fi ndings confi rmed that market orientation, <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> intensity and entrepreneurial success are signifi cantly related. <b>Entrepreneurial</b> <b>learning</b> intensity partially mediated the relationship between market orientation and entrepreneurial success. Lastly, discussion and implications of the research fi ndings are provided in understanding the scenario of entrepreneurial success of small and medium-sized service enterprises in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|According to Schwartz, {{behaviour}} is oriented by values through motivations. In our opinion, {{these values}} {{in case of}} the entrepreneurial behaviour are expressed as entrepreneurial values and factors of strategic orientations in the specific literature. Entrepreneurial orientation includes the dimensions of risk taking, innovativeness and pro-activeness. Learning orientation summarizes the factors of common vision, a commitment to business {{and the ability to}} accept bottom-up initiatives in a well-defined approach. We study these orientations because our goal is to describe the value structure of an innovative entrepreneurial behaviour what is desirable in a science park. At first, we investigated the difference between the values of Hungarian citizens and Hungarian entrepreneurs. After that, we assessed whether there is a difference of values among entrepreneurs who have different levels of <b>entrepreneurial</b> or <b>learning</b> orientation.

40|$|The {{strategic}} {{orientation of}} firms {{can take on}} many forms. Researchers most commonly distinguish between <b>entrepreneurial,</b> market, and <b>learning</b> orientations. In combination, strategic orientations represent a firm's value proposition {{in terms of the}} markets in which it operates, where it deploys its resources, and which behavioral patterns are established. This thesis provides insights into the effectiveness of strategic orientations by adopting multiple theoretical perspectives. The strategic orientations of <b>entrepreneurial,</b> market, <b>learning,</b> and innovation orientations are investigated in an isolated as well as interrelated manner. The first research article concentrates on entrepreneurial orientation as its conceptualization and operationalization is subject to several debates in the literature. This conceptual study shows how the challenges of the entrepreneurial orientation construct can be overcome in future research to arrive at a higher level of construct clarity. Thereby, the theoretical perspectives of entrepreneurial dominant logic and the theory of planned behavior are employed. The literature has predominantly focused on investigating the effectiveness of particular strategic orientations. Recently, scholars have stressed their synergetic impact on firm performance and, as such, the relevance of considering their combined role in creating superior value for firms. However, empirical research on their interrelatedness remains scant and dispersed, making it necessary to conduct further research on strategic orientations in an integrative manner. As such, the second research article demonstrates which interrelated roles are played by <b>entrepreneurial,</b> market, and <b>learning</b> orientations in their relationship to firm performance. The rich body of existing knowledge is synthesized by means of meta-analysis under the perspective of strategic coalignment as well as the resource-based view of the firm...|$|R
