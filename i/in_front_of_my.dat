500|$|The writing staff {{used their}} {{individual}} childhood experiences as inspirations {{to come up}} with much of the story lines for this episode.

[...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|On November 11, Ortega-Hernandez {{parked his}} vehicle on Constitution Avenue, [...] {{directly}} {{south of the}} White House. He aimed his semi-automatic rifle from the car's passenger seat and fired. Gunfire was reported around 9pm. One bullet hit an antique window on the White House's second floor near the first family's formal living room; however, it did not penetrate the bulletproof glass on the inside. One bullet lodged in a window frame, and others ricocheted off the roof, causing small pieces of wood and concrete to fall to the ground. At least seven bullets struck the second floor, causing $97,000 worth of damage. A woman in a taxi nearby witnessed the shooting and wrote on Twitter, [...] "Driver <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cab STOPPED and fired 5 gun shots at the White House. It took the police a while to respond." [...] President Obama, his wife Michelle, and their oldest daughter Malia were not home {{at the time of}} the shooting, although their younger daughter Sasha and Michelle's mother Marian Shields Robinson were. When the shooting occurred, Malia was coming home and was expected to arrive at any moment.|$|E

500|$|Episodes {{were written}} {{by a team of}} writers, which {{consisted}} of Dohrn, David Fain, Greenblatt, Mr. Lawrence, Lender, Mark O'Hare, Povenmire, William Reiss, Springer, Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. During the season, the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for individual episodes. For example, in the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", SpongeBob learns profanity. The idea for the episode was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother." [...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." [...] In [...] "Secret Box", SpongeBob wants to see what is inside Patrick's secret box. The idea came to Drymon because he too had a secret box as a child. Creator Hillenburg said, [...] " [...] started telling us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In old age, Iorga {{had also}} {{established}} {{his reputation as}} a memoirist: Orizonturile mele was described by Victor Iova as [...] "a masterpiece of Romanian literature". George Călinescu referred to this series as Iorga's [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "eminently subjective" [...] literature; [...] "dignified" [...] and dominated by [...] "explosions of sentiment", it echoes, according to Călinescu, the Renaissance model of Ion Neculce. Many of the volumes were quickly written as Iorga's attempt to rehabilitate himself after a failed premiership; Orizonturile comprises messages on the power and justness of his cause: [...] "And so I stand at age sixty-two, confident and strong, proud, upright <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> conscience and the judgment of time." [...] The works offer retrospective arguments against Iorga's adversaries and sketch portraits of people who crossed Iorga's path—attributes which, Iova suggests, fully exploit Iorga's talents as a [...] "polemicist" [...] and [...] "portraitist"; according to Alexandru Zub, they also fall into place within the Romanian ego-history vogue, between Xenopol's and Pârvan's.|$|E
2500|$|Ewa Podleś {{likewise}} {{stated that}} [...] "It's {{enough to hear}} her, I'm positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! I can imagine everything, I can see everything <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye." [...] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, [...] "For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, {{yet at the same}} time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles." [...] Scott adds, [...] "Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnston ordered Maj. Gen. G. W. Smith {{to protect}} the road to Barhamsville and Smith {{assigned}} the division of Brig. Gen. William H. C.

John Newton's brigade in the woods {{on either side of}} the landing road, supported in the rear by portions of two more brigades (Brig. Gens. Henry W. Slocum and Philip Kearny). Newton's skirmish line was pushed back as Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade advanced, with Hampton to his right. Hood was concerned about casualties from friendly fire in the thick woods, so he ordered his men to advance with unloaded rifles. Encountering a Union picket line 15 paces away, Hood wrote, [...] "A corporal of the enemy drew down his musket upon me as I stood <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> line."

2500|$|In 1948 in an {{apartment}} in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his [...] "Blake vision"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as [...] "voice of the ancient of days". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked {{at the sky and}} intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: [...] "living blue hand itself. [...] Or that God was <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes - existence itself was God" [...] and [...] "And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I'd been existing in." ...|$|E

In this 'Vision-like' experience he was carried up to [...] "a Wheel, or what you call an unidentified flying object", as in the Bible's Book of Ezekiel. During this experience, he heard the voice of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam.

I put ten shapes on the frame; I {{look at it and}} {{suddenly}} a sort of spark ignites. Then the form appears. Color is secondary, used to accentuate the intensity of the form." [...] Nadir Afonso did not renege on his early expressionist and surrealist works: [...] "An individual initially does not see the true nature of things, he starts by representing the real, because he is convinced therein lies the essence of the artwork. I thought that too. But, as I kept working, the underlying laws of art, which are the laws of geometry, slowly revealed themselves <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes. There was no effort on my part, it was just the daily work what led me to that result, guided by intuition." [...] The illustrations in this article are a chronological representation of the evolution of Nadir Afonso's style and thought towards the original geometric alphabet with which he created his artworks, as explained in his books and seen most prominently in his Cities series.|$|E
