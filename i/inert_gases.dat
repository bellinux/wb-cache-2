5|$|The NDL is a {{theoretical}} time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in the body, using a model {{such as the}} Bühlmann decompression algorithm.

In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb and release <b>inert</b> <b>gases</b> at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E

5|$|Therapeutic {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} for treating decompression sickness by recompressing the diver, thus reducing bubble size, {{and allowing the}} gas bubbles to re-dissolve, then decompressing slowly enough to avoid further formation or growth of bubbles, or eliminating the <b>inert</b> <b>gases</b> by breathing oxygen under pressure.|$|E

40|$|In This Chapter [How <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> {{works to}} prevent methane explosions How <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> is {{generated}} and delivered at highwall mines Volume and quality requirements for <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> at highwall mines How an <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> system is operated and Precautions to take during mining to prevent methane explosions] This chapter discusses a method, originally developed by Volkwein and Ulery [1993], to prevent methane explosions during highwall mining. In highwall mining, a horizontal auger or a mining machine enters the coal seam from a surface mine pit {{at the bottom}} of a highwall, and the coal is mined out from a series of parallel holes. Explosions can be prevented by injecting <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> into each hole as it is mined. Coal near the surface has lost most of its methane gas over time. However, in recent years, surface mining has been used for deeper reserves of coal. This trend toward mining deeper reserves has increased the chance of encountering methane, and methane explosions at highwall mining operations have resulted in injuries. HOW <b>INERT</b> <b>GAS</b> WORKS TO PREVENT METHANE EXPLOSIONS A methane explosion requires the presence of sufficient amounts of both methane and oxygen, as well as an ignition source. If the methane cannot be reduced and the ignition source cannot be eliminated, then explosions may be prevented by adding an <b>inert</b> <b>gas,</b> which contains little to no oxygen, to the mixture [FWQA 1970]. Just how much <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> must be added depends on the mining rate, as well as the composition of the <b>inert</b> <b>gas.</b> An explosibility diagram can be used to show whether a methane mixture is explosive after <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> is added [Zabetakis et al. 1959] (Figure 10 - 1). This diagram indicates that gas mixtures fall into one of three range categories explosive, explosive when mixed with air, and nonexplosive depending on the percentage of methane and percentage of effective inert. Effective inert is calculated from the percentage of excess nitrogen 3 and percentage of carbon dioxide in the mixture...|$|R
5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of <b>inert</b> <b>gases</b> limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled <b>inert</b> <b>gases</b> were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E
