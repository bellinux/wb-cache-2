40|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers (LEO) are at relatively {{high risk of}} back pain and other musculoskeletal disorders. The risk is exacerbated by the poor accommodation provided by their vehicles, which are usually modified civilian vehicles. LEO are also involved in vehicle crashes {{at a higher rate}} than most other occupations, yet officers report difficulty in wearing a safety belt due to interference with their body-borne equipment. To begin to address these issues, a pilot study was conducted to demonstrate the application of three-dimensional anthropometric techniques to quantifying the influence of body-borne gear on space claim and posture in vehicles. The results demonstrated that three exemplar vehicles accommodated the officers poorly due to interference between the seat or other vehicle features and the body-borne <b>gear.</b> <b>Belt</b> fit was also adversely affected, and vehicle modifications and additions, such as the now-common center-mounted laptop computer, create awkward postures for driving, in-vehicle work, and ingress and egress.

40|$|Most {{advanced}} manufacturing processes require highspeed and high precision motion control for material transfer, packaging, assembly, and electrical wiring. Examples are surface mounting of electronic components, wire bonding of semiconductor chips, and assembly of watches and hard disks. To achieve precise motion control, {{most of these}} high-performance manufacturing machines use rotary d. c. or a. c. motors as the prime motion actuator, and couple their output shafts to mechanical motion translators (e. g. reduction <b>gear,</b> <b>belt,</b> ball screw, etc.). Though {{this is the most}} widely used method, it has disadvantages of reduced accuracy, complex mechanical structure, difficult adjustments and alignments, high production cost, and low reliability. in this paper, the author proposes a new direction in high performance machine design, and suggests that future high performance motion systems should be designed through "simplifying the mechanics through specialized direct-drive actuators and advanced control methodologies". For this purpose, this paper investigates a class of variable reluctance (VR) direct-drive motion actuators for high performance machines.
