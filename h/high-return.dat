500|$|Thanks to {{specialisation}} {{in a few}} <b>high-return</b> sectors, at {{purchasing power}} parity Jersey has high economic output per capita, substantially ahead {{of all of the}} world's large developed economies. Gross national income in 2009 was £3.7 billion (approximately £40,000 per head of population). However, this is not indicative of each individual resident's purchasing power, and the actual standard of living in Jersey is comparable to that in the United Kingdom outside central London. The island is recognised as one of the leading offshore financial centres. The growth of this sector however has not been without its controversies as Jersey has been characterised by critics and detractors as a place in which the [...] "leadership has essentially been captured by global finance, and whose members will threaten and intimidate anyone who dissents." [...] In June 2005 the States introduced the Competition (Jersey) Law 2005 to regulate competition and stimulate economic growth. This competition law was based on that of other jurisdictions.|$|E

We develop an options pricing model in which the probability of stock-price jumps increases with knowledge capital. GMM estimates show the probability of stock-price jumps increases with three measures of knowledge capital intensity, two of which can be reasonably estimated contemporaneously. The model explains most variation in biotech firm market values.

30|$|Empirical {{findings}} consistently {{show that}} incomes generated from off-farm activities ease {{the burden on}} agriculture as it enables households to have better incomes. Hence, they enhance food security as they manage food consumption fluctuations better than a household without such an activity (de Janvry and Sadoulet 2001; Ruben 2001; Barrett et al. 2001; Babatunde and Qaim 2010; Haggblade et al. 2010; Owusu et al. 2011; Bezu et al. 2012; Hoang et al. 2014; Mishra et al. 2015). Especially when the agricultural production fails due to climate change, pest, deceases, or other shocks, off-farm employment provides a risk management tool to reduce the income variability and will fill the gap that will be created between farm income and household consumption El-Osta et al (2008). By engaging in off-farm employment, farmers also become self-insured (Alasia et al. 2009) and they may invest in a risky but <b>high-returning</b> agricultural business.|$|R
40|$|This article {{builds a}} model of {{financial}} frictions to explain the aftermath of natural disasters. In constrained economies, after a large shock on capital, affected entrepreneurs might lose access to credit together with their stock of capital. Investment does not flow to <b>high-returns</b> projects. Accordingly, in constrained economies, a shock on capital is associated with an initial decrease of domestic credit and an investment slack. I find direct support for the theoretical model using objective measures on sudden natural disasters between 1980 and 2006. Constrained economies experience an initial decline in their level of investment, which reflects on the immediate GDP growth. This effect fades away after 3 years. In frictionless environment, the increase of credit offsets almost perfectly the estimated capital losses. The underlying credit frictions computed using a structural equation prove to be correlated to more classic measures of financial development.

40|$|Farmers’ {{decision}} and perceptions to {{be a member}} of agricultural cooperatives in the South Eastern Anatolian Region were investigated. Factors affecting the probability of joining the agricultural cooperatives were determined using binary logit model. The model released that most of variables such as education, high communication, log of gross income, farm size, medium and high technology variables play important roles in determining the probability of entrance. Small farmers are likely expected to join the agricultural cooperatives than the wealthier farmers are. Small farmers may wish to benefit cash at hand, input subsidies, and services provided by the agricultural cooperatives since the risks associated with intensive <b>high-returning</b> crops are high. Some important factors playing pole role in abstention of farmers towards agricultural cooperatives are gross income and some social status variables. In addition, conservative or orthodox farmers are less likely to join agricultural cooperatives than moderate farmers are. We also found that the direct government farm credit programs mainly should be objected to providing farmers to better access to capital markets and creating the opportunity to use with allocation of capital inputs via using modern technology...|$|R

Most living things are rarely distributed at random, their placement being largely determined by a hierarchy of environmental factors. For this reason, standard statistical designs based on purely random sampling or systematic (e.g. grid-based) systems tend to be less efficient in recovering information about the distribution of taxa than sample designs that are purposively directed instead along deterministic environmental gradients.|$|E

Torchmark's conservative investment strategies earned its primary subsidiaries the industry's highest ratings.

50|$|To raise capital, {{you require}} them from investors who are {{interested}} in the investments. You have to present those investors with <b>high-return</b> projects. By displaying high-level potentials of the projects, investors would be more attracted to put their money into those projects. After certain amount of time, usually in a year’s time, rewards of the investment will be shared with investors. This makes investors happy and they may continue to invest further. If returns do not meet the intended level, this could reduce the willingness of investors to invest their money into the funds. Hence, the amounts of financial incentives are highly weighted determinants to keep the funding remain at a desirable level.|$|E

5000|$|Opponents {{believe that}} one of the {{problems}} that arises is moral hazard whereby a company that benefits from these protective policies will seek to profit by it, deliberately taking positions (see asset allocation) that are high-risk <b>high-return,</b> as they are able to leverage these risks based on the policy preference they receive. The term has emerged as prominent in public discourse since the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Critics see the policy as counterproductive and that large banks or other institutions should be left to fail if their risk management is not effective. Some critics, such as Alan Greenspan, believe that such large organisations should be deliberately broken up: [...] "If they're too big to fail, they're too big". More than fifty prominent economists, financial experts, bankers, finance industry groups, and banks themselves have called for breaking up large banks into smaller institutions.|$|E

Further, because the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection largely operates in secrecy, it is unclear to researchers how allegedly corrupt officials are disciplined and punished. The odds for a corrupt official to end up in prison are less than three percent, making corruption a <b>high-return,</b> low risk activity.

5000|$|Still {{moved into}} a two-story log house once {{occupied}} by a crafter of dulcimers, Jethro Amburgey. He would remain here till his death. Here, he began writing his masterpiece, River of Earth. It was published February 5, 1940. River of Earth is a discussion of change in Appalachia, depicted as the struggles of a family trying to survive by either subsisting off the land or entering the coal mines of the Cumberland Plateau in the reaches of eastern Kentucky. This tension is depicted in the tension between Brack and Alpha Baldridge. Alpha Baldridge longs for settled solidity. [...] "Forever I've wanted to set us down in a lone spot, a place certain and enduring, with room to swing arm and elbow, [...] [...] [...] [...] So many places we've lived—the far side of one mine camp and next the slag pile of another. I'm longing to set me down shorely and raise my chaps proper (50-51)." [...] Conversely, her husband Brack {{is committed to the}} mines and answers her as the family provider: [...] "It was never meant for a body to be full content on the face of this earth. Against my wont it is to be treading the camps, but its bread I'm hunting, regular bread with a mite of grease on it. To make and provide, it's the only trade I know, and I work willing (51)." [...] His version of stability is perhaps more transitory than hers. She longs to see things grow of a season, whether gardens or children; he looks for the <b>high-return</b> of mine work, despite the dangers (which are not major factors in the book) and the irregularity of the work. She willing to trade the sentence of living from hand to mouth through the year for the security of a personal place; he is willing to endure famine for the short seasons of feasting that mine work allows. The perspectives of both characters represent the dead-end choices of Appalachians who chose to remain in the hills.|$|E

40|$|Summary Using {{data from}} Western Kenya, we confirm the {{existence}} of a dichotomous non-agricultural sector. The poverty and inequality implications of the differently motivated diversification strategies only partly correspond to expected patterns. While <b>high-return</b> activities are indeed confined to richer households, low-return activities constitute an important income source for households across the entire income distribution. Finally, we examine the wider implications of our findings for rural livelihoods. We find that only engagement in <b>high-return</b> non-agricultural activities is significantly associated with increased agricultural productivity.
