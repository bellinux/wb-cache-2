5000|$|In 2009, Maha spent $20 {{million during}} an epic {{shopping}} spree in high-end Parisian boutiques, habitually {{walking out of}} the door after staff had been given an <b>embossed</b> card <b>marked</b> [...] "Payment to Follow". She lived in various top hotels in Paris, including the Crillon, which remained a long-time creditor; she then moved to the luxury Georges V hotel, owned by her nephew, Prince Alwaleed. Shops she patronised report that her payment history had always been excellent, but that her staff started shrugging off payment all of a sudden. She has since been pursued by some 30 Parisian retailers for 15 million Euro worth of merchandise. Casualwear retailer Key Largo finally secured payment after obtaining a court order to seize goods from her Georges V hotel suite. Bailiffs were met by the Saudi consul, who issued a guaranteed payment for $125,000 {{in the presence of a}} chief of police. Those debts were said to have been eventually settled through the Saudi embassy. The negative publicity of her Parisian stay incurred the wrath of King Abdullah, who grounded her on her return from Paris. Nevertheless, she once again escaped back to Paris from Saudi in December 2011. Media reported that she and her entourage, occupying 41 rooms at the Shangri-La Hotel in the 16th Arrondissement in Paris where they had been staying since 23 December 2012, tried to sneak out of the hotel at 3:30 am of 31 May 2012 without paying the $7 million bill. Police were called, but Maha claimed diplomatic immunity. In the meantime pending resolution, she decanted to the Royal Monceau Hotel owned by a friend, the Emir of Qatar. In March 2013, creditors obtained a court order from a judge in Nanterre, and two storage units containing Maha's purchases from 2012 were seized, to be auctioned off to satisfy creditors. Maha was barred from leaving Saudi Arabia after the latest spending spree.|$|R
30|$|Authentication of {{physical}} products is generally done {{by using the}} stochastic structure of either the materials that composes the product or of a printed package associated to it. Authentication can be performed for example by recording the random patterns of the fiber of a paper [3], but such a system is practically heavy to deploy since each product needs {{to be linked to}} its high-definition capture stored in a database. Another solution is to rely on the degradation induced by the interaction between the product and a physical process such as printing, <b>marking,</b> <b>embossing,</b> carving, etc. Because of both the defaults of the physical process and the stochastic nature of the matter, this interaction can be considered as a physically unclonable function (PUF) [4] that cannot be reproduced by the forger and can consequently be used to perform authentication. In [5], the authors measure the degradation of the inks within printed color tiles and use discrepancy between the statistics of the authentic and print-and-scan tiles to perform authentication. Other marking techniques can also be used; in [6], the authors propose to characterize the random profiles of laser marks on materials such as metals (the technique is called LPUF for laser-written PUF) to use them as authentication features.|$|R
