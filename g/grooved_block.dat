40|$|A {{detonation}} wave produced in a combustible gaseous mixture might cause serious damages by interacting with an artificial structure or human bodies {{because of an}} extremely high-pressure and high-temperature behind this wave. Therefore, the {{detonation wave}} produced in the gaseous mixture and propagated into a circumstance by accident should be attenuated or quenched within {{a short distance from}} its origin. Experiments were conducted in order to investigate behaviors of the detonation wave passing through narrow grooves, since the detonation wave was accompained with a cellular structure and no detonation wave could be propagated. In this study, the detonation wave produced in a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and oxygen was propagated through a <b>grooved</b> <b>block</b> and behaviors of the detonation wave were experimentally investigated by using techniques of pressure measurement and soot track record. As a result, the behavior of detonation wave propagating through the <b>grooved</b> <b>block</b> was classified into two categories, i. e. (i) the detonation wave was quenched, (ii) the detonation wave was once quenched behind the block but re-initiated again by focusing mechanisms of a reflected shock wave on a central axis...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results of}} capillary-driven heat and mass {{transfer}} in a vertical rectangular capillary porous structure heated from a <b>grooved</b> <b>block</b> {{placed on the}} top are reported in this paper. The formation of the liquid-vapor menisci {{in the vicinity of}} the downward-facing heated surface provided the capillary-force for the upflow of water in the porous structure. The temperature distributions in both the heating block and the porous structure as well as the induced mass flow rate of water were measured under different heat flux conditions. The experimental results show that with an increase of the imposed heat flux, the heat transfer coefficient increases to a maximum value and then decreases afterwards. It is also found that the liquid-vapor interface moved towards the downward-facing heated surface as the imposed heat flux was increased. The heat transfer mechanisms leading to the maximum heat transfer coefficient and the critical heat flux are explained based on the visual observation of the phase-change behavior and the measured temperature distributions within the porous structure. The effects of particle sizes, the inlet temperature of the subcooled liquid, and the adverse gravity force on the heat transfer characteristics are also examined...|$|E

50|$|XIAP stops {{apoptotic}} {{cell death}} that is induced either by viral infection or by overproduction of caspases. Caspases are the enzymes {{primarily responsible for}} cell death. XIAP binds to and inhibits caspase 3, 7 and 9. The BIR2 domain of XIAP inhibits caspase 3 and 7, while BIR3 binds to and inhibits caspase 9. The RING domain utilizes E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and enables IAPs to catalyze ubiquination of self, caspase-3, or caspase-7 by degradation via proteasome activity. However, mutations affecting the RING Finger do not significantly affect apoptosis, indicating that the BIR domain is sufficient for the protein’s function.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an electrically-energized device for the rapid {{generation of steam}} or other vapors. The high-speed steam generator includes a wicked evaporator, a liquid reservoir, a liquid supply pipe, and a vapor transport tube. The evaporator consists of a low-thermal-conductivity porous wick, heated from a downward-facing <b>grooved</b> heating <b>block</b> that is in intimate contact with the upper surface of the wick structure. The <b>grooved</b> heating <b>block</b> is made of a copper block in which electric cartridge heaters are installed. As a heat load is applied on the heating block, an extremely steep temperature gradient is established immediately at the upper surface of the wick so that water from the saturated wick evaporates rapidly adjacent to the heated surface. Subsequently, menisci are formed at the vapor/liquid interface to develop a capillary force to pump subcooled liquid into the wick from the liquid reservoir. A plurality of grooves in the heating block allow the resulting vapor to instantaneously escape from the heated surface so that a high heat transfer rate from the heating block to the saturated wick can be maintained at all time...|$|R

Geumdang with the height of 305 meters from the sea level is located in the metropolitan city of Gwangju, southern part of Korea. The study reviews the human and natural geography, geological features, geomorphic resources, landscapes, and conveniences of the mountain for a possibility of meaningful field work. The population within the distance of 5 km from the mountain stands at about 620, 000 and 170, 000 of them are students and teachers. Mt. Geumdang has a warm temperature climate with low rainfall throughout the year, so it seems suitable for a field survey. Road network and public transportation system around the area are well-developed and easily accessible. Mt. Geumdang shows various rock type and geological structures. The basement rock is Gwangju granite, which is plutonic body of the Jurassic period. Also, granophyre (micrographic granite) and various volcanic rocks distributed as bedded tuff, lapilli tuff, and rhyolite of the Cretaceous period. Many andesitic and felsic dykes were intruded into the rock by joint system. In Mt. Geumdang, many geomorphic resources are found such as U shaped mountain, joint, fault, lamination, gnamma, tor, cliff, <b>groove,</b> <b>block</b> stream and block field, regolith, and saprolite.

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} {{mosaic of}} Ida shows a highly irregular body (roughly 56 km long), heavily covered with craters, with many interesting geological features, including <b>grooves,</b> <b>blocks,</b> chutes, dark-floored craters, and crater chains. A satellite of Ida, with a preliminary designation of 1993 (243) 1, {{was discovered in}} orbit around Ida. It is approximately 1. 5 km in diameter, has an albedo and spectral reflectance not grossly different from Ida, and orbits Ida in a prograde direction with a period of roughly 20 hr. No other comparable-sized satellites have been found near Ida. New pictures of {{the opposite side of}} Ida reveal an irregular, dog-bone shape, with a prominent gouge that seems to separate Ida into two chief components. A V-shaped valley, well shown in the highest-resolution view of Ida returned in April, may mark a modest expression on the September face of the more dramatic feature on the back side. Ida's dense population of craters shows a wide diversity of morphologies, consistent with the surface having been subjected to saturated bombardment by smaller projectiles. Assuming the same projectile flux applies to Ida was used in deriving Gaspra's cratering age of about 200 m. y., and assuming that Gaspra and Ida both have the same impact strength, then the age of Ida's surface is calculated to be 1 - 2 b. y. This is considerably older than expected from other evidence concerning the Koronis family. Our favored explanation of Ida's satellite is that it (or a precursor satellite from which the present satellite was derived) formed during the catastrophic disruption event that formed Ida itself and formed the Koronis family of asteroids. Perhaps, instead, the satellite is a block ejected from a cratering impact. In any case, smaller blocks visible on some parts of Ida are more certain to be crater ejecta, {{whether or not they were}} ever temporary satellites...|$|R

An increased angle of deflection resulted in a decreased number of rotations to failure for all three file types.

Mutation of a conserved arginine in the ACD of several human sHsp family members causes many common inherited {{diseases of the}} lens and neuromuscular system. The mutation R 120 G in αB crystallin causes myopathy, cardiomyopathy and cataract. We have solved the x-ray structure of the excised ACD dimer of human αB R 120 G close to physiological pH and compared it with several recently determined wild-type vertebrate ACD dimer structures. Wild-type excised ACD dimers have a deep groove at the interface floored by a flat extended “bottom sheet”. Solid-state NMR studies of large assemblies of full-length αB-crystallin {{have shown that the}} <b>groove</b> is <b>blocked</b> in the ACD dimer by curvature of the “bottom sheet”. The crystal structure of R 120 G ACD dimer also reveals a closed groove, but here the “bottom sheet” is flat. Loss of Arg 120 results in rearrangement of an extensive array of charged interactions across this interface. His 83 and Asp 80 on movable arches either side of the interface close the groove by forming two new salt bridges. The residues involved in this extended set of ionic interactions are conserved in Hsp 27, Hsp 20, αA and αB-crystallin sequences.

This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. There were to be four grooves on the front (three in the first year) and rear that ran through the entire circumference of the tyre. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. This, according to the FIA, was to promote driver skill and provide a better spectacle.Results have been mixed as the lack of mechanical grip has resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip — pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track.

The class 11 -associated invariant chain peptide region of li (about residues 81 - 1 04) is known to mediate binding to class II molecules and blockade of the groove, {{but this does not}} exclude additional contact sites for li. Using a set of overlapping li peptides and recombinant soluble li, we demonstrate here that a large segment of Ii encompassing approximately residues 71 to 128 interacts with HLA-DR molecules. The N- and C-terminal regions of this Ii segment appear to bind outside the peptide groove to the contact area for the staphylococcal superantigen Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B on the a 1 domain. The core region of this segment (residues 95 - 108) prevents binding of antigenic peptides, probably by interaction with the peptide groove. Occupation of the groove with anti-genic peptides abolishes binding not only of the core region, but also that of those Ii peptides that bind outside the groove.

40|$|AbstractBackground: α-Amylases {{constitute}} {{a family of}} enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of α-D-(1, 4) -glucan linkages in starch and related polysaccharides. The Amaranth α-amylase inhibitor (AAI) specifically inhibits α-amylases from insects, but not from mammalian sources. AAI is the smallest proteinaceous α-amylase inhibitor described so far and has no known homologs in the sequence databases. Its mode of inhibition of α-amylases was unknown until now. Results: The crystal structure of yellow meal worm α-amylase (TMA) in complex with AAI was determined at 2. 0 Å resolution. The overall fold of AAI, its three-stranded twisted β sheet and the topology of its disulfide bonds identify it as a knottin-like protein. The inhibitor binds into the active-site <b>groove</b> of TMA, <b>blocking</b> the central four sugar-binding subsites. Residues from two AAI segments target the active-site residues of TMA. A comparison of the TMA–AAI complex with a modeled complex between porcine pancreatic α-amylase (PPA) and AAI identified six hydrogen bonds that can be formed only in the TMA–AAI complex. Conclusions: The binding of AAI to TMA presents a new inhibition mode for α-amylases. Due to its unique specificity towards insect α-amylases, AAI might represent a valuable tool for protecting crop plants from predatory insects. The close structural homology between AAI and ‘knottins’ opens new perspectives for the engineering of various novel activities onto the small scaffold of this group of proteins...|$|R
40|$|The Tyre {{tread pattern}} is the {{arrangement}} of <b>blocks,</b> <b>grooves</b> and voids, sipes and channels designed into the tread to enhance its grip on the road. Tread is the uppermost part of any tyre which contact into the road and {{it has its own}} performance towards mileage, traction, low noise and heat built up properties. It would be meaningful to conduct an extended analysis on the tyre tread blocks for its performance in static and dynamic condition to predict its behavior and wear of tread block in on-road condition. The Finite Element software Abaqus is used for the present analysis of the tread block and its behavior was studied on two different contact surfaces. The tread block is modeled in six different shapes and analyzed for is performance. The deformation stress strain characteristic of different blocks is studied which will be useful in deciding the contact behavior, friction and road grip. The regular shape/geometry has common behavior and the mixed type geometry shows a distinguished variation in the analysis. The dynamic stiffness and deformed shape was analyzed in this study and it has its own effect in tyre design. The tread block dynamics study by geometric shape would be vital in tread pattern optimization to enhance the traction, better hydroplaning and rolling resistance under all operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} 2 -cyclin A complex is an {{important}} regulator of the DNA-synthesis phase of the mammalian cell cycle, which is frequently deregulated in cancer. Rather than blocking the ATP-binding site of the apparently redundant kinase subunit, targeting the binding site for macromolecular substrates and regulatory proteins of cyclin A represents a promising strategy to enforce tumour-selective apoptosis. The cyclin-binding <b>groove</b> can be <b>blocked</b> with comparatively small synthetic peptides, which indirectly leads to inhibition of kinase function, but these peptides are metabolically labile and membrane impermeable. As part of our ongoing effort to develop more druglike peptidomimetics derived from cyclin-groove-binding peptides, we report {{the results of our}} studies aimed at a detailed understanding of the structural determinants required for effective binding. Using a combination of peptide synthesis, biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography, we show {{that it is possible to}} simplify peptide structures through the replacement of dipeptide units in which one of the residues is not directly involved in binding, through the introduction of β-amino acid residues that retain only the dipeptide residue side chain that is important for binding. This approach also allowed us to probe spatial constraints in general, as well as the importance of peptide backbone hydrogen-bonding functions. Our identification of potent β-homoleucine-containing tetrapeptide inhibitors, as well as the finding that an optimised N-terminally acetylated tripeptide retains some cyclin A-binding affinity, suggest that the pharmacological targeting of the cyclin A binding groove may be feasible. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

50|$|The second {{bridge was}} far more massive and the new eastern {{abutment}} was a far more massive affair than before, with splayed wing walls both {{north and south of}} the bridge's actual line. This abutment, its massive rectangular stones lifted into place using the lewis holes which are a feature of their upper surface, were held together with long iron ties channelled into the masonry to reinforce the front face. The lewis-holes widen as they penetrate. The lewis consisted of a split wedge which, after being inserted in the hole, was widened out to lock into it by the insertion of a strip of metal between the two halves of the wedge. The hook of the crane was then passed through the head of the lewis and the stone was ready for lifting. From this solid abutment there sprang an elegant bridge with four arches supported on three substantial river piers, 34 ft apart. Its overall length was 189 ft and was intended to take a road carriageway. Few voussoirs (wedge-shaped stones from arches) have been found, but there is sufficient other evidence in the form of cornice <b>blocks,</b> <b>grooved</b> to take vertical parapet slabs, and angled mouldings, to show that the bridge was of stone, although others state that the second bridge had a timber superstructure. This second bridge seems to date from the early 3rd century give AD 162-5 or AD 206. There is no evidence for any further repair or alteration to the bridge after that date. There is a male fertility symbol carved into the northern face of the eastern abutment.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of cultural factors {{in the assessment of}} African Americans (N = 45) who had suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Following the administration of a neuropsychological test battery and functional outcome measures, participants completed a self-report measure of African American acculturation (African American Acculturation Scale-Short Form; Landrine 2 ̆ 6 Klonoff, 1995). In the first study, hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the possible relationship between acculturation and neuropsychological test performance. After controlling for various injury-related (TBI severity, time since injury) and demographic factors (age, sex, and education/occupation), lower levels of acculturation were associated with poorer overall neuropsychological test performance (Overall Test Battery Mean; Rohling, Langhinrichsen-Rohling, 2 ̆ 6 Miller, in press) and lower scores on three of the administered tests (<b>Grooved</b> Pegs, WAIS-R <b>Block</b> Design, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - Categories). In the second study, standard regression analyses were performed to assess whether inclusion of cultural factors could improve the ability of neuropsychological tests to predict functional outcome following TBI. Less acculturation was related to lower ratings of functional independence on cognitive tasks (Functional Independence Measure-Cognition), greater ratings of disability (Disability Rating Scale), and decreased community integration (Community Integration Questionnaire). These findings suggest that differences in cultural experience may be an important factor in the neuropsychological assessment of African Americans following TBI, and provide support for the hypothesis that cultural factors may partially account for differences among various ethnic-cultural groups on neuropsychological tests.
