5|$|Because WALL-E overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's {{production}} {{values and}} aesthetic, without being too obvious. In the DVD commentary, Stanton {{said that he}} has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> it was not; {{it was a way to}} answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself.|$|E
5|$|MGySgt Guadalupe Denogean is an {{immigrant}} from Mexico {{who has served}} in the Marine Corps for 25 years. Denogean was wounded in combat in Basra, Iraq. During {{the time that he}} received treatment for his wounds, he was asked if he had any requests. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> that he had two: First, he wanted a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and second he wanted to be an American citizen.|$|E
25|$|Mercati {{posed the}} {{question}} to himself, why would anyone prefer to manufacture artifacts of stone rather than of metal, a superior material? <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> that metallurgy was unknown at that time. He cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the 3-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based {{on the use of}} stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Due to lateness of publication, Mercati's ideas were already being developed independently; however, his writing served as a further stimulus.|$|E

60|$|The ranger {{was not in}} a mood {{to invite}} the {{sheepman}} in, and, besides, he perceived the danger to which Wetherford <b>was</b> exposed. Therefore <b>his</b> <b>answers</b> <b>were</b> short. Gregg, on his part, did not appear anxious to enter.|$|R
25|$|Janowitz {{agreed with}} Huntington that, {{because of the}} {{fundamental}} differences between the civilian and military worlds, clashes would develop which would diminish the goal of civilian control of the military. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> to ensure that convergence occurred, thus ensuring that the military world would be imbued with the norms and expectations of the society that created it. He encouraged use of conscription, which would bring {{a wide variety of}} individuals into the military. He also encouraged the use of more Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities to ensure that the military academies did not have a monopoly on the type of officer, particularly the senior general officer and flag officer leadership positions, in the military services. He specifically encouraged the development of ROTC programs in the more elite universities, so that the broader influences of society would be represented by the officer corps. The more such societal influences present within the military culture, the smaller the attitudinal differences between the two worlds and the greater the chance of civilians maintaining control over the military. Janowitz, like Huntington, believed that the civilian and military worlds were different from one another; while Huntington developed a theory to control the difference, Janowitz developed a theory to diminish the difference.|$|E
500|$|<b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> that in {{many cases}} animals exist with {{intermediate}} structures that are functional. He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved. Darwin concludes: [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{returned}} from the expedition to his home town in Oregon for a festive welcome on July 21, 1930. Among the many questions the crowd had for him, the one that stood out was {{a question about the}} most impressive thing he experienced while at the South Pole. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> of the notable silence in the Antarctic. He accounted for this by remarking that no woman had ever been there. Smith went back to the air mail delivery after being at the South Pole for two years with Byrd, even setting a record on the notorious [...] "hell stretch" [...] over mountains in Pennsylvania.|$|E

50|$|Kahn's work {{focuses on}} the social imaginary. Like many {{constitutional}} theorists, Kahn is interested in what makes law legitimate.

500|$|Edward Lycett Green, {{described}} by Havers, Grayson and Shankland as [...] "the emotional {{force behind the}} accusations", was next in the witness box. Although Lycett Green had not played on the first night, Clarke considered him a potentially dangerous witness who was capable of giving vital evidence. Lycett Green stated {{that he had seen}} Gordon-Cumming twice push counters over the chalk line when he should not have done so; he had considered accusing Gordon-Cumming at the time, but decided against it because he [...] "did not like to make a scene before ladies". At points in the examination by Asquith, Lycett Green contradicted the course of events outlined by Stanley Wilson—which Levett had also done—and on one point regarding a question the prince put to Levett; <b>his</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> [...] "highly suspect". Havers, Grayson and Shankland later wrote that [...] "it is remarkable that he, the prime mover in the affair, seemed unable to say anything without qualifying it with some such remark as, 'I don't exactly remember'... The hedging by the principal accuser certainly weakens the defendants' case". They also thought that [...] "is refusal to remember anything was obviously humbug, a deliberate policy".|$|E
500|$|At 12:30 pm, Bellerophon {{cut through}} the enemy line, {{slipping}} under {{the stern of the}} Spanish 74-gun Monarca and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, Bellerophon collided with the French 74-gun Aigle, hitting Aigles port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships' yards. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard Aigle sweeping Bellerophons decks with musket fire and grenades. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke's distinctive epaulettes marked him out. Cumby urged him to take them off, only for Cooke to reply [...] "It is too late now to take them off. I see my situation but I will die like a man." [...] Bellerophon was now sustaining fire from Aigle and three other ships, the Spanish San Juan Nepomuceno and Bahama, and the French Swiftsure. Bellerophons main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistols... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster going up and asking him if he should take him down below, <b>his</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> [...] "No, let me lie quietly one minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his success on the football field, Taylor's personal life has been marred by drug usage and controversy. When Taylor was once asked {{what he could do}} that no outside linebacker could, <b>his</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "Drink". However, alcohol abuse was not the largest of his substance abuse problems. After admitting to and testing positive for cocaine in 1987, he was suspended from football for 30 days in 1988 after failing a second drug test. After his second positive test he gave up drugs for five years as a third positive test would have ended his career. As he approached retirement, however, he looked forward to picking up the habit again, saying in his second autobiography, [...] "I saw blow as the only bright spot in my future." [...] After his retirement, he began abusing drugs on a regular basis. He went through drug rehab twice in 1995, only to later be arrested twice over a three-year span for attempting to buy cocaine from undercover police officers. During this period, he lived almost exclusively in his home with white sheets covering his windows and only associated with other drug users. Taylor later said, [...] "I had gotten really bad. I mean my place was almost like a crack house." [...] In his second autobiography, Taylor admitted that he had begun using drugs as early as his rookie season in the NFL. He has also stated that his first wife, Linda, mother to his three children, once had to come pick him up from a crack house during his playing career.|$|E

2500|$|Upon arrival, Dmitry Konstantinovich and {{the other}} grand dukes were {{questioned}} at length by Moisei Uritsky, the Chairman of the Petrograd Cheka. Grand Duke Georgy wrote “ Dmitry asked Uritsky why we were imprisoned, and <b>his</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> that it was to save us as the people intended shooting us at Vologda”, [...] an explanation hard to believe. The prisoners were photographed, and then moved to the Kresty prison.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, in 1945, {{he set up}} {{a company}} called Almin Ltd (Associated Light Metal Industries) which brought {{together}} a group of companies mostly concerned with the production and processing of aluminium and magnesium alloys. [...] He wanted Almin to have research facilities but he recognised that Almin's R needs alone were not sufficient to justify the investment in staff and capital equipment required for properly equipped laboratories.

2500|$|Porsche, Penske, and Donohue quickly {{started the}} {{development}} of the 917-30, complete with a reworked aerodynamic [...] "Paris" [...] body and a 5.4-liter turbocharged flat-12 engine whose output could be adjusted between approximately 1,100 and 1,500 bhp by turning a boost knob located in the cockpit. During {{the development of}} this motor, the German Porsche engineers often asked Donohue if the motor finally had enough power. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> [...] "it will never have enough power until I can spin the wheels {{at the end of the}} straightaway in high gear." ...|$|E

50|$|In an {{extensive}} introduction, Burton asks how Sidrak and Bokkus was so widely {{read in the}} Middle Ages but failed to leave any appreciable influence on later literature. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> that while immensely popular, the book itself is rather unsophisticated in both its language and the general quality of its information. Sidrak's <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> often formulaic and not infrequently fail to directly answer the question posed by Bokkus.|$|R
5000|$|Mathematical order: From {{where does}} this order issue, and why does it {{correspond}} {{to the world of}} nature? <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> in one of his philosophical [...] "treatises on being".

2500|$|Judge Horton {{called the}} first case against Haywood Patterson and began jury selection. Leibowitz objected that African-American jurors had been {{excluded}} from the jury pool. He called the jury commissioner to the stand, asking {{if there were any}} blacks on the juror rolls, and when told yes, suggested <b>his</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> not honest. The locals resented his questioning of the official and [...] "chewed their tobacco meditatively." [...] The National Guard posted five men with fixed bayonets in front of Leibowitz's residence that night. [...] The jury was selected {{by the end of the}} day on Friday and sequestered in the Lyons Hotel.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was forced}} to resign from his {{professorship}} at the University of Bonn in 1935 for refusing to swear an oath to Hitler. Barth then returned to his native Switzerland, where he assumed a chair in systematic theology at the University of Basel. In the course of his appointment he was required to answer a routine question asked of all Swiss civil servants: whether he supported the national defense. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "Yes, especially on the northern border!" [...] The newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung carried his 1936 criticism of Martin Heidegger for his support of the Nazis. In 1938 he wrote a letter to a Czech colleague Josef Hromádka in which he declared that soldiers who fought against the Third Reich were serving a Christian cause.|$|E
2500|$|Yusuf {{was asked}} by the Swiss {{periodical}} Das Magazin why the title of the album was An Other Cup, rather than [...] "Another Cup". The answer was that his breakthrough album, Tea for the Tillerman in 1970, was decorated with Yusuf's painting of a peasant sitting down to a cup of steaming drink on the land. He commented that the two worlds [...] "then, and now, are very different". His new album shows a steaming cup alone on this cover. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> that this was actually an other cup; something different; a bridge between the East and West, which he explained was his own perceived role. He added that, through him, [...] "Westerners might get a glimpse of the East, and Easterners, some understanding of the West. The cup, too, is important; it's a meeting place, a thing meant to be shared." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the close}} of my sophomore year [...] my Greek {{professor}} [...] asked me to teach the course in elementary physics in the preparatory department during the next year. To my reply that I did not know any physics at all, <b>his</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "Anyone who can do well in my Greek can teach physics." [...] "All right," [...] said I, [...] "you {{will have to take}} the consequences, but I will try and see what I can do with it." [...] I at once purchased an Avery's Elements of Physics, and spent the greater part of my summer vacation of 1889 at home – trying to master the subject. [...] I doubt if I have ever taught better in my life than in my first course in physics in 1889. I was so intensely interested in keeping my knowledge ahead of that of the class that they may have caught some of my own interest and enthusiasm.|$|E
2500|$|While some brands {{welcome the}} support of the hip hop community, one brand that did not was Cristal {{champagne}} maker Louis Roederer. A 2006 article from The Economist magazine featured remarks from managing director Frederic Rouzaud about whether the brand's identification with rap stars could affect their company negatively. <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> dismissive: [...] "That's a good question, but what can we do? We can't forbid people from buying it. I'm sure Dom Pérignon or Krug [...] would be delighted to have their business." [...] In retaliation, many hip hop icons such as Jay-Z and Sean Combs, who previously included references to [...] "Cris", ceased all mentions and purchases of the champagne. 50 Cent's deal with Vitamin Water, Dr. Dre's promotion of his Beats by Dr. Dre headphone line and Dr. Pepper, and Drake's commercial with Sprite are successful deals. Although product placement deals were not popular in the 1980s, MC Hammer was an early innovator in this type of strategy. With merchandise such as dolls, commercials for soft drinks and numerous television show appearances, Hammer began the trend of rap artists being accepted as mainstream pitchpeople for brands.|$|E
2500|$|The ABCC {{also drew}} {{on the work of}} Chinese scientists, who were already {{studying}} the survivors in the time before the ABCC arrived in Japan, so there was information from both American and Chinese officials. Masao Tsuzuki was the leading Japanese authority on the biological effects of radiation. He said there were four causes of injury in the bombed cities: heat, blast, primary radiation and radioactive poisonous gas. In a report that was released by Tsuzuki, he answered the question, [...] "What does strong radioactive energy do to the human body?" [...] <b>His</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "damage to blood, then hematopoetic organs such as bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. [...] All are destroyed or damaged severely. Lungs, intestines, liver, kidney etc are affected and their functions disturbed as a result." [...] The damages were rated by severity. People suffering from severe damage were people who were in within a 1km radius of the hypocenter. The severely affected people typically died within a few days, some living as long as two weeks. Moderate damage was seen in people living in a 1–2km. radius from the hypoenter, and those people would live for 2–6 weeks. Those people living within a 2–4km. radius had slight damage, and which would not cause death, but would cause some health problems during the several months after the exposure.|$|E
