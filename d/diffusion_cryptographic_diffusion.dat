Perfect secrecy {{can also be}} achieved by normalizing the CS measurement vector. However, these findings are established on real measurements while digital devices can only store measurements at a finite precision. Based {{on the distribution of}} measurements of natural images sensed by structurally random ensemble, a joint quantization and diffusion approach is proposed for these real-valued measurements. In this way, a nonlinear <b>cryptographic</b> <b>diffusion</b> is intrinsically imposed on the CS process and the overall security level is thus enhanced. Security analyses show that the proposed scheme is able to resist known-plaintext attack while the original CS scheme without quantization cannot. Experimental results demonstrate that the reconstruction quality of our scheme is comparable to that of the original one. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Echo state {{networks}} are simple recurrent neural networks {{that are easy}} to implement and train. Despite their simplicity, they show a form of memory and can predict or regenerate sequences of data. We make use of this property to realize a novel neural cryptography scheme. The key idea is to assume that Alice and Bob share a copy of an echo state network. If Alice trains her copy to memorize a message, she can communicate the trained part of the network to Bob who plugs it into his copy to regenerate the message. Considering a byte-level representation of in- and output, the technique applies to arbitrary types of data (texts, images, audio files, etc.) and practical experiments reveal it to satisfy the fundamental <b>cryptographic</b> properties of <b>diffusion</b> and confusion.

40|$|Abstract. Three-neighbourhood Cellular Automata (CA) {{are widely}} studied and {{accepted}} as suitable cryptographic primitive.

The <b>cryptographic</b> properties like <b>diffusion</b> and randomness increase with increase in neighbourhood radius and thus opens the avenue of exploring the cryptographic properties of 4 -neighbourhood CA. This work explores whether four-neighbourhood CA can be a better cryptographic primitive. We construct a class of crypto-graphically suitable 4 -neighbourhood nonlinear CA rules that resembles rule 30. One 4 -neighbourhood nonlinear CA from this selected class is shown to be resistant against Meier-Staffelbach attack on rule 30, jus-tifying the applicability of 4 -neighbourhood CA as better cryptographic primitives.

As a natural way for realizing Shannon’s confusion and <b>diffusion</b> properties in <b>cryptographic</b> primitives through nonlinear and linear behavior, re-spectively, SPN designs {{served as the}} basis for the Advanced Encryption Standard and a variety of other block ciphers. In this work we present a methodology for minimizing the logic resources for n-bit affine-power S-boxes over Galois fields based on measurable security properties and find-ing corresponding area-efficient combinational implementations in hard-ware. Motivated by the potential need for new and larger S-boxes, we use our methodology to find area-optimized circuits for 8 - and 16 -bit S-boxes. Our methodology is capable of finding good upper bounds on the number of XOR and AND gate equivalents needed for these circuits, which can be further optimized using modern CAD tools...|$|R

The paper treats general propagation properties, resistance against differential cryptanalysis and <b>diffusion.</b> 1 Introduction <b>Cryptographic</b> algorithms have to achieve a very high degree of diffusion and confusion to be secure. In most practical block ciphers and hash functions this is realized by performing a number of rounds, where in each round a relatively simple calculation takes place. Typical operations are bit permutations, modular arithmetic, substitution boxes and binary logic. Hence a round is the composition of a number of easily implementable operations. The optimum choice of operations depends on the desired implementation. In hardware oriented design the most efficient operations are substitution boxes, bit permutations and binary logic.
