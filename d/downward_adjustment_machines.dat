30|$|In {{most of the}} {{specifications}} in Table 3, the estimates of the adjustment cost parameters have the expected signs and they are highly significant. 21 The estimates reveal asymmetry in adjustment costs. Except for one case (specification II with alternative growth rate), <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost parameters are higher than upward adjustment cost parameters, both for the average-wage and employment adjustment. The equality of the upward and <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost parameters are rejected at high levels of significance across most specifications. Furthermore, the <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost parameters are generally larger in absolute value when all plants are considered (specifications II and IV), compared with the case of continuing plants only (specifications I and III). This difference suggests that failing plants face higher <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. The adjustment cost parameter estimates are generally smaller under alternative growth rates.|$|R

Using large-scale data from an employee web-survey running from 2009 / 08 to 2010 / 11, this paper investigates the likelihood that German and Dutch employees work for a crisis-hit organisation. The likelihood of labour hoarding or <b>downward</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the permanent or flexible workforce in crisis-hit organisations is studied, as is the likelihood of <b>downward</b> <b>adjustments</b> in basic wages or benefits.

40|$|Emerging market {{financial}} crises are abrupt and dramatic, usually occurring {{after a period}} of high output growth, massive capital flows, and a boom in asset markets. This paper develops an equilibrium asset pricing model with informational frictions in which vulnerability and the crisis itself are consequences of the investor optimism in the period preceding the crisis. The model features two sets of investors, domestic and foreign. Both sets of investors are imperfectly informed about the true state of the emerging economy. Investors learn from noisy signals which contain information relevant for asset returns and formulate expectations, or ``beliefs'', about the state of productivity. Numerical analysis shows that, if preceded by a sequence of positive signals, a small, negative noise shock can trigger a sharp <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> in investors' beliefs, asset prices, and consumption. The magnitude of this <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> and sensitivity to negative signals increase with the level of optimism attained prior to the negative signal.

40|$|In Malaysia, {{the public}} water supply has been artificially fluoridated since 1972 at an optimum level of 0. 7 ppm {{fluoride}} {{as a public health}} measure to control dental caries. However, concerns arose that a fluoride concentration of 0. 7 ppm was too high given increasing exposure to other sources of fluoride. That prompted a <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the fluoride concentration from 0. 7 to 0. 5 ppm in 2005. In addition to Malaysia, there has recently been a movement towards the <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> of fluoride concentration in the water in the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore and Ireland. However, {{little is known about the}} impact of such adjustments on oral health. This thesis aimed to evaluate the outcome of the <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> of fluoride concentration in the Malaysian {{public water supply}} from 0. 7 to 0. 5 ppm in relation to dental fluorosis and dental caries. Two projects were conducted. The first project comprised a systematic review to critically appraise the literature on stopping the addition of fluoride or reducing the level of fluoride in public water supply on dental caries and fluorosis. This review highlighted the gaps in knowledge and several methodological issues such as lack of examiner blinding and control of confounders. The second project was a cross sectional survey involving life-long residents aged 9 and 12 year-olds in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas in Malaysia (n= 1155). In the fluoridated area, children aged 12 years and 9 years were exposed to 0. 7 and 0. 5 ppmF respectively at the times when maxillary central incisors enamel developed. Fluoride exposures were assessed by questionnaire. Standardized photographs of maxillary central incisors were blind scored for fluorosis using Dean’s Index. Caries prevalence was examined using ICDAS-II criteria. The key findings indicated that the change in fluoride iv level from 0. 7 to 0. 5 ppm has reduced fluorosis and maintains caries preventive effect. The change in fluoridation concentration has also had a significant impact on caries prevalence at different thresholds of severity. The findings support the policy initiative of a lower fluoride concentration in the Malaysian public water supply. It also highlights the need for modification of oral health advice with regards to fluoride exposure in maximising caries prevention while minimising fluorosis...|$|R
