500|$|Nixon, Haldeman, and Mitchell {{did nothing}} to clear up the situation, and Chotiner finally took action {{on his own and}} told Bliss that he was to take control. A shaken Bliss called Haldeman, who backed up Chotiner's account, and Bliss {{immediately}} resigned. Bliss's aides publicized the reasons for his resignation, and reporter <b>David</b> <b>Broder</b> contacted Chotiner, who confirmed the story. Morton refused to be a figurehead for Chotiner, or indeed to have Chotiner at the RNC in any capacity, and so stated to the media. Mitchell dispatched his subordinate, John Sears, to tell Chotiner he would have no place at the RNC. Chotiner took the bad news philosophically, stating that it {{was not the first time}} he had been treated badly, and that his estranged wife had predicted that Nixon would [...] "screw" [...] him.|$|E

2500|$|While {{running for}} his Senate seat in 1984, and again while {{running for the}} Democratic presidential {{nomination}} in 1992, Harkin has faced criticism for claiming that he had flown combat missions over North Vietnam. In a 1979-round table discussion with other Congressional military veterans, Harkin said of his service as a navy pilot: [...] "One year was in Vietnam. I was flying F-4s and F-8s on combat air patrols and photo-reconnaissance support missions". These comments were later published in a 1981 book by <b>David</b> <b>Broder.</b> After subsequent inquiries by Barry Goldwater and The Wall Street Journal, Harkin clarified {{that he had been}} stationed in Japan and sometimes flew recently repaired aircraft on test missions over Vietnam. His service flying F-4s and F-8s was later, while he was stationed at U.S. Naval Base Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{were skeptical}} of Barbour's chances in 2012. <b>David</b> <b>Broder</b> of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "several others {{would have to}} stumble {{before he could get}} a serious consideration." [...] Statistician Nate Silver argued that [...] "Barbour may have difficulty appealing to voters outside the South, especially after his recent comments about the civil rights era." [...] Salon.com noted that [...] "Barbour has some serious baggage ... he's lobbied on behalf of the Mexican government for amnesty. There's also the issue of his freighted racial history, and whatever pragmatic concerns it raises for November-minded Republicans." [...] Timothy Carney, reflecting on Barbour's history as a lobbyist, concluded: [...] "If the Tea Party still has some wind, it's hard to see how Barbour gets anywhere near the GOP nomination." [...] On April 25, 2011, Barbour announced that he would not run for president in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Whittlesey {{worked her}} entire adult life, {{including}} when pregnant and {{after her husband}} died in 1974. She canvassed door-to-door for her 1972 legislative race while pregnant with her third child, William. In 1985, {{when looking at the}} trendline that showed that half of all pre-school children had mothers in the workforce, she assured Reagan that once the economy picked up [...] "all those women can go home and look after their own children". [...] As a long-time working mother herself, Whittlesey asserted this statement was taken out of context and did not reflect her intent of actively expanding choices, professional and personal, for women. The statement continued, [...] "They could care for their children themselves if they wished to do so because their husbands would have opportunities again in a thriving economy." [...] She emphasized Reagan's pledge to create more jobs for working people. Whittlesey was the only woman on Reagan's Senior White House Staff during her service there. According to <b>David</b> <b>Broder,</b> [...] "Whittlesey asserted in 1980 her position on women's rights and her fight as a woman to be effective politically, 'I sympathize with some of the goals of the women's movement, but they choose not to associate with me, so that's where we are. [...] I find myself in many closed rooms filled with men, but I'm rarely invited to women's movement's functions, because I am pro-life and do not endorse feminist ideology of victimhood.'
