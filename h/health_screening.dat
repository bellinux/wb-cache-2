5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} <b>health</b> <b>screening</b> for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

25|$|Pharaoh hounds, being {{somewhat}} uncommon {{outside of}} the Maltese Islands of Malta and Gozo, {{and because they are}} not profitable for commercial breeding, have not been subjected to as much irresponsible breeding as some more popular breeds. Breeders try hard to prevent hereditary diseases from entering the gene pool and according to the American breed club, Pharaohs are virtually free from genetic diseases. Reputable breeders continue to test their breeding stock for genetic conditions such as hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and myriad eye conditions just to ensure that these disorders do not become a problem. Reputable breeders should be able to show documentation of <b>health</b> <b>screening</b> performed on their breeding dogs.

40|$|Objectives: The {{mental health}} of open prison inmates is {{virtually}} un-researched. This study aims to fill that gap. The researcher hypothesised that the open prison inmates would present with significantly fewer mental health problems than is reported in closed prisons. Design: Mental health data from an open prison sample was collected using a battery of tests/tools, and then compared to general population and closed prison data available in the literature. This approach was chosen as to put the {{mental health of}} the open prison inmates in a gradient context. Methods: The sample (N = 74) was collected from an open prison in Ireland. The test (administered in individual interviews) were: STAI, GHQ 12, Brief Jail Mental <b>Health</b> <b>Screen,</b> Correctional Mental <b>Health</b> <b>Screen</b> for Men, England Mental <b>Health</b> <b>Screen,</b> and Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being scale. The tests were chosen based on scoring formats and their degree of validation in relevant literature. Analysis was conducted using SPSS. Results: Mental Health tests indicated widespread presence of mental health problems at rates approximating/exceeding those reported for closed prisons. In contrast, the STAI and WEMWBS indicated a) anxiety at general population levels, and b) mental well-being better than general population levels. Conclusions: An open prison setting is conductive to positive mental health, but this by itself does not seem to mitigate the high incidence rate of mental health problems that is found in prisons in general. A follow up-study is in development to investigate the cause...|$|R
40|$|Background: Renal {{transplantation}} is {{the preferred}} therapy to extend life expectancy {{and quality of life}} for patients with chronic kidney disease. There are many barriers in the process of live kidney donation that prevent the timely progression from organ requirement to transplantation, including the progression of the live donor through a medical evaluation. We assess how easily patients complete the donor workup, how often the medical evalu-ation identifies significant incidental findings, and which surgical procedure is planned for organ retrieval. Methods: We reviewed our donor database and the minutes from our multidisciplinary rounds from 2002 to 2008 to assess how medical, radiological and psychological findings were used to decide on the candidacy of potential donors. Results: Half (50. 2 %) of patients did not pass the initial <b>health</b> <b>screen.</b> Of the 467 patients who progressed beyond the <b>health</b> <b>screen</b> to the computed tomographic angiogram evaluation, 48 (10. 3 %) were excluded as donors and 419 (89. 7 %) were accepted. Of those accepted, 136 (32. 5 %) were conditional on further medi-cal workup. Of the patients accepted (n= 419), 375 (89. 5 %) were planned for laparoscopic left-sided approach. Conclusions: The vast majority of patients who passed the initial <b>health</b> <b>screen</b> for kidney donation will be accepted as donors, but about one-third will require further workup. It is rare to identify life-threatening disease on screening computerized tomographic angiograph for kidney donor workup...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Although {{approximately}} 60 %- 70 % of detained adolescents meet {{criteria for}} a mental disorder, few receive treatment upon community reentry. Given that mental health treatment can potentially reduce recidivism, the study examined detained adolescents’ mental health needs and their post-detention mental health treatment and recidivism. Method: Altogether, 1574 adolescents (< 18 years) completed a mental <b>health</b> <b>screener</b> at a detention center. Scores on the <b>screener,</b> mental <b>health</b> treatment utilization (60 -days post-detention), and recidivism (6 -months post-detention) were measured. Results: About 82. 2 % of adolescents earned elevated scores on the mental <b>health</b> <b>screener,</b> but only 16. 4 % utilized treatment and 37. 2 % recidivated. Logistic regression models revealed adolescents with insurance and higher Angry-Irritable scores {{were significantly more likely}} to obtain treatment, whereas males, Black adolescents, older adolescents, and adolescents endorsing a trauma history were less likely. Black adolescents, insured adolescents, and adolescents with higher Alcohol/Drug Use scores {{were significantly more likely to}} recidivate. Mental health treatment increased the likelihood of recidivism. Discussion: The prevalence of mental health needs among DAs was high, but treatment utilization was low, with notable treatment disparities across race, gender, and age. The use of mental health treatment predicted recidivism, suggesting treatment may act as a proxy measure of mental health problems. Future research should assess the impact of timely and continuous mental health services on recidivism...|$|R
