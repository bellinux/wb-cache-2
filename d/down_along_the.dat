5|$|Basel had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had strong economic ties in the Alsace and further <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Rhine. But {{the events of the}} war had strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the Swiss recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on the Rhine (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and the Swiss cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the hinge}} {{of the shell}} is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with extra material gradually being laid <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E
5|$|The forces attacking towards Kupreška Vrata were redeployed {{the next}} day to assist in the advance towards Zlosela. In Kupres itself, the Bosnian Croat TO secured {{the western part of the}} town, as well as Gornji Malovan. Regardless, no {{significant}} territory changed hands. Although the 9th (Knin) Corps dispatched ten tanks to Kupres from its 9th Tank Company, commanded by Colonel Slavko Lisica, only four of them reached Kupres, as six broke <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> way. In the town of Kupres itself, the Bosnian Croat TO was reinforced by the arrival of a group drawn from the HV special forces Zrinski Battalion. The 30th Partisan Division lost contact with the JNA troops (1st Battalion of the 19th Partisan Brigade) in Kupres at 1:00p.m.|$|E

5|$|The multifidus muscles {{run up and}} <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in {{trying to avoid the}} pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|As Viet Cong fire {{increased}} in intensity, {{the soldiers of}} Delta Company picked up the distinctive sound of a U.S.-made M-60 machine-gun firing from the southern flank. Allen assumed that Alpha Company was approaching his perimeter, so he ordered them to cease-fire because he feared his rifle companies were firing on each other. However, the order was also passed <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> formation of Delta Company, which enabled the Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment to gain fire superiority. At around 11:35am, Triet unleashed his 2nd Battalion which was placed in reserve during the battle, and they attacked Welch's Delta Company from three different directions. During that time Allen tried to request artillery support, but that had become impossible due to the close proximity between U.S. and Viet Cong soldiers. In a scene that had characterized the destruction of Alpha Company earlier, both Allen and Welch were wounded in battle as Viet Cong snipers fired down from the trees. Nonetheless, just before 12:00pm, Allen instructed Delta Company to begin a northward march toward the battalion's base, and Bravo Company to move forward to cover the withdrawal.|$|E

25|$|For {{some three}} {{miles along the}} lakeside many Burgundians died {{that day in the}} rout.

Approximately one half of all breeding pairs nest on the Galápagos Islands. Its diet mainly consists of fish, which it obtains by diving and sometimes swimming underwater in search of its prey.

25|$|The {{war began}} in June. Desperate to {{consolidate}} the Chao Phraya valley before the expected dry-season invasion, combined Ayutthaya and Lan Xang forces braved unforgiving rainy season conditions and laid siege to Phitsanulok. But Phitsanulok's reinforced defenses held. In late October/early November, the besiegers retreated to their respective cities before the upcoming invasion. Bayinnaung's five armies (54600 men, 5300 horses, 530 elephants) arrived at Phitsanulok on 27 November 1568. Reinforced at Phitsanulok, combined armies of 70,000 marched <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Chao Phraya to Ayutthaya, and laid siege to the city in December 1568.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} quay {{in the space}} of the former Lakeland Dairies {{premises}} (an old industrial area), the Scotch Hall Shopping Centre and the D Hotel was completed in November 2005.

Phase Two of the development, which will shortly commence construction, will extend further <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> river front, {{on the site of the}} former Irish Oil Cake works.

25|$|On 28 December 1914 the Sagene Line was {{extended}} via Bentse Bridge to Torshov, where it intersected with the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line. This allowed KSS {{to start a}} circle service, which it named Sagene Ring and numbered 0. It initially used white signs for the counter-clockwise inside ring and green signs fort he clockwise outer circle. Thus the service would run along the Sagene Line and then connect <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Grünerløkka–Torshov Line. The headway was set to five minutes, which required eight trams per direction. At Sagene they took a five-minute break, {{and as long as}} they were on time passengers could transfer to the next tram and save the break.|$|E

25|$|The {{cartilaginous}} septum (septum nasi) {{extends from}} the nasal bones in the midline (above) to the bony septum in the midline (posteriorly), then <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> bony floor. The septum is quadrangular; the upper half is flanked by two (2) triangular-to-trapezoidal cartilages: the upper lateral-cartilages, which are fused to the dorsal septum in the midline, and laterally attached, with loose ligaments, to the bony margin of the pyriform (pear-shaped) aperture, while the inferior ends of the upper lateral-cartilages are free (unattached). The internal area (angle), formed by the septum and upper lateral-cartilage, constitutes the internal valve of the nose; the sesamoid cartilages are adjacent to the upper lateral-cartilages in the fibroareolar connective tissue.|$|E
25|$|The wing {{was fixed}} to the {{fuselage}} at three points. There was a pivot at the centre {{of a pair of}} turntable rings, one on the fuselage, and one on the wing underside and just under 3ft (890mm) in diameter, plus two L-shaped locking bolts. Before the wings could be rotated, the flat-topped decking on the rear fuselage had to be swung out on hinges to hang <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> fuselage sides, then with these bolts removed, the wing could be swung through almost 90° so that one trailing edge, with its aileron raised vertically, lay close to the fin. The resulting storage planform was narrower than that of a typical folding aircraft, but longer. The aim of the rotating wing was not so much to save space as to make folding a one-man, rather than a two-man task.|$|E
25|$|The high {{latitude}} magnetosphere {{is filled}} with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines. The flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth {{and back into the}} solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels <b>down</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.|$|E
