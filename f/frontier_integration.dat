They {{are the most}} abundant and ubiquitous biological entities on Earth and are important drivers of ecosystem functioning. Little is known, however, about {{the vast majority of}} these viruses of microorganisms, or VoMs. Modern techniques such as metagenomics have enabled the discovery and description of more presumptive VoMs than ever before, but also have exposed gaps in our understanding of VoM ecology. Exploring the ecology of these viruses – which is how they interact with host organisms, the abiotic environment, larger organisms, and even other viruses across a variety of environments and conditions – is the next <b>frontier.</b> <b>Integration</b> of a growing molecular understanding of VoMs with ecological studies will expand our knowledge of ecosystem dynamics. Ecology can be studied at multiple levels including individual organisms, populations, communities, whole ecosystems, and the entire biosphere. Ecology additionally can consider normal, equilibrium conditions or instead perturbations. Perturbations are of particular interest because measuring the effect of disturbances on VoM-associated communities provides important windows into how VoMs contribute to ecosystem dynamics. These disturbances in turn can be studied through in vitro, in vivo, and in situ experimentation, measuring responses by VoM-associated communities to changes in nutrient availability, stress, physical disruption, seasonality, etc., and could apply to studies at all ecological levels. These are considered here across diverse systems and environments...|$|E
40|$|Border {{regions are}} likely to play a {{critical}} role within the spatial dynamics initiated by the enlargement of the EU. This paper deals with the effects of integration on labour markets in border regions. Within the framework of different theoretical approaches, the effects of integration on labour markets in border regions are analysed. Furthermore, we investigate empirically the degree of labour market integration in European border regions. As indicators for the intensity of integration among neighbouring labour markets measures of spatial association are applied. Results of an analysis of per capita income and unemployment for the period from 1995 to 2000 point to a measurable spatial segmentation of labour markets between EU 15 countries along national borders. On average, border regions in the EU are characterised by a lower degree of labour market integration with neighbouring regions than non-border areas due to significant border impediments that hamper equilibrating forces between labour markets on both sides of national <b>frontiers.</b> European <b>Integration,</b> Labour Market Disparities, Border Regions, Spatial Dependence, International Relations/Trade, Labor and Human Capital, F 22, J 61, R 23,...|$|R
40|$|The Alsace-Baden-Basel area is an {{especially}} interesting "laboratory" {{for the study of}} border region problems and opportunities. Although the Common Market has tended to reduce the role of the Franco-German border it has not affected the Swiss <b>frontier.</b> Moreover, economic <b>integration</b> of the area is still inhibited by the effects of three very different national administrative structures. In many respects, border region issues in the trinational area tend to focus on a French region in an essentially germanic setting, and especially {{on the question of whether}} Alsace should be more closely integrated with France or with the Rhine axis. The nature and significance of these options are critically discussed in some detail...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is based on}} a larger study whose purpose was to explore the various opportunities and challenges influencing integration of ICT in teaching and learning Mathematics in secondary schools in Nairobi County. The study, adopted a descriptive survey design. Three instruments questionnaires’, a structured interview schedule and an observation checklist were used to collect data. The study was carried out in twelve public secondary schools in Nairobi County. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Findings from the study indicated that, teachers face major challenges such as developing their own technological skills and knowledge as well as self-training in the use ICTs in their teaching. This lack of capacity building support was found by the study to contribute to teacher lax in integrating technology in their teaching inspite of the enthusiasm. This study recommends that new <b>frontiers</b> on technology <b>integration</b> be made accessible to both teachers and students for learning purpose to increase access to information and that, capacity building in technology integration be increased for teachers and awareness be built among pre-service teachers trainees integrating ICT in teaching and learning Mathematics...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{main focus}} was on {{developing}} an algorithm and supporting computer programs for use by extension personel to counsel farm managers on problems of enterprise choice. Investigation was initiated from the complete certainty viewpoint of linear programming. Upon introducing uncertainty, ramifications of changing expected income, variance and the correlation coefficient between enterprises were explored. This was extended to develop a quadratic programming algorithm which resulted in complete algebraic specification of the efficiency <b>frontier</b> through <b>integration</b> of the Lagrangian multipliers. The Von Neuman-Morgenstern utility analysis framework was posed for selecting the best alternative but dismissed as being cumbersome for practical application. A probability of loss function which places confidence intervals about the income level of each alternative was used since it is more amenable for application by extension workers. Data requirements {{were found to be}} no more difficult to satisfy in the quadratic programming model than in the presently used linear programming models. The triangular probability distribution was used in obtaining subjective estimates for the mean and variance of prices and yields. Subjective methods for deriving covariances between incomes from farm enterprises were discarded as being difficult to administer and subject to inconsistencies. A regional correlation matrix was used from which specific covariance estimates for individual decision problems were computed. Seven cases were studied as a test of the computer programs and the algorithm. Four of these cases were submitted from actual farm situations by an extension agent. Output from the computer provided each farmer with a report containing the composition of every efficient plan, the pattern of resource use, the shadow prices of limiting resources and confidence statements about achieving certain levels of gross margin. The report was presented in tabular form, in graphic form and as a set of algebraic equations. Although no extensive test of acceptance by farm decision makers was made, results with the four cases studied appeared encouraging...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the Web {{has been}} rapidly "deepened" with the {{prevalence}} of databases online and becomes an important <b>frontier</b> for data <b>integration.</b> On this deep Web, {{a significant amount of}} information can only be accessed as response to dynamically issued queries to the query interface of a back-end database, instead of by traversing static URL links. Such a query interface expresses a set of constraint templates, where each constraint template states how an attribute can be queried. To enable automatic query mediation among heterogenous deep Web sources, it is critical to automatically translate those constraints, which we name as constraint mapping. In particular, this paper aims at enabling on-the-fly constraint mapping, toward on-the-fly integration of Web databases, due to the the large scale and dynamic nature of the deep Web. Such on- the-fly query translation poses a significant new challenge on the generality and extensibility of the translation framework. Existing works pursue a per-source rule-driven framework and thus cannot satisfy such requirements. In contrast, we propose a generic type-based search-driven translation framework by considering the constraintmapping for each data type as a search problem. In particular, in this paper, we develop search algorithms for text and numeric types. Our experiments over real deep Web sources show that our approach is promising as a principle way to mediate queries for large scale integration...|$|R
40|$|Systems Biology has {{established}} numerous approaches for mechanistic modeling of molecular {{networks in the}} cell and a legacy of models. The current <b>frontier</b> is the <b>integration</b> of models expressed in different formalisms to address the multi-scale biological system organization challenge. We present MUFINS (MUlti-Formalism Interaction Network Simulator) software, implementing {{a unique set of}} approaches for multi-formalism simulation of interaction networks. We extend the constraint-based modeling (CBM) framework by incorporation of linear inhibition constraints, enabling for the first time linear modeling of networks simultaneously describing gene regulation, signaling and whole-cell metabolism at steady state. We present a use case where a logical hypergraph model of a regulatory network is expressed by linear constraints and integrated with a Genome-Scale Metabolic Network (GSMN) of mouse macrophage. We experimentally validate predictions, demonstrating application of our software in an iterative cycle of hypothesis generation, validation and model refinement. MUFINS incorporates an extended version of our Quasi-Steady State Petri Net approach to integrate dynamic models with CBM, which we demonstrate through a dynamic model of cortisol signaling integrated with the human Recon 2 GSMN and a model of nutrient dynamics in physiological compartments. Finally, we implement a number of methods for deriving metabolic states from ~omics data, including our new variant of the iMAT congruency approach. We compare our approach with iMAT through the analysis of 262 individual tumor transcriptomes, recovering features of metabolic reprogramming in cancer. The software provides graphics user interface with network visualization, which facilitates use by researchers who are not experienced in coding and mathematical modeling environments...|$|R
40|$|The intergrain ceramic {{structures}} are very complex {{and difficult to}} describe by using traditional analytical methods. In this study, {{in order to establish}} grain shapes of sintered ceramics, new approach on correlation between microstructure and properties of doped BaTiO 3 -ceramics based on fractal geometry has been developed. BaTiO 3 ceramics doped with CeO 2, Bi 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, CaZrO 3 Nb 2 O 5, MnCO 3, La 2 O 3, Er 2 O 3, Yb 2 O 3 and Ho 2 O 3, were prepared using conventional solid state procedure and sintered at 1350 °C. The sintered specimens microstructure was investigated by SEM- 5300 and capacitance has been done using LCR-metra Agilent 4284 A. The fractal modeling method using a reconstruction of microstructure configurations, like grains or intergranular contacts shapes has been successfully done. Furthermore, the area of grains surface was calculated by using fractal correction which expresses the grains surface irregularity through fractal dimension. For better and deeper the ceramics material microstructure characterization the Voronoi model and mathematical statistics calculations, are applied, also. The fractal nature for ceramics structure analysis providing a new ideas for modeling the grain shape and relations between the BaTiO 3 ceramic structure and dielectrical properties and new <b>frontier</b> for higher <b>integration</b> on electronic circuits. The presented results indicate that fractal method for structure ceramics analysis creates a new approach for describing, predicting and modeling the grain shape and relations between the BaTiO 3 -ceramic structure and dielectric and generally electric and microelectronics properties...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{a dynamic}} household utility optimization model to examine small-scale settler behavior in colonization projects within the Brazilian Amazon's arc of deforestation. The {{aim is to}} illuminate factors influencing the typical trajectory from forest to pasture—a process with implications for settler welfare and the environment. Model dynamics derive from herd growth and degradation, in a frontier-like context of constrained access to capital and labor markets. Using numerical simulations, the analysis shows competition for the household's scarce factor labor among pasture investment, annual cropping, and off-farm wage work playing out in different trajectories for household time allocation and land use with different model parameters. The investment approach bridges two often opposing views of the small-scale farmer—struggling for subsistence, or rising out of poverty—placing them as potential snapshots along a trajectory. In the long run, the household devotes all its labor to the activity with the higher return to that labor—maintaining a fixed amount of pasture and living off sales from herd growth, or working off farm. Herd growth and the discount rate determine optimal pasture stocking rates. The household's trajectory shifts with additional activities in ways dependent on their returns-to-labor profiles and parameter levels. Dynamic patterns change under decreasing marginal returns to labor over time (with annuals), constant returns (with wage work), and rising returns (pasture investment). Because the shadow wage changes over time, participation in a labor market can become attractive due to pasture investment. Simulations highlight dynamic trade-offs, and include scenarios with a prolonged annuals phase, and volatile behavior such as a one-year spike in pasture labor, or overshooting the long-run herd stocking rate. In an attempt to examine <b>frontier</b> labor market <b>integration,</b> the dissertation also includes simulations with a changing exogenous wage and labor trading between two households. Expectation of off-farm work in the future encourages annuals and slows pasture growth prior to the wage phase, but speeds the pasture transition thereafter. Trading labor between farms with different household sizes favors annuals along the trajectory, but {{does not affect the}} steady state. Labor trades between farms with different time preferences favors pasture...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation studies {{the effect of}} economic integration {{on the performance of}} firms. The ongoing process of global economic integration has been characterized by dismantling of trade barriers and openness to foreign direct investments (FDI). These changes have not only brought opportunities to firms in terms of market access and the possibility to learn about foreign technologies brought in by foreign counterparts. The new economic environment has also posed new challenges through a greater competitive pressure urging firms to continuously align their production patterns to more efficient business practices. The agility of firms to adjust to external shocks, and hence the potential of countries to benefit from economic integration, does presumably not only depend on the internal assets of firms but may also be influenced by government policies and national institutional settings. This conceptual background constitutes the storyline of the {{doctoral dissertation}}. Chapter 1 of the dissertation is a step forward in understanding the externalities of foreign direct investments on the economic performance of domestic firms. During the late eighties and early nineties, Spain saw an upswing in foreign direct investments that placed the economic at the top of FDI recipients in Europe. To provide fresh insights into the firm-levels responses to FDI, Chapter 1 investigates the effects of foreign direct investment on the productivity of domestic firms within the same sector of activity as foreign firms, and whether FDI externalities differed depending on their level of technology. The empirical results show that foreign presence had an overall positive effect on the productivity growth of domestic firms. The gains were not, however, evenly distributed across firms. Firms closer to the frontier benefited more from FDI than firms far from the technology <b>frontier.</b> A further <b>integration</b> of the world economy with new economic actors, like China and India, has highlighted the need for European firms to climb the quality ladder and shift towards high value added products and greater flexibility in delivering new products in order to survive new competitive threats. Chapter 2 is a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of innovation for the export activities of firms. The intuition is that firms through innovation enhance their access to foreign markets by improving cost competitiveness and the quality of products. The Chapter builds on previous literature to develop a trade model in which firms differ in their propensity to innovate and export based on their underlying productivity. The empirical results, in line with the theoretical model, suggest a positive effect of innovation on the probability of participation in export markets. The innovative activities of firms may not only depend on their internal assets, but presumably also on their relations with other actors in the national innovation systems. To understand better the role of firms’ relations with the science sector, Chapter 3 turns to one of the major producers of knowledge –universities- and investigates the factors that contribute to the successful transfer of knowledge from universities to the market. The results from Chapter 3 show that universities with established technology transfer policies, procedures, and large and experienced technology transfer offices perform better. Previous chapters demonstrate that innovation gives a competitive edge to firms exploring foreign markets. Chapter 4, which is joint work with economists from France’s central bank, investigates how credit market imperfections affect the expansion and survival of firms in foreign markets, which is essential for the design of policies stimulating aggregate trade and competitiveness. Chapter 4 develops a theoretical model to study the impact of credit constraints on the number of newly served export destinations by firms and their exits from the export market and tests it using French firm-level data. The results show that credit constraints negatively affect the number of newly created export relations and {{have a negative effect on}} the probability of exit from the export market.
