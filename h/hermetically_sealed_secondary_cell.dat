A second technique, the multiplexed cell protector, uses common circuitry to monitor and control each cell in a battery pack. The third technique, the computerized cell protector, by replacing the hard-wired logic of the multiplexed cell protector with a microprocessor, achieves greatest control flexibility and inherent computational capability with a minimum parts count implementation...|$|R

40|$|An {{intensive}} study of {{various forms of}} transducers was conducted with application towards <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealing</b> the transducer and all electronics. The {{results of the study}} indicated that the Hall effect devices and a LED/phototransistor combination were the most practical for this type of application. Therefore, hardware was developed utilizing a magnet/Hall effect transducer for single action switches and LED/phototransistor transducers for rotary multiposition or potentiometer applications. All electronics could be housed in a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> compartment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the affect of hermetic sealing on extending the shelf life of a biscuit product. <b>Hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> packages were compared with non-hermetically-sealed packages received from the biscuit manufacturer. The package materials were the same so the only variable was the hermetic integrity of the package. A pressure test was conducted to determine the hermetic integrity of the package samples. The maximum moisture content that the biscuits gained before they were considered spoiled was then determined. Moisture gain of biscuit products kept in a 100 % RH environment was monitored by recording the changes in biscuit weight over time. Data collected was analyzed in order to show a distinct and comparable trend of the hermetic samples and non-hermetic samples. A analysis of variance test was conducted to determine whether or not the means of the moisture gain of both samples was significantly different at a 0. 05 significance level. <b>Hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> packages for biscuits provide for longer shelf life of product than packages which are not <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed...</b>|$|R
