For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, {{at the request of}} Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival <b>data</b> <b>presented</b> to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill. The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission Alexander Yakovlev.|$|E

In building on the <b>data</b> <b>presented</b> here by the UN, the World Bank goes on to explain that access to water for producing food {{will be one of the}} main challenges in the decades to come. Access to water will need to be balanced with the importance of managing water itself in a sustainable way while taking into account the impact of climate change, and other environmental and social variables.|$|E
25|$|It {{was once}} widely {{hypothesized}} that ethane produced {{in this fashion}} on Titan rained back onto the moon's surface, and over time had accumulated into hydrocarbon seas or oceans covering much of the moon's surface. Infrared telescopic observations cast significant doubt on this hypothesis, and the Huygens probe, which landed on Titan in 2005, failed to observe any surface liquids, although it did photograph features that could be presently dry drainage channels. In December 2007 the Cassini probe found at least one lake at Titan’s south pole, now called Ontario Lacus because of the lake's similar area to Lake Ontario on Earth (approximately 20,000nbsp&km2). Further analysis of infrared spectroscopic <b>data</b> <b>presented</b> in July 2008 provided stronger evidence {{for the presence of}} liquid ethane in Ontario Lacus.|$|E
