40|$|Informal {{payments}} {{in the health}} system refer to any payment made outside the legal funding framework. The existence of the phenomenon in Central and Eastern European countries relates to {{the characteristics of the}} health systems in the communist period. The analysis is based on three types of data: a set of data gathered from literature review; a second set of data gathered from online media; and a third set of data collected from legislative and public policy. The analysis was pursued using the key words such as informal payment, under-the-table payment, out-of-pocket payment, <b>envelope</b> <b>payment,</b> healthcare corruption, under-the-counter payment. As reflected in the media reports and even publicly recognized by the officials of the Ministry of Health, informal payments are a serious problem of the Romanian healthcare system. Nevertheless, the studies pursued by local researchers are inconsistent with the actual magnitude of the problem. Besides that, there is a serious gap between the findings in this area and the policies intended to reduce the phenomenon. </p...|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explain the cross-national {{variations}} in the tendency of employers to under-declare salaries by paying formal employees an undeclared (‘envelope’) wage {{in addition to their}} official declared salary. Analysing the prevalence, size and nature of <b>envelope</b> wage <b>payments</b> across 10 East-Central European countries using data from a 2007 Eurobarometer survey, <b>envelope</b> wage <b>payments</b> are found to be less common, smaller and more likely to be for extra work in wealthier, less corrupt and more equal nations with higher levels of taxation, social protection and effective redistribution via social transfers. The theoretical and policy implications are then discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} the new Common Agricultural Policy agreed upon in 2013, the Walloon government had to make some choices, left to the Member States or the regions within them, which {{is the case in}} Belgium. In January 2014, it was decided {{to implement the}} green payment (which is compulsory) proportionally to the basic payments, the payment for young farmers (compulsory) at its maximum authorized level (2 % of the total <b>envelope</b> for direct <b>payments),</b> an additional payment for the first 50 hectares (payment which is left to the choice of the Member State/region), coupled payments (including 2. 1 % of the regional <b>envelope</b> for direct <b>payments</b> for pastures and forage area), and the basic payment (compulsory, representing 26. 7 % of the total regional <b>envelope</b> for direct <b>payments</b> only in Wallonia).

40|$|This article {{examines}} the undeclared economy in general, and envelope wages more particularly, in 10 Central and East European countries, drawing on a 2013 Eurobarometer survey. The explanatory approach focuses on the asymmetry between the codified laws and regulations of the formal institutions and the unwritten socially shared rules of informal institutions. A strong association is revealed between the prevalence of <b>envelope</b> wage <b>payments</b> {{and the degree of}} asymmetry between formal and informal institutions at both the individual and country levels. We explore the implications for theorising and for tackling undeclared work practices...|$|R
5000|$|On cover - An {{envelope}} {{bearing a}} used plate number coil stamp with a contemporary postmark tying the stamp to the envelope. Many collectors prefer the cover {{to have the}} correct postage and proper stamp or stamps used for the envelope. An example of an improper use is to combine many precanceled stamps and older issues on an <b>envelope</b> as <b>payment</b> for a first class postage. Although this practice is allowed by the Post Office, most collectors find this and stamp collector contrived or philatelic covers less desirable.|$|R
25|$|Any {{letter sent}} within Canada has the {{destination}} {{address on the}} centre of its envelope, with a stamp, postal indicia, meter label, or frank mark on the top-right corner of the <b>envelope</b> to acknowledge <b>payment</b> of postage. A return address, {{although it is not}} required, can be put on the top-left corner or the back of the envelope in smaller type than the destination address.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the United States Postal Service {{specifies}} {{that the}} envelopes or postcards for courtesy reply mail should be printed with a FIM A code. The POSTNET bar code can be {{printed on the}} envelope or postcard; alternatively, it can be printed on a payment coupon so that the bar code is visible {{through the window of}} a window <b>envelope</b> when the <b>payment</b> coupon is inserted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{jury trial}} {{commenced}} in November 1999. Hamilton {{and his wife}} were cross-examined by George Carman QC. Carman put to Hamilton that he had acted corruptly to demand and then take £10,000 from Mobil Oil in 1989 for the tabling of an amendment to a finance bill. At the time, Hamilton {{was a member of a}} Commons select committee on finance. Al-Fayed said Hamilton had taken the money either in brown <b>envelope</b> cash <b>payments</b> or through Ian Greer. Hamilton said in his own evidence, [...] "I have never received a penny from Mr Fayed; I have never asked." [...] His counsel, in the closing comments, argued that Al-Fayed's assertions had destroyed his client's reputation. On 21 December 1999, the jury unanimously decided in favour of the defence.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{defined in}} 2013 is {{implemented}} since 2015. It offers several options to the Member States/Regions. This paper describes the choices {{which have been}} made in Wallonia and their consequences on direct payments. It appears that 42 % of the farmers will lose between 2014 and 2019, while 44 % will gain and a quasi-status quo is observed for the remaining 14 %. Finally, the new situation is politically acceptable and gives more support to small farms, young farmers and cattle breeders, though the global <b>envelope</b> for direct <b>payments</b> will decline in Wallonia...|$|R
5000|$|Tony and Chris {{attend a}} sitdown {{in a park}} in Queens, {{settling}} on 15% for Carmine. Carmine asks Tony to remember his son, Little Carmine, when he [...] "is gone." [...] Later, Tony changes his mind and tells Chris to call off the hit and ensure the hired guns don't talk to anyone. At Chris' behest, Benny and Petey execute the would-be hitmen. Johnny is angered that the hit is off and expresses treasonous feelings about Carmine and his son. Johnny then asks Tony why he should trust him when he has backed out of their deal, something that he can hang over Johnny's head. Tony states that he shouldn't be hearing any of this. They part ways after an embrace, but eye each other when Johnny drives away. Elsewhere, thanks to juror intimidation, Junior is freed following a mistrial. Upon returning home, Bobby and Janice dance together, but an irritated Junior breaks up the moment by ordering Bobby to check for Murf's <b>payment</b> <b>envelope.</b>|$|R
40|$|Policy {{harmonized}} (PH) approach {{allows for}} the quantitative assessment {{of the impact of}} various elements of EU CAP direct support schemes, where the production effects of direct payments are accounted through reaction prices formed by producer price and policy price add-ons. Using the AGMEMOD model the impacts of two possible EU agricultural policy scenarios upon beef production have been analysed - full decoupling with a switch from historical to regional Single Payment scheme or alternatively with re-distribution of country direct <b>payment</b> <b>envelopes</b> via introduction of EU-wide flat area payment. The PH approach, by systematizing and harmonizing the management and use of policy data, ensures that projected differential policy impacts arising from changes in common EU policies reflect the likely actual differential impact as opposed to differences in how "common" policies are implemented within analytical models. In the second section of the paper the AGMEMOD model's structure is explained. The policy harmonized evaluation method is presented in the third section. Results from an application of the PH approach are presented and discussed in the paper's penultimate section, while section 5 concludes...|$|R
2500|$|The legal {{proposals}} aim to {{move away}} from the different systems of the Single Payments Scheme in the EU-15 (which allows for historical references, or a payment per hectare, or a [...] "hybrid" [...] combination of the two) and the Single Area Payments Scheme (SAPS) in most of the EU-12, a new [...] "Basic Payment Scheme" [...] will apply after 2013. This will be subject to [...] "cross compliance" [...] (respecting certain environmental, animal welfare & other rules), as at present, although there are various simplifications to the current requirement. It intends to reduce significantly the discrepancies between the levels of payments obtained between farmers, between regions and between Member States. All Member States will be obliged to move towards a uniform payment per hectare at national or regional level by the start of 2019. In line with the Commission proposals within the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the national <b>envelopes</b> for direct <b>payments</b> will be adjusted so that those that receive less than 90% of the EU average payment per hectare will receive more. The gap between the amounts currently foreseen and 90% of the EU-27 average is reduced by one-third.|$|R
