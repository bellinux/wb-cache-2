5|$|During the Revolution, Suharto married Siti Hartinah (known as Madam Tien), the {{daughter}} of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996. The couple had six children: Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati ("Titiek Suharto", born 1959), Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). Within the Javanese upper class, it was considered acceptable for the wife to pursue genteel commerce to supplement the family budget, allowing her husband to keep his <b>dignity</b> <b>in</b> his official role. The commercial dealings of Tien, her children and grandchildren became extensive and ultimately undermined Suharto's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} <b>dignity</b> <b>in</b> the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E

The Chapter of the Cathedral had three <b>dignities</b> <b>in</b> 1677, and two <b>dignities</b> <b>in</b> 1775. In 1211 there were eighteen Canons, but the number grew to twenty-four in 1431, when Pope Eugenius IV ordered their reduction to eighteen again. In 1523 the Emperor Charles V added six more Canons, bringing the number back up to twenty-four. There were again twenty-four Canons in 1677 and twenty-six Canons in 1775. [...] The Chapter had the right to elect the Archbishop.|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{companies}} that he recorded for at this stage in his career reduced Hope's <b>dignity,</b> <b>in</b> the view of musician and critic Robert Palmer. One album was entitled High Hope! (1961), and another, released as Sounds from Rikers Island (1963) in reference to a New York City jail complex, featured performances exclusively by musicians who had at some point been imprisoned for drug-related crimes. Between these two sessions as leader, Hope was briefly in prison again for drug offenses. These and other album releases in the early 1960s did little to develop a wider awareness of Hope.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Yaroslavich {{escaped from}} captivity in early 1189 or 1190. With the {{assistance}} of Casimir II of Poland, he expelled Andrew from Halych, and regained control of the principality. In 1191, Béla met his son-in-law, Isaac II, in Philippopolis (now Plovdiv in Bulgaria) and Syrmium, but {{the results of their}} negotiations remained unknown. Upon Béla's request, the Holy See approved the canonization of Ladislaus I of Hungary in 1192. Béla invaded Serbia at the beginning of 1193. Isaac II demanded the withdrawal of his troops, and threatened Béla with war. At the same time, Doge Enrico Dandolo attempted to occupy Zadar, but failed. In 1193, Béla granted Modruš County in Croatia to Bartholomew of Krk, a member of the Frankopan family. This is the earliest certain example of an office being granted as a hereditary <b>dignity</b> <b>in</b> the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E
5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and <b>dignity</b> <b>in</b> the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E

He reformed the post-office, improved the banking system of Russia, regulated the finances, constructed roads, and united the Uniate and Orthodox churches. On the death of Catherine, Emperor Paul entrusted Bezborodko with {{the examination of the}} late empress's private papers, and shortly afterwards made him a prince of the Russian Empire, with a correspondingly splendid apanage.

25|$|Group {{psychological}} abuse refers to groups where methods of {{psychological abuse}} are frequently or systematically used on their members. Such abuse would be practices that treat the members as objects one {{is free to}} manipulate instead of respecting their autonomy, human rights, identity and <b>dignity.</b> <b>In</b> a group they may also play mind games with another person that can make the victim seem like they are accepted, but in actuality are backstabbing the person when his/her back is turned.

25|$|There is {{disagreement}} among American physicians as {{to whether}} the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of euthanasia. Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Around the world there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of physician assisted death, or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the Hemlock Society of the United States and the <b>Dignity</b> <b>in</b> Dying campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient’s life only if the patient is conscious enough to decide for themselves, is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.|$|E
25|$|During {{his college}} years, La Luz became {{involved}} in the Students for a Democratic Society, speaking out on issues such as the war in Vietnam. He also became involved with local Puerto Rican Farm Workers organizations in the Tobacco Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts. La Luz was one of the key community organizers to secure new rights for migrant workers in the area by putting public pressure on the Labor Department of Puerto Rico and denouncing the deplorable conditions that the migrant workers were working under. He also helped merge the local farm workers with Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers of America. La Luz credits César Chávez and Martin Luther King, Jr. as being his greatest influences in understanding the importance of justice and <b>dignity</b> <b>in</b> the quest for civil and human rights.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{and cruelty}} of life were harmonically {{combined}} {{in the works}} that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, Shoeshine (1946), The Bicycle Thief (1948) and Miracle in Milan (1951). The 1952 film Umberto D. showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his <b>dignity</b> <b>in</b> the loneliness of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece {{and one of the}} most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.|$|E

25|$|The black humor {{employed}} by Ichikawa has also often {{been the subject}} of comment by others. It has been claimed that Eiji Funakoshi was fundamentally a comic actor. The noted Japanese film critic Tadao Sato points out that Funakoshi does not play his role in Fires on the Plain in the usual style of post-World War II anti-war Japanese films. He does not put on the pained facial expression and the strained walk typical of the genre, but instead staggers confused through the film more like a drunk man. Sato says that this gives the film its black-comic style which results from watching a man trying to maintain his human <b>dignity</b> <b>in</b> a situation which makes this impossible. Quandt notes that Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, wrote the script to the film and contributed this sardonic wit. Audie Bock says that this black humor, rather than relieving the bleakness of the film, has the effect of actually heightening the darkness.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Oregon Right to Die, a {{political}} action committee, was founded to draft and pass Oregon's Death with Dignity ballot measure 16. The following year the Oregon Right to Die PAC (ORDPAC) campaigned successfully for {{the passage of}} Measure 16 in Oregon; 51% of Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity ballot initiative which created the Oregon Death With Dignity Law (DWD) allowing those who are terminally ill to hasten death in consultation with their physician and under strict safeguards, making Oregon the first U.S. state {{and one of the}} first jurisdictions in the world to officially do so. Subsequently, the Oregon Death with Dignity Legal Defense and Education Center (ODLDEC), the forerunner to the Death with Dignity National Center, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded to defend the voter-approved law. In 1997, Oregon Right to Die Political Action Committee successfully defeated Measure 51, an attempt to ban Death with <b>Dignity</b> <b>in</b> Oregon, by a margin of 60% to 40%.|$|E
