5|$|Thrips are haplodiploid with haploid males (from unfertilised eggs, as in Hymenoptera) and diploid females {{capable of}} {{parthenogenesis}} (reproducing without fertilisation), many species using arrhenotoky, a few using thelytoky. The sex-determining bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> {{that affects the}} reproductive mode. Several normally bisexual species have become established in the United States with only females present.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E

5000|$|Climatic {{conditions}} have been thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the reduced numbers as well. Because the seeds require wet conditions to break dormancy, drought can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor.</b> The lack of moisture discourages {{the development of}} the seeds and promotes prolonged dormant stage.|$|R
5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E
5|$|The Patagonian {{climate is}} {{classified}} as arid to semi-arid and temperate to cool temperate. One defining characteristic are the strong winds from the west which blow year round (stronger in summer than in winter), which favors evaporation and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in making the region mostly arid. There are three major factors that influence the climate of the region: the Andes, the South Pacific High and South Atlantic High, and an isolation that is more pronounced in eastern than western areas.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System's {{location}} in the Milky Way <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are {{at roughly the same}} speed as that of the spiral arms. Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve. The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life. Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.|$|E

5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
