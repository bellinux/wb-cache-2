40|$|In this dissertation, GaN {{growth on}} porous {{templates}} by metalorganic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD) was studied. The motivation {{of this research is}} pursuing an effective reduction of defects in GaN by its submicron-scale and nano-scale epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) on these porous templates, which included porous TiN/GaN (P-TiN), imprint lithography patterned Ti/GaN (IL-Ti), carbon-face nano-porous SiC (C-PSC), and silicon-face nano-porous SiC (Si-PSC). The porous TiN/GaN was formed in situ in MOCVD reactor by annealing a Ti-covered GaN seed layer. This simplicity makes <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> ELO on <b>the</b> P-TiN more cost-efficient than the conventional ELO which requires ex situ photolithography and/or etching. Both <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> nano-ELO and <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> micron-ELO could be realized on P-TiN by controlling <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> nucleation scheme. <b>The</b> reduction efficacy of edge threading dislocation (TD) was ~ 15 times. The optical characterization indicated that the non-radiative point-defects in GaN grown were reduced significantly on the P-TiN. The imprint lithography patterned Ti/GaN had uniformly distributed submicron Ti pads on GaN seed layer. These Ti pads acted as <b>GaN</b> ELO masks. <b>The</b> TD reduction efficacy of the IL-Ti was only ~ 2 due to the low coverage of Ti (~ 25 %) on <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> seed layer and the low pressure (30 Torr) employed during GaN ELO. Even with a small reduction of TDs, <b>the</b> point-defects in <b>GaN</b> were effectively lowered by the IL-Ti. Hydrogen polishing, sacrificial oxidation, and chemical mechanical polishing were employed to remove surface damage on the PSC substrates. Nitrogen-polarity <b>GaN</b> grown on <b>the</b> C-PSC was highly dislocated because the rough surface of C-PSC induced strong misorientation between <b>GaN</b> nucleation islands. <b>The</b> efficacy of Si-PSC on defect reduction primarily depended on <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> nucleation schemes. A high density of GaN nano-nucleation-islands was required to realize <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> nano-ELO extensively. With such a nucleation scheme, <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> grown on Si-PSC had a ~ 20 times reduction on the density of the mixed and screw TDs compared with control sample. This growth method is promising for effective defect reduction within a small <b>GaN</b> thickness. Reducing <b>the</b> <b>GaN</b> nucleation density further lowered the TD density but also diminished the efficacy of Si-PSC. These results were explained by a growth model based on the mosaic structure of GaN...|$|R

The 3.35 eV or Y 4 peak observed in GaN has been assigned to the excitons bound to the stacking faults in <b>the</b> as-grown <b>GaN</b> samples [17].
