5|$|A Sinclair Executive {{purchased}} by a Russian diplomat <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> his breast pocket, allegedly {{leading to an}} official Soviet investigation.

5|$|Automobile {{production}} <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. and {{in other}} nations during the 1920s. This, and {{the increasing use of}} petroleum derivatives to power factories and industrial equipment, substantially increased worldwide demand for oil.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population. The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> the ship's engine rooms.|$|E

5|$|Hardcore punk was the {{response}} of American youths to the worldwide punk rock explosion of the late 1970s. Hardcore stripped punk rock and New Wave of its sometimes elitist and artsy tendencies, resulting in short, fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth. Hardcore <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> the American metropolises of Los Angeles, Washington, DC, New York and Boston and most American cities had their own local scenes {{by the end of}} the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 1994, a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA near the pier was defused by a {{controlled}} explosion. A similar bomb {{by the same}} perpetrators had <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> Bognor Regis on the same day. The bombing was intended to mark the 25th anniversary of the start of The Troubles. The pier was closed for several days owing to police investigation.|$|E

On 18 February 1991, an IRA bomb <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> a litter bin, killing David Corner, and injuring 38. A general bomb warning for all main line stations had been received by telephone at 0700, but the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch {{chose not to}} close the stations.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680. The remnant of this explosion, Cassiopeia Ais heavily obscured by interstellar dust, which is possibly why it {{did not make a}} notable appearance. However it can be observed {{in other parts of the}} spectrum, and it is currently the brightest radio source beyond our solar system.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Italian fleet {{for the first}} decade of their careers. They saw action in the Italo-Turkish War of 19111912, where they participated in the seizure of Cyrenaica in North Africa and operations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They were reduced to training ships by World War I, and both ships were lost with heavy death tolls during the conflict. Benedetto Brin <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> Brindisi in September 1915, and Regina Margherita struck a mine and sank in December 1916.|$|E

5|$|Defence was sunk on 31 May 1916 {{during the}} Battle of Jutland, the largest naval {{battle of the}} war. Escorting {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet, the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she {{attempted}} to engage a disabled German light cruiser. She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine. The fire from that explosion spread to the ship's secondary magazines, which <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> turn. There were no survivors.|$|E
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was {{closed to the public}} in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> the gardens.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing {{cartoons}} and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, {{he was wounded}} in the left thigh when a shell <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> the dispatch runners' dugout. Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, and—by his own account—upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.|$|E

On March 23, 2008, a tour bus carrying Tejano singer Emilio Navaira crashed in Bellaire. By 2008, an increasing number of houses sold for over $1,000,000.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} {{as a major}} port saw it become a target for the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> the basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant that much of the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{days later}} Dundas claimed a {{probable}} victory against a Bf 110, after {{a battle with}} German aircraft six miles north of RAF Warmwell at 16:30. Despite firing a 12–14 second burst at the enemy fighter, {{he did not see}} it crash. During the battle Dundas was hit in the leg when a cannon round <b>exploded</b> <b>in</b> his cockpit, but flew again the next day. The Spitfire Dundas flew that day, R6915, still exists, having been preserved by the Imperial War Museum. By 9 October 1940, his score stood at 10 and he was award the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
