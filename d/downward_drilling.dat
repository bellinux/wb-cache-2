At center, several {{derricks}} stand tall, while {{a series}} of wooden structures {{is built into the}} base of the oilrig closest to the foreground. Across these structures to the right sits an automobile behind a wooden fence. At the rightmost corner, a portion of another derrick can be seen, with a tank and piping at its base. A cloud of smoke curls from smoke stacks in the leftmost corner. The distance is a veritable sea of derricks.; Photoprint reads: "Long Beach, Calif. Oil at 10, 000 feet under the earth's surface is one of the geological secrets uncovered by the Shell Company's Nasa Well No. 11, the deepest hole in the world. Eight months have been required in sinking the shaft, which is in the rich Signal Hill field near Long Beach, and the <b>downward</b> <b>drilling</b> will be continued {{as long as it is}} possible mechanically. In the center of this picture is shown the derrick and hoisting machinery by means of which the "deepest hole in the world" was drilled"...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{shows the}} advantages of re-melting post-consumer glass, but also the potential risks of using contaminated cullet in the raw material batch of glass furnaces (e. g. container glass furnaces). As an example of potential advantages: increasing the cullet % in the batch of an efficient end-port fired regenerative container glass furnace from 65 up to 75 % decreased the specific energy consumption from 3. 95 MJ/kg molten glass to 3. 8 MJ/kg and reduced the direct CO 2 emissions with 31 grams per kg glass. Additional, lower indirect CO 2 emissions can be taken into account, since less primary raw materials have to be applied, saving fossil energy in raw material synthesis (e. g. synthetic soda production). Waste glass has to be sorted and prepared in dedicated cullet recycling (treatment) plants (CTP) to meet the strict quality standards often expressed in maximum mass fraction of ceramics, stones, china, metal (ferro & non-ferro) and color mismatches that can still be accepted. But, also the presence of organic components (fats, oils, sugar, food residues, [...] ) has to be controlled to avoid production or glass color problems. Contamination of cullet may lead to: 1. Glass quality problems: inclusions or color changes; 2. Glass melting disturbances by foaming or limited heat transfer into melt; 3. Glass furnace lifetime, by <b>downward</b> <b>drilling</b> of melts of metals, present in the cullet. The most important problems today {{are related to the}} presence of glass ceramics in the post-consumer waste glass and the variable amount of different colors in the glass cullet or fluctuating contamination by organics. Even small pieces of china or glass ceramics in the cullet, with sizes less than 5 mm, may end as glass defects in glass products. Larger pieces of glass ceramics may even lead to severe interruptions in the gob formation process, due to problems with cutting of the gobs with high viscous inclusions. In modern cullet treatment plants most ferro- and non-ferro metals are rather effectively removed. Glass-ceramics are very difficult to distinguish from normal soda-lime-silica glass, because color and transparency can be almost the same. Specific techniques have to be applied to detect glass-ceramic pieces in the cullet based on X-Ray absorption, X-Ray fluorescence, Hyper-spectral Imaging or UV techniques. Such systems are recently applied in modern waste glass treatment plants in Europe, delivering recycling cullet to the glass industry. This paper will show the glass defects related to the presence of glass-ceramics and the typical compositions of these inclusions (often present as cord or big knots). Organic materials can pyrolize within the batch blanket to form carbon rich residues. Carbon or cokes can react with sulfates in the batch and will cause formation of sulfides. A high level of sulfides in the batch (instead of sulfate) will jeopardize the fining process, may cause changes in fining onset temperature, may cause foaming around the batch blanket, or may lead to chemically reduced glass or even amber cords. The process of radiant heat transmission in the melt will change with a variation of the oxidation state of the melt (redox state of batch & cullet). Examples of glass defects caused by metal contamination in the batch will be shown. The composition of the metal inclusions (glass defects) in the glass product may be very different from the composition of the original contamination, causing the defect. An example is metallic aluminum that leads to silicon inclusions in the glass. Nickel sulfide can be formed by pollution of the glass melt by stainless steel flakes. Liquid metals are very aggressive towards the refractory bottom materials of the tank. A droplet of molten lead for instance will drill a hole in the refractory layers: "downward drilling". The presentation will show the relation between glass defects and their origin in contaminated cullet and the mechanism of defect formation or defect conversion...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, medium Ra values (~[*] 2 – 4  Ra) in the {{southwest}} Japan forearc region were explained by fluid release from the young PSP slab (Sano et al. 2009; Umeda et al. 2012), maybe with additional contribution of crustal fluids. Such medium Ra values are in good agreement with our dataset. Fluid migration from the slab could explain the occurrence of deep non-volcanic tremors in the region. Also the lack of Quaternary volcanism makes a significant contribution of fluids from the asthenosphere to the total fluid budget at site C 0002 little likely. We interpret the 3 He/ 4 He ratios measured in C 0002 mud gas samples as a mixture of air, introduced by the <b>downward</b> pumped <b>drilling</b> mud, crustal helium and mantle helium released from the subducting PSP.|$|R
50|$|McClure's rescue {{proved to}} be a much more {{difficult}} ordeal than was first anticipated. Within hours of beginning the emergency procedure, the Midland Fire and Police Departments devised a plan that involved drilling another shaft parallel to the well and then drilling a tunnel at a right angle across to it. Enlisting the help of a variety of local (often out-of-work) oil-drillers, the Midland officials had hoped to free McClure in minutes. However, the first workers to arrive on the scene found their tools barely adequate to penetrate the hard rock around the well. It took about six hours to drill the shaft and longer to drill the tunnel, because the jackhammers used were designed for <b>drilling</b> <b>downward,</b> rather than sideways. A mining engineer was eventually brought in to help supervise and coordinate the rescue effort. Forty-five hours after McClure fell into the well, the shaft and tunnel were finally completed.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the last one that is {{currently}} scheduled in the sequence of reports of new data, and therefore, also includes summary comments referencing important data obtained by BSEP since 1983. These BSEP activities document and investigate the origins, hydraulic characteristics, extent, and composition of brine occurrences in the Permian Salado Formation and seepage of that brine into the excavations at the (WIPP) Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. A project concern is that enough brine might be present after sealing and closure to generate large quantities of hydrogen gas by corroding the metal in the waste drums and waste inventory. This report describes progress made during the calendar years 1992 and 1993 and focuses on four major areas: (1) monitoring of brine inflow, e. g., measuring brines recovered from holes <b>drilled</b> <b>downward</b> from the underground drifts (downholes), upward from the underground drifts (upholes), and from subhorizontal holes from the underground drifts; (2) observations of weeps in the Air Intake Shaft (AIS); (3) further characterization of brine geochemistry; and (4) additional characterization of the hydrologic conditions in the fractured zone beneath the excavations...|$|R
40|$|Horizontal wells {{are a very}} {{important}} element in {{oil and gas industry}} due to their distinguished advantages. Horizontal wells are not technically horizontal. This is because of the structural nature of reservoir formations and drilling procedures. In response to the reservoir rock?s strength, the horizontal well deviates upward and <b>downward</b> while being <b>drilled</b> forming an undulating path instead of a horizontal. In this study, horizontal wells with an undulating trajectory within a gas reservoir have been studied. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of the trajectory angle on pressure drop in horizontal wells. In addition, the contribution of water flow to pressure drop is a part of this research. Generally, water comes from different sources like an aquifer or a water flood job. In low permeability horizontal wells, hydraulic fracturing introduces water to gas wells. Water distribution is an important issue in gas wells production. In order to achieve the goal of this study, a model has been developed to simulate different situations for a horizontal well with an undulating trajectory in gas reservoirs. This study is a step forward to understand well performance in low permeability gas reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Abundant iron-titanium (Fe-Ti) oxide gabbro, olivine gabbro, and troctolite were drilled at Hole 735 B {{adjacent}} to the Atlantis II Fracture Zone of the Southwest Indian Ridge during Leg 118. The Fe-Ti oxide gabbro occurs as intrusive bodies into olivine gabbro with very sharp intrusive contacts. The size of the intrusive bodies varies from a millimeter to a few tens of meters. Mineralogical parameters, such as anorthite content of plagioclase and Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios of mafic minerals exhibit bimodal distributions corresponding to olivine and Fe-Ti oxide gabbros, respectively. When the two major gabbro types are looked at separately, several downhole mineralogical cycles are recognized. The Fe-Ti oxide gabbros exhibit two such cycles with plagioclase becoming more sodic and mafic minerals becoming more iron-rich <b>downward</b> in the <b>drill</b> core. The olivine gabbros and troctolites, however, exhibit two cycles showing an upward increase in sodium in plagioclase and iron in mafic minerals. The mineralogical variations of these gabbros and the intrusive contact relationships probably resulted from downward intrusion of evolved magma into underlying solid or almost solidified olivine gabbros and troctolite. The dense evolved melt {{at the top of}} the cumulus pile probably formed from the crystallization of olivine gabbro cumulates followed by extreme fractional crystallization of residual melt in an isolated, ephemeral magma chamber. The interlayered occurrence of evolved and primitive gabbros from Hole 735 B represents a typical section of lower ocean crust formed at a very slow spreading ridge...|$|R
40|$|This paper details a {{comprehensive}} control {{structure and the}} application in managed pressure drilling (MPD). The goal of this controller is to regulate the downhole pressure and rate of penetration (ROP) at desired values and attenuate any unwanted gas influx. For this purpose, a moving horizon estimator (MHE), an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) are designed to estimate and regulate the process. MHE and EKF provide the estimated unmeasured variables values to the controller to update the NMPC model and enable the controller to capture varying dynamics of the drilling process. During MPD, the main pump sends the drilling mud {{into the middle of}} the drill string pipe. This mud travels <b>downward</b> through the <b>drill</b> bit and into the annulus and upward to the choke valve. Mud is used to remove the drilling cuttings and also to maintain a hydrostatic pressure at the drill bit against reservoir pore pressure. Rotation speed of the drill string (RPM) and weight on the bit (WOB), the amount of downward force placed on the drill bit, are two of the main factors that affect the drilling rate. Drill string rotation is adjusted with a top drive and WOB is adjusted by actuation above ground. As a result of hydraulic forces, torsional spring characteristics of the drill string, frictional losses, non-Newtonian mud flow, and other effects, the downhole WOB and RPM may be dynamically different tha...|$|R
