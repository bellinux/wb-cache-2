A colony {{of up to}} 20,000 barnacle geese, over 10,000 <b>greylag</b> geese and thousands of waders stop on the coastal pastures in spring. The most numerous birds of passage (around 1.6 million) are long-tailed ducks. Approximately 35,000—40,000 ducks feed in the reedbeds in spring. In autumn, about 300,000 migratory waterfowl pass Matsalu. The wetland is the biggest autumn stopping ground of common cranes in Europe. The highest recorded number of cranes at the park has been 23,000.|$|E
5|$|The <b>greylag</b> goose (Anser anser) was domesticated by the Egyptians {{at least}} 3000 years ago, and a {{different}} wild species, the swan goose (Anser cygnoides), domesticated in Siberia about a thousand years later, {{is known as a}} Chinese goose. The two hybridise with each other and the large knob {{at the base of the}} beak, a noticeable feature of the Chinese goose, is present to a varying extent in these hybrids. The hybrids are fertile and have resulted in several of the modern breeds. Despite their early domestication, geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens and ducks.|$|E
25|$|Domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus or Anser cygnoides domesticus) are domesticated grey geese (either <b>greylag</b> geese or swan geese) {{that are}} kept by humans as poultry for their meat, eggs, and down {{feathers}} since ancient times.|$|E

The writer has also noted that geese of all species, when unable to undertake north ward migration through injury, will join forces during the summer months. In the summer of 1964, for example, two Barnacles, two <b>Greylags</b> and one Pink footed Goose formed an almost inseparable unit which was temporarily supplemente...|$|R
50|$|Young <b>greylags</b> {{stay with}} their parents as a family group, {{migrating}} with them in a larger flock, and only dispersing when the adults drive them away from their newly established breeding territory the following year. At least in Europe, patterns of migration are well understood and follow traditional routes with known staging sites and wintering sites. The young learn these locations from their parents which normally stay together for life. <b>Greylags</b> leave their northern breeding areas relatively late in the autumn, for example completing their departure from Iceland by November, and start their return migration as early as January. Birds that breed in Iceland overwinter in the British Isles; those from Central Europe overwinter {{as far south as}} Spain and North Africa; others migrate down to the Balkans, Turkey and Iraq for the winter.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{moulting}} period ofGreylag Geese in the Oostvaardersplas-sen, The Netherlands, {{coincides with}} {{a period of}} rapid growth in their food plant Phragmites australis. During moult there is a continuous decrease in {{quantity and quality of}} the available food stock. As a consequence of food shortage, a large number oflate arriving <b>Greylags</b> did not moult in the Oost-vaardersplassen, but showed a reversed migration back to Scandinavia. The significance of this phenomenon is discussed in relation to the phenology of the food plants at different sites in Europe...|$|R
25|$|Frederiksberg Gardens is an English-style Romantic {{landscape}} {{garden with}} winding paths, canals, lakes, small islands and magnificent trees. A large variety {{of plants and}} birds can be seen, including mute swans, <b>greylag</b> geese, mallards, grey herons, and Canada geese.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{domestic}} geese descended from the <b>Greylag</b> goose are effectively the same species as their wild ancestor (being a subspecies formed through domestication), escaped individuals readily breed with wild populations, resulting in the offspring sometimes resembling either one of their parents, or bearing mixed plumage with patterns of grey and white feathers.|$|E
25|$|The {{karyotype}} of {{the swan}} goose is 2n=80, consisting of four pairs of macrochromosomes, 35 pairs of microchromosomes, {{and a pair}} of sex chromosomes. The two largest macrochromosome pairs as well as the Z (female) chromosome are submetacentric, while the third-largest chromosome pair is acrocentric and the fourth-largest is metacentric. The W chromosomes are acrocentric too, as are the larger microchromosomes, the smaller ones probably being telocentric. Compared to the <b>greylag</b> goose, there seems to have been some rearrangement on the fourth-largest chromosome pair.|$|E
40|$|This bird report {{covers the}} years 1978 and 1979 and completes {{a period of}} 30 years of {{observations}} by a contingent of resident and visiting ornithologists in the Rhône delta and neighbouring Crau and Alpilles. It presents not only observations of rare species or unusual numbers of birds, but also indicates the results of several long term monitoring programmes concerning in particular, waterfowl and allied species. A climatological report summarizes the most important meteorological phenomena of the two years, the most striking of which were the very wet spring of 1978 and the dry summer of 1979. The winter of 1978 - 1979 must surely be remembered in northern and central Europe {{as one of the}} most severe this century. In the Mediterranean, however, it was much less severe and, fortunately, had none of the disastrous effects of the previous hard winters of 1956 and 1962 - 1963. "La Crau", a unique stony desert area and former delta of the River Durance, is suffering seriously from the spread of industry and from agricultural reclamation. Some of the first census work to be carried out here shows just how important the area is for breeding Stone Curlews, Little Bustards and Pin-tailed Sandgrouse in particular. The sandgrouse population is an isolated one, the species occurring elsewhere in Europe only in parts of Spain. Observations of sea birds are not carried out systematically and more thorough sea-watching would probably show that many of the species mentioned here are regularly wintering in the "Golfe du Lion". Unusually high numbers of Black-necked Grebes appear each autumn in the saline "Etang de Lavalduc" (up to 4, 500), which makes it an internationally important site for this species. Whilst the herons as a group maintain their numbers, several notable changes have taken place in recent years. The reed-nesting Grey Heron continues to increase whilst the Purple clearly shows the opposite trend. The Cattle Egret, occuring only as an accidentai visitor less than 15 years ago, appears now to have reached the peak of colonisation with the numbers of breeding pairs levelling off. Autumn roost counts show the total of individuals at close to 2, 000. The first indications of roughly how many Bitterns breed in the Camargue are given whilst the second only record of White Storks breeding in the delta involved one semi-captive male and a wild female carrying a ring. This was a chick transplanted from Morocco to a nest in Alsace as part of a reintroduction programme in 1975. The flamingos again had two successful breeding seasons and the summer population for the south coast of France peaked at over 35, 000 birds both years. Particularly interesting data are being gatbered from the sightings of "Darvic-ringed" birds, 1858 of which have thus been marked over the past three years. 24 % of these have already been read outside France. Amongst the Anseriiformes, the wintering Bewick's Swan population was the highest yet recorded with a maximum of 85 in January 1979. During this same period four species of geese were present with <b>Greylags</b> and Bean's bath reaching one hundred or more individuals. Counts of Shelducks have shawn how important the salines are bath as a breeding area and winter quarters, and a ringing programme has thrown some light on their movements. For other ducks the overall wintering population has been quite high with a peak of 122, 000 in January 1979. In general the number of diving ducks was below average but this was compensated for by several of the surface feeders being present in large numbers, in particular Teal, Gadwall and Shoveler. The list of raptor observations is as impressive as ever and includes a second estimate of the breeding Marsh Harrier population with results slightly superior to those obtained ten years earlier. The eighth complete census of breeding Lara-limicoles was carried out in the brackish and salt water zone of the greater Camargue area. All species are maintaining their numbers and attention is drawn to the increasing populations of Mediterranean and Slender-billed Gulls. Nearctic waders already observed in the delta included sightings of Buff-breasted Sandpiper and Wilson's Phalarope whilst the Pectoral was only the second reported. Eagle Owls in "Les Alpilles" appear to be increasing with 30 pairs recorded. Passerines have not been ignored entirely; the continued increase of breeding Stonechats is encouraging whilst the successful nesting of a pair of Red-billed Quelea in the Camargue adds an exotic flavour to this repor...|$|R
25|$|This type of {{ecosystem}} is {{noted for its}} variety and large population of birds, some of them very rare. The most important are the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula, red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), <b>greylag</b> goose (Anser anser), pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmeus), purple heron (Ardea purpurea), great white egret (Egretta alba), little egret (Egretta garzetta), eurasian spoonbill(Platalea leucorodia), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), mute swan (Cygnus olor), and glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus). A recent and welcomed newcomer is the pheasant (Phasianus colchicus).|$|E
25|$|Changes to the plumage are variable; {{many have}} been {{selected}} to lose dark brown tones of the wild bird. The result is an animal marked, or completely covered in white feathers. Others retain plumage close to the natural; some, such as the modern Toulouse goose look almost identical to the <b>greylag</b> in plumage, differing only in structure. White geese are often preferred as they look better plucked and dressed, with any small down feathers remaining being less conspicuous. From {{the time of the}} Romans, white geese have been held in great esteem.|$|E
25|$|Kingfishers {{have been}} seen just {{downstream}} and the estate's woodland policies and river contain, amongst others, tawny and barn owls, herons, mallard, ravens, rooks, treecreepers, buzzards, peewits or lapwings, roe deer, mink, moles, shrews, grey squirrels, hares, hedgehogs, foxes, badgers, pipistrelle bats and probably otters. Migrating Canada and <b>greylag</b> geese frequent the nearby fields on their way up from the Caerlaverock or coming down from Spitzbergen in the winter. Duncan McNaught in 1895 records that he found a kingfisher's nest at an arms length inside an earthen burrow at Chapelton on the Annick.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{northern}} Africa, {{and western}} Asia, the original domesticated geese {{are derived from}} the <b>greylag</b> goose Anser anser. In eastern Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the swan goose Anser cygnoides; these {{are commonly known as}} Chinese geese. Both have been widely introduced in more recent times, and modern flocks in both areas (and elsewhere, such as Australia and North America) may consist of either species, and/or hybrids between them. Chinese geese may be readily distinguished from European geese by the large knob {{at the base of the}} bill, though hybrids may exhibit every degree of variation between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley of}} the Charente {{upstream}} from Angoulême is a Natura 2000 zone with remarkable species: 64 species of birds. Among them are species for marshland and wetland; and at Angoulême {{it is common to}} see diving and swimming birds, swans (mute swan), grebes (black-necked grebe, little grebe, horned grebe, great crested grebe), geese (<b>greylag</b> goose), ducks (gadwall, pintail, wigeon, shoveler), teal (garganey, teal) and scaup (pochard, tufted duck) on the Charente. It is more rare to see waders. Terns, gulls (laughing gull), great cormorants, return during periods of storms from far upstream on the river.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} bird {{species of the}} river basin reduced sharply over the past 100–150 years. The {{disappeared}} species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, sociable lapwing, bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as Streptopelia, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, Charadriiformes, Podiceps, great reed warbler and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of demoiselle cranes remain in the area, near Svyatogorsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by <b>greylag</b> and black geese.|$|E
25|$|Most bird strikes involve large {{birds with}} big populations, {{particularly}} geese and gulls in the United States. In {{parts of the}} US, Canada geese and migratory snow geese populations have risen significantly while feral Canada geese and <b>greylag</b> geese have increased in parts of Europe, increasing the risk of these large birds to aircraft. In {{other parts of the}} world, large birds of prey such as Gyps vultures and Milvus kites are often involved. In the US, reported strikes are mainly from waterfowl (30%), gulls (22%), raptors (20%), and pigeons and doves (7%). The Smithsonian Institution's Feather Identification Laboratory has identified turkey vultures as the most damaging birds, followed by Canada geese and white pelicans, all of which are very large birds. In terms of frequency, the laboratory most commonly finds mourning doves and horned larks involved in the strike.|$|E
25|$|The campus lake is {{the largest}} plastic-bottomed lake in Europe. The {{decision}} by Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Stirrat Johnson-Marshall to give the university a lake had two motivations: one, to give the university a distinct image and identity while also creating areas to foster community; and two, more practically to create a drainage basin {{as the site of}} the Heslington West was built on generally flat agricultural land and it was feared the construction of the new buildings would increase the risk of flooding. The lake has attracted a large population of wild and semi-wild waterfowl, including <b>greylag,</b> Canada, barnacle and snow geese, coots, moorhens and large numbers of ducks, including mallards, tufted duck, and common pochards. There is also a growing population of black swans and a few great crested grebe. Herons have also been sighted on the lake. The southern end of the lake has been established as a bird sanctuary. Fishing is permitted in season, on purchase of a licence.|$|E

50|$|Anser anser, the <b>greylag</b> goose, is {{a member}} of the {{waterfowl}} family Anatidae. It was first described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 as Anas anser, but was transferred two years later to the new genus Anser, erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson, where it is the type species. Two subspecies are recognised; A. a. anser, the western <b>greylag</b> goose, breeds in Iceland and north and central Europe; A. a. rubrirostris, the eastern <b>greylag</b> goose, breeds in Romania, Turkey and Russia eastwards to northeastern China. The two subspecies intergrade where their ranges meet. The <b>greylag</b> goose sometimes hybridises with other species of goose including the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), and occasionally with the mute swan (Cygnus olor). The <b>greylag</b> goose was one of the first animals to be domesticated; this happened at least 3000 years ago in Ancient Egypt, the domestic breed being known as A. a. domesticus. As the domestic goose is a subspecies of the <b>greylag</b> goose they are able to interbreed, with the offspring sharing characteristics of both the wild and tame birds.|$|E
