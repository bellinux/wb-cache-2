Equal gain-combining (EGC) and selection-combining (SC) techniques are considered as practical schemes {{to mitigate the}} atmospheric turbulence under thermal-noise-limited conditions. Bit-error rate (BER) performances for on-off keying-modulated direct detection and outage probabilities are analyzed and compared for SC <b>diversity</b> <b>receptions</b> using analytical results and for EGC <b>diversity</b> <b>receptions</b> through an approximation method. To show the net diversity gain of a multiple-aperture receiver system, BER performances and outage probabilities of EGC and SC receiver systems are compared with a single monolithic-aperture receiver system with the same total aperture area (same average total incident optical power) for satellite-to-ground downlink optical communications.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{performance}} of frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS) systems employing noncoherent reception is analyzed for frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Two different types of diversity transmission techniques, a fast frequency-hopping (FFH) system and a multicarrier frequency-hopping (MCFH) system are investigated. In order to combine <b>diversity</b> <b>receptions,</b> the optimum combining scheme is developed. The probability of error equations are derived, and utilized to evaluate {{the performance}} of the two systems. MCFH systems are found to outperform FFH systems when the channel delay spread is severe, while FFH systems are superior to MCFH systems when a channel varies rapidly. Furthermore, it is found that performance enhancement due to an increase of diversity order is more significant for MCFH systems than for FFH systems in frequency-selective fading channels. The effect of frequency-selective fading is also investigated in determining optimum frequency deviations of BFSK signals. I...|$|R

40|$|We derive a {{comprehensive}} analytical {{framework for the}} ED over generalized, extreme, and non-linear fading conditions which addresses the topic completely. This is carried out for both conventional and <b>diversity</b> <b>receptions</b> and {{it is based on}} the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which is an efficient performance measure that is widely used in physical sciences and engineering. This differentiates the considered methodology from the aforementioned routine approaches and additionally provides generic results on the arbitrary derivatives of the MGF of useful generalized processes. The asymptotic behavior of the derived expressions is also analyzed providing direct and concrete insights on the role and effect of the involved parameters on the ED performance. The offered analytic results are subsequently employed in quantifying the performance of ED over various types of fading conditions, which exhibits that ED performance is significantly degraded by even slight variations of the severity of fading. To this end, it is shown that the detrimental effects of fading can be effectively mitigated with the aid of square-law combining and switch-and-stay combining methods, as a low number of diversity branches can ensure sufficient and holistic performance improvement even in severe fading conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} modulation schemes {{optimized for}} two–way wireless relaying systems, for which network coding is employed at the physical layer. We consider network coding based on denoise–and–forward (DNF) protocol, {{which consists of}} two stages: multiple access (MA) stage, where two terminals transmit simultaneously towards a relay, and broadcast (BC) stage, where the relay transmits towards the both terminals. We introduce the design principles of modulation and network coding, suited for the BC stage by considering the superposed constellations during the MA stage. For the case of QPSK modulations at the MA stage, we show that the QPSK constellation with an exclusive–or (XOR) network coding does not always offer the best transmission for the BC stage, {{and that there are}} several channel conditions in which the unconventional 5 –ary constellations lead to a better throughput performance. Through the use of sphere packing, we optimize the constellation for such an irregular network coding. We further discuss the design issue of the modulation in the case when the relay exploits <b>diversity</b> <b>receptions</b> such as multiple–antenna diversity and path diversity in frequency– selective fading. In addition, we apply the presented design strategy to a relaying system using higher–level modulations of 16 QAM in the MA stage. Performance evaluations confirm that the proposed scheme can achieve a significant improvement in end–to–end throughput for two–way relaying systems.

50|$|Antenna {{diversity}} is especially effective at mitigating these multipath situations. This is because multiple antennas offer a receiver several {{observations of the}} same signal.

5000|$|Most work on {{wireless}} communications {{until the early}} 1990s had focused on having an antenna array at only {{one end of the}} wireless link — usually at the receiver. Seminal papers by Gerard J. Foschini and Michael J. Gans, Foschini [...] and Emre Telatar enlarged the scope of wireless communication possibilities by showing that for the highly scattering environment substantial capacity gains are enabled when antenna arrays are used at both ends of a link.An alternative approach to utilizing multiple antennas relies on having multiple transmit antennas and only optionally multiple receive antennas. Proposed by Vahid Tarokh, Nambi Seshadri and Robert Calderbank, these space-time codes (STCs) achieve significant error rate improvements over single-antenna systems. Their original scheme was based on trellis codes but the simpler block codes were utilised by Siavash Alamouti, and later Vahid Tarokh, Hamid Jafarkhani and Robert Calderbank to develop space-time block-codes (STBCs). STC involves the transmission of multiple redundant copies of data to compensate for fading and thermal noise in the hope that some of them may arrive at the receiver in a better state than others. In the case of STBC in particular, the data stream to be transmitted is encoded in blocks, which are distributed among spaced antennas and across time. While it is necessary to have multiple transmit antennas, {{it is not necessary to}} have multiple receive antennas, although to do so improves performance. This process of receiving diverse copies of the data is known as <b>diversity</b> <b>reception</b> and is what was largely studied until Foschini's 1998 paper.|$|E
