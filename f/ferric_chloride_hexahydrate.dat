50|$|A {{variety of}} {{reagents}} {{have been used}} to dope PTs. Iodine and bromine produce highly conductive materials, which are unstable owing to slow evaporation of the halogen. Organic acids, including trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, and sulfonic acids produce PTs with lower conductivities than iodine, but with higher environmental stabilities. Oxidative polymerization with ferric chloride can result in doping by residual catalyst, although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) studies have shown that poly(3-hexylthiophene)s are also partially halogenated by the residual oxidizing agent. Poly(3-octylthiophene) dissolved in toluene can be doped by solutions of <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> dissolved in acetonitrile, and can be cast into films with conductivities reaching 1 S/cm. Other, less common p-dopants include gold trichloride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.|$|E

Six different aluminium compounds and an empty Finn Chamber® were used to patch test 21 patients with aluminium contact allergy. Aluminium <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> in saline was used for intracutaneous injection of 19 patients. Results: One test preparation, aluminium lactate 2. 4 %, was found to show significantly more positive patch test reactions than aluminium <b>chloride</b> <b>hexahydrate</b> 2. 0 % (p = 0. 03).
