5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> {{that the}} mandibles were highly specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} {{further evidence that}} the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E
5|$|Kavirajamarga (850) by King Amoghavarsha I is the {{earliest}} available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> from this book that native styles of Kannada composition had already existed in previous centuries. Kavirajamarga is {{a guide to}} poets (Kavishiksha) that aims to standardize these various styles. The book refers to early Kannada prose and poetry writers such as Durvinita, perhaps the 6th-century monarch of Western Ganga Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Peter von Bagh regards Vainio as {{the pioneer}} of Finnish 1960s humorous songs since he began their {{composition}} before Irwin Goodman. Producer Jaakko Salo commented that Vainio's career {{found a new}} start once Vainio quit drinking. According to him, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> from Vainio's texts that his songs are based on his own experiences.|$|E

5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident,</b> that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that she must have belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E
5|$|The DVD's special {{features}} include {{an interview with}} Wiseau, who is asked questions by an off-screen Greg Sestero. Wiseau sits {{directly in front of}} a fireplace, with a mantel cluttered by various props from the film; next to him sits a large framed theatrical poster for the film. A few of Wiseau's answers are dubbed in, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that the dubbed responses match what he was originally saying. Wiseau fails to answer several of the questions, instead offering non sequiturs.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter Asser {{seems to}} have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no {{information}} about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> from Asser's account that he {{spent a good deal}} of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of}} the local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, {{most of the major}} structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{explanation}} {{is provided in}} the biographies of the Ridwan family, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> they chose Gaza as their home and the place for their castle. Ridwan Pasha's son Ahmad Pasha succeeded him and governed Gaza for thirty years, sometimes incorporating the sanjaks of Nablus and Jerusalem. He became Governor of Damascus Eyalet in 1601 after bribing several viziers and bureaucrats in Istanbul and died in 1607. Next in line was Hasan Pasha ibn Ahmad who became known 'Arab Hasan ("Hasan the Bedouin") because by then, the Ridwans were identified with the control {{and knowledge of the}} Bedouin. He successfully led his pro-Ottoman Bedouin troops against the army of the rebel Fakhr ad-Din in a series of battles. He was later appointed Governor of Tripoli in Lebanon, but he was deposed in 1644. 'Arab Hasan had many wives and concubines and 85 children. He led the Ridwans successfully militarily, however, he burdened the dynasty with heavy debt.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
5|$|In 821, {{the year}} of Coenwulf's death, a council was held in London at which Coenwulf {{threatened}} to exile Wulfred if the archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 pounds to the king. Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms, but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf's death, with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf's brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that some accommodation had been reached by that time. Wulfred had probably resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year.|$|E

5|$|In {{later life}} she {{converted}} to Buddhism and remained single thereafter, largely {{retiring from the}} world. Even in her eighties, however, she was still active in the literary world, entertaining female artists such as Huang Yuanjie and Yi Lin at her home on the West Lake {{after the collapse of}} the Ming Dynasty. With her Buddhist friend Yang Jiangzi (the sister of Xue's fellow courtesan Liu Yin), she made pilgrimages to sacred sites such as Mount Lu and Mount Emei. The date of her death is uncertain; some sources suggest that she may have lived into the 1650s whilst others put her death in the late 1630s or early 1640s. Qian Qianyi mentions her death in a work published in 1652, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that she must have died before this date.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Securing the {{favour of}} the priesthood was {{essential}} for the Ptolemaic kings to retain effective rule over the populace. The High Priests of Memphis—where the king was crowned—were particularly important, as they were the highest religious authorities {{of the time and}} had influence throughout the kingdom. Given that the decree was issued at Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, rather than Alexandria, the centre of government of the ruling Ptolemies, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that the young king was anxious to gain their active support. Thus, although the government of Egypt had been Greek-speaking ever since the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Memphis decree, like the two preceding decrees in the series, included texts in Egyptian to show its connection to the general populace by way of the literate Egyptian priesthood.|$|E

5|$|Senior officer Mark (Robin Clarke) radios Sandy – his romantic {{interest}} – {{from the}} Operations Room to stall for time as Kate and operations chief Gary (Steven Grives) depart to requisition chainsaws from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she mauls his flesh. Preparing {{for a final}} confrontation, Mark stumbles across Sandy's newborn, mutant twins. He entrusts them to Sharon as the mother blasts through the Operations Room door and destroys all the equipment inside, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that she no longer possesses unnatural strength. Crippled by an explosive charge, Kate is gored to death. In a last stand, Mark strangles and kills Sandy with a ripped-out cable. He returns to Sharon to discover one of the twins biting at her slit neck, before its sibling launches itself at him.|$|E
5|$|The García {{family is}} an example of this phenomenon. In How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in {{altering}} the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in the Dominican Republic, and is forced to face the challenges which come along with being an immigrant family in a foreign land. Julia Alvarez herself was not born in the Dominican Republic, but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. Clearly in the novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems that normal North American girls do.|$|E
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
