40|$|Using {{numerical}} experiments, {{we investigate}} how river‐dominated <b>delta</b> <b>channel</b> networks {{are likely to}} respond to changes in river discharge predicted to occur over the next century {{as a result of}} environmental change. Our results show for a change in discharge up to 60 % of the initial value, a decrease results in distributary abandonment in the delta, whereas an increase does not significantly affect the network. However, an increase in discharge beyond a threshold of 60 % results in channel creation and an increase in the density of the distributary network. This behavior is predicted by an analysis of an individual bifurcation subject to asymmetric water surface slopes in the bifurcate arms. Given that discharge in most river basins will change by less than 50 % in the next century, our results suggest that deltas in areas of increased drought {{will be more likely to}} experience significant rearrangement of the <b>delta</b> <b>channel</b> network...|$|E

The study has been carried out in the framework of researches by FSBSI "Caspian Fisheries Research Institute" conducted in the period from 2010 to 2014. The main goal was to assess the current state of benthic fauna of output channels of the Volga delta areas against the backdrop of changing water availability of the Volga river. Methods. We have conducted sample processing of zoobenthos within investigated watercourses of the Volga River according to conventional methods of Zhadin V. I. (1960), Winberg G. G. (1984) and Abakumov V. A. (1992). Results. The results of the work on the study of the modern state of the benthic fauna of the Volga <b>delta</b> <b>channels</b> show that the species composition of macrozoobenthos in these sections of the river in dry years was characterized by mass development of oligochaetes. With the increase of water content (between the years 2012 and 2013) in all studied water streams there is a change of the dominant group. With the decrease in the annual runoff (in 2014) the qualitative characteristics of zoobenthos have changed. In the average long-term aspect, the distribution pattern of quantitative indicators of benthic invertebrates in the delta of Volga river was uneven, and their greatest density has been marked in the wet year.

Whereas {{the mechanics of}} river bifurcations is well-understood, junctions in tidal channels have received comparatively little attention in the literature. This paper aims to quantify the tidal impact on subtidal discharge distribution at the bifurcations in the Mahakam Delta, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The Mahakam Delta is a regular fan-shaped delta, composed of a quasi-symmetric network of rectilinear distributaries and sinuous tidal channels. A depth-averaged version of the unstructured-mesh, finite-element model second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model {{has been used to}} simulate the hydrodynamics driven by river discharge and tides in the <b>delta</b> <b>channel</b> network. The model was forced with tides at open sea boundaries and with measured and modeled river discharge at upstream locations. Calibration was performed with water level time series and flow measurements, both spanning a simulation period. Validation was performed by comparing the model results with discharge measurements at the two principal bifurcations in the delta. Results indicate that within 10 to 15 km from the delta apex, the tides alter the river discharge division by about 10 % in all bifurcations. The tidal impact increases seaward, with a maximum value of the order of 30 %. In general, the effect of tides is to hamper the discharge division that would occur in the case without tide...|$|E
40|$|The {{acetylcholine}} receptor (AChR) is a cation selective channel whose biophysical properties {{as well as}} its molecular composition are fairly well characterized. Previous studies on the rat muscle alpha-subunit indicate that a threonine residue located near the cytoplasmic side of the M 2 segment is a determinant of ion flow. We have studied the role of this threonine in ionic selectivity by measuring conductance sequences for monovalent alkali cations and bionic reversal potentials of the wild type (alpha beta gamma <b>delta</b> <b>channel)</b> and two mutant channels in which this threonine was replaced by either valine (alpha T 264 V) or glycine (alpha T 264 G). For the wild type channel we found the selectivity sequence Rb greater than Cs greater than K greater than Na. The alpha T 264 V mutant channel had the sequence Rb greater than K greater than Cs greater than Na. The alpha T 264 G mutant channel on the other hand had the same selectivity sequence as the wild type, but larger permeability ratios Px/PNa for the larger cations. Conductance concentration curves indicate that the effect of both mutations is to change both the maximum conductance as well as the apparent binding constant of the ions to the channel. A difference in Mg 2 + sensitivity between wild-type and mutant channels, which is a consequence of the differences in ion binding, was also found. The present results suggest that alpha T 264 form part of the selectivity filter of the AChR channel were large ions are selected according to their dehydrated size...|$|E

The amount of this displacement is unknown, but large {{movements of the}} S 4 segment should be con strained by the length and flexibility of the S 3 -S 4 Linker. To investigate {{the role of the}} S 3 -S 4 linker in the ShakerH 4 Delta(6 - 46) (Shaker Delta) K+ channel activation, we constructed S 3 -S 4 linker deletion mutants. Using macro-patches of Xenopus oocytes, we tested three constructs: a deletion mutant with no linker (0 aa linker), a mutant containing a linker 5 amino acids in length, and a 10 amino acid linker mutant. Each of the three mutants tested yielded robust K+ currents. The half-activation voltage was shifted to the right along the voltage axis, and the shift was + 45 mV {{in the case of the}} 0 aa linker channel. In the 0 aa linker, mutant deactivation kinetics were sixfold slower than in Shaker Delta. The apparent number of gating charges was 12. 6 +/- 0. 6 e(o) in Shaker Delta, 12. 7 +/- 0. 5 in 10 aa linker, and 12. 3 +/- 0. 9 in 5 aa linker channels, but it was only 5. 6 +/- 0. 3 e(o) in the 0 aa linker mutant channel. The maximum probability of opening (P-o(max)) as measured using noise analysis was not altered by the linker deletions. Activation kinetics were most affected by linker deletions; at 0 mV, the 5 and 0 aa linker channels' activation time constants were 89 x and 45 x slower than that of the Shaker Delta K+ channel, respectively. The initial lag of ionic currents when the prepulse was varied from - 130 to - 60 mV was 0. 5, 14, and 2 ms for the 10, 5, and 0 aa linker mu rant channels, respectively These results suggest that: (a) the 34 segment moves only a short distance during activation since an S 3 -S 4 linker consisting of only 5 amino acid residues allows for the total charge displacement to occur; and (b) die length of tl-le S 3 -S 4 linker plays an important role in setting Shaker <b>Delta</b> <b>channel</b> activation and deactivation kinetics...|$|E

40|$|Ever since 120 years {{people have}} been trying to create {{estuaries}} and tidal inlet systems in experiments, starting with Osborne Reynolds in the 1880 ’s. So far, no group of scientist succeeded creating a physical scale model of a dynamic tidal system. Low‐sediment mobility, ebb‐dominance and the emergence of unrealistic deep scour holes and large ripples as a result of smooth flow were major problems of earlier experiments. Our objective was to create a tidal inlet system in a laboratory physical scale model by applying a novel method to generate flow, to determine what the possible scale effects are, and whether equilibrium morphology exists, in case of a dynamic state. In our experiments morphology emerged that resembled nature with the existence of an ebb‐tidal <b>delta,</b> <b>channel</b> network and inlet channel(s). In contrast to the regular pumping of water, the entire basin (3. 8 m by 1. 2 m) was tilted vertically, over the short axis. This novel method of tilting the experimental set‐up caused an increased sediment mobility in the ebb‐ and flood phase because the bed surface slopes in downstream direction, both during flood and ebb phases. This reduced experimental time from weeks to days. Channels formed through backward erosion and started to bifurcate after retreating from the basin margin to form a network of up to four orders. Channels in the back‐barrier area were found to migrate cyclically. Resemblance with natural cyclic behaviour such as the number of inlet channels existed and typical ebb‐ and flood channels separated by sills were present. The use of light‐weight grains, an initial sediment basin level considerably higher than mean sea level, a start perturbation and non‐erodible barriers were required to create a dynamic tidal inlet system. The parameters most sensitive to the equilibrium morphology were sediment bed level, average water level, inlet width and tidal amplitude. Low average water level with respect to the sediment bed caused long sharply curved channels. These channels had few branches and persisted on the irregularly shaped ebb‐tidal delta. Higher average water levels increased channel migration rates, number of branches and a regularly shaped ebb‐tidal delta formed. Inlet width and tidal amplitude most importantly affected the shape and extent of the back‐barrier basin and ebb‐tidal delta, since they determined the strength of the flow. The effect of a rise in water level was that the back‐barrier area widened and lengthened, channels deepened and the number of channels increased. The ebb‐tidal delta built up in the vertical. In this report possible scale effects, equilibrium state of the system and how the experimental results can be translated to natural systems has been discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{hydrocarbon}} exploration in the Egyptian northern Western Desert and the Gulf of Suez have revealed relatively rich hydrocarbon accumulations, mainly of gas, and demonstrates promising future prospects. In {{order to improve}} our understanding of these areas {{and to provide a}} biostratigraphic framework for the poorly-dated Lower Cretaceous successions palynological analyses were carried out on 134 ditch cutting samples from the Abu Tunis 1 x drilled in the northern Western Desert, and 78 samples from the BB 80 - 1 borehole in the Gulf of Suez area. Palynostratigraphic investigations focussed on the lower parts of the borehole successions as earlier studies have largely ignored these Cretaceous sediments. A central objective was therefore to construct a biostratigraphic scheme, for both boreholes. Analysis of the Abu Tunis 1 x samples enabled the identification of eight palynozones largely defined by first occurrences of spores, gymnosperm and angiosperm pollen and dinoflagellate cysts. Three new palynostratigraphically defined age divisions are described for {{the lower part of the}} Abu Tunis 1 x succession, and a more refined biostratigraphy is made for the upper part of the sequence. In contrast, the Gulf of Suez BB 80 - 1 borehole samples proved palynologically lean and provided less information for age dating. It was only possible to define two palynozones of lower age-resolution than that for Abu Tunis 1 x. Spore and pollen grains recovered from both boreholes show characteristics of the Cretaceous Phytogeographic Provinces of northern Africa-northern South America. Sporomorphs of the pre-Albian Dicheiropollis/Afropollis Province were recognised from the lower part of the Abu Tunis 1 x borehole and sporomorphs characteristic of Albian-Cenomanian Elaterate Province identified from both. No spore and pollen grains of the Senonian Palmae Province have been recognised due to the complete marine nature of the early Santonian sediments of the Abu Tunis 1 x borehole. In order to understand the palaeoenvironmental conditions prevailing in the two boreholes during the deposition of the clastic and carbonate sediments, quantitative palynological data was combined with geophysical wireline data and cuttings lithologies. The quantitative distribution of certain terrestrial palynomorphs with known botanical affinities and palaeoenvironmental significance have been used as proxy indicators for identifying palaeoclimatic and palaeoceanographic conditions in both borehole regions. In general, the lower part of the Abu Tunis 1 x succession (consisting of shale and sandstones) was deposited in deltaic settings during a regressive cycle with sediments of the upper Alam El Buieb Formation and the Alamein Formation representing the late Barremian-Aptian transgression cycle, during which shallow marine settings prevailed. Clastics of the Dahab and Kharita formations represent another regression in marine sedimentation, where fine silts and a few shale horizons of the latter formations were deposited in a <b>delta</b> <b>channel</b> system that prograded through time over prodelta sediments as a response to sea level fall. Mixed clastic and carbonate sediments of the upper Kharita and lower Bahariya represent more distal marine deposition as a response to a second minor rise in sea level, where a partially marine isolated, brackish lagoonal depositional system developed that was subjected to occasional marine incursions. Integration of the same datasets demonstrate that the upper carbonate-dominated part of the Abu Tunis 1 x succession (the upper Bahariya, Abu Roash, and Khoman B formations) was deposited mainly in deeper marine settings interpreted as outer shallow marine, during a major transgressive cycle. The upper part of the BB 80 - 1 borehole also shows this late Cretaceous marine transgression, represented by high concentrations of phytoplankton-rich carbonate sequences. The lower part of this Gulf of Suez sequence is of latest early Cretaceous age, and appears to have been deposited in a continental basin, far from source vegetation, possibly in alluvial settings, which witnessed occasional marine incursions represented by deposition of a few organic-rich marine shale intercalations that are interpreted as shallow marginal marine in origin. These environmental fluctuations are related to global sea level fluctuations and global tectonic processes, such as the breakup of Western Gondwana during the opening of the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Investigation of the hydrocarbon potential of the Abu Tunis 1 x and BB 8 - 1 shows that the first borehole has source rock potential, with the second of no potential due to its organic-poor lithology. The lower part of the Abu Tunis 1 x borehole represented by the Alam El Bueib Formation sediments is regarded as a non commercial gas-prone source rock; this is indicated from visual kerogen study and vitrinite reflectance investigations of its thermal maturation. A burial history reconstruction for the Abu Tunis 1 x borehole sequence indicates that the lower part of the Alam El Bueib source rock entered the early stage of thermal maturation during the Oligocene and is currently at the early mature stage. By investigating the organic matter quality and conducting maturity analyses such as vitrinite reflectance studies, the overlying clastics of the Dahab, Kharita and lower Bahariya, and the carbonates of the upper Bahariya, Abu Roash and Khoman formations are shown also to contain relatively high amounts of oil-prone organic matter, but it is immature, and thus they are not active source rocks in the region of the Abu Tunis 1 x borehole. The BB 80 - 1 borehole is made of a thick organic-poor, porous sandstone unit of the Malha and lower Raha formations that are intercalated by a few organic-rich shale horizons. This sandstone lithology is regarded as having no hydrocarbon potential. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Furthermore, the spectral composition of the IRS in the carbon doped interface is found to be dominated by the delta 1 symmetry, which is responsible for the suppression of <b>delta</b> 5 <b>channel</b> in the parallel conductance. Comment: We recently find that the explication in this paper is not correct. We are continuing to study the mechanis...|$|R
