Cloud-screening through a monthly average infrared threshold based on measured surface air temperature, which is geographically dependent, shows an improvement over using a seasonally and geographically independent thermal cloud threshold of 287 K. It is found that differences in cloud-screening for these two thresholds occur for cases of lower altitude clouds or subpixel clouds where the radiative temperature is higher than the 287 K infrared threshold, yet colder than the variable threshold developed by Stowe et al.

While power planning tools can optimize a power grid for a specified maximum IR drop, this level of detail omits two important factors from analysis. The first is whether the maximum <b>IR</b> drop <b>threshold</b> is correctly chosen. For example, if a number of critical timing paths pass through the area of maximum IR drop, and the reduced supply voltage causes those timing paths to experience setup or hold failures, then the maximum <b>IR</b> drop <b>threshold</b> {{may need to be}} lower. Likewise, if the power grid is over-designed, {{we may be able to}} gain area by reducing P/G wire width without worsening peak IR drop, and thereby improve critical path timing by freeing routing channels for more direct signal routing.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{delineation}} of precipitation during daytime using multispectral satellite data is proposed. The {{approach is not}} only applicable to the detection of mainly convective precipitation {{by means of the}} commonly used relation between infrared cloud top temperature and rainfall probability but enables also the detection of stratiform precipitation (e. g. in connection with mid-latitude frontal systems). The presented scheme is based on the conceptual model that precipitating clouds are characterized by a combination of particles large enough to fall, an adequate vertical extension (both represented by the cloud water path (cwp)), and the existence of ice particles in {{the upper part of the}} cloud. The technique considers the VIS 0. 6 and the NIR 1. 6 channel to gain information about the cloud water path. Additionally, the channel differences &Delta;T 8. 7 - 10. 8 and &Delta;T 10. 8 - 12. 1 are considered to supply information about the cloud phase. Rain area delineation is realized by using a minimum threshold of the rainfall confidence. To obtain a statistical transfer function between the rainfall confidence and the channel differences, the value combination of the four variables is compared to ground based radar data. The retrieval is validated against independent radar data not used for deriving the transfer function and shows an encouraging performance as well as clear improvements compared to existing optical retrieval techniques using only <b>IR</b> <b>thresholds</b> for cloud top temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} goal of {{this project}} is to establish relationships that would allow application of area-time integral (ATI) calculations based upon satellite data to estimate rainfall volumes. The research is being carried out as a collaborative effort between the two participating organizations, with the satellite data analysis to determine values for the ATIs being done primarily by the STC-METSAT scientists and the associated radar data analysis to determine the 'ground-truth' rainfall estimates being done primarily at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T). Synthesis of the two separate kinds of data and investigation of the resulting rainfall-versus-ATI relationships is then carried out jointly. The research has been pursued using two different approaches, which for convenience can be designated as the 'fixed-threshold approach' and the 'adaptive-threshold approach'. In the former, an attempt is made to determine a single temperature threshold in the satellite infrared data that would yield ATI values for identifiable cloud clusters which {{are closely related to}} the corresponding rainfall amounts as determined by radar. Work on the second, or 'adaptive-threshold', approach for determining the satellite ATI values has explored two avenues: (1) attempt involved choosing <b>IR</b> <b>thresholds</b> to match the satellite ATI values with ones separately calculated from the radar data on a case basis; and (2) an attempt involved a striaghtforward screening analysis to determine the (fixed) offset that would lead to the strongest correlation and lowest standard error of estimate in the relationship between the satellite ATI values and the corresponding rainfall volumes...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{infrared}} (IR) {{and visible}} (VIS) {{images from the}} Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere - Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE) experiment are investigated {{through the use of}} Clustering Analysis. The clusters are obtained from the values of IR and VIS counts and the local variance for both channels. The clustering procedure is based on the standardized histogram of each variable obtained from 179 pairs of images. A new approach to classify high clouds using only IR and the clustering technique is proposed. This method allows the separation of the enhanced convection in two main classes: convective tops, more closely related to the most active core of the storm, and convective systems, which produce regions of merged, thick anvil clouds. The resulting classification of different portions of cloudiness is compared to the radar reflectivity field for intensive events. Convective Systems and Convective Tops are followed during their life cycle using the IR clustering method.

40|$|Most infrared-based {{techniques}} of satellite rainfall estimation contain substantial uncertainties {{due to the}} indirect relationship between precipitation particles and space-borne infrared observations of clouds. Generally, these uncertainties include (1) IR temperature threshold defining cold clouds; (2) inclusion of no-rain clouds; (3) exclusion of warm rain clouds; and (4) the coefficients between rain rate and cloud-top properties. To address these uncertainties, a methodology, Cloud Patch Analysis, was developed to estimate rainfall by removing large portion of no-rain clouds from IR cloud imagery. Seven cloud features, including physical, geometric and textural, were defined, and ID 3, an inductive decision tree, was used to identify no-rain clouds. Particularly, textural characteristics were extended from square images to irregular cloud patches to extract cloud features related to rainfall. In addition, the method adopted a mechanism to adjust IR temperature threshold according to locations and seasons, and this adjustment {{can be made by}} the combination of microwave observations by polar-orbiting satellites with infrared observations by geostationary satellites.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between cloud and surface rain rate varies significantly from cloud patch to cloud patch. Therefore, a rainfall estimation model characterized by significant transience, heterogeneity, and variability {{is needed to}} associate rainfall with the extremely complex and still imperfectly understood precipitating processes to produce higher quality estimates. We have responded to this by developing a high-resolution precipitation estimation algorithm dubbed “CCS ” (Cloud Classification System) at UC Irvine. The CCS uses computer image processing and pattern recognition techniques to develop a patch-based cloud classification and rainfall estimation system based on co-registered passive microwave and infrared images from Low Earth-orbiting and Geostationary satellites. Unlike the region-based approach, which establishes only one Tb-R function for all clouds, this technique classifies various patches into different clusters and then searches the best-matched nonlinear Tb-R mapping function for each patch. Therefore, CCS jumps out the deadlock of the assumption that colder cloud pixel must produce higher rain rates than warmer cloud pixel, which is not all-time-true but popularly used by some other statistical regression or histogram matching approaches. This design feature enables CCS to generate various rain rates at a given brightness temperature and variable rain/no-rain <b>IR</b> <b>thresholds</b> for different cloud patches, which overcomes the one-to-one mapping limitation of a single statistical Tb-R function for {{the full spectrum of}} cloud-rainfall conditions. In addition, the computational and modeling strengths of neural network enable CCS to cope with the nonlinearity of cloud-rainfall relationships by fusing multi-source data sets.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of the rainfall from convective clouds to area-time integrals determined from satellite infrared data using a fixed infrared-temperature threshold is investigated. Concurrent radar and rapid-scan satellite data obtained during field projects in the northern High Plains and the southeastern United States were used in this study. The fixed <b>IR</b> <b>threshold</b> appropriate for each region was determined by an optimization procedure that identified the brightness threshold that yields the strongest relationship between estimated rainfall from a cloud cluster and its satellite Area-Time Integral (ATI) for each dataset. For the North Dakota-Montana area the optimization procedure indicated that the area enclosed by the - 22. 5 C isotherm provides satellite ATI values most {{closely related to the}} estimated rainfalls. For the southeastern United States project, the optimized tem- perature threshold was 8. 5 'C. The difference between the thresholds determined for the two geographic areas suggests that a different 'calibration' for each distinct area may be needed to make use of this relationship. Slopes of the two log-log rainfall-ATI regressions are less than unity, indicating that a relative horizontal expansion and/or increase in persistence of a cloud cluster exceeds the associated increase in precipitation. Implications for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite precipitation index are discussed.

Easterly waves were partitioned into northerly, southerly, trough, and ridge phases based on the 700 -hPa meridional wind from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis dataset. Waves were subsequently divided according to whether they did or did not develop tropical cyclones (i. e., developing and nondeveloping, respectively), and developing waves were further subdivided according to development location. Finally, composites as a function of wave phase and category were created using the various datasets. Results suggest that the convective characteristics that best distinguish developing from nondeveloping waves vary according to where developing waves spawn tropical cyclones. For waves that developed a cyclone in the Atlantic basin, coverage by IR brightness temperatures. 240 K and. 210 K provide the best distinction between developing and nondeveloping waves.

40|$|Deep Convective Clouds (DCC) are bright, nearly {{isotropic}} earth targets extending {{up to the}} tropopause, {{making them}} favorable as pseudo invariant calibration sites (PICS). Located in all tropical domains, DCC can be observed by both geostationary (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, allowing for large ensemble statistical comparisons of the instrument sensors aboard the respective satellites to measure variation in sensor response. The stability of the GEO instrument can be monitored over time using monthly DCC PDF mode visible reflectances of GEO pixels over the corresponding domain. The temporal stability of DCC reflectances has been well documented. The inter-annual variability of the regional seasonal and diurnal cycle DCC reflectances are very small. The more difficult part of DCC calibration is tying the GEO DCC mode reflectance to the Aqua-MODIS 0. 65 µm band calibration reference as recommended by the GSICS community. It {{has been shown that}} the DCC mode reflectance is dependent on the <b>IR</b> <b>threshold</b> temperature. If the GEO and MODIS imagers had the same IR temperature threshold, it can be assumed that the GEO and MODIS DCC monthly mode reflectance should be equal over the GEO domain during the MODIS overpass time provided they have the similar visible spectral responses. If this assumption is verified then any GEO in this GEO domain can be anchored to the MODIS calibration and therefor can be applied to historical GEOs. This assumption is verified by using GEO and MODIS ray-matched 10 -km or 30 -km pixel level averaged radiance pairs to transfer the MODIS calibration. In order to reduce the spectral band differences the ray-matched radiance pairs are limited over DCC. Another permutation of this method is to compare the GEO and MODIS monthly DCC mode reflectance using the same pixel-level ray-matched radiances. This will allow for a reliable transfer of a well-calibrated reference sensor calibration using DCC calibration...|$|E

40|$|Uniform radiometric {{calibration}} {{of satellite}} sensors {{is vital to}} the scientists and researchers around the world that use the satellite retrieved properties to study the Earth’s climate. In order to consistently calibrate sensors that have varying degrees of onboard calibration over time, an invariant target approach is needed. Fortunately, all satellite sensors are able to view deep convective clouds (DCC), which are bright, nearly-isotropic solar diffusers that can be easily identified via a simple infrared (IR) brightness temperature threshold. Also, most sensors have a window channel, which are historically well-calibrated using onboard black-bodies. If the DCC reflectivity is predictable in space and time, then the DCC can be used as an absolute reference for past, present, and future operational sensors. This study focuses on analyzing and optimizing the DCC identification criteria in order to derive the most consistent DCC reflectance fields over the tropics, while maintaining the greatest regional temporal stability. The DCC reflectances were characterized using the well-calibrated Aqua-MODIS 0. 65 micron channel radiances. The DCC calibration technique revealed that the Aqua-MODIS 0. 65 µm radiances are temporally stable to within 0. 5 %/decade based on 9 -years of data over the entire tropics. Replacing the DCC bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model with a Lambertian BRDF model increased the Aqua-MODIS temporally stability to 0. 7 %, verifying that the DCC reflectance were nearly isotropic. It is known that the seasonal and diurnal distribution of DCC varies geographically over tropics. However, the inter-annual variability of the distribution is small and very predictable. The DCC reflectance was found to be dependent on the <b>IR</b> <b>threshold</b> criteria, indicating that a comparable IR temperature threshold is necessary to transfer the absolute visible calibration across visible sensors. It was also found that the lowest DCC reflectances were found over the tropical western pacific but the brightest DCC were not always found exclusively over land. These differences can easily be accounted for when using DCC as an invariant Earth target, allowing for a uniform and consistent calibration target for visible sensors...|$|E
40|$|Tropical Deep Convective Clouds (DCC) are the brightest, nearly isotropic, tropopause-level earth {{invariant}} targets or solar diffusers, {{making them}} suitable as pseudo invariant calibration sites (PICS). DCC are observed by both {{low earth orbit}} and geostationary (GEO) satellites, since they are found over all tropical domains. DCC calibration is a statistical technique that collectively analyzes all identified DCC over a geographical domain by a simple <b>IR</b> <b>threshold.</b> After the pixel level application of a DCC Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), the DCC monthly mode statistic can accurately verify the temporal stability of the sensor response. The temporal standard error is equal to or better than other desert and polar ice PICS. Another advantage of DCC {{is that they are}} spectrally flat in the visible and near IR, since they are above the tropopause where there is little water vapor absorption. The most difficult aspect of DCC absolute calibration is the calibration transfer from a reference instrument. The GSICS community has decided on Aqua-MODIS 0. 65 µm as the calibration reference. As the calibration of future VIIRS or CLARREO hyper-spectral instruments improves, the superior calibration can be transferred back in time using Simultaneous Nadir Overpasses (SNO) s. Since DCC calibration is a statistical method that relies on ~ 100 K DCC identified pixels, the feasibility of pixel-level matching between reference and target sensor is virtually impossible. It also preferable to characterize the DCC with a reference instrument so that the absolute calibration can be inferred even when there is no simultaneous GEO and MODIS data available. If the frequency histogram of the GEO and MODIS pixel level radiances are very similar and obtained over the same domain and time range with the same DCC algorithm, then the GEO and MODIS mode radiance should be similar. This assumption will be tested by transferring the Aqua-MODIS reference calibration using ray-matched coincident radiance pairs over DCC. Sensitivity to other factors such as GEO and MODIS threshold temperature and pixel resolution differences will also be examined in obtaining the histogram mode DCC radiance...|$|E

The frequency of rain days in the TOVS is scaled down to match that in the TMPI at the data boundaries, and the resulting non-zero TOVS values are scaled locally to sum to the SG (which is a globally complete monthly product). The time series of the daily 1 DD global images shows good continuity in time and across the data boundaries. Various examples are shown to illustrate uses. Validation for individual grid -box values shows a very high root-mean-square error but, it improves quickly when users perform time/space averaging {{according to their own}} requirements...|$|R
40|$|Requiring {{that the}} {{contributions}} of supersymmetric particles to the Higgs mass are not highly tuned places upper limits on the masses of superpartners [...] in particular the higgsino, stop, and gluino. We revisit {{the details of the}} tuning calculation and introduce a number of improvements, including RGE resummation, two-loop effects, a proper treatment of UV vs. <b>IR</b> masses, and <b>threshold</b> corrections. This improved calculation more accurately connects the tuning measure with the physical masses of the superpartners at LHC-accessible energies. After these refinements, the tuning bound on the stop is now also sensitive to the masses of the 1 st and 2 nd generation squarks, which limits how far these can be decoupled in Effective SUSY scenarios. We find that, for a fixed level of tuning, our bounds can allow for heavier gluinos and stops than previously considered. Despite this, the natural region of supersymmetry is under pressure from the LHC constraints, with high messenger scales particularly disfavored. Comment: 26 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Our {{purification}} {{procedure was}} {{specifically designed to}} preserve {{the integrity of the}} purified complexes as they exist in live human cells. Affinity purification of tagged proteins theoretically allows the isolation of all protein complexes containing the tagged polypeptide. This method does not, however, allow for the direct determination of the abundance of the purified complexes. In addition, the high sensitivity of mass spectrometry requires the development of methods that discriminate between specific and spurious interactions (Patil and Nakamura, 2005; Krogan et al., 2006; Gavin et al., 2006). This was accomplished through the development of an algorithm that selects high confidence interactions by assigning Interaction Reliability (IR) scores to each protein interaction (a schematic representation of our computational procedure is provided in Supplemental Figure S 2). The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm was evaluated using literature-based classification of protein interactions. We selected as high confidence interactions those for which the IR score exceeded a <b>threshold</b> (<b>IR</b> score above 0. 6729) predicted to miss as false-negatives only 17 % of a set of literature-supported interactions while incorrectly retaining only 17 % of a set of interactions without literature support as false-positives. The selected interactions were used to build a protein interaction map (see Figure 2 of the article). Supplemental Experimental Procedure...|$|R
40|$|Precipitation {{estimation}} from satellite information (VISIBLE, IR, or microwave) {{is becoming}} increasingly imperative because of its high spatial/temporal resolution and board coverage unparalleled by ground-based data. After decades' efforts of rainfall estimation using IR imagery as basis, it has been explored {{and concluded that the}} limitations/uncertainty of the existing techniques are: (1) pixel-based local-scale feature extraction; (2) <b>IR</b> temperature <b>threshold</b> to define rain/no-rain clouds; (3) indirect relationship between rain rate and cloud-top temperature; (4) lumped techniques to model high variability of cloud-precipitation processes; (5) coarse scales of rainfall products. As continuing studies, a new version of Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network (PERSIANN), called Cloud Classification System (CCS), has been developed to cope with these limitations in this dissertation. CCS includes three consecutive components: (1) a hybrid segmentation algorithm, namely Hierarchically Topographical Thresholding and Stepwise Seeded Region Growing (HTH-SSRG), to segment satellite IR images into separated cloud patches; (2) a 3 D feature extraction procedure to retrieve both pixel-based local-scale and patch-based large-scale features of cloud patch at various heights; (3) an ANN model, Self-Organizing Nonlinear Output (SONO) network, to classify cloud patches into similarity-based clusters, using Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM), and then calibrate hundreds of multi-parameter nonlinear functions to identify the relationship between every cloud types and their underneath precipitation characteristics using Probability Matching Method and Multi-Start Downhill Simplex optimization techniques. The model was calibrated over the Southwest of United States (100 ° [...] 130 °W and 25 ° [...] 45 °N) first and then adaptively adjusted to the study region of North America Monsoon Experiment (65 ° [...] 135 °W and 10 ° [...] 50 °N) using observations from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) IR imagery, Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) rainfall network, and Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) microwave rain rate estimates. CCS functions as a distributed model that first identifies cloud patches and then dispatches different but the best matching cloud-precipitation function for each cloud patch to estimate instantaneous rain rate at high spatial resolution (4 km) and full temporal resolution of GOES IR images (every 30 -minute). Evaluated over a range of spatial and temporal scales, the performance of CCS compared favorably with GOES Precipitation Index (GPI), Universal Adjusted GPI (UAGPI), PERSIANN, and Auto-Estimator (AE) algorithms, consistently. Particularly, the large number of nonlinear functions and optimum IR-rain rate thresholds of CCS model are highly variable, reflecting the complexity of dominant cloud-precipitation processes from cloud patch to cloud patch over various regions. As a result, CCS can more successfully capture variability in rain rate at small scales than existing algorithms and potentially provides rainfall product from GOES IR-NEXARD-TRMM TMI (SSM/I) at 0. 12 ° x 0. 12 ° and 3 -hour resolution with relative low standard error (∼= 3. 0 mm/hr) and high correlation coefficient (∼= 0. 65) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{reporter}} gene assay AREc 32 {{is based on}} the induction of the Nrf 2 mediated oxidative stress response pathway in the human breast cancer cell line MCF 7, where eight copies of the antioxidant response element (ARE) are linked to a {{reporter gene}} encoding for luciferase. The Nrf 2 -ARE pathway is responsive to many chemicals that cause oxidative stress, among them a large number of pesticides and skin irritants. We adopted and validated the AREc 32 bioassay for water quality testing. tert-Butylhydroquinone served as the positive control, phenol as the negative control and other reactive chemicals were assessed for their specificity. An environmentally relevant reference chemical, benzo(a) pyrene was the most potent inducer of all tested chemicals. The concentration causing an induction ratio (IR) of 1. 5 (EC(IR 1. 5)) was chosen as the effect benchmark value. The assay was applied to 21 water samples ranging from sewage to drinking water, including secondary treatment and various tertiary treatment options (ozonation, biologically activated carbon filtration, membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, advanced oxidation, chlorination, chloramination). The samples were enriched by solid phase extraction. In most samples the oxidative stress response was far more sensitive than cytotoxicity. The primary and secondary treated effluent exceeded the effect <b>threshold</b> <b>IR</b> 1. 5 at a relative enrichment factor (REF) of 1, i. e., the native samples were active. All tertiary treated samples were less potent and their EC(IR 1. 5) lay between REF 1 and 10. The Nrf 2 pathway was induced at a REF of approximately 10 for surface waters and drinking water, and above this enrichment cytotoxicity took over in most samples and quenched the induction. The blank (ultrapure water run through the sample enrichment process) was cytotoxic at an REF of 100, which is the limit of concentrations range that can be evaluated. Treatment typically decreased both the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response apart from drinking water treatment where chlorination caused an increase in oxidative stress response, presumably due to the formation of disinfection by-products. This study demonstrates the relevance and applicability of the oxidative stress response pathway for water quality monitoring...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Human Movement Science), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 A need {{exists to}} obtain accurate, {{reliable}} and valid data to assess the external and internal loads of soccer matches, especially {{as it relates to}} South African soccer teams. Consequently, the objectives of this study were firstly to determine the fatigue rates and patterns of a cohort of university-level soccer players during matches when using global positioning system (GPS) to quantify the high-intensity running performances in rolling 5 -min periods. Secondly, to determine the influence of Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo- Yo IR 1) determined training status of a cohort of university-level soccer players on fatigue patterns and rate during match play. Thirdly, to determine the positional-internal match loads of a cohort of university-level soccer players by making use of heart rates and the Yo-Yo <b>IR</b> 1 -determined <b>threshold</b> values. Lastly, to compare the match analysis results of different methods aimed at determining the external and internal match loads of a cohort of university-level soccer players. Selected groups of university-level soccer players (n = 10 – 13) were required to complete a 40 -m maximum speed test and the Yo-Yo IR 1 during a two-week period either before or after each analysed match. The heart rate (HR) values and GPS data of each player were recorded during league soccer matches. For the first and second objectives of the study players were categorised into three activity level categories (low, moderate and high) according to their activity levels {{of the first half of}} the match. Furthermore, their high-intensity running (> 3. 7 m/s) (HIR) was monitored in rolling 5 -min periods. The low-activity group showed a small to moderate difference (p < 0. 05) in high-intensity running (HIR) at 5 -min and 15 -min after the peak period compared to the average 5 -min period. The moderate-activity group showed a moderate difference (p < 0. 05) in HIR at 5 -min after the peak period. The high-activity group showed moderate to large declines in distance covered between the first 15 -min of the second half (103. 9 m/min) compared to the first 15 -min of the first half (122. 5 m/min). They also showed small to moderate declines in HIR during the first 10 -min of the second half (25. 7 m/min) compared to the first half (34. 1 m/min). The low-activity group showed a small decline in distance covered during the first 5 -min of the second half (76. 3 m/min) compared to the first half (87. 7 m/min). Conversely the low-activity group showed a small to moderate increase in distance covered during the last 10 -min of the second half (95. 7 m/min) compared to the first half (84. 4 m/min). The Yo-Yo IR 1 was not significantly correlated with any of the variables associated with HIR. For the third objective of the study players’ heart rates that corresponded with the first and second ventilatory thresholds as obtained during a Yo-Yo IR 1 were used to classify heart rates into low (LI HR zone), moderate (MI HR zone) and high-intensity zones (HI HR zone). Results showed that attackers spent more time in the LI HR zone (3386 s; 62 %; p < 0. 05) than defenders (2155 s; 40 %) and midfielders (2425 s; 42 %). The attackers spent less time in the HI HR zone (260 s; 4 %; p < 0. 05) than the defenders (964 s; 15 %). Midfielders (2444 s; 44 %) and defenders (2364 s; 41 %) spent more time in the MI HR zone than attackers (1854 s; 44 %). For the fourth objective of the study players’ individualised velocity and heart rate (HR) thresholds were determined from the 40 -m maximum speed test and the Yo-Yo IR 1. Results showed a large (r = 0. 5; p ≤ 0. 01) correlation between the time spent in the LIVZ (5017 ± 368 s) and the LI HR zone (2891 ± 1086 s), with the true correlation value that varied between moderate and large. Similarly, a moderate (r = 0. 3; p ≤ 0. 01) to large (r = 0. 6; p ≤ 0. 01) correlation was found between the relative (11. 4 ± 3. 7 %) and absolute time (669 ± 223 s) spent in the MIVZ and the MI HR zone (41. 0 ± 16. 8 % and 2253 ± 752 s). However, the true correlation value for the absolute time spent in the MI zone fell between the large to very large category, whereas the correlation for the relative time was small to moderate. There were no significant correlations (p ≤ 0. 01) between the HIVZ and the HI HR zone. Although some correlations were found from the Spearman’s rank correlation, when adjusting for 2 max O V• and Yo-Yo IR 1 performance these correlations became non-significant. From these study results it is clear that the Yo-Yo IR 1 and 40 -m speed test show promise to be used as valid sports-specific field tests for determining ventilatory thresholds for each player, the heart rates that correspond to these thresholds and the different velocity thresholds. The authors therefore recommend that researchers use these methods in future to determine individualised HR and velocity zones in combination with the GPS analysis results to define both the internal and external match loads of soccer players. Results of these analyses could enable future coaches and sport scientists to develop match-specific conditioning programs that reflect both the internal and external demands of soccer matchesDoctora...|$|R
