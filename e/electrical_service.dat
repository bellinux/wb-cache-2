5|$|The first Philippine provinces to be {{impacted}} by the typhoon were Albay and Catanduanes, which suffered power outages after strong winds tore down power lines. One person was killed in Virac, Catanduanes after being electrocuted by a felled power line. In order to prevent more widespread outages, <b>electrical</b> <b>service</b> in some locations was deliberately shut down. Landslides triggered by Nanmadol in Aurora killed 25people. On the Bicol Peninsula, eight fatalities occurred due to drowning, electrocution, or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|The tower's <b>electrical</b> <b>service</b> was {{supplied}} by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800volts. The electricity {{passed through the}} World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC), and was then sent up the building's core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors. The substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277volts, and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services. The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and {{on the roof of}} Five World Trade Center.|$|E

5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: <b>electrical</b> <b>service</b> {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a water system. The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic {{through the center of}} town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused downtown to decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-fourhours {{after the}} passage of the hurricane, workers had {{restored}} power to 70% of the affected residents in Sinaloa, and by six days after the storm, <b>electrical</b> <b>service</b> was completely restored. The damage to the federal highway between Culiacán and Los Mochis along the coastal region of Sinaloa was restored about 48hours {{after the passage}} of the hurricane. The rehabilitation of the agricultural infrastructure began immediately, and most of the drainage networks were repaired by about two weeks after the hurricane. About half of the damaged railways were repaired by about a month after the storm. The total cost for reconstruction and aid amounted to about $18.5million (1998USD, 175million 1998MXN, $23.3million 2007USD), about 94% from federal funds and the rest from state funding. A portion of the funding was allocated to assist the reconstruction of destroyed houses.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and <b>electrical</b> <b>service.</b> Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category4 in September 1960.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} Winifred's approach, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone watches and {{warnings}} for various locations along the Queensland coast, prompting evacuations in several towns. Damage after landfall was widespread and severe, {{with thousands of}} homes damaged, flooding {{as a result of}} heavy rainfall along major rivers, and severe damage to crops. Debris obstructed roads across northern Queensland and power outages disrupted <b>electrical</b> <b>service,</b> even at water treatment plants, forcing officials to warn residents to boil water as a precautionary measure. Overall, the cyclone caused $86.4million in agriculture-related damages, with sugar cane and banana harvests suffering the most. Tourist operations were generally uninterrupted by the storm, while ecological and environmental damage, if any, was mild. Even so, high winds uprooted trees in wide swaths of forests, with those not completely defoliated. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and inflicted $130million (1986AUD; $154million USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|While {{stalling}} {{north of}} Luzon, Goni enhanced the southwest monsoon across the Philippines, resulting in rainfall and gusty winds across the western {{portion of the}} nation. The storm spawned seven tornadoes, one of which damaged or destroyed ten houses in Carranglan, Nueva Ecija. Rough seas swamped a motor boat near Banton Island, forcing the crew of seven to swim ashore. Across Luzon, flooding caused landslides in 13locations, including a mountain slope in Mankayan, Benguet, that buried three mining camps, killing 13miners. More than 100policemen and miners searched through the mud for survivors. Water levels quickly rose in rivers across Luzon, washing away 14flood control systems, including one dyke. Swollen rivers also inundated several bridges and washed away one in Santa, Ilocos Sur, that left 5,100people isolated. At three dams, water gates were opened after flood levels reached critical heights. Across Luzon, trees were knocked down and the power supply was disrupted; all <b>electrical</b> <b>service</b> was restored by September1, or 11days after the storm's closest approach. In total, Typhoon Goni damaged 5,742houses, of which 188 were completely destroyed. Total damages amounted to ₱4.5billion ($96.6million USD), split roughly evenly between agricultural and infrastructural impacts. In Ilocos Norte province in northwestern Luzon, damage was estimated at ₱1.8billion ($38.7million USD). Overall, Typhoon Goni killed 33people and left 9missing in the Philippines, mostly due to landslides or drownings, and injured 24others.|$|E

25|$|Inexpensive and {{abundant}} electrical power {{was the main}} benefit the TVA brought to Tennessee, particularly to rural areas that previously did not have <b>electrical</b> <b>service.</b> TVA brought electricity to about 60,000 farm households across the state. By 1945, TVA was the largest electrical utility in the nation, a supplier of vast amounts of power whose presence in Tennessee attracted large industries to relocate near one of its dams or steam plants. This incentive contributed to important economic development in the state.|$|E

25|$|One {{fatality}} {{has been}} reported in extreme Southeast Texas related to Ike. It was {{as a result of a}} generator fire when power was out. Despite official assurances that this was the only Ike-related death in the area, rumors spread that large numbers of people died during the storm. This was fueled by the presence of refrigerated trailers outside a Beaumont funeral home. The funeral home had lost <b>electrical</b> <b>service</b> and was using the trailers to store bodies of people who died of natural causes until burials could be arranged.|$|E
25|$|Fire was a {{constant}} hazard in these pioneer communities and on April 26, 1896, much of Ainsworth was destroyed.

The Deering even boasted a swimming pool in its basement. Still, Ainsworth suffered in its isolation, having no roads until 1914 and not having <b>electrical</b> <b>service</b> until 1928.
