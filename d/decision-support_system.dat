40|$|This article {{draws on}} the concept of “performance ” to argue for greater recogni-tion of preexisting {{practices}} in the configuration of users. Through an Australian case study of a computer-based dairy <b>decision-support</b> <b>system</b> introduced via a two-day workshop to participating farmers, the article examines the assembling of imputed farmer users {{in the design of the}} software.

The case study highlights that attempts to make workable on-farm the “new ” per-formances of users inscribed in the software are highly contingent on farmers’ preexisting knowledge practices. These “old ” performances problematize the designer’s and trainers ’ version of imputed users and contribute to partial trans-lation of the <b>decision-support</b> <b>system.</b> A focus on performance is argued to pro-vide a useful starting point in mapping the effects of preexisting knowledge practices on attempts to enroll users in technosocial programs...|$|E

40|$|This paper characterizes {{part of an}} {{interdisciplinary}} research effort on AI techniques applied to environmental decision-support systems. The architectural design of the OntoWEDSS <b>decision-support</b> <b>system</b> for wastewater management is presented. This system augments classic rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning with a domain ontology, which provides a more flexible management capability to OntoWEDSS. The construction of the <b>decision-support</b> <b>system</b> {{is based on a}} specific case study. But the system is also of general interest, given that its ontology-underpinned architecture can be applied to any wastewater treatment plant and, at an appropriate level of abstraction, to other environmental domains. The OntoWEDSS system helps improve the diagnosis of faulty states of a treatment plant, provides support for complex problem-solving and facilitates knowledge modeling and reuse. In particular, the following issues are dealt with: (1) modeling information about wastewater treatment processes, (2) clarifying part of the existing terminological confusion in the domain, (3) incorporating ontology-modeled microbiologic knowledge related to the treatment process into the reasoning process and (4) creating a <b>decision-support</b> <b>system</b> that combines information through a novel integration between knowledge-based systems and ontologies. 2003 by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Introduction In {{designing}} the communication {{aspects of a}} <b>decision-support</b> <b>system,</b> developers {{must be aware of}} the way their potential users function, if they are to enable the system's decision support to realize its full potential.

In the fast-paced domain of trauma care, where a large group of people work together to carry out a care plan that has not been pre-determined, communication among team members is vital to the team's functioning, and patterns of communication are well-developed. The interface to a <b>decision-support</b> <b>system</b> for trauma care should incorporate any knowledge that can be gained about the way communication is accomplished among team members.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} appropriate coupling of deterministic and statistical models. In the <b>decision-support</b> <b>system</b> for the Elbe river, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model is used to obtain the discharge statistics and corresponding average number of flood days, which is a key input variable for a rule-based model for floodplain vegetation. The required quality of the discharge time series cannot be determined by a sensitivity analysis because a deterministic model is linked to a statistical model. To solve the problem, artificial discharge time series are generated that mimic the hypothetical output of rainfall-runoff models of different accuracy. The results indicate that a feasible calibration of the rainfall-runoff model is sufficient to obtain consistency with the vegetation model in view of its sensitivity {{to changes in the}} number of flood days in the floodplains.
