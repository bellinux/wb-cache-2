5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was going up the mountain than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would go down the other side.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Chris Poland {{and drummer}} Gar Samuelson had been {{expelled}} from the band following {{the conclusion of the}} Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler. However, a new guitarist would take longer to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> handled Reynolds's firing.|$|E
5|$|Lewis' {{presence}} on the Street infuriates Gail, who still holds a grudge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> treated Audrey. Gail hopes Lewis may have left for good when he attends court on charges of fraud. However, Lewis charms the judge with a speech {{about the way he}} let Audrey down, and he is sentenced to community service. The animosity between Gail and Lewis, reaches a peak at The Bisto; and as Audrey defends Lewis, a food critic from the Weatherfield Gazette walks in. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Lewis turns on the charm and quickly wins the reviewer over. Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who owns The Bistro, realises Lewis' communication skills could be good for his business and he employs Lewis for a trial period at the restaurant.|$|E
50|$|Bird {{has also}} been posthumously criticised <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{negative}} <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wrote about and portrayed local indigenous tribes and for omitting events where Aboriginal people were murdered.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. I can't {{forgive him}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sneaky <b>way</b> <b>he</b> went to work-- {{counting}} on our suspecting young Davis if the matter came to light. It was the merest accident the cheque-book stayed in your pocket.|$|R
5000|$|Ray is reproached by <b>the</b> Countess <b>for</b> <b>the</b> impersonal <b>way</b> <b>he</b> buys up hotels this way, {{piling up}} [...] "ten {{thousand}} bedrooms" [...] and replacing employees {{without a second}} thought. He sincerely promises {{not to do so}} with the staff of the Regent.|$|R
5|$|Minton did {{not realize}} that Frank was also {{president}} of the University of Wisconsin, and soon suffered retaliation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had treated Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.|$|E
5|$|After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno to {{the three}} main {{characters}} from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though {{he added that the}} similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> handled Naruto's parents and his heritage.|$|E
25|$|Laws {{resigned}} as Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 29 May 2010, stating {{that he could}} not carry on working on the Comprehensive Spending Review while dealing with the private and public implications of the revelations. He claimed that his reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had claimed expenses had been to keep private details of his sexuality and that he had not benefited financially from this misdirection.|$|E
5000|$|Jason DiLaurentis: The two {{had a brief}} casual {{relationship}} in which Melissa didn't care <b>for</b> him <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> did <b>for</b> her. As {{a way to get}} closer, Ian revealed to Melissa the secret about the DiLaurentis twins and asked for her to keep it a secret between them, which she did.|$|R
5|$|If {{you please}} Sir I am a widow; & I think it very wrong {{that there is}} not any Mrs. Fisher, but I would not marry Mr. Jeremy not <b>for</b> worlds, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & not a bit of good {{starching}} his cravats.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{leave that}} {{point for a}} minute. You must admit it's curious that when we asked him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> easiest <b>way</b> <b>he</b> sent us through these hills and muskegs; {{particularly}} as you have learned from the Indian {{that we could have}} got north with much less trouble had we headed farther west." ...|$|R
25|$|Like Butt-Head, Beavis shares scorn for Stewart and Mr. Van Driessen. Though {{he shares}} Butt-Head's mutual hatred for Coach Buzzcut <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> {{exploited}} {{their lack of}} intelligence, manliness and strength, Beavis has a little respect for him. He has shown some level of respect for Daria, as {{she is the only}} student who tolerates the duo the most without losing her cool.|$|E
25|$|On April 5, 2007, University of Kentucky {{athletic}} director Mitch Barnhart was given permission by Texas A {{to speak with}} Gillispie about the program's basketball coach opening, vacated by Tubby Smith. On April 6, 2007, the announcement was made that Gillispie had accepted the position. He drew criticism <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> left Texas A by having alerted the Aggie players of his decision to take the Kentucky job via text message while {{en route to the}} introductory press conference in Lexington.|$|E
25|$|Duran Duran was touring {{to support}} the album when Hutchence died and Le Bon found the song too {{difficult}} to perform at Lakewood Civic Auditorium, Lakewood (Cleveland), Ohio, United States. Le Bon was in tears through part of this show and the song was cut from the set list {{for the remainder of}} the tour. During subsequent tours it was reincluded, with Le Bon introducing the song by saying that he wanted to remember Hutchence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> lived instead of the way he died.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} he was back again, but such a queer-looking fellow as he was! His head was twice as big {{as it had been}} before and you would hardly have known that it was Striped Chipmunk but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> saucy <b>way</b> <b>he</b> twitched his funny little tail and <b>the</b> spry <b>way</b> <b>he</b> scampered along <b>the</b> old stone wall.|$|R
60|$|Our great astronomer, Adams, however, {{appears to}} have found a flaw in Laplace's calculation, and to have shown that only half the {{observed}} retardation could be accounted <b>for</b> in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had suggested. There remains, therefore, the other half to be accounted for; and here, in the absence of all positive knowledge, three sets of hypotheses have been suggested.|$|R
50|$|Buttle has {{received}} numerous honors and awards {{in recognition of}} {{his commitment to the}} community including National Spokesman <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United <b>Way.</b> <b>He</b> holds a Bachelor of Arts in general arts and sciences from Penn State University. He lives in Northport, New York with his wife, Rita, son Greg Jr. and two daughters, Christina and Allegra.|$|R
25|$|Terry was {{not without}} {{considerable}} support for his notable accomplishments and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> handled the violence in Wilmington. He campaigned {{for a second term}} and only narrowly lost, believing an October heart attack and a rezoning dispute in Sussex County cost him the election. But 1968 was a Republican sweep and Russell W. Peterson, a chemist from New Castle County, was able to defeat the incumbent governor, undoubtedly helped by a large number of Democrats in Wilmington who were seeking new leadership to end the tension and violence.|$|E
25|$|Quicksilver finally {{learns that}} the person he thought was his sister is {{actually}} Loki in disguise. Enraged, he {{and the rest of}} the team travel to the Isle of Silence to set a trap for the god of mischief. After imprisoning Loki in a device designed by Hank Pym, he begins torturing the god for information about Wanda's whereabouts. Loki offers no information about her and manages to contact Thor to beg for his help. Thor arrives and attacks Quicksilver <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> is treating Loki. He is able to outrun the thunder god's lightning but is eventually overpowered. He is one of the Avengers who joins Hercules, Amadeus Cho and their allies in an assault on Olympus Group Headquarters. He battles Amazon warrior women alongside Zeus and helps a wounded Wolverine defeat the Huntsman, stabbing him through the chest with his own weapon.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} between Holly and Sebastian {{for the center}} ring develops into a romantic triangle as well, with both Sebastian and Brad vying for Holly as the aerialists' acts become increasingly daring and dangerous. Sebastian ignores his former lovers on the show: Angel, who performs in the elephant act; and Phyllis, who does a double turn as an iron jaw artist and a vocalist, starring in a South Seas spectacular built around her talent as a singer. The duel ends when, {{in response to a}} challenge from Holly, Sebastian removes his safety net and suffers serious injuries in a fall when a trick goes wrong. Buttons tends to him; and when the show's doctor expresses admiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> dealt with the injuries, the clown explains, a little nervously, that he used to be a pharmacist's mate. Holly finally has the center ring and star billing – but not the way she wanted it. Brad is unable to comfort her because she is in love with Sebastian.|$|E
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the first}} times Angel shows that he might have deeper {{feelings}} <b>for</b> Cordelia, given <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> reacts after witnessing commercial director Seth being rude to her in a moment of anger.|$|R
50|$|At this point, David dashes out of <b>the</b> {{restroom}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elevator <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> does in <b>the</b> theatrical cut, but {{the scene}} in the lobby is expanded - David shoots the police officer who is firing at him and is then surrounded by a SWAT team whom McCabe tries to talk down, but the SWAT team fires at both of them. They black out and wake up in the emptied lobby where McCabe continues to applaud what he believes is a performance while David gets into the elevator with Ventura and tells him what happened {{at the end of his}} real life.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> run <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Blue Moon had {{certainly}} been a swift one, and while Jack was congratulated on his victory, {{he was also}} praised <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>he</b> had handled his speedy bobsled.|$|R
25|$|The 2013 home Ashes series marked Cook's first Ashes series as captain. England {{went into}} the series as strong favourites, with Australia {{recently}} having parted company with their coach. England won the first Test, with Cook making 50 in England's second innings to help them set Australia a competitive target to win the game. They were bowled out for 296, meaning England won the match by 14 runs. Although Cook only managed 20 runs in the next match, England cruised to victory, winning by 347 runs. The third match ended in a draw, with Cook scoring 62 in the first innings, but being dismissed for a duck in the second. The fourth Test saw England win the series after winning the match and taking a 3–0 series lead. The final match ended in a draw, with Cook failing to pass fifty in either of his innings. Despite this, Cook was generally praised <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had led the side. In the ODI series, Cook and Flower decided to rest several of England's Test players to ensure they were fit for the series in Australia. Cook himself played no part in the series, being replaced in the side by Michael Carberry.|$|E
25|$|As Joey {{tentatively}} {{enters the}} stage space, he is {{met with a}} spontaneous ovation sparked by the immediacy of the live moment, in turn aided {{by the fact that}} Kohler and Jones never stray from the game that dictates they treat him as a live horse. This playful notion helps Joey’s creators invite the audience to believe in his aliveness, and the audience succumbs, not only for his lifelike movement, but also <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> is activated by those around him. As both creators and performers, Jones and Kohler soothe Joey’s “nervousness,” and a planned moment when Joey “notices” the audience elicits a generous laugh. Joey shies, nervously clops his hooves, and nickers gently to demonstrate alarm. He sniffs Kohler’s jacket pocket, as he “knows” there is a snack in there. Later, when Jones crosses the stage to demonstrate a feature, he is careful not to walk behind Joey, lest he is kicked. The audience must believe he will not be kicked – only a spiteful puppeteer could activate such a trick – but Jones’s conviction that he should respect the animal’s space foregrounds the moment’s liveness and heightens the audience’s engagement. Finally, a jockey is introduced, and Joey patiently holds still while he is mounted. Joey accepts the rider’s weight without complaint, comfortably parades around the stage, and swiftly exits before the effect is mundane. For the entire time that Joey inhabits the stage, the audience is noticeably spellbound.|$|E
500|$|Hu wrote a {{detailed}} memoir {{of her life}} in the 1980s, in which she harshly criticized her own politics. She described herself as [...] "immature", relying on [...] "enthusiasm rather than analysis", which pushed her to [...] "join whatever cause that struck her as just". She also considered the Red Guards who had tormented her during the Cultural Revolution similarly immature and easily manipulated. Her memoir rarely mentions Mao Zedong, but frequently praises Premier Zhou Enlai, as many other writers did after the Cultural Revolution, contrasting the vengeful Mao with the humane Zhou. She explicitly criticized the morality of Chen Yi <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> treated her in 1949.|$|E
60|$|Not {{an instant}} did he hesitate, nor yet did he advance rashly; but with ready sword and {{cautious}} steps, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> was dark, <b>he</b> stole on. As he advanced, the obscurity became impenetrable blackness.|$|R

"'Throw him over, the Jezebel,' I said, for I was oot o' patience; an' {{they took}} haud o' that {{volunteer}} {{before he knew}} what was in store, and hove him over, in the bight of my life-line.

500|$|In 1996, Boycott {{assaulted}} Margaret Moore, {{a former}} lover. Boycott denied the charges, claiming {{she had fallen}} over and injured herself. He pointed {{to the fact that}} Moore was in financial difficulties and said that he would never hit a woman. However, in the second trial beginning on 20 October 1998, Boycott, having missed the first trial in January where his conviction had been set, appeared before a French magistrates' court and was given a three-month suspended sentence, and his £5,300 fine was confirmed. He was criticised by the Magistrate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> conducted his case and for [...] "rudely interrupting" [...] Mrs Moore's barrister.|$|E
500|$|Nicknamed [...] "Captain Hook" [...] <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> handled goaltenders, the Flames {{decision}} to hire Mike Keenan {{as head coach}} in 2007–08 created speculation that Kiprusoff might choose to leave Calgary when his contract expired {{at the end of}} the season. Nonetheless, he agreed to a six-year extension worth $35 million that would keep him in Calgary until the end of the 2013–14 season. He struggled at times, as his GAA and save percentage fell outside of the top 30 goaltenders in the League by mid-November. His play improved throughout the season, however, and he finished the season third in the NHL with 39 wins.|$|E
500|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{was intended to}} last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio {{said there was no}} point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think {{you have to have a}} fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.|$|E
50|$|Francis Waring (1760-1833) was the vicar of Heybridge. He was notorious <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{extraordinary}} <b>way</b> <b>he</b> performed <b>the</b> {{duties of}} his office. He would read church lessons at breakneck speed, give {{a very quick}} sermon {{of one or two}} sentences and then run down the aisle and leap onto a horse to gallop off and repeat the performance at two other churches in the area.|$|R
500|$|Harry Thompson has {{described}} this post-war period as the [...] "greatest upheaval" [...] of Hergé's life. Hergé later {{described it as}} [...] "an experience of absolute intolerance. It was horrible, horrible!" [...] He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people, and never forgave Belgian society <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>he</b> had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2013, Hartlepool manager John Hughes {{revealed}} to the Hartlepool Mail that club in the higher divisions were looking to sign Flinders with Hughes saying [...] "I {{know there are a}} lot of clubs looking at big Scotty.
