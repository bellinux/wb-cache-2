40|$|<b>Guanidino</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>GAA)</b> is {{synthesized}} in {{the liver}} and kidney from Arg and Gly. It is subsequently methyllated by S-adenosylmethione to creatine. L-Homoserine (HS) {{has been identified as}} an intermediate compound in the metabolism of Thr, Met, and Asp. Bacteria, plants and yeast can synthesize Thr and Met from HS, but this has not been shown in higher organisms. Several bioassays were carried out to determine the capacity of GAA to spare dietary Arg or HS to spare dietary Thr. Crossbred chicks were fed Arg-deficient dextrose-casein (0. 86 % Arg), Arg-deficient corn-corn coproduct-soybean meal (1. 0 % Arg), Thr-deficient dextrose-casein (0. 22 % Thr), or Thr-deficient corn-peanut meal (0. 46 %) basal diets during 9 -d battery feeding trials involving 5 pens of 4 chicks per treatment. Growth and gain:feed responses were obtained when GAA was added to a purified Arg-deficient diet and when HS was added to both Thr-deficient diets. In the corn-corn coproduct-soybean meal diet, GAA yielded a gain:feed response, but not an increase in gain. These results demonstrate that 0. 12 % supplemental GAA, like creatine, produces consistent growth and feed efficiency responses in young chicks fed Arg-deficient diets and indicate that low levels of HS (0. 08 - 0. 1 %) elicit a growth and feed efficiency response in young chicks fed Thr-deficient diets...|$|E

The eight dietary regimens were tested for starter (0 - 10 d), grower (11 - 22 d) and finisher (23 - 35 d) periods on a total of 200 male ROSS 308 broiler chickens in a factorial arrangements of treatments (2 × 4), with experimental diet fed to 5 replicate pens with 4 birds each. The results revealed a positive effect for CreAMINO ® supplementation on feed conversion ratio (FCR) for the starter, grower, finisher and cumulative periods (P< 0. 05, 0. 05, 0. 01 and 0. 001, respectively); feed conversion was significantly improved in the treatment with CreAMINO ® supplementation vs unsupplemented group. During the grower period, {{a significant difference in}} FCR was observed for metabolisable energy (ME) level (P< 0. 01). When examining the cumulative period of the trial (0 to 35 days of age), two-way interaction was significant for feed intake and body weight gain. Birds receiving the control level of energy, 75 or 50 kcal/kg lower ME than the control, consumed less feed when supplemented with CreAMINO ®. Birds receiving 25 kcal/kg lower ME or the control energy levels gained more weight when supplemented with CreAMINO ®. In summary, GAA (as CreAMINO) improved FCR of broilers in each period as well as cumulatively, while ME level also affected FCR. CreAMINO ® supplementation to reduced-energy diets showed FCR improvements, while the best performance was detected for the diet with 50 kcal/kg lower ME...|$|E

In {{the context of}} a commercial human papillomavi-rus (HPV) hybridization assay performed on 465 tandem specimens with and without GAA treatment, we show that GAA treat-ment significantly reduces genomic DNA content (P< 0. 0001) and creates an increased potential for indeterminate and false-negative results. In the context of cytological workflow, laboratories should consider providing a specimen aliquot for HPVDNA detection prior to GAA treatment. Molecular diagnostic assays specific for human papillomavi-rus (HPV) {{play a significant role in}} cervical cancer triage (15). Such assays, shown to have 98. 9 % negative predictive value for the underlying presence of cervical intraepithelial neo-plasia 2 (5, 13), can be performed on endocervical scrapings preserved in liquid transport medium. This collection, also for-warded for cytological analysis, has the potential to possess insuf-ficient squamous cellularity, as well as abundant erythrocytes, mucus, acute inflammatory cells, and cytological debris (11). In particular, the latter factorsmay compromise Papanicolaou (Pap) smear analyses that are reliant on filter-based processing protocols (e. g., ThinPrep; Hologic, Marlborough, MA).

The aims of the present investigation was to confirm further occurrence of hypokalemia in the monkey (comparatively at two higher dose levels) {{and the role of}} potassium salt in preventing occurrence of gossypol-induced hypokalemia. Highly purified gossypol <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> alone at two dose levels (7. 5 and 10 mg/animal/day; oral) and in combination with potassium chloride (0. 50 and 0. 75 mg/animal/day; oral) was given for 180 days.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Liquid embolic {{agents are}} {{increasingly}} gaining {{importance in the}} embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Currently, {{the most commonly used}} agent is N-butyl 2 -cyanoacrylate (NBCA). Various NBCA mixtures, arterial hypotension, and Valsalva maneuver (increased positive end-expiratory pressure) during the injection of the acrylate have been used to address hemodynamic and architectural variations of an AVM; however, the precise in vivo polymerization, distribution, and kinetics of NBCA mixtures are unknown.

The present study investigated whether increased ethiodized oil concentration or the addition of GAA increased rate of embolization.

40|$|Abstract: Edible films can be {{produced}} from kafirin but the diverse food product requirements necessitate modification of the films. To modify their functional properties, kafirin films were cast, with and without plasticizer, from glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>GAA)</b> and aqueous ethanol (AE), then heated using microwave energy. A power of 80 W for 2 min caused an approximately two- and fourfold increase in the tensile strength of non-plasticized and plasticized films, respectively. Film glass transition temperature increased by about 15 %. Film biodegradability was slowed. However, only the digestibility of the non-plasticized films cast from AE heated {{for the longest time}} (4 min) was decreased, by about 25 %; while that of the other films was not affected. GAA cast films had higher digestibility than AE cast ones, possibly as a result of acid-mediated deamidation of kafirin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated heat-induced kafirin oligomers. Scanning electron microscopy of heated plasticized films showed more wrinkled structures compared to non-heated films, whereas the non-plasticized films appeared more brittle with heating. The results indicate that heat-induced intermolecular disulfide cross-linking was involved in modifying the properties of kafirin films...|$|R

To achieve {{a clearer understanding of}} the mechanisms that affect the immunity of uremic patients, the hypothesis that guanidine <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>GAA)</b> contributes to the inhibition of oxidative metabolism and an increase in neutrophil apoptosis in healthy dogs was investigated in vitro. To this end, neutrophils isolated from ten healthy dogs were incubated in pure RPMI 1640 (control) and enriched with 5 mg/L of GAA. Capillary flow cytometry was used to quantify superoxide production in neutrophils with the probe (hydroethidine), in the presence and absence of phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA), in order to assess oxidative metabolism. Apoptotic indices were quantified using the Annexin V-PE system, with and without the inductive effect of camptothecin. Neutrophils isolated and incubated in a GAA-enriched medium produced smaller amounts of superoxide (p< 0. 001) when activated with PMA, however, this inhibition of oxidative metabolism occurred without significantly altering their viability or rate of apoptosis. Thus, the results show guanidine compounds contribute to immunosuppression in dogs with CKD. ...|$|R

Among the many uremic toxins found in higher concentrations due to CRF, there is evidence - in humans - that guanidines inhibit the oxidative metabolism of neutrophils, affecting their bactericidal function. In this study, a systematic review of the relationship between guanidine compounds and neutrophils in dogs was undertaken. It was found that the literature on this subject is scarce and conflicting, which prompted this investigation {{of the relationship between the}} plasmatic concentration of guanidine, the production of superoxide, and the apoptosis of neutrophils in dogs with CRF. Morever, the effect of the isolated compound guanidine <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>GAA)</b> on the production of superoxide and on neutrophil apoptosis in healthy dogs was investigated in vitro.

Methods and Results: Crude extracts of different parts of both species of Cenchrus were evaluated against three medically important bacteria viz. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-ve), Bacillus Subtilis (Gram +ve), Enterobacter aerogens (Gram-ve) and one fungi Aspergillus flavus. The dried and powdered parts (root, stem, leaf and seed) were successively extracted with petroleum ether (PE), ethyl acetate (EA) and glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>GAA)</b> using soxhlet assembly. The antimicrobial activity assay was done by both disc diffusion and serial dilution methods. The highest yield was found in root extract in different polar solvents. Maximum antibacterial activities were observed by GAA extracts of seed in both species of Cenchrus against Bacillus Subtilis and antifungal activity by root extract of C. ciliaris. Conclusion: Cenchrus grass easily grows in harsh climatic conditions or xeric conditions and requires less care, hence its use as raw material for preparing drugs would definitely be economical.

Above 165 K, the remaining <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> solid appears to evaporate without undergoing the phase transformation, {{in contrast to the}} case of a high <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> exposure. Coevaporation of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> with water is also found to proceed at a faster rate than the subsequent evaporation of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is consistent with the weaker interactions observed in the H-bonded <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrate than that in <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> solid. 1...|$|R
