5|$|The {{family moved}} to Berlin in 1811, leaving Hamburg in {{disguise}} fearing French revenge for the Mendelssohn bank's role in breaking Napoleon's Continental System blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children– Fanny, Felix, Paul and Rebecka– the best education possible. Fanny became a well-known pianist and amateur composer; originally Abraham <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> she, rather than Felix, would be the more musical. But at that time, it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, {{for a woman to}} have a career in music, so Fanny remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was also disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he seriously intended to dedicate himself to it.|$|E
5|$|The fight cost {{both sides}} dearly. The true extent of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese {{casualties}} is largely unknown, {{but due to}} their exposure to American firepower, the Communist forces undoubtedly suffered heavy losses. Nonetheless, the successful capture of Loc Ninh exceeded Communist expectations, as they <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the South Vietnamese would hold out longer. Lộc Ninh became {{the seat of the}} Provisional Revolutionary Government, the capital of Communist-occupied territories in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese, in their efforts to hold the district, lost more than three thousand soldiers killed or captured; only about fifty soldiers actually reached An Lộc. The Viet Cong also captured all seven American advisers and an embedded French journalist, Yves-Michel Dumond, in Lộc Ninh; they were taken to a prison camp in Kratié Province, Cambodia. Dumond was released on 14 July 1972. On 12 February 1973, the Americans were released in accordance with the Paris Peace Accord.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E

25|$|Prior to excavation, historians <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Tomotley {{was founded}} by {{refugees}} from the Cherokee Middle, Lower, or Valley towns when they fled warfare with the Creek and later the English, whose attacks destroyed their towns in the mid-18th century. The goals of the 1976 excavations were {{to shed light on}} this theory by determining the location and structure of Tomotley's councilhouse, analyzing Tomotley's Cherokee dwellings, and establishing the general layout of the village.|$|E
25|$|The children's song Mors lilla Olle by Alice Tegnér {{is set in}} {{the forests}} of Fulufjället. Its story is {{inspired}} by a real event: during the winter of 1850–1851, four children were playing in the forest. One of them, Jon, was just one and a half. They met a bear and its cub. Jon crawled to the bear, who caressed him and fed him berries. When the toddler's mother arrived, she screamed, which made the bears flee. The little boy <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the bears were big black dogs.|$|E

25|$|Papua New Guinea is a Commonwealth realm. As such, Queen Elizabeth II is its {{sovereign}} {{and head}} of state.

The founders, however, considered that imperial honours had a cachet. The monarch {{is represented by the}} Governor-General of Papua New Guinea, currently Bob Dadae. Papua New Guinea (and the Solomon Islands) are unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature, rather than chosen by the executive branch.|$|E
25|$|The main battle {{began with}} a naval {{bombardment}} throughout {{the day and night}} of 28 December. The next day troops landed, taking a small fort, by Kupar Creek to the south-east of the city. The Chinese <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the attacking forces would try to capture Magazine Hill before they moved on the city walls, but on the morning on 29 December after a naval bombardment ending at 9am French troops climbed the city walls with little resistance. They had arrived at the wall half an hour early and so faced fire from their own guns. The British also broke into the city through the East gate.|$|E
25|$|Fukuda {{was born}} on April 12, 1913, in Tokyo. Her father {{died when she was}} very young. As a youth, she learned the arts of calligraphy, flower arrangement, and the tea ceremony; typical pursuits for a woman in Japan at that time. Despite her {{conventional}} upbringing, Fukuda felt close to judo through memories of her grandfather, and one day went with her mother to watch a judo training session. A few months later, she decided to begin training for herself. Her mother and brother supported this decision, but her uncle was opposed to the idea. Her mother and brother <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Fukuda would eventually marry one of the judo practitioners, but she never married, instead becoming a judo expert herself.|$|E

25|$|On October 29, 1901, outside Lexington, North Carolina, {{a freight}} train crashed into one unit of the train {{carrying}} Buffalo Bill's show from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Danville, Virginia. The freight train's engineer <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the entire show train had passed, not realizing it was three units, {{and returned to the}} tracks; 110 horses were killed in the crash or had to be killed later, including his personal mounts Old Pap and Old Eagle. No people were killed, but Annie Oakley's injuries were so severe that she was told she would never walk again. She did recover and continued performing later. The incident put the show out of business for a while, and this disruption may have led to its eventual demise.|$|E
25|$|Scholars <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> invaders {{attacked}} {{the city in}} the 7th or 8th century, sacking and burning it. More recent evidence, however, seems to indicate that the burning was limited to the structures and dwellings associated primarily with the ruling class. Some think this suggests that the burning was from an internal uprising. They say the invasion theory is flawed because early archaeological work on the city was focused exclusively on the palaces and temples, places used by the upper classes. Because all of these sites showed burning, archaeologists concluded that the whole city was burned. Instead, it is now known that the destruction was centered on major civic structures along the Avenue of the Dead. Some statues seem to have been destroyed methodically, with their fragments dispersed.|$|E
25|$|Modern historians {{tend to take}} {{a kinder}} view of Churchill’s actions at Antwerp. He had asked for the brigades minus recruits, {{and it had been}} Kitchener who insisted on {{retaining}} territorials in the UK to defend the East Coast against possible German invasion. Only 57 men were actually killed. In “The World Crisis” Churchill claimed he had prolonged Belgian surrender by a few days and occupied five German divisions. In fact it had been a week and enabled Calais and Dunkirk to be secured. Rhodes James believes that Antwerp was “substantially to Churchill’s credit”. However, at the time he <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> holding Antwerp would help the Allied advance north; the claim that it helped hold Calais and Dunkirk when the German advance resumed is hindsight. The more damaging attack, made inside and outside the Cabinet, was that Churchill was seeking publicity instead of running his department.|$|E

25|$|The quarter finals {{were not}} {{knockout}} but {{took the form}} of another round robin with the teams split into two groups. Fiji emerged as the only nation with an unbeaten record after overcoming Ireland, Tonga and Western Samoa in the first. The second group was more fiercely contested with each nation claiming at least one victory. Australia and England who progressed to the semi finals despite their respective defeats by New Zealand and Australia. England had assumed they would top their group and avoid Fiji, even with a defeat to Australia in the final pool game. They opted to rest some first team players but expressed dismay in finding themselves placed second in the group behind Australia. The England team <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> table placings {{in the event of a}} tied points tally were decided on tries scored. However, tournament rules stated that the first differentiator was results between the tied teams.|$|E
25|$|Nathan-Turner <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he {{too would}} finally be leaving the series, {{but with no}} other {{producer}} available or {{willing to take on}} the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he {{had little choice but to}} either accept this or resign from the Corporation's staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game than he ever let on.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Belfast {{was one of}} {{the major}} cities in the United Kingdom bombed by German forces. The British {{government}} <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Northern Ireland would be safe from German bombing because of its distance from German positions, and so very little was done to prepare Belfast for air raids. Few bomb shelters were built and the few anti-aircraft guns the city possessed were sent to England. The Belfast Blitz occurred on Easter Tuesday, 15 April 1941, when two hundred German Luftwaffe bombers attacked the city, pounding working class areas of Belfast around the shipyards and north Belfast-in particular, the New Lodge and Antrim Road areas. About one thousand people died and many more were injured. Of Belfast's housing stock, 52% was destroyed. Outside London, this was the greatest loss of life in a single raid during the war. Roughly 100,000 of the population of 415,000 became homeless. Belfast was targeted due to its concentration of heavy shipbuilding and aerospace industries. Ironically, during the same period the local economy made a recovery as the war economy saw great demand for the products of these industries.|$|E
