5|$|Tommy was {{originally}} released as a two-LP set with artwork designed by McInnerney, {{which included a}} booklet including lyrics and images to illustrate parts of the story. The cover is presented {{as part of a}} triptych-style <b>fold-out</b> cover, and the booklet contained abstract artwork that outlined the story. Although the album included lyrics to all the songs, indicating individual characters, it did not outline the plot, which led to a concert programme being prepared for shows, that carried a detailed synopsis.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a <b>fold-out</b> poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E

5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a <b>fold-out</b> desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E
50|$|USSR in Construction (СССР на стройке) was {{a journal}} {{published}} in the decade of 1930 to 1941, as well as briefly in 1949, in the Soviet Union.

With elements such as oversized pages and multi-page <b>fold-outs,</b> each issue exists as an elaborate artistic creation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1964, Jaffee {{created his}} longest-running Mad feature, the Fold-In. In each, a drawing is folded {{vertically}} and inward {{to reveal a}} new [...] "hidden" [...] picture (as well as a new caption). Originally, Jaffee intended it as a one-shot [...] "cheap" [...] satire of the triple <b>fold-outs</b> that were appearing in glossy magazines such as Playboy, National Geographic and Life. But Jaffee was asked to do a second installment, and soon the Fold-In became a recurring feature on the inside back cover of the magazine. In 2011. Jaffee reflected, [...] "The thing that I {{got a kick out}} of was ... Jeopardy! showed a Fold-In and the contestants all came up with the word they were looking for, which was [...] "Fold-In." [...] So I realized, I created an English language word." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1814 Hornor was {{advertising}} {{himself in}} S Wales as a ‘Pictural Delineator of Estates’ and soliciting commissions for the summer. He was successful and became wealthy producing bound portfolio volumes of plans, panoramas, watercolour paintings, all linked by exquisite copperplate handwritten accounts of tours in the area, {{for at least}} nine wealthy families with whom {{he appears to have}} mixed as an equal; at least one still bears the price, 500 guineas. The paintings [...] have sometimes been broken out from the original volumes and are interesting from topographic (especially the Neath and Taff valleys, and Glamorgan coast), historic (e.g. tin works around Neath; iron works at Merthyr Tydfil), technical (demonstrating the use of his camera obscura; use of <b>fold-outs),</b> and artistic (the same scene is often worked up in different ways) points of view. He has been noted as having had a penchant for painting moonlit scenes, and he also painted inside the Porth-yr-Ogof cave, whereas other artists painted only from outside.|$|R

The fourth chapter discusses the current {{practices of the}} bacon factory, including the stages in which the pigs are received, killed, branded and processed. The usage of the entire carcass is covered, from the blood to the fat and hair of the pig. Chapter five details the distribution and wholesale centers of the industry and the terms and regulations used. Chapter six details the selection and grading of the cuts, beginning with the most popular Wiltshire cut. Chapter seven and eight details the retail distribution of the bacon, and dividing the Wiltshire cut into different cuts and pricing. Chapter nine concludes with the retail distribution of the American and Canadian cuts. The book includes <b>fold-out</b> anatomical charts that were popular during the time.|$|E
5|$|What Were You Hoping For? was {{released}} on September 27, 2011, by Hunt's independent record label Godless Hotspot in {{a joint venture with}} Nashville-based distributor Thirty Tigers. It was distributed by RED Distribution. Thirty Tigers reached out to Hunt during 2009 and offered their distribution and marketing services to him pending the album's completion. He subsequently assembled a marketing team and Godless Hotspot. What Were You Hoping For? was executive-produced by music manager and executive Randy Jackson, who originally helped Hunt get his first major-label record contract in 2003. The album's cover is a photograph taken by Hunt in North Hollywood that depicts an elderly woman looking askance at a collection of white garbage bags set against a concrete wall. The interior packaging of the album also features Hunt's photography, including a kaleidoscopic collage of photographed subjects in the <b>fold-out</b> CD booklet.|$|E
5|$|The Eidgenössische Flugzeugwerke Emmen N-20 was a semi-tailless {{swept wing}} jet {{similar to the}} U.S. Navy's Vought F7U Cutlass with four engines mounted {{internally}} in the wings, <b>fold-out</b> canards to improve its aerodynamics at slow speeds, and a maximum designed airspeed of 1200km/h, a remarkable velocity for an aircraft of the early 1950s. The FFA P-16 was a single-engine straight-wing aircraft for which a contract for production of 100aircraft was awarded in 1958, but after the second crash of a pre-production model, the order was canceled. The aircraft had met all Swiss Air Force requirements for an STOL attack fighter capable of carrying heavy loads, and the crash was widely considered a pretext for the Swiss parliament to reverse itself. In addition, {{by the middle of}} 1958, influenced by NATO concepts, the LVK had redefined the Swiss doctrine of air power from close air support to counter-air operations. Further, the strategic concepts governing Swiss defense doctrine had shifted to a dynamic (mobile) defense that included execution of air missions beyond the Swiss border and the possibility of carrying nuclear weapons, for neither of which the P–16was suitable.|$|E
40|$|On Innards is a {{multidisciplinary}} project developed by artists, Amanda Couch, Andrew Hladky, and Mindy Lee, that explores the changing conceptualisations of guts and digestion, {{their impact on}} the creative process and the role they play in constructing and destabilising our sense of self. Recently, bookwork artist and designer Richard Nash joined the project to collaborate on a record of this two-year project, dissecting, reinterpreting, and reconnecting it {{in the form of a}} limited edition artist book, On Innards | Publication, published by bookRoom press. Lee, Couch and Hladky begin by ruminating on their panel and three-way conversation, presented at the second international Interdisciplinary conference, Body Horror, in Athens, in 2013. Their reflections on the project, joined by Nash's are interwoven with recalled events, artefacts, images, and stories from the conference panel, and the On Innards | Exhibition and Event of 2014, which includes contributions by Carlo Comanducci, Giskin Day, Dr. Simon Gabe, Kerry Gallagher, Nathaniel Storey, and Jamie Sutcliffe and Jenny Pengilly. Curated and intervened by Nash, the book becomes an embodiment of digestion, its intestinal form, a multitude of folds; concertinas, <b>fold-outs,</b> pop-ups, gate-folds, roll-folds and reveals, held by a mesenteric binding, which, when unwound, allows the book to be opened further, unfolding to reveal hidden ideas, images and text...|$|R
50|$|When Coblentz entered Cornell University, {{infrared}} spectroscopy was in what {{today would be}} considered an extremely primitive state. As a young Cornell researcher, Coblentz assembled and calibrated his own IR equipment, and extended the range of IR measurements to longer wavelengths than had ever been reached. By 1905 he had acquired hundreds of spectra by tedious point-by-point measurements with a prism instrument of his own construction. These were published in 1905 with large <b>fold-outs</b> charts (not available in the later reprints), and tables of wavelengths at which various materials absorbed IR light. While such a massive spectral compilation itself {{was something of a}} tour de force, it is perhaps not {{the most important part of}} Coblentz's 1905 book. Instead, that honor probably goes to his generalization that certain molecular groupings, or functional groups in modern parlance, appeared to absorb specific and characteristic IR wavelengths. In time this would allow scientists to use a molecule's IR spectrum as a type of molecular fingerprint. This generalization had been hinted at in earlier work by others, but not with such a large amount of supporting data as Coblentz presented. Today, IR spectra are used in thousands of laboratories around the globe by scientists in many fields.|$|R

5000|$|His largest composition, {{and the one}} {{to which}} he devoted {{attention}} {{for much of his}} early creative life, was his Kniga Zhizni (Le livre de vie, The Book of Life). According to Nicolas Slonimsky, writing in his autobiography Perfect Pitch, Obukhov's wife was so exasperated with her husband's obsessive activity on the massive and peculiar piece that once she attempted to destroy the score by cutting it up. The composer caught her in time, carefully and reverently suturing its wounds, and adding drops of his own blood where he repaired the torn pages. [...] He kept it in a [...] "sacred corner" [...] of their Paris apartment, in a shrine upon which he placed candles to burn day and night, along with religious icons. Obukhov considered himself the intermediary rather than the composer of the piece - the person through whom the Divine allowed it to be revealed to the world - and he called that revelation a [...] "sacred action" [...] rather than a concert performance. [...] Rather than using his full name, he signed this piece, as well as many others, as [...] "Nicolas l'illuminé" [...] (Nicolas the visionary). [...] It was intended to be performed - or rather, revealed - once a year, during the day and the night, on the first and second resurrections of Christ, in a cathedral specially constructed for that purpose alone. Of the huge piece, only the Prologue, and possibly some other sections, were performed during the composer's lifetime. The score itself is part of the presentation: it was huge, amounting to 800 pages in the lost fair copy, and 2,000 pages in the copy in the Paris Bibliothèque Nationale; some of the pages were cut and mounted {{in the shape of the}} cross, on cloth and colored paper. The score contains numerous <b>fold-outs</b> and collages. Some of the performance markings, in addition to the repairs, were in the composer's own blood.|$|R
