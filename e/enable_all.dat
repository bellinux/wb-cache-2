In many banks the conversion was done manually, as most bank branches were not yet computerised. February had been chosen for Decimal Day because it was the quietest time of the year for the banks, shops, and transport organisations.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{lifeboats}} {{could be}} stored {{within reach of}} the davits on the deck house roof, and in an emergency the gantry davits could reach lifeboats {{on the other side}} of the ship, providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way. The aim of this design was to <b>enable</b> <b>all</b> the lifeboats to be launched, even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent lifeboats being launched on the side opposite to the list. However, several of these davits were placed abreast of funnels, defeating that purpose. The ship carried 48 lifeboats, capable of carrying at least 75 people each. Thus, 3,600 people could be carried by the lifeboats, more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry.|$|E

The Authority built a new control room in 1981, which housed a computer control system for the site. Three years later, eight new sludge digesters were built, to <b>enable</b> <b>all</b> sludge dumped at sea to be digested first. Construction of the Mersey Valley Regional Sludge Pipeline began, linking Oldham to Davyhulme, and continuing to Sandon Dock in Liverpool. Davyhulme was able to treat sludge {{from a number of}} other sewage works to the east, and pump the digested product to Liverpool. Sludge boats ceased to use the ship canal, taking 15 minutes to transport sludge from Liverpool to a point {{to the north of the}} Bar Light in the Mersey, instead of over six hours required when using the canal.|$|E

500|$|The Kclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell's team in 1914 {{as part of his}} proposed standardisation programme following the Nclass, but the designs were not shown to the railway directors until early 1915 to <b>enable</b> <b>all</b> six designs to be shown at once. The design incorporated the principles of power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free running at high speeds, a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. The inclusion of these features is attributed to Holcroft, Maunsell's personal assistant, who had worked on the GWR 4300class and the Nclass. James Clayton, Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, brought simpler and more functional Midland Railway influences to the design, such as the shape of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. The latter was fitted with Ross pop safety valves and pressed to [...]|$|E
500|$|Mahaleo {{recorded}} {{their first}} album in 1973 upon {{the invitation of}} Raklio, leader of the group Rahona. He had heard their single [...] "Adin-tsaina" [...] ("Troubles") and suggested the band record it at the Comarmond studio in the Antanimena neighborhood of Antananarivo; [...] "Raosy Vony" [...] ("Yellow Rose") was also recorded as the album's B-side. Latimer Rangers began playing [...] "Adin-tsaina" [...] on his radio show, and the band enjoyed their first major hit. The band was invited to perform live on Rangers' show, enabling listeners to discover a larger repertoire of the band's compositions. The national radio received hundreds of fan letters for the group, leading the national television station to invite Mahaleo to film a short set performance for national broadcast. The band recorded the first ever LP record by a Malagasy artist or band in 1976. Entitled Mahaleo Madagascar, the album was recorded live inside a record shop and was produced by popular singer Bessa. Shortly afterward, the national television channel RadioTelevision Malgache (RTM) shot {{a black and white}} film of the band over the course of fifteen days in Antsirabe. Although the film generated strong acclaim from RTM viewers, all copies of the original recording have been lost. When the band performed a concert organized by the Alliance Francaise of Antananarivo in 1977, the demand for tickets greatly exceeded capacity of the venue, prompting the group to play the same concert twice in one evening to <b>enable</b> <b>all</b> their waiting fans to enjoy the performance.|$|E

2500|$|The People's Charter was {{released}} to the public on August 6, 2008. Deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase was critical of its content. He dismissed as [...] "unreasonable" [...] its proposal to dissolve political parties which [...] "engage in activities that breach important values of the Constitution". Qarase also opposed the proposed change in the country's demonym, which would <b>enable</b> <b>all</b> citizens of Fiji to refer to themselves as [...] "Fijians": [...] "That term [...] is embedded into the indigenous population. It is a very sensitive issue and it will be opposed very strongly." [...] Qarase stated that the Charter made a number of good suggestions, but that it would, on the whole, increase inter-ethnic tensions. He stated that [...] "ome of the key proposals in the charter, if implemented without the approval of an elected parliament, would be contrary to the provisions of the 1997 Constitution." [...] He called upon the Charter to be voted on by an elected Parliament, and, alternately, suggested a referendum to decide the issue. He added: ...|$|E
2500|$|Computationalism is a {{philosophy}} of mind theory stating that cognition {{is a form of}} computation. It is relevant to the Simulation hypothesis in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a [...] "virtual people" [...] simulation. For example, {{it is well known that}} physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy. If computationalism is correct and if there is no problem in generating artificial consciousness or cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality. Nevertheless, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal qualia of consciousness is disputed. It is possible that consciousness requires a vital substrate that a computer cannot provide and that simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be philosophical zombies. This would undermine Nick Bostrom's simulation argument; we cannot be a simulated consciousness, if consciousness, as we know it, cannot be simulated. The skeptical hypothesis remains intact, however, and we could still be envatted brains, existing as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if consciousness cannot be simulated. It has been suggested that whereas virtual reality would enable a participant to experience only three senses (sight, sound and optionally smell), simulated reality would <b>enable</b> <b>all</b> five (including taste and touch).|$|E
2500|$|What {{emerges from}} these philosophies, {{in the view}} of Hu, is a country with {{systematic}} approach to national structure and development that combines dynamic economic growth, a free market energized by a vigorous [...] "nonpublic" [...] (i.e., private) sector, heavy-handed political and media control, personal but not political freedoms, concern for the welfare of all citizens, cultural enlightenment, and a synergistic approach to diverse social issues (the Scientific Development Perspective) that lead, in Hu’s vision, to a [...] "Harmonious Socialist Society". In the view of the Chinese government, these philosophies, which have created a new [...] "China Model" [...] of governance, serve as a legitimate alternative to the West's [...] "Democracy Model", particularly for developing countries. In Hu’s words, [...] "A Harmonious Socialist Society should feature democracy, the rule of law, equity, justice, sincerity, amity and vitality." [...] Such a society, he says, will give full scope to people's talent and creativity, <b>enable</b> <b>all</b> the people to share the social wealth brought by reform and development, and forge an ever-closer relationship between the people and government.
