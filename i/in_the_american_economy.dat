25|$|In the United States, the {{corporation}} {{has emerged as}} an association of owners, known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by {{a complex set of}} rules and customs. Brought on by the process of mass production, corporations, such as General Electric, have been instrumental in shaping the United States. Through the stock market, American banks and investors have grown their economy by investing and withdrawing capital from profitable corporations. Today in the era of globalization, American investors and corporations have influence all over the world.

He needed to find a new printer for the photogravures for Camera Work, which had been printed in Germany for many years. The war caused a significant downturn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> and art became a luxury for many people.

25|$|As {{head of the}} Department of the Treasury, McAdoo confronted a major {{financial}} crisis on the eve and at the outbreak of World War I, July – August 1914. During {{the last week of}} July, 1914, British and French investors began to liquidate their American securities holdings into U.S. currency. Many of these foreign investors then converted their dollars into gold, as was common practice in international monetary transactions at the time, in order to repatriate their holdings back to Europe. If they had done this, they would have depleted the gold backing for the dollar, possibly inducing a depression in American financial markets and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> as a whole. They might then have been able to buy American goods and raw materials (for their war effort) at greatly depressed prices, which the Americans would have had to accept in order to restart the economy from a consciously (albeit inadvertently) caused depression.|$|E
5000|$|When Lewenthal {{commissioned}} {{his first}} lithographs <b>in</b> 1934, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> was still limping towards {{recovery from the}} Depression; high-priced art was an impossible luxury for most people and the old galleries that had always supported artists were finding it difficult to broker their work. AAA was thus [...] "an agent of economic salvation" [...] for numerous American artists including Peggy Bacon, Aaron Bohrod, John Steuart Curry, Luigi Lucioni, and Grant Wood, {{despite the fact that}} signing with AAA usually meant being fired from their higher-end gallery.|$|R
25|$|By 1936, all {{the main}} {{economic}} indicators had regained the levels of the late 1920s, except for unemployment, which remained high. <b>In</b> 1937, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> unexpectedly fell, lasting through most of 1938. Production declined sharply, as did profits and employment. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938. A contributing factor to the Recession of 1937 was a {{tightening of monetary policy}} by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve doubled reserve requirements between August 1936 and May 1937 leading to a contraction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> money supply.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{detailed}} analyses of the unrest was a study produced shortly after the riots by a Special Committee of the California Legislature, entitled To Rebuild is Not Enough. After extensive research, the Committee concluded that the inner-city conditions of poverty, segregation, lack of educational and employment opportunities, police abuse and unequal consumer services created {{the underlying causes of}} the riots. It also pointed to changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>economy</b> and the growing ethnic diversity of Los Angeles as important sources of urban discontent, which eventually exploded on the streets following the King verdicts. Another official report, The City in Crisis, was initiated by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners and made many of the same observations as the Assembly Special Committee about the growth of popular urban dissatisfaction leading up to the unrest. In their study Farrell and Johnson found similar factors which included the diversification of the L.A. population, tension between the successful Korean businesses and other minorities, use of excessive force on minorities by LAPD, and the effect of laissez-faire business on urban employment opportunities.|$|E
500|$|The Economist criticized Cowen for associating the {{economic}} problems resulting from the 2008 financial crisis to his broader thesis, arguing instead that this was mostly caused by a demand shock and mostly preventable. [...] Some scholars, such as Jim Rickards, Howard Qi, Hongbin Song, etc., {{point out that the}} demand shock was only the phenomenon, a result of a more serious underlying structural problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>economy.</b> Furthermore, Howard Qi argues that the education in the US is not conducive to producing high quality scientists and engineers from the American citizens. Instead, the US is becoming increasingly and vitally relying on foreign students in the US universities to support the intellectual need in the US's science and engineering. Matthew Yglesias also disagreed with the link: [...] "Rich countries have experienced very divergent fates over the past 36 months when the key evidence for the technological stagnation thesis is that rich countries have experienced a broadly similar fate over the past 36 years", he writes.|$|E

A critical link <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complex intermodal chain is on land [...] primarily outside immediate port boundaries. There are indications that surface transportation is under stress.

25|$|The {{need for}} these war {{materials}} created a huge spurt in production, thus leading to promising amount of employment in America.

2500|$|According to {{one survey}} of the {{existing}} economic literature, [...] "much of the existing research points towards positive net contributions by immigrant entrepreneurs." [...] Areas where immigrant are more prevalent in the United States have substantially more innovation (as measured by patenting and citations). Immigrants to the United States create businesses at higher rates than natives. Mass migration can also boost innovation and growth, {{as shown by the}} examples of German Jewish Émigrés to the US and the Mariel boatlift. Immigrants have been linked to greater invention and innovation in the US. According to one report, [...] "immigrants have started more than half (44 of 87) of America's startup companies valued at $1 billion or more and are key members of management or product development teams in over 70 percent (62 of 87) of these companies." [...] Foreign doctoral students are a major source of innovation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>economy.</b> In the United States, immigrant workers hold a disproportionate share of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM): [...] "In 2013, foreign-born workers accounted for 19.2 percent of STEM workers with a bachelor's degree, 40.7 percent of those with a master's degree, and more than half—54.5 percent—of those with a Ph.D." ...|$|E
