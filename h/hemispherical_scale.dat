This study evaluates the temporal evolution of snow water equivalent (SWE) for the February 2 ̆ 013 April spring period using the GlobSnow observation dataset for the 19802 ̆ 0132012 period. The analysis is performed for different regions of hemispherical to sub-continental scales for the Northern Hemisphere. The detection 2 ̆ 013 attribution analysis is then performed to demonstrate anthropogenic and natural effects on spring SWE changes for different regions, by comparing observations with six CMIP 5 model simulations for three different external forcings: all major anthropogenic and natural (ALL) forcings, greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing only, and natural forcing only. The observed spring SWE generally displays a decreasing trend, due to increasing spring temperatures. However, it exhibits a remarkable increasing trend for the southern parts of East Eurasia. The six CMIP 5 models with ALL forcings reproduce well the observed spring SWE decreases at the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>scale</b> and continental scales, whereas important differences are noted for smaller regions such as southern and northern parts of East Eurasia and northern part of North America. The effects of ALL and GHG forcings are clearly detected for the spring SWE decline at the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>scale,</b> based on multi-model ensemble signals. The effects of ALL and GHG forcings, however, are less clear for the smaller regions or with single-model signals, indicating the large uncertainty in regional SWE changes, possibly due to stronger influence of natural climate variability.

30|$|Tamura et al. (2011) {{presented}} the first investigation {{that creates a}} dataset of heat/salt fluxes, both by sea-ice production and melting on a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>scale</b> (Southern Ocean). In that study, the amount of melting ice is calculated from the daily decrease in SSM/I sea-ice concentration, taking account {{of the effect of}} ice drift and heat flux. The thickness of the melting ice is adjusted so that the total ice melting is balanced by the total ice production in the entire Southern Ocean. That study demonstrates that sea ice formed via losing latent heat with salt release in the coastal regions is transported offshore, where it gains latent heat from the atmosphere and releases freshwater by melting. Annual cumulative heat and salt contents show a large heat loss (11  ×  1020 J) and salt release (64  ×  1012 kg) in the coastal regions. This 64  ×  1012 kg of annual cumulative salt content implies that ~ 1900  Gt/yr of freshwater is supplied to the region outside of the coastal zone.

40|$|Dust {{particles}} {{represent a}} dominant source of particulate matter (by mass) to the atmosphere, and their emission from some source regions {{has been shown}} to be transported on regional and <b>hemispherical</b> <b>scales.</b> Dust particles' potential to interact with water vapor in the atmosphere can lead to important radiative impacts on the climate system, both direct and indirect. We have investigated this interaction for several types of dust aerosol, collected from the Southwestern United States and the Saharan region. A continuous flow diffusion chamber was operated to measure the ice nucleation ability of the dust particles in the temperature range of relevance to cirrus and mixed-phase clouds (− 65 T<− 20 °C). In most experiments, particles were size selected using a differential mobility analyzer prior to sampling to give information on heterogeneity of the sample with size, generally in the range of diameters 100 – 400 nm. All dust nucleated ice heterogeneously in the deposition mode colder than about − 40 °C, but required droplet activation in the exclusively heterogeneous ice nucleation regime warmer than − 36 °C. Ice nucleated on 1 % of dry generated dust particles at a similar relative humidity with respect to ice irrespective of temperature between − 60 and − 40 °C. The Saharan dust types exhibited a dependency on particle size below 500 nm. Additional data were collected during the International Workshop on Comparing Ice Nucleation Measurement Systems (ICIS, 2007) which indicated that ice nucleation on larger, polydisperse dust particles occurs at warmer temperatures than found for the smaller particles. When particles were coated with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) species, higher relative humidity was required for ice nucleation below − 40 °C, similar to that required for homogeneous nucleation of sulfates. However, ice nucleation was still observed on SOA-coated dust at warmer temperatures than are required for homogeneous nucleation of sulfates, indicating that condensation freezing occurs without any apparent deactivation for temperatures between − 25 and − 35 °C...|$|R
40|$|Morpho-stratigraphic {{approaches}} {{in the field}} of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction are time consuming, have a low temporal resolution and the problem of equifinality in terms of processes or simply the reputation of fuzziness. Nevertheless, investigations of seemingly continuous archives such as lake sediments are more effective if climate driven catchment signals are considered. Lake level data sets provide valuable indices for modelling the palaeoclimatic history and feedback-mechanisms on regional, supra-regional or even <b>hemispherical</b> <b>scales.</b> However, they are frequently used without considering the role of sediment trapping, signal buffering and random events (tectonic, mass-movements, etc.) along related sediment cascades. Moreover, dating inversions, record gaps and unlikely high or low SARs are considered as archive-internal disturbances or simply measurement errors which have to be smoothed by increasingly sophisticated tools of statistics or simply eliminated. This poster examines the value of such discontinuities and random events within continuous lake record for deciphering catchment-wide feedbacks/responses and their related processes. Our first example shows the influence of lake level changes and permafrost uplift on the reservoir effect of Lake Heihai, Northern Tibetan Plateau. A drop in lake level induced the reworking of sediment sequences, which is not identifiable by disturbances of the stratigraphy. This problem only becomes apparent, if several on-shore sediment records and at least two lake cores are compared. Several lake records from Hala Lake, Qilian Mountains, northeastern Tibetan Plateau confirm highly diverse stratigraphies and sediment properties, thus underpinning the necessity of data comparison from different locations (within the lake) for a reliable reconstruction of climate-driven hydrological variations within a lake-catchment system. A third example from a large endorheic foreland basin of the Tibetan Plateau (Ejina Basin also known as Gaxun Nur B.) shows that only a large set of well dated sediment records with overlapping time frame lead {{to an understanding of the}} underlying sedimentation processes. The information of sedimentation variance derived from a cored sediment record is punctual. Only the spatial relation and geomorphological context provide insights into a larger set of interrelated processes and thus ensure spatially reliable reconstructions of climate-induced hydrography. Finally we show that a single record without considering the geomorphological process ensemble will provide less resolution or greater fuzziness than a geomorphological archive. Only the combination of more than one core from a “final” sink, an unbiased analyses of different proxy sets and at least a well dated morphostratigraphy may lead to a reliable process-based reconstruction of palaeo-environmental (-climate) variance...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the common}} {{properties}} of fauna is their ability to move (Dickinson, Farley et al. 2000). Most animals are capable of relocating their position, and locomotion is often a key to survival. Animals forage, escape, and migrate. This is true not only for multi-cellular but also for single cell organisms (Murphy, Drone et al. 1985). It is even {{the case for the}} individual cells of a multi-cellular organism. The range of movements that I considered in this thesis ranges from the micron scale, such as the movement of neutrophils, to <b>hemispherical</b> <b>scales,</b> as in the case for the seasonal migration of birds and mammals. Moreover, movements can be un-coordinated and solitary, such as the movements of some cancer cells (Yamaguchi, Wyckoff et al. 2005), or they can be coordinated between several hundreds or thousands of individuals (flocking birds or fish) (Feder 2007). The quantification of movement gives important information about the underlying molecular processes in cells, which encompasses the field of molecular biology, or the complex behavior of (groups of) organisms, which encompasses the field of ethology. My studies are governed by the overarching question regarding the characteristics and driving forces of motion across several orders of magnitude. I investigated the locomotion inside cells at the nanometer scale, locomotion of individual cells at the micron scale, movements of single penguins inside a colony at the scale of centimeters to meters, movements of whales at a scale up to several kilometers, and the possibility to study movement of migratory and invasive species, at the scale of kilometers {{to tens of thousands of}} kilometers (Figure 1). The work presented in this thesis was performed in several phases; the first years concentrated on the biophysical aspects of cell migration and traction generation (Metzner, Raupach et al. 2007; Raupach, Zitterbart et al. 2007; Mierke, Kollmannsberger et al. 2008; Mierke, Zitterbart et al. 2008; Rösel, Brábek et al. 2008; Oakes, Patel et al. 2009; Mierke, Kollmannsberger et al. 2010); later, the focus switched to the macroscopic world, including a 15 month stay at Neumayer station, Antarctica, during which the idea of investigating the collective dynamics of emperor penguins (Zitterbart, Wienecke et al. 2011) arose. Subsequently, I investigated the local locomotion of whales in the presence of large ships (Burkhardt, Kindermann et al. 2011) (i. e. RV Polarstern). This study required the development of a technology to automatically detect whales (Zitterbart, Kindermann et al. 2011; Zitterbart, Kindermann et al. 2012).

Using emission rates of these radionuclides estimated from previous studies, three distinctive transport routes of these radionuclides toward the Korean Peninsula for a period from 10 March to 20 April 2011 were exploited by three spatial scales: 1) intercontinental scale - plume released since mid-March 2011 and transported to the North to arrive Korea on 23 March 2011, 2) global (<b>hemispherical)</b> <b>scale</b> - plume traveling over the whole northern hemisphere passing through the Pacific Ocean/Europe to reach the Korean Peninsula with relatively low concentrations in late March 2011 and, 3) regional scale - plume released on early April 2011 arrived at the Korean Peninsula via southwest sea of japan influenced directly by veering mesoscale wind circulations. Our identification of these transport routes at three different scales of meteorological circulations suggests the feasibility of a multi-scale approach for more accurate prediction of radionuclide transport in the study area. In {{light of the fact}} that the observed arrival/duration time of peaks were explained well by the FLEXPART model coupled with NCEP/GFS input data, our approach can be used meaningfully as a decision support model for radiation emergency situations.

The global and hemispherical temperatures reconstructed from glacier length fluctuations are in good agreement with the instrumental record of the last century. Furthermore our results agree with existing multi-proxy reconstructions of temperature in the preinstrumental period. The temperature record obtained from glacier fluctuations confirms the pronounced warming of the twentieth century, giving a global cumulative warming of 0. 94 ± 0. 31 K over the period 1830 – 2000 and a cumulative warming of 0. 84 ± 0. 35 K over the period 1600 – 2000...|$|R

DAMAS (Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources) array processing as well as straightforward individual microphone processing were employed to compile unique flyover and sideline directivity databases for a range of freestream Mach numbers (0. 11 - 0. 17) covering typical approach conditions. Comprehensive corrections were applied to the test data to account for shear layer ray path and amplitude variations. This allowed proper beamforming at different measurement orientations, as well as directivity presentation in free-field emission coordinates. Four different configurations of the landing gear were tested: a baseline configuration with and without an attached side door, and a noise reduction concept "toboggan" truck fairing with and without side door.

This finding permitted the determination of unique, spatially-detailed directivity contours of spectral band levels over a <b>hemispherical</b> surface. Spectral <b>scaling</b> for the baseline model confirmed that the acoustic intensity scaled with the expected sixth-power of the Mach number.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{relatively}} rapid, simple and repeatable method to characterize the crown architecture of Queensland maple (Flindersia brayleyana F. Muell.) by vertical <b>hemispherical</b> photography. Calibration <b>scales</b> were developed to provide horizontal planes of measurement at heights from 15 to 40 m above the camera. Hemispherical images of tree crowns were merged with the specific calibration scale appropriate for the mid-height of the crown in order to adjust for image distortion during measurement. Merged images were analyzed by three procedures to yield measurements of crown diameter and projected area. The most precise measurement of projected crown dimensions was assumed to be provided by a complete analysis of a digital image of the crown, after removal of the trunk image. Crown diameters estimated by tape measurements on the ground were relatively imprecise (R- 2 = 0. 54), Crowns classified as symmetrical were described much more precisely (R- 2 = 0. 72) than those classified as asymmetrical (R- 2 = 0. 37). The precision of estimates of crown dimensions by tape did not alter significantly over the range of crown sizes sampled (2 - 10 m diameter in trees 15 - 40 m tall). This novel image analysis method can yield relatively precise and accurate measurements on the relatively shallow crowns of tall trees, often found in rainforests, regardless of the degree of asymmetry in crown shapes. However, the method is slower to apply than conventional tape techniques and additional equipment is required. The principal advantage of the photographic technique is the opportunity for precise measurements of changes in crown size and foliage projected area over time.

40|$|International audienceDynamics and {{chemistry}} {{of the lower}} and middle stratosphere are characterized by manifold processes on different scales in time and space. The total column density of ozone, measured by numerous instruments, {{can be used to}} trace the resulting variability. In particular, satellite-borne spectrometers allow global observation of the total ozone distribution with proven accuracy and high temporal and spatial resolution. In order to analyse the zonal and hemispherical ozone variability a spectral statistical Harmonic Analysis is applied to multi-year total ozone observations from the Total Ozone Monitoring Spectrometer (TOMS). As diagnostic variables we introduce the hemispheric ozone variability indices one and two. They are defined as the hemispheric means of the amplitudes of the zonal waves number one and two, respectively, as traced by the total ozone field. In order to demonstrate the capability of the diagnostic for intercomparison studies we apply the hemispheric ozone variability indices to evaluate total ozone fields of the coupled chemistry-climate model ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM (hereafter: E 39 /C) against satellite observations. Results of a multi-year model simulation representing '' 2000 " climate conditions with an updated version of E 39 /C and corresponding total ozone data of TOMS from 1996 to 2004 (Version 8. 0) are used. It is quantified to what extent E 39 /C is able to reproduce the zonal and <b>hemispherical</b> large <b>scale</b> total ozone variations. The different representations of the hemispheric ozone variability indices are discussed. Summarizing the main differences of model and reference observations, we show that both indices, one and two, in E 39 /C are preferably too high in the Northern Hemisphere and preferably too low in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, where the coincidence is generally better, E 39 /C produces a too strong planetary wave one activity in winter and spring as well as a too high interannual variability. For the Southern Hemisphere we conclude that model and observations differ significantly during the ozone hole season. In October and November amplitudes of wave number one and two are underestimated. This explains that E 39 /C exhibits a too stable polar vortex and a too low interannual variability of the ozone hole. Further, a strong negative bias of wave number one amplitudes in the tropics and subtropics from October to December is identified, which may also contribute to the zonal-symmetric polar vortex. The lack of wave two variability in October and November leads to weak vortex elongation and eventually a too late final warming. Contrary, too high wave number two amplitudes in July and August indicate why the polar vortex is formed too late in season by E 39 /C. In general, the hemispheric ozone variability indices can be regarded as a simple and robust approach to quantify differences in total ozone variability on a monthly mean basis. Therefore, the diagnostic represents a core diagnostic for model intercomparisons within the CCM Validation Activity for WCRP's (World Climate Research Programme) SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate) regarding stratospheric dynamics...|$|R

The main objective of the LIVE program at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) is to study the core melt phenomena both experimentally in large-scale 2 D and 3 D geometry and in supporting separate-effects tests {{in order to provide}} a reasonable estimate of the remaining uncertainty band under the aspect of safety assessment. Within the LIVE experimental program several tests have been performed with water and with non-eutectic melts (mixture of KNO 3 and NaNO 3) as simulant fluids to study the heat flux distribution in the conditions when the melt pool is covered by water from the top. The tests were performed in LIVE- 3 D and LIVE- 2 D facilities using different simulant materials and under different external cooling condition. The upward and downward heat transfer was compared between the 2 D and 3 D geometries. Although similar heat flux distribution through the vessel wall is observed for LIVE- 3 D and LIVE- 2 D tests, LIVE- 2 D test results have shown higher heat transfer {{from the top of the}} melt pool as compared to the LIVE- 3 D tests and to results from previous studies. Using water as simulant material resulted in a lower heat transfer both to the top of the pool and to the vessel wall. The outcomes of the LIVE top-cooling tests provide new insights for the evaluation of the established Nu-Ra correlations. The results of these experiments allow a direct comparison with findings obtained earlier in other experimental programs (SIMECO, ACOPO, BALI, etc.) and are used for the assessment of the correlations derived for the molten pool behavior.
