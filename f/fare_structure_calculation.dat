40|$|This study extends taxi {{models with}} an {{explicit}} consideration of perceived profitability and nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>structure.</b> The expected profit {{is defined as}} the profit per unit time (inclusive of both occupied and vacant taxi times) that a taxi driver expects to receive from picking up a customer in a particular zone or location. It has great impact on taxi driver’s location choice in search of customers. The <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> will directly govern the profitability of taxi rides of different lengths. With these explicit considerations, the extended model is intended to simulate the market effects of adopting a nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> with a diminishing fare rate per unit distance. The proposed nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> could potentially tackle the problem of taxi fare bargaining for discounts largely due to the current linear <b>fare</b> <b>structure.</b> Analysis of sensitivity of social welfare gain and profitability as well as taxi/customer waiting times is conducted with respect to the parameters in the nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, many {{low-cost}} airlines have been created around the world. Legacy carriers used to apply revenue management (RM) to fully-restricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> with segmented demand. These low-fare competitors with simplified or unrestricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> often manage to capture {{an important part of}} the demand in the markets they enter, forcing legacy carriers to change their <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> However, because of this change in <b>fare</b> <b>structures,</b> most RM forecasters and optimizers that were previously used by the legacy carriers are no longer effective. The goal of this thesis is to describe and test two RM methods based on dynamic programming in <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> with few or no restrictions. The first one, the "Lautenbacher" approach (DP-LB), was developed for fully-restricted environments but, when associated with an appropriate forecaster, may be used in less-restricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> The second one, the "Gallego-Van Ryzin" approach (DP-GVR), was developed for unrestricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> In this thesis we describe these two methods, and analyze the performance of both in comparison with the performance of traditional RM methods used by legacy carriers, based on results obtained with the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulation (PODS). In our simulation DP-LB leads to results very close to those obtained with traditional RM methods. In unrestricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> DP-GVR appeared to be theoretically appealing. The simulation results obtained with DP-GVR against a competitor using no RM or against a competitor using the same RM method were better than those obtained with other RM methods. But against advanced competitors, DP-GVR got worse results than other RM methods. (cont.) We showed that this variability in the performance of DP-GVR was related to its sensitivity to forecasts of probabilities of sell-up, forecasts that are difficult to estimate because they depend on the RM methods and actions of the competition. Further study with improved estimation of probabilities of sell-up will be required to determine whether this method can lead to stable improvement over traditional RM methods in unrestricted <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> by Thierry Vanhaverbeke.

40|$|Three wheelers have a {{significant}} contribution towards the road transportation as a popular para-transit mode in the country. Though three wheeler taxi provides valuable services, it is not appreciated at all. Only negative aspects are highlighted. Its existence and operation fail to get the credits from the society. Three wheeler transport services is unregulated at present and is mainly criticized for its “unfair” <b>fare</b> <b>structure.</b> Many three-wheeler users view that they are often exploited by drivers who over-state distance and charge higher fares. It is also observed that the fares are generally inconsistent and may vary from operator to operator, {{in addition to the}} distance travelled and journey time. Further, three wheeler meters are calibrated arbitrarily by the operators. Absence of a proper <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> for three wheelers causes inconvenience to both operators and passengers. Therefore development of a <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> would lead to minimization of imbalances and inefficiency in the service under prevailing <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> At present, passengers are charged with a minimum fee of Rs. 50 for the first kilometer and henceforth each kilometer is charged at a rate of Rs. 40 per km. There is no systematic procedure to charge for two way trips and waiting time. This study is an attempt to examine the price irregularities and explore the cost recovery in three-wheeler transport services and thereby develop a systematic <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> for Three-Wheelers based on both passenger and Three-Wheeler drivers’ perspectives. A <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> should be transparent, simple and understandable by each party to be effective and <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> is the instrument to recover cost and it acts as the communicator between the operator and the passenger of the taxi service. After considering the present operational cost and cost recovery of a three wheeler, including the profit mark-up, a new <b>fares</b> <b>structure</b> is proposed considering all stakeholder requirements and expectations. It is shown that the three wheeler is best for shorter distances (last mile connectivity) and not efficient for longer distances. Hence, three wheelers should not be encouraged for longer distances travelas public bus transport and the van service are more efficient for longer distances...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>structures</b> in taxi markets using an extended taxi model with an explicit consideration of perceived profitability. The expected profit, defined as the profit per unit time (inclusive of both occupied and vacant taxi times), that a taxi driver expects to receive from picking up a customer in a particular zone or location, has great impact on the taxi driver's choice of location {{in the search for}} customers. The <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> directly governs the profitability of taxi rides of different distances originating from different locations. With these explicit considerations, the extended model is intended to look into the market effects of adopting a nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> with declining incremental charges. The proposed nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> could help restore a level-playing field for taxi operators whose businesses have been affected by some taxi drivers who resort to practices such as offering fare discounts or accepting requests for discounted fares from passengers for long-haul trips. Analysis of sensitivity of social welfare and profit gain as well as taxi/customer wait/search times is conducted with respect to the parameters in the nonlinear <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> for the Hong Kong taxi market, and Pareto-improving nonlinear fare amendments are identified that neither disadvantage any customer nor reduce the taxi operators' profits.

40|$|Due to the {{disturbance}} of unexpected effects and adverse weather conditions, transit {{supply and demand}} manifests many uncertainties. In this paper, we take account of these uncertainties and propose a transit <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> design model including both ground and underground public transportation. Such transit fare design problem is described through bilevel programming, in which the upper level is the transportation authority’s transit <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> decision aiming to minimize the transit network’s total travel and operation cost, while the lower level is a transit network assignment model considering supply and demand uncertainties that influence passengers’ travel choice decisions. A heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the problem, and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the application. We get some important results: (1) a diversified <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> considering uncertain weather’s impact is quite necessary; (2) when the value of time is at a high level, metro fare should be higher than bus fare; (3) the optimal metro and bus fare should be close under an extremely adverse weather condition; (4) <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> could be quite different with varied value of time...|$|R
40|$|A bilevel {{model is}} {{presented}} to optimize the <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> for transit networks with elastic demand under the assumption of fixed transit service frequency. It is known that the transit <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> has significant effects on passengers' demand and route choice behavior. The transit operator therefore should predict passengers' response to changing fare charges. A bilevel programming method is developed to determine the optimal <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> for the transit operator while taking passengers' response into account. The upper-level problem seeks to maximize the operator's revenue, whereas the lower-level problem is a stochastic user equilibrium transit assignment model with capacity constraints. A heuristic solution algorithm based on sensitivity analysis is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is given together with some useful discussion.

40|$|Transit {{scholars}} have long advocated {{the use of}} differentiated transit pricing to improve service efficiency and equity among riders. Using Metropolitan Vancouver as a case study, I examine the effects on transit revenues and equity measures of two strategies – distance-based and time-of-day pricing. The analysis uses an established transportation forecasting model, combined with survey data from TransLink and estimates of price elasticity of demand from the literature to predict change in demand due {{to change in the}} <b>fare</b> <b>structure.</b> Information from transit agencies in Washington, DC, and Toronto, Ontario provides insights into issues of implementation complexity and public and political acceptance of differentiated <b>fare</b> <b>structures.</b> The analysis reveals an improvement in terms of increase in trips and reduced fares for lower income, captive and transit-dependent riders, and for riders from certain municipalities, with distance-based pricing. With a time-of-day <b>fare</b> <b>structure</b> there is slight improvement for low-income riders, an increase in revenues, and a small shift of trips from peak to off-peak times.
