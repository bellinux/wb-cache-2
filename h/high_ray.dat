5|$|The pink whipray is {{valuable}} to ecotourism at {{sites in the}} Maldives, French Polynesia, and elsewhere; they are attracted to visitors in large numbers {{by the promise of}} food. The government of the Maldives has taken steps to preserve ray ecotourism by banning all exports of ray products in 1995. In 2005, stingray ecotourism at Moorea brought in over €500,000. However, a 2008 study of Moorea whiprays found a negative effect of ecotourism in the form of bite and impact injuries, stemming from artificially <b>high</b> <b>ray</b> density and interactions with boat traffic at the feeding sites. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pink whipray as Vulnerable overall. Although the species has a wide distribution that includes refuge regions with few conservation threats such as the population off northern Australia. By contrast the Southeast Asian population is heavily fished.|$|E

5000|$|In 1965 Mascaro, Rickets and Dewey Bonds {{assembled}} the Modds and recruited Dean Laipis on lead vocals, and Bob Nimer on lead guitar. [...] Dennis O'Barry later succeeded Nimer on lead guitar. [...] The band was highly influenced by British Invasion, citing the Beatles' February 9, 1964 {{performance of the}} Ed Sullivan Show as a major influence. [...] They {{would be one of}} the first local bands to cover the Rolling Stones' 1965 hit song, [...] "Satisfaction" [...] in live performances, however, their repertoire also reflected the influence of American R&B and soul acts such as Sam Cooke. [...] The band's name was influenced by the popular mod movement going on in England at the time, but the band added an extra [...] "-d" [...] to the end of the name. [...] Most of their rehearsals were conducted at Mascaro's or Dewey's houses. [...] The band would play frat parties, local dance halls, such as the PAL (Police Athletic League), usually averaging $3.00 to $10.00 per member each night, but would occasionally play for free. [...] With the help of their science teacher at Southwest <b>High,</b> <b>Ray</b> Skopp, who became their manager, the band would eventually be able to land gigs at posh Miami Beach hotels such as the Americana, the Fontainebleau, and the Deuville, where the Beatles appeared for their second Ed Sullivan performance.|$|E

Particularly a variation of a hybrid test having all benefits of Plücker and projected barycentric tests is proposed. The test is also vectorized using SIMD instructions for efficient handling ray packets. It is essential for achieving <b>high</b> <b>ray</b> tracing performance on modern CPUs. Our implementation also detects axis-orthogonal triangles and processing them separately. For maximum performance we also introduce a method for triangle representation, using only necessary pre-computed values. We also present inherently thread-safe and memory efficient alternative of mailboxing to avoid unnecessary intersection tests for ray packet in case when many leaves share the same triangle...|$|E
40|$|Raytracing is {{a simple}} and elegant {{solution}} to many realistic image synthesis problems such as global illumination. Recent hardware advances have made GPU based raytracing possible. This paper explores the design space {{as well as the}} characteristics and limitations of interactive raytracing on said platform. We implement a GPU-based raytracer and compare it with a native as well as a modified CPU raytracer that mimics the GPU raytracer. We found that the GPU raytracer was almost always slower than the CPU raytracer, typically by a factor of 2 x. The primary reason for the poor performance is the high cost of per pixel branching. This is illustrated in a pathological test case that causes <b>high</b> <b>ray</b> divergence. Additionally, the constraints of the architecture mandate inefficient modifications to the kd-tree traversal routine. ...|$|E
40|$|Sampling {{convection}} in the Earth's mantle by {{seismic tomography}} is difficult {{as evidenced by}} the uneven distribution of seismic stations and events with some regions being well imaged compared to others. Here we quantitatively explore tomographic filtering on Earth structure by tracing ISC P‐body‐wave data through a computer simulation of mantle circulation which accounts for internal heating of the mantle by radioactive decay, heatflux from the core, a depthwise increase in viscosity, and plate motion history of the past 120 million years. The travel time residuals are inverted by solving jointly for structure and hypocentral parameters with explicit damping and smoothing. We recover the Farallon and Tethys slabs as well as some low velocity anomalies associated with hot upwelling flow suggesting that tomographic filtering is probably minor in areas of <b>high</b> <b>ray</b> density...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we present the use of {{staggered}} grid {{as a tool to}} improve the resolution of inverse model in seismic tomography in the case of elliptical anisotropic media. We analyze two synthetic models, both showing elliptical anisotropic characteristics, with different complexity: the first consists of a body with rectangular shape having inside an anomaly with higher velocity and the second one is characterized by morphological variation to simulate a watershed. This second case is studied for both cross-hole and <b>high</b> <b>ray</b> coverage configuration. Successively, a previous field survey is analyzed introducing staggered grids and the results are compared with the old ones, solved using a constant cells’ size model.

30|$|The {{electronic}} sources {{based on}} laser assisted electron emission have found applications in different fields {{of science and}} technology including particle accelerators [1], free electron lasers [2], and modern photovoltaic systems [3]. The laser assisted electron emission has opened a way towards the time resolved electron microscopy [4, 5] because electrical gating and source control enable time resolution down to picoseconds, while using optical control enables creation of electron pulses with duration down to tens of femtoseconds [6]. Such dense and short electron bunches can resolve important problems in electron microscopy, X-ray microscopy, and time-resolved electron diffraction, which is of special interest for industry and science. However, development of such electron sources requires cathode materials, which are capable to provide a high density electron current and possess a <b>high</b> <b>ray</b> stability [7 – 9]. One of the most promising materials here are nanocarbon films (NCF) consisting of disordered graphene sheets [10] that demonstrated high efficiency of the field electron emission and durability with response to laser treatment. Owing to their unique structure and relative simplicity of the fabrication process, NCF are promising for various applications in electronic devices. However, implementation of the NCF in practice implies getting more information on the electron emission mechanism. This paper reports experimental results and theoretical analysis aiming at the mechanism of the ultrashort laser pulse assisted electron emission from NCF.|$|E

This code {{has been developed}} {{on the base of}} two well-known widely used tomographic algorithms (LOTOS and ATOM- 3 D), providing a robust set of algorithms. The dataset used to set and test the program has been provided by TOMO-ETNA experiment. TOMO-ETNA database is a large, high-quality dataset that includes active and passive seismic sources recorded during a period of 4 months in 2014. We performed a series of synthetic tests in order to estimate the resolution and robustness of the solutions. Real data inversion has been carried out using 3 different subsets: i) active data; ii) passive data; and iii) joint dataset. Active database is composed by a total of 16, 950 air-gun shots during 1 month and passive database includes 452 local and regional earthquakes recorded during 4 months. This large dataset provides a <b>high</b> <b>ray</b> density within the study region.
