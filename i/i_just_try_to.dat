500|$|Following {{accusations of}} Satanism, Smith decided that Closed Casket {{would be the}} last album to feature such themes, and that he would no longer rap about the Devil. According to Smith, [...] "I've been able to {{entertain}} people for 20 years. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> uplift people now. The latest things I do, I'm trying to get a message out to people, while I'm entertaining them at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Marceline {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{characters}} in Adventure Time. Although she did not appear in the series' pilot, the groundwork for her design and character were present in the series pitch book, penned by series creator Pendleton Ward. Ward purposely set out to make Marceline's character complex, as he explained that [...] "with the female characters it’s easy to either write them as clichés or write them as the extreme opposite of those clichés [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make them have faults and strengths just like Finn and Jake have." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Maria Theresa and Joseph {{was not without}} warmth but was complicated and their personalities clashed. Despite his intellect, Maria Theresa's force of personality often made Joseph cower. Sometimes, she openly admired his talents and achievements, but criticised him behind his back. She wrote: [...] "We never see each other except at dinner ... His temper gets worse every day ... Please burn this letter ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> avoid public scandal." [...] In another letter, also addressed to Joseph's companion, she complained: [...] "He avoids me ... I am {{the only person in}} his way and so I am an obstruction and a burden ... Abdication alone can remedy matters." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{appreciate}} {{other kinds}} of drummers who play differently, but it's not my style or what works for this band. I get [...] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I {{realize that this is}} what is really needed for this band. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. I can always sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of Marceline, {{one of the main}} characters in Adventure Time. Although she did not appear in the series' pilot, the groundwork for her design and character were present in the series pitch book, penned by Pendleton Ward. Marceline's name is based on the name of a childhood friend of Ward's friend, named Marie, whose middle name is Marceline. Ward described Marie as someone who likes the horror movie Psycho and wearing dark clothing. Ward purposely set out to make Marceline's character complex, as he explained in an interview that [...] "with the female characters it’s easy to either write them as clichés or write them as the extreme opposite of those clichés [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make them have faults and strengths just like Finn and Jake have." ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalists have}} noted the title and artwork as {{reflective}} of the album's musical influences. A columnist for the Santa Fe Reporter later described the artwork as [...] "totally cool, with a blocky style depicting some kind of Miami soul food/taco stand." [...] Music journalist Kimberley Chun of the San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote of the concept, stating [...] "So what is a soul food taquería? Do you get a side of collard greens with your menudo?" [...] In an interview with Chun, Guerrero discussed the concept and title, stating [...] "It's just this funny idea I had, {{growing up in the}} city – it's so diverse. The city itself is just down-home, down-to-earth, blue-collar, full of everyday kind of people. My music is along the same lines, just being simple – <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be honest in what I do." ...|$|E

500|$|Also that month, Cosmopolitan {{published}} {{the first interview}} with Manning in prison, conducted by mail. Cosmo reported that Manning was optimistic about recent progress but said that not being allowed to grow her hair long was [...] "painful and awkward … I am torn up. I get through each day okay, but at night, when I'm alone in my room, I finally burn out and crash." [...] Manning said it was [...] "very much a relief" [...] to announce {{that she is a}} woman and did not fear the public response. [...] "Honestly, I'm not terribly worried about what people out there might think of me. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be myself." [...] According to Cosmo, Manning had her own cell with [...] "two tall vertical windows that face the sun", and could see [...] "trees and hills and blue sky and all the things beyond the buildings and razor wire".

Connie and Sam were again voted 'Best Couple of Series 9', with Tom Chambers' portrayal of Sam during {{the birth of their}} daughter voted fifth 'Best Acting Performance' of the series. Asked to comment on why he thought Sam had proven so popular with viewers, Chambers responded: [...] "No idea! <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> turn up on time and learn my lines. I love playing Sam and finding different ways of doing things. It's a roller-coaster of emotions and storylines - some are not as easy to manage as others and it's always a challenge to find the most natural and interesting way to deliver." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E

In 129 playoff games, he had eighty-five goals and seventy-five assists. When he retired, he held the record for most goals per season average with 57.3. While he wanted to be considered a great overall player, he was basically known for his impressive scoring output. Even he did not completely understand how he did it. As he was quoted as saying by Stan Fischler in The All-New Hockey's 100, [...] "About 90 percent of the time I don't aim: <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get my shot away as quick as possible as a surprise element. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get the puck on net." ...|$|E
