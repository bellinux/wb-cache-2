In 1887 the service between Aberdeen and Dyce had improved with more local trains and new stations; {{by the end of}} that year there were twelve trains a day, eventually becoming twenty trains a day calling at nine stops <b>in</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes.</b> The trains were initially called the Jubilees, as it was Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, but became known as the Subbies. Suburban services were also introduced between Aberdeen and Culter on the Deeside Line in 1894, after the track had been doubled, starting with ten down and nine up trains calling at seven stops in twenty-two minutes. The number of trains was eventually doubled and an additional station provided.|$|E

The American and British ambassadors informed Meguid that their governments refused, repeating their policies of not negotiating with terrorists.|$|E

25|$|At 22:29 JST, {{workers had}} succeeded in {{refilling}} half the reactor with water but parts of the rods were still exposed, and technicians could {{not rule out the}} possibility that some had melted. It was hoped that holes blown in the walls of reactor building 2 by the earlier blast from Unit 3 would allow the escape of hydrogen vented from the reactor and prevent a similar explosion. At 21:37 JST, the measured dose rates at the gate of the plant reached a maximum of 3.13 mSv/h, which was enough to reach the annual limit for non-nuclear workers <b>in</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes,</b> but had fallen back to 0.326 mSv/h by 22:35.|$|E

This was a wet summer and most of the bowling in the series was done by spinners, but Trueman still managed 5–31 in the first Test at Edgbaston. He pulled off a {{remarkable}} anticipatory catch in the Lord's Test when he stepped forward from his short leg position to catch the ball off a defensive stroke with his hand on the batsman's boot. In the Final Test at the Oval, he made the highest score of his whole Test career with 39 not out <b>in</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes,</b> including three sixes off Alex Moir.|$|E

However, England lost the match after a lower order batting collapse losing 6 wickets for only 31 runs which resulted in England losing by 75 runs. Panesar was not selected to play in the final test of the series, which England won by 8 wickets.|$|E
25|$|Sometime after 0100, 12 August, 2nd Battalion {{lost contact}} with C Company on the ridge northward and sounds of combat could be heard coming from that area. When further efforts to reach the company by {{telephone}} and radio failed, the battalion commander sent runners and a wire crew out to try to re-establish contact. He then urged speedy movement of the trains and artillery westward through the pass. But the regimental commander reluctantly held firm to division orders not to move until after daylight. The runners returned and {{said they could not}} find the company. The wire crew was missing. Members of the battalion staff had again heard sounds of combat in the company area. They also had seen flares there. This was interpreted to mean that North Korean troops held it and were signaling to allied units. Still unable to contact the division, 5th Infantry now decided to move the trains and artillery out westward while it was still dark, despite division orders to wait for daylight, seeing too much risk in delaying any longer. The battalion of the 24th Infantry promised by the division had not arrived. About 0400 the trains to moved out. They were to be followed by the artillery, and then the 1st Battalion would bring up the rear. In the meantime, the battalion was to hold open the pass and protect the regimental column. Movement of the trains through the pass should have been accomplished <b>in</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes,</b> but it required hours. During the hour or more before daylight, no vehicle moved more than ten or twenty feet at a time. One of the factors creating this situation was caused when the Medical Company tried to move into the column from its position near the 1st Battalion command post. An ambulance hung up in a ditch and stopped everything on the road behind it until it could be pulled out.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented positively on the episode, {{and said that}} [...] "if any show's taken a more unusual path to a story about xenophobia, I've not seen it." [...] He praised the bear scenes, which he thought was the episode's most [...] "amusing" [...] part. The review continued, [...] "The parts with the immigrants are also good, especially since they make their point deftly. Add to that the hilarious sound of 'American Apu' {{and this is a}} strong program." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be when Homer tries to teach Apu American history, noting Homer's [...] "relevant and complex" [...] diagram of a stovepipe hat. Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "One of the most outspoken, and certainly angriest of episodes succeeds as a savage satire on the scapegoating of immigrants. Homer has never been so frighteningly dumb, although he does come through with a rousing liberal speech." [...] The episode is The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's third favorite episode of the show. The episode received a negative review from Dave Foster of DVD Times. He considered [...] "Much Apu About Nothing" [...] to be one of the season's most [...] "tiring" [...] episodes, [...] "mostly because Apu is not a strong enough character to focus an episode on no matter how much writer David Cohen develops him". Foster commented that the episode deals with a political issue which is [...] "difficult to broach <b>in</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes</b> and is therefore reached and sewn up in a rather haphazard manner".|$|E
