6000|$|I am {{bound to}} tell you that I don't think your letter makes out any sort of case for the bad manners of [...] "Boon," [...] as far as your indulgence in them at the expense of your poor old H. J. is concerned--I say [...] "your" [...] simply because he has been yours, in the most liberal, continual, sacrificial, the most admiring and abounding {{critical}} way, ever since he began to know your writings: as to which you have had copious testimony. Your comparison of the book to a waste-basket strikes me as the reverse of felicitous, for what one throws into that receptacle is exactly what one doesn't commit to publicity and make the affirmation of one's estimate of one's contemporaries by. I should liken it much rather to the preservative portfolio or drawer in which what is withheld from the basket is savingly laid away. Nor do I feel it anywhere evident that my [...] "view of life and literature," [...] or what you impute to me as such, is carrying everything before it and becoming a public menace--so unaware do I seem, on the contrary, that my products constitute an example in any measurable degree followed or a cause in any degree successfully pleaded: I can't but think that if this were the case I should find it somewhat attested in their circulation--which, alas, I have reached a very advanced age in the entirely defeated hope of. But I have no view of life and literature, I maintain, other than that our form of the latter in especial is admirable exactly by its range and variety, its plasticity and liberality, its fairly living on the sincere and shifting experience of the individual practitioner. That is why I have always so admired your so free and strong application of it, the particular rich receptacle of intelligences and impressions emptied out with an energy of its own, that your genius constitutes; and that is in particular why, in my letter of two or three days since I pronounced it curious and <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should find the case I constitute myself only ridiculous and vacuous to the extent of your having to proclaim your sense of it. The curiosity and the interest, however, in this latter connection are of course for my mind those of the break of perception (perception of the veracity of my variety) {{on the part of a}} talent so generally inquiring and apprehensive as yours. Of course for myself I live, live intensely and am fed by life, and my value, whatever it be, is in my own kind of expression of that. Therefore I am pulled up to wonder by the fact that for you my kind (my sort of sense of expression and sort of sense of life alike) doesn't exist; and that wonder is, I admit, a disconcerting comment on my idea of the various appreciability of our addiction to the novel and of all the personal and intellectual history, sympathy and curiosity, behind the given example of it. It is when that history and curiosity have been determined in the way most different from my own that I want to get at them--precisely for the extension of life, which is the novel's best gift. But that is another matter. Meanwhile I absolutely dissent from the claim that there are any differences whatever in the amenability to art of forms of literature aesthetically determined, and hold your distinction between a form that is (like) painting and a form that is (like) architecture for wholly null and void. There is no sense in which architecture is aesthetically [...] "for use" [...] that doesn't leave any other art whatever exactly as much so; and so far from that of literature being irrelevant to the literary report upon life, and to its being made as interesting as possible, I regard it as relevant in a degree that leaves everything else behind. It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance, for our consideration and application of these things, and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process. If I were Boon I should say that any pretence of such a substitute is helpless and hopeless humbug; but I wouldn't be Boon for the world, and am only yours faithfully, ...|$|E

The results of our baseline studies are clearly in agreement since a majority of patients have a strongly positive correlation between heart rate and PVC frequency. The method you have used to display this correlation is an interesting one and if my interpretation is correct, would demonstrate this relationship only when it is a positive one. I am uncertain as to how some of our patients with complex relationships between PVC frequency and heart rate would be depicted using your data display format. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> found a dissociation of this heart rate PVC frequency relationship during timolol therapy.

I do think, however, that it confirms our impression that using assessments of these relationships may be a new and interesting way to evaluate antiarrhythmic drugs. Given the large number of individual differences in this relationship, I wonder about the advisability of lumping all patients together and presenting averages for the group. I would prefer to have seen individual plots for each of your patients.

This essay is an explorative case study that will compare four Swedish municipalities quality of local school system against the municipality ´s backgrounddata and a governing document: Skolplan. This study begins in a previous benchmarking study made by one of Sweden’s teachers unions Lärarförbundet. This is a statistical study that ranked the Swedish municipalities against each other’s according to their accomplishments {{in a number of}} areas related to their school systems. Its name is Bästa skolkommun 2011 and has been made for the last 10 years. In my own study this ranking will be used to sort out one representing municipality for each quartile of the total 290 in Sweden. To get the municipality ´s as similar as possible I then took the largest town in that quartile for comparison. Therefore the three biggest Swedish cities have been examined (Stockholm, Malmö, Gothenburg) and as well a major university town of Sweden (Lund). The main purpose of this study is to track down possible causes behind the ranking in Bästa skolkommun 2011. In the first part of the essay I compare the municipality´s background´s data. This is a quantitative part where data hailing from Swedens statistical authority’s. According to this will all the following factors grant a higher level of ranking in the Bästa skolkommun 2011 study: Low crime rates, a large group of the population with higher education, high voting figures in national democratic elections and low amount of days at home due to sickness. Strange enough doesn’t high taxing and high income in the populace have an impact on the ranking. The second part of this essay is a mostly conceptual study that will examine the municipality´s local school governing document the: Skolplanen (School planning). Before the Swedish change of law 2011 this was a document, in law demanded to exist. But the local authorities had a large freedom to shape them themselves. Therefore this is an ideological document where the local authorities can make their politics heard. I made a closer examination of the documents to see if any possible explanation to the municipality´s ranking could be found in the documents. In this we could peer a few things: Size was an important matter. The worst ranked was the largest document in text and the second worst ranked was the smallest. A moderate usage of content seems to have been optimal. I could as well find a connection when I performed a minor content analysis and this connection was that a Skolplan with a commanding attitude was superior the documents that didn’t had one or drowned it in size. The results are only indicating in nature due to the essays limited size. But what is found is quite <b>interesting.</b> <b>That</b> the local economic muscles seem to have a limited impact on the schools performance and that it rather is the society as a whole that grants a good ranking is <b>interesting.</b> It indicates <b>that</b> <b>you</b> only can use money to a level and then it is quite useless without a stabile society and a high social capital. Also what we found on the local government document Skolplanen was <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> give shape to an important document make sure it is moderate in size and have a direct commanding attitude...|$|R
