5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with the syndrome {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable <b>expressivity,</b> one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E
5|$|Germline {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause Microcephaly {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable <b>expressivity</b> but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E
5|$|This {{family of}} white horses {{produced}} Old King in 1908, a dark-eyed white stallion that {{was purchased by}} Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson. Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American White Horse. A grandson of Old King, Snow King, {{was at the center}} of the first major study of the dominant white coat color in horses, conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt of Cornell. They concluded, based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios, that the white coat was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. Other factors, such as variations in <b>expressivity</b> and the influence of multiple genes, may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed. The white coat of the American White Horse has not yet been mapped.|$|E

25|$|The {{highlighting}} of {{the fact}} that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of <b>expressivity</b> which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the ego is one of the conclusions of The Structure of Behavior that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty's later works. Following this theme of <b>expressivity,</b> he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject {{is in a position to}} undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.|$|E

25|$|From 1943 and 1944, Xul’s {{painting}} {{was influenced by}} his thoughts of the Second World War.

Gradowczyk posits that “Xul reached his highest point of artistic <b>expressivity</b> in these ascetic paintings whose theme corresponded to that anguishing reality.|$|E
25|$|TSC is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable <b>expressivity,</b> and incomplete penetrance. Two-thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in roughly 20% of individuals {{diagnosed with the}} disease. So far, it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2.|$|E

Other admirers include architect Daniel Libeskind and novelist Umberto Eco (Das Nonoprojekt), for Nono totally reconstructed music and engaged in the most fundamental issues with regards to its <b>expressivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Non-verbal {{behaviors}} {{are particularly important}} to forming first impressions when meeting a business acquaintance. Specifically, components of social <b>expressivity,</b> such as smiling, eyebrow position, emotional expression, and eye contact are emphasized. Straightening one's posture, leaning in slightly, and giving a firm handshake promotes favorable impression formation in the American business context. Other impression management tactics {{in the business world}} include researching the organization and interviewers beforehand, preparing specific questions for the interviewer, showing confidence, and dressing appropriately.|$|E
25|$|Monochromatic {{painting}} {{has been}} an important component of avant-garde visual art throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Painters have created the exploration of one color, the examination of values changing across a surface, the <b>expressivity</b> of texture and nuance, expressing a wide variety of emotions, intentions and meanings {{in a wide variety of}} ways and means. From geometric precision to expressionism, the monochrome has proved to be a durable idiom in Contemporary art.|$|E
25|$|Benny Moré, {{considered}} {{by many as the}} greatest Cuban singer of all time, was in his heyday in the 1950s. He had an innate musicality and fluid tenor voice, which he colored and phrased with great <b>expressivity.</b> Although he could not read music, Moré was a master of all the genres, including son montuno, mambo, guaracha, guajira, cha cha cha, afro, canción, guaguancó, and bolero. His orchestra, the Banda Gigante, and his music, was a development – more flexible and fluid in style – of the Perez Prado orchestra, which he sang with in 1949–1950.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} in the Netherlands by Dr. Dirk van Kampen has indicated that the authentic rhythm of Gregorian chant in the 10th century includes both proportional elements and elements that are in agreement with semiology. Starting {{with the expectation that}} the rhythm of Gregorian chant (and thus the duration of the individual notes) anyway adds to the <b>expressivity</b> of the sacred Latin texts, several word-related variables were studied for their relationship with several neume-related variables, exploring these relationships in a sample of introit chants using such statistical methods as correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis.|$|E
25|$|Webern {{insisted on}} lyricism, nuance, rubato, sensitivity, and both {{emotional}} and intellectual understanding in performance of music; this {{is evidenced by}} anecdotes, correspondence, extant recordings of Schubert's Deutsche Tänze (arr. Webern) and Berg's Violin Concerto under his direction, many such detailed markings in his scores, and finally by his compositional process as both publicly stated and later revealed in the musical and extramusical metaphors and associations everywhere throughout his sketches. As both a composer and conductor {{he was one of}} many (e.g., Wilhelm Furtwängler, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Hermann Scherchen) in a contemporaneous tradition of conscientiously and non-literally handling notated musical figures, phrases, and even entire scores so as to maximize <b>expressivity</b> in performance and to cultivate audience engagement and understanding.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{may also}} be complex, multifactorial, or polygenic, meaning they are likely associated {{with the effects of}} multiple genes in combination with lifestyles and environmental factors. Multifactorial disorders include heart disease and diabetes. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, {{they do not have a}} clear-cut pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person’s risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat, because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified. Studies which aim to identify the cause of complex disorders can use several methodological approaches to determine genotype-phenotype associations. One method, the genotype-first approach, starts by identifying genetic variants within patients and then determining the associated clinical manifestations. This is opposed to the more traditional phenotype-first approach, and may identify causal factors that have previously been obscured by clinical heterogeneity, penetrance, and <b>expressivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and 1960s artists {{with a wide}} range of {{interests}} began to push the boundaries of contemporary art. Yves Klein in France, and Carolee Schneemann, Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman, and Yoko Ono in New York City were pioneers of performance based works of art. Groups like The Living Theater with Julian Beck and Judith Malina collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments; radically changing the relationship between audience and performer especially in their piece Paradise Now. The Judson Dance Theater located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York City, and the Judson dancers, notably Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, Deborah Hay, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton and others collaborated with artists Robert Morris, Robert Whitman, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, and engineers like Billy Klüver. These performances were often designed to be the creation of a new art form, combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. The works were characterized by the reductive philosophies of minimalism, and the spontaneous improvisation, and <b>expressivity</b> of abstract expressionism.|$|E

25|$|During the 1930s {{through the}} 1960s as {{abstract}} painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Post painterly abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Minimal art, shaped canvas painting, and Lyrical Abstraction. Other artists reacted {{as a response}} to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the Bay Area Figurative Movement in the 1950s and new forms of expressionism from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, Giorgio Morandi was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced Realism and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique <b>expressivity</b> like Milton Avery, John D. Graham, Fairfield Porter, Edward Hopper, Andrew Wyeth, Balthus, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud, Leon Kossoff, Philip Pearlstein, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Grace Hartigan, Robert De Niro, Sr., Elaine de Kooning and others. Along with Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, and other 20th-century masters. The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's painting, Christina's World, currently in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. This tempera work, done in a realist style, is nearly always on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.|$|E

Other artists reacted {{as a response to}} the tendency toward abstraction with Art brut, as seen in Court les rues, 1962, by Jean Dubuffet, Fluxus, Neo-Dada, New Realism, allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like Pop art, the Bay Area Figurative Movement (a prime example is Diebenkorn's Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1), 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and later in the 1970s Neo-expressionism. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Nathan Oliveira and Richard Diebenkorn whose painting Cityscape 1, 1963 is a typical example (see above) were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Although throughout the 20th-century painters continued to practice Realism and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique <b>expressivity</b> like Milton Avery, Edward Hopper, Jean Dubuffet, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud, Philip Pearlstein, and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. Yves Klein, Martial Raysse, Niki de Saint Phalle, David Hockney, Alex Katz, Antoni Tàpies, Malcolm Morley, Ralph Goings, Audrey Flack, Richard Estes, Chuck Close, Susan Rothenberg, Eric Fischl, John Baeder, and Vija Celmins were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. Fairfield Porter (see above) was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the New York School of writers, including John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, and James Schuyler. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on Great Spruce Head Island, Maine.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} of {{a recording}} noted the work's [...] "quasi-symphonic sequence" [...] and its [...] "balanced overall shape which brings musical satisfaction {{even though the}} choral-orchestral presentation is at times somewhat unrelenting". Eidenbenz noted that Reger achieved a direct <b>expressivity</b> of smallest entities of material (""), and saw in this [...] "atomization" [...] and relentless modulation a modern radicality (""). He then describes: [...] "" [...] (<b>Expressivity</b> instead of understandability, the intention of a shock wave making the audience a relief, relentless modulation, external opulence and inner calculated logic, the naive and unquestioned naturalness of his music) and noted how these elements also characterize Reger's life.|$|E

Fraser McAlpine from BBC, praised {{the lyrics of}} the song, and complimented Shakira's unpredictability and <b>expressivity.</b> Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commended the song's production and labelled Shakira' songwriting skills as her [...] "strongest suit". The Popjustice review of the album described the song as being [...] "brilliant", and noted {{it to be a}} good choice for a single. [...] Lahmeik Stacy from Yahoo! Voices commented on the fast-paced musical arrangement of the song, saying that it [...] "immediately demands the attention of the listener". Anthony Balderrama from Consequence of Sound, singled out [...] "Did It Again" [...] as one of the strongest tracks on the album, along with [...] "She Wolf" [...] and [...] "Why Wait", and also as a good choice for creating a Spanish version. Stephen Erlewine from AllMusic picked the song as an album highlight.|$|E
500|$|Xenogears entered {{development}} in 1996 {{and was released}} in 1998. The game's soundtrack was Yasunori Mitsuda's first major solo work, as his previous soundtracks were collaborations with other composers {{with the exception of}} the score to , which never saw an album release. Mitsuda worked closely with Masato Kato, the event planner and script writer of Xenogears, to compose the score. Mitsuda considered it hard at times to maintain his motivation throughout the whole two-year period, especially since he had to wait for the end to see the most dramatic tracks implemented. The game's director Tetsuya Takahashi did not initially think [...] "music was all that important" [...] compared to graphics, but eventually acknowledged its importance when he realized it could strongly enhance the <b>expressivity</b> of the images. Takahashi explained that without Mitsuda's music, he would not have been able to achieve his goals for the project.|$|E
500|$|According to Rodriguez, [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] is {{an early}} example of Harrison [...] "matching the music to the message", as aspects of the song's rhythm, harmony and {{structure}} combine to convey the difficulties in achieving meaningful communication. As in his 1965 composition [...] "Think for Yourself", Harrison's choice of chords reflects his interest in harmonic <b>expressivity.</b> The verse opens with a harmonious E-A-B-C#-E melody-note progression over an A major chord, after which the melody begins a harsh ascent with a move to the II7 (B7) chord. Further to the off-kilter quality of the opening riff, musicologist Alan Pollack identifies this chord change {{as part of the}} disorientating characteristics of the verses, due to the change occurring midway through the fourth bar, rather than {{at the start of the}} measure. The musical and emotional dissonance is then heightened by the use of E79, a chord that Harrison said he happened upon while striving for a sound that adequately conveyed a sense of frustration. With the return to the I chord for the guitar riff, the harmonic progression through the verse suggests what author Ian MacDonald terms [...] "an Oriental variant of the A major scale" [...] that is [...] "more Arabic than Indian".|$|E

2500|$|One way {{in which}} Méhul {{increased}} dramatic <b>expressivity</b> was to experiment with orchestration. For example, in Uthal, an opera set in the Highlands of Scotland, he eliminated violins from the orchestra, replacing them with the darker sounds of violas in order to add local colour. Méhul's La chasse du jeune Henri (Young Henri's Hunt) provides a more humorous example, with its expanded horn section portraying yelping hounds as well as giving hunting calls.

There seems to be significant interfamilial and intrafamilial variability in <b>expressivity,</b> more noticeably between rather than within families. Because of this variability, it is possible that {{there is more than one}} genetic locus involved in the actual manifestation of the syndrome in any given person.

2500|$|His motets are {{the most}} {{progressive}} part of his output, and are characteristic of the mid-century practice intermediate between the smooth, pervading imitation of composers such as Nicolas Gombert, where all voices where equal, and textural contrast was minimized; and late-century composers such as Lassus. [...] Indeed, many of his motets are reminiscent of Lassus, using chromaticism, cross-relations, textural contrast, and always remaining carefully attentive to the comprehensibility of the text. [...] Waelrant uses text-painting as well, highlighting individual words with characteristic gestures, as a method to increase the <b>expressivity</b> of the music. [...] Occasionally, his use of text-painting is obvious: [...] for example, in his chanson Musiciens qui chantez, after the word [...] "taire" [...] (silent) all the voices rest {{for a moment of}} silence.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>expressivity</b> of whistled {{speech is}} likely to be {{somewhat}} limited compared to spoken speech (although not inherently so), but such a conclusion should not be taken as absolute, as it depends heavily on various factors including the phonology of the language. For example, in some tonal languages with few tones, whistled messages typically consist of stereotyped or otherwise standardized expressions, are elaborately descriptive, and often have to be repeated. However, in languages which are heavily tonal, and therefore convey much of their information through pitch even when spoken, such as Mazatec and Yoruba, extensive conversations may be whistled. [...] In any case, even for non-tonal languages, measurements indicate that high intelligibility can be achieved with whistled speech (90%) of intelligibility of non-standardized sentences for Greek and the equivalent for Turkish.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{is known}} for {{producing}} art films focussed on mood and atmosphere, rather than following convention. His general style is described by Stephen Teo as [...] "a cornucopia overflowing with multiple stories, strands of expression, meanings and identities: a kaleidoscope of colours and identities". Structurally, Wong's films are typically fragmented and disjointed, with little concern for linear narrative, and often with interconnected stories. Critics have commented {{on the lack of}} plot in his films, such as Ty Burr who says [...] "The director doesn't build linear story lines so much as concentric rings of narrative and poetic meaning that continually revolve around each other". Similarly, Peter Brunette says that Wong [...] "often privileges audio/visual <b>expressivity</b> over narrative structure". Wong has commented on this, saying [...] "in my logic there is a storyline." ...|$|E
2500|$|A key {{trade-off}} in {{the design}} of a knowledge representation formalism is that between <b>expressivity</b> and practicality. The ultimate knowledge representation formalism in terms of expressive power and compactness is First Order Logic (FOL). [...] There is no more powerful formalism than that used by mathematicians to define general propositions about the world. However, FOL has two drawbacks as a knowledge representation formalism: [...] ease of use and practicality of implementation. [...] First order logic can be intimidating even for many software developers. Languages which do not have the complete formal power of FOL can still provide close to the same expressive power with a user interface that is more practical for the average developer to understand. The issue of practicality of implementation is that FOL in some ways is too expressive. With FOL it is possible to create statements (e.g. quantification over infinite sets) that would cause a system to never terminate if it attempted to verify them.|$|E
