500|$|... "Scream" [...] {{is cited}} {{primarily}} as an aggressive, retaliatory song {{directed at the}} tabloid media and their coverage of the child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993. [...] "Scream" [...] was written, composed and produced by Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson; Michael played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of pop, R, electrorock, new jack swing, dance-pop, and funk. Recording for Scream {{took place at the}} Hit Factory in New York City in October 1994 and at Flyte Tyme Studios in Edina, Minnesota in December 1994. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite Epic Records' attempt to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> air until the official release date.|$|E

50|$|Although goats are {{relatively}} hardy animals, domestic goats benefit from being provided with shelter from wind and rain. Regular feeding is essential, {{as is the}} provision of clean water. Hay is a necessary food source and a manger <b>keeps</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the ground where they might urinate and defecate upon it. Providing a salt lick is also a wise adjunct so as {{to provide them with}} essential minerals. Being cloven-hoofed animals, they also need their feet to be examined {{from time to time and}} to be trimmed if necessary, since some breeds evolved in areas where hard rocky surfaces continually wear down their hoofs, whereas on soft land pasture their hoofs may overgrow. Such overgrowth can lead to problems requiring veterinary visits.|$|R

60|$|This letter {{conveyed}} to Marian hardly {{one of the}} considerations set forth in it. She thought it a frank, strong, admirable letter, just what she should have hoped from her highest estimate of him. In the quaint earnestness about religion, and the exaggerated estimate (as she thought) of the advantages which she might forfeit by marrying him, there was just enough of the workman to make them characteristic. She wished that she could make some real sacrifice for his sake. She was afraid to realize her situation at first, and, to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> occupied herself during the forenoon with her household duties, with some pianoforte practice, and such other triflings as she could persuade herself were necessary. At last she quite suddenly became impatient of further delay. She {{sat down in a}} nook behind the window curtain, and re-read the letter resolutely. It disappointed her a little, so she read it again. The third time she liked it better than the first; and she would have gone through it yet again but for the arrival of Mrs. Leith Fairfax, with whom they had arranged to go to Burlington House.|$|E
60|$|As for Glumm, {{he frowned}} {{on the path}} most unamiably while he sauntered along with both hands thrust into the breast of his tunic, and the point of his sword rasping harshly against rocks and bushes. Glumm was {{peculiar}} in his weapons. He wore a double-handed and double-edged sword, which was so long that he was obliged to sling it across his back in order to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the ground. The handle projected above his left shoulder, and the blade, lying diagonally across his person, extended beyond his right calf. The young man was remarkably expert {{in the use of}} this immense weapon, and was not only a terror to his foes, but, owing to the enormous sweep of its long blade, an object of some anxiety to his friends when they chanced to be fighting alongside of him. He wore a knife or dagger at his girdle on the right side, which was also of unusual size; in all probability it would have been deemed a pretty good sword by the Romans. There were only two men in the dale who could wield Glumm's weapons. These were Erling and his father, Haldor. The latter was as strong a man as Glumm, Erling was even stronger; though, being an amiable man he could not be easily persuaded to prove his strength upon his friends. Glumm wore his hair very short. It was curly, and lay close to his head.|$|E

5000|$|Another type {{of spring}} clamp, {{typically}} only used on vacuum hoses, {{is just a}} piece of spring steel wire bent into a loop, with the ends curled to provide handles.

60|$|Yes, death. Why {{should he}} die? No! Better solitude, better hopeless waiting, alone. Alone. No! {{he was not}} alone, he saw death looking at him from everywhere; from the bushes, from the clouds--he heard her {{speaking}} {{to him in the}} murmur of the river, filling the space, touching his heart, his brain with a cold hand. He could see and think of nothing else. He saw it--the sure death--everywhere. He saw it so close that he was always on the point of throwing out his arms to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> It poisoned all he saw, all he did; the miserable food he ate, the muddy water he drank; it gave a frightful aspect to sunrises and sunsets, to the brightness of hot noon, to the cooling shadows of the evenings. He saw the horrible form among the big trees, in the network of creepers in the fantastic outlines of leaves, of the great indented leaves that seemed to be so many enormous hands with big broad palms, with stiff fingers outspread to lay hold of him; hands gently stirring, or hands arrested in a frightful immobility, with a stillness attentive and watching for the opportunity to take him, to enlace him, to strangle him, to hold him till he died; hands that would hold him dead, that would never let go, that would cling to his body for ever till it perished--disappeared in their frantic and tenacious grasp.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have just}} been praying to God to remove from us the cholera, which we call a {{judgment}} of God, a chastisement; and God knows we have need enough to do so. But we can hardly expect God to withdraw His chastisement unless we correct the sins for which He chastised us, and therefore unless we find out what particular sins have brought the evil on us. For it is mere cant and hypocrisy, my friends, to tell God, in a general way, that we believe He is punishing us for our sins, and then to avoid carefully confessing any particular sin, and to get angry with anyone who tells us boldly WHICH sin God is punishing us for. But so goes the world. Everyone is ready to say, [...] "Oh! yes, we are all great sinners, miserable sinners!" [...] {{and then if you}} charge them with any particular sin, they bridle up and deny THAT sin fiercely enough, and all sins one by one, confessing themselves great sinners, and yet saying that they don't know what sins they have committed. No man really believes himself a sinner, no man really confesses his sins, but the man who can honestly put his finger on THIS sin or THAT sin which he has committed, and is not afraid to confess to God, [...] "THIS sin and THAT sin have I done--THIS bad habit and THAT bad habit have I cherished within me." [...] Therefore, I say, it is no use for us Englishmen to dream that we can flatter and persuade the great God of Heaven and earth into taking away the cholera from us, unless we find out and confess openly what we have done to bring on the cholera, and unless we repent and bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, by amending our habits on that point, and doing everything for the future which shall not bring on the cholera, but <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
