5000|$|The 2-door {{bodywork}} {{was executed}} in <b>Duralinox,</b> an aluminum/magnesium alloy. The Dynavia's shape {{resulted in a}} drag coefficient (...) of just 0.26. The car was designed to seat four people although the narrow body and curving roof-line limited passenger space. The tall greenhouse with its two-piece windscreen and backlite offered good outward visibility. A single floodlight was mounted in {{the centre of the}} nose of the car, while the headlamps were Cibi√© [...] "zero dazzle" [...] units housed in tubes in the fenders and projecting flat beams out through slots {{on either side of the}} nose.|$|E
5000|$|The HBR {{was first}} {{introduced}} as the [...] "DB Coach" [...] at the 1954 Paris Salon, with production beginning in January 1955. An earlier prototype with a body made of <b>Duralinox</b> (an aluminium-magnesium alloy) had been shown at the 1953 Paris Salon, but productionising the car took some time. The early Chausson designs received retractable headlamps and often the front portion of the roof is plexiglass. This plexiglass sunroof, with a removable inner cover, continued to be available throughout the HBR's life. Chausson built the fibreglass body; this was considered an experience-gaining effort and DB was charged a very modest per-unit price. The first hundred interim cars were built by Chausson, after which, experiment over, they sold the tooling to Deutsch and Bonnet themselves. They in turn turned the equipment over to another bodybuilding company which proceeded to sell the finished bodies to DB, meaning DB {{got into the car}} manufacturing business at a minimal cost. The first Coach/HBR had a [...] version of the 848 cc Panhard Dyna engine, with twin Solex carburettors. Early models, show cars in particular, also often exhibited luxurious equipment with lots of chrome and two-tone paintjobs.|$|E
