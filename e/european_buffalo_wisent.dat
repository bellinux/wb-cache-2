50|$|Europeans {{were first}} {{in the area of}} Noulangie Rock in about 1845, after Ludwig Leichhardt’s explorations passed through the area. By the 1880s, <b>European</b> <b>buffalo</b> and buffalo {{shooters}} had moved into the area, ad local Traditional Owners joined their shooting parties. Traditional owners told the buffalo shooters about the Dreaming stories at Burrungui and the many names of all the natural features of the landscapes. Chaloupka argues that the Europeans couldn’t remember all of the names, and called ‘Nourlangie’, a confused pronunciation of the name of the area generally called ‘Nawulandja’.|$|R
25|$|<b>European</b> <b>buffalo</b> {{are all of}} {{the river}} type and {{considered}} {{to be of the}} same breed named Mediterranean buffalo. In Italy, the Mediterranean type was particularly selected and is called Mediterranean Italian breed to distinguish it from other European breeds, which differ genetically. Mediterranean buffalo are also found in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, Kosovo, and the Republic of Macedonia, with a few hundred in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hungary. Little exchange of breeding buffalo has occurred among countries, so each population has its own phenotypic features and performances. In Bulgaria, they were crossbred with the Indian Murrah breed, and in Romania, some were crossbred with Bulgarian Murrah.|$|R

5000|$|Najombolmi also painted at Nangawulurr Shelter (formerly spelled Nangaloar). It {{is located}} on the {{northern}} side of Burrungui (Nourlangie Rock). [...] Nangawulurr shelter features many styles of Aboriginal rock art that appear in other sites around the region in one area. It includes hand prints, Mimi figures in ceremonial dress, Ancestral beings, x-ray animals and dolphin-like creatures depicted in red ochre. It also features a white depiction of a two-masted sailing ship with an anchor and dingy, which may relate to the early <b>European</b> <b>buffalo</b> shooters in the area). Unfortunately due to the fame of the site for its amazing rock art, in the early 1970s tourists came and destroyed some features and even stole Aboriginal Ancestral Remains from the site.|$|R

50|$|The {{morphology}} of Bubalus murrensis is {{very similar}} to other Bubalus species like the Wild Asian water buffalo (Bubalus arnee). Only the skull differs from other Bovines. Especially the triangular horns set the <b>European</b> water <b>buffalo</b> apart. A skull found in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany) had a width of 107 cm.|$|R
50|$|Bubalus murrensis, the <b>European</b> water <b>buffalo,</b> is an extinct Bovine {{that lived}} in Europe during the Pleistocene. Its closest living {{relatives}} are the Wild Asian water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), the Tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis), the Lowland anoa (Bubalus depressicornis), the Mountain anoa (Bubalus quarlesi) and the domestic water bufallo (Bubalus bubalis).|$|R
50|$|In early 2010, Snapcase {{confirmed}} {{to play a}} series of shows in Europe including a performance at the 2010 Groezrock Festival in Belgium and also confirmed a reunion show with Sick of It All in Buffalo, N.Y., for May 8, 2010. Guitarist Frank Vicario later stated that the band {{had no intention of}} doing an extended reunion beyond the <b>European</b> and <b>Buffalo,</b> N.Y., shows.|$|R
5000|$|A {{livestock}} {{field station}} {{is located at}} Mawela, about 1.5 km from the faculty. It serves undergraduate training and research. The station maintains <b>European</b> dairy cattle, <b>buffaloes,</b> broilers, swine, ducks, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs and micro livestock.|$|R
5000|$|For 20th-century {{examples}} of an individual's assuming a fraudulent Native North American identity, establishing notability, and later being revealed as ethnic <b>European,</b> see: Chief <b>Buffalo</b> Child Long Lance, Forrest Carter, Manitonquat (Medicine Story) (Francis Talbot), Nasdijj and Ward Churchill. The circumstances are somewhat different in each case.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> water <b>buffalo</b> {{occurred}} in river valleys along the Rhine, Elbe and Murr in Germany and the Netherlands. It lived in muddy and swampy terrain. Bubalus murrensis could not tolerate long-lasting episodes of frost {{and was therefore}} absent in Central Europe during the Glacial Periods. During the Interglacial Periods like the Eemian it occurred together with other species of the Interglacial faunal assemblage by name the straight-tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon namadicus), Merck's rhinoceros (Stephanorinus kirchbergensis), fallow deer (Dama dama), aurochs (Bos primigenius) and the European hippopotamus (Hippopotamus antiquus).|$|R
5000|$|Broadway-Fillmore {{was once}} {{home to a}} large Polish/Eastern <b>European</b> {{population}} in <b>Buffalo.</b> The neighborhood has long since fallen into poverty and disrepair due to the [...] "white flight" [...] to the suburbs (particularly Cheektowaga) in the mid-late 20th century, although it still enjoys a brief renaissance every Easter due to the local Easter celebrations and Dingus Day.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} water buffalo in Italy is not settled. One {{theory is that}} Asian water buffalo were brought to Italy by Goths during the migrations of the early medieval period. However, {{according}} to the Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, the [...] "most likely hypothesis" [...] {{is that they were}} introduced by Normans from Sicily in 1000, and that Arabs had introduced them into Sicily. The Consorzio per la Tutela also refers to fossil evidence (the prehistoric <b>European</b> Water <b>Buffalo,</b> Bubalus murrensis) suggesting that water buffalo may have originated in Italy. A fourth theory is that water buffalo were brought from Mesopotamia into the Near East by Arabs and then introduced into Europe by pilgrims and returning crusaders.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 August, Kelsey {{described}} a [...] "great store of buffalo" [...] and [...] "silver-haired" [...] bears, the first sightings by a <b>European</b> of <b>buffalo</b> and grizzly bears {{on the northern}} Great Plains. His party had gone hungry during their ascent of the journey through the taiga, but now Kelsey and his Indian companions feasted on buffalo. Kelsey also noted the abundance of beaver in the many ponds and lakes of the aspen parkland. Continuing his journey, possibly to a point south and west of Saskatoon, Kelsey tried to make peace between the Assiniboine and their neighbours, the Naywatame poets. It is unclear who the Naywatame were; Kelsey commented [...] "they knew not the use of canoes," [...] which indicates that they were Plains Indians.|$|R
5000|$|Chief Long Wolf (1833-1892), warrior of Battle of the Little Bighorn and the Sioux Wars. He {{died at age}} 59 of {{bronchial}} pneumonia {{while taking}} part in the <b>European</b> tour of <b>Buffalo</b> Bill's Wild West Show. He was buried at West Brompton's cemetery with a 17-month-old Sioux girl, White Star Ghost Dog, believed to have died after falling from her mother's arms while on horseback. 105 years later, Elizabeth Knight, a British woman, traced his family and campaigned with them to have his remains returned to his homeland. In 1997, Long Wolf's coffin was moved to a new plot at Saint Ann's Cemetery in Wolf Creek. White Star Ghost Dog's coffin was also reinterred there.|$|R
50|$|Other biomes, {{although}} less noted, {{were significant}} in {{contributing to the}} diversity of fauna in Late Pleistocene Europe. Warmer grasslands such as temperate steppes and Mediterranean savannahs hosted Stephanorhinus, gazelle, European wisent, asian ostriches, Leptobos, cheetahs, and onager. These biomes also contained an assortment of mammoth steppe fauna, such as saiga antelope, lions, Homotherium, cave hyenas, wolves, Pleistocene horse, steppe bison, Spirocerus, aurochs, and camels. Deciduous, mixed conifer/broadleaf and Mediterranean forests and open woodlands accommodated straight-tusked elephants, Praemegaceros, Stephanorhinus, European wisent, wild boar, species of Ursus such as the Etruscan bear, and smaller deer (Capreolus, Cervus, Dama, Haploidoceros) with several mammoth steppe species, such as lynx, tarpan, wolves, dholes, moose, Irish Elk, woodland bison, leopards, and aurochs. Woolly rhinoceros and mammoth occasionally resided in these temperate biomes, mixing with predominately temperate fauna to escape harsh glacials. In warmer wetlands, <b>European</b> water <b>buffalo</b> and hippopotamus were present. Although these habitats were restricted to micro refugia and to Southern Europe and its fringes, being in Iberia, Italy, the Balkans, Ukraine's Black Sea basin and the Caucasus, during inter-glacials these biomes had a far more northernly range. For example, hippopotamus inhabited Great Britain and straight-tusked elephant the Netherlands, as recently as 80,000 BCE and 42,000 BCE respectively.|$|R
40|$|On the Indian sub-continent, nearly 5, 000  years ago, the {{domestication}} of the riverine buffalo—the incredible Asian {{dairy animal}} was initiated. It plays a versatile role in socio-economic upliftment of its owners {{from the rural}} agricultural communities in Asian, African, South American and a few <b>European</b> countries. Comparatively, <b>buffaloes</b> are lesser evolved and susceptible to infectious diseases than cattle. However, poor body thermoregulation and wallowing nature predisposed them to snail borne infections, especially tropical fasciolosis—an incessant major constraint on buffalo production and improvement programmes. This review article is an insight into the global prevalence, varied epizootiological factors, offers possible explanation to pathophysiological clinical signs, deleterious effects of the tropical liver fluke, involving hepato-biliary system, haemopoitic system, endocrine glands and their secretions, oxidative stress, altered metabolism and significant fall in food conversion efficiency with unaffected digestibility of nutrients. Besides, the authors have briefly discussed and reviewed the developments and significance of successful immunodiagnostic approaches for detecting and forecasting the disease during early pre-patency and feasibility of developing a cost effective immunoprotection strategies against tropical fasciolosis...|$|R
