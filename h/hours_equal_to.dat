2500|$|While {{calculations}} of days, {{months and years}} are based on fixed <b>hours</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 1/24 of a day, {{the beginning of each}} halachic day is based on the local time of sunset. The end of the Shabbat and other Jewish holidays is based on nightfall (Tzeth haKochabim) which occurs some amount of time, typically 42 to 72 minutes, after sunset. According to Maimonides, nightfall occurs when three medium-sized stars become visible after sunset. By the 17th century, this had become three-second-magnitude stars. The modern definition is when the center of the sun is 7° below the geometric (airless) horizon, somewhat later than civil twilight at 6°. The beginning of the daytime portion of each day is determined both by dawn and sunrise. Most halachic times are based on some combination of these four times and vary from day to day throughout the year and also vary significantly depending on location. The daytime hours are often divided into Sha'oth Zemaniyoth or [...] "Halachic hours" [...] by taking the time between sunrise and sunset or between dawn and nightfall and dividing it into 12 equal hours. The nighttime hours are similarly divided into 12 equal portions, albeit a different amount of time than the [...] "hours" [...] of the daytime. The earliest and latest times for Jewish services, the latest time to eat chametz on the day before Passover and many other rules are based on Sha'oth Zemaniyoth. For convenience, the modern day using Sha'oth Zemaniyoth is often discussed as if sunset were at 6:00pm, sunrise at 6:00am and each hour were equal to a fixed hour. For example, halachic noon may be after 1:00pm in some areas during daylight saving time. Within the Mishnah, however, the numbering of the hours starts with the [...] "first" [...] hour after the start of the day.|$|E

Methods: The course, prepared based on an extensive search of the literature and books on writing biomedical research papers, was offered as an elective course to PhD students at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in the second semester of 2011 - 2012 academic year. The structure and function of various sections of a paper and publication ethics were discussed in lecture and practical sessions {{over a period of}} 12 weeks. The course was then evaluated using a self-designed questionnaire. Results: The majority of students gave the highest score (20) to the content and implementation of all sessions of the course. Moreover, most of them believed that the allotted time to the course was not enough, and suggested that it should be increased to 32 <b>hours</b> (<b>equal</b> <b>to</b> two credits).

40|$|Abstract. In recent decades, due to some {{urgent and}} {{unavoidable}} issues, such as increasing energy demand, climate change, global warming, etc., the R&D of renewable energies have become inevitable to pave way the sustainable development of human society. In this regard, solar power {{is widely considered}} as the most appealing clean energy {{since there is no}} other one being as abundant as the sun. The amount of solar energy reaching our earth within one <b>hour</b> <b>equals</b> <b>to</b> the total annual energy need of all of humankind. Since the energy resources on Earth are being exhausted, solar energy have to serve as the main energy source in coming century and beyond. The photovoltaic solar cells developed so far have been based on silicon wafers, with this dominance likely to continue well into the future. The surge in manufacturing volume as well as emerging technologies over the last decade has resulted in greatly decreased costs. Therefore, several companies are now well below the USD 1 W− 1 module manufacturing cost benchmark that was once regarded as the lowest possible with this technology. Thin-film silicon, such as hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si), microcrystalline silicon (mc-Si) and related alloys, are promising materials for very low-cost solar cells. Here in this article, a brief description of thin film solar cell technologies followed by deferent state-of-art tools used for characterizing such solar cells are explored. Since characteristics of thin-film solar cells are the main ingredient in defining efficiency, the inherent properties are also mentioned alongside the characterizations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} an association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and postoperative fever and infection. This prospective study investigated whether the intermediate or definite stages of BV are risk factors for postoperative infection after major gynecologic surgery. Methods: Vaginal cultures were obtained preoperatively from 175 women undergoing gynecologic surgery. The diagnostic criteria for BV were based on Nugent’s standardized method of Gram stain interpretation. Postoperative fever was defined as at least one temperature <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 101. 0 F or greater, or two or more temperatures more than 6 <b>hours</b> apart <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 100. 4 F or greater. Results: Thirty-six percent of the positive-BV group developed a postoperative fever, compared with 20 % of the Lactobacillus-predominant group and 12 % of the intermediate-BV group (P 0. 017). The differences between the positive-BV group and the Lactobacillus-predominant group, and between the positive-BV group and the intermediate-BV group, with respect to postoperative fever, were statistically significant (P 0 [...] 045 and P 0. 007, respectively).

The labor supply probability of a person or a group of persons (labor supplier or suppliers) is given by the definite integral of the (density) distribution function of reservation wage,(a kind of latent variable), which can not be directly observed.
