Four independent groups of 10 subjects received, under a double-blind design, placebo or one of the following drugs: CBD (300 mg), diazepam (10 mg) or <b>ipsapirone</b> (5 mg). Subjective anxiety was evaluated through the Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) and the State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The VAMS anxiety factor showed that <b>ipsapirone</b> attenuated SPS-induced anxiety while CBD decreased anxiety after the SPS test. Diazepam, on the other hand, was anxiolytic before and after the SPS test, but had no effect on the increase in anxiety induced by the speech test.

40|$|Prenatal {{exposure}} to ethanol can cause serious {{damage to the}} developing central nervous system. Both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate {{the vulnerability of the}} developing serotonergic system to the damaging effects of ethanol. However, treatment with a serotonin- 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) agonist prevents the ethanol-associated apoptosis in developing 5 -HT neurons. One mechanism by which 5 -HT 1 A agonists exert their neuroprotective effects appears to involve activation of the phosphatidylinositol 32 ̆ 7 kinase (PI- 3 K) pro-survival pathway and activation of NF-κB dependent anti-apoptotic genes. Additional NF-κB dependent genes might also be involved with the neuroprotective effects of <b>ipsapirone.</b> There is also considerable evidence that ethanol augments apoptosis by increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In light of the neuroprotective effects of <b>ipsapirone</b> and their ability to increase expression of NF-κB dependent genes, it was hypothesized that <b>ipsapirone</b> increases the expression of additional NF-κB dependent genes that encode specific antioxidant enzymes. This dissertation investigated the effects of ethanol and <b>ipsapirone</b> on ROS levels and on the expression/enzyme activities of endogenous antioxidants Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD 1), Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD 2), and catalase. The results of these studies demonstrate that ethanol induces an increase in ROS and that <b>ipsapirone</b> pre-treatment prevents this increase. Time-course studies of the expression and enzyme activity of SOD 1, SOD 2, and catalase showed that <b>ipsapirone</b> mediates regulation of these enzymes. Ethanol treatment resulted in an early and transient increase in the expression of the three genes. However, expression levels returned to those in unstressed control neurons after prolonged ethanol exposure. <b>Ipsapirone,</b> on the other hand, prevented the latter fall in the expression of the antioxidant enzyme genes. Moreover, addition of EUK- 134, which mimics SOD and catalase activities, attenuates ethanol-associated apoptosis. Interestingly, inhibitor studies suggested that both the PI- 3 K and MAPK pro-survival pathways might be involved with the effects of ethanol and <b>ipsapirone</b> on the expression of the antioxidant genes. In summary, it appears that some of the neuroprotective effects of 5 -HT 1 A agonists such as <b>ipsapirone</b> are likely to involve the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} discontinuation {{effects of}} <b>ipsapirone,</b> a novel azapirone and partial 5 -HTIA agonist that has anxiolytic effects clinically {{and has not}} caused dependence or withdrawal symptoms in animals, and to compare these effects {{with those of the}} benzodiazepine lorazepam, owing to concern about dependence or withdrawal symptoms following use of these drugs. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient and inpatient treatment. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five healthy male volunteers who had experience with sedative-hypnotics or anxiolytics and did not meet DSM-III-R criteria for abuse or dependence. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive <b>ipsapirone</b> 15 mg per day (n = 17), <b>ipsapirone</b> 22. 5 mg per day (n = 16), lorazepam 3 mg per day (n = 16), or placebo (n = 16) as outpatients for 36 days (treatment) followed by single-blind placebo as inpatients for 3 days and as outpatients for 6 days (withdrawal). OUTCOME MEASURES: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Spielberger State Anxiety Scale, Sleep Quality Questionnaire, General Symptom Checklist, self-rated intoxication, Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment [...] Benzodiazepines (CIWA-Benzo), psychomotor testing and urine drug screen. RESULTS: Only 45 subjects completed the study; discontinuation rates did not significantly differ among treatment groups. At day 39, fewer and less severe symptoms (e. g., insomnia and fatigue) were found on the CIWA-Benzo scale after treatment with <b>ipsapirone</b> or placebo than after treatment with lorazepam (p < 0. 05).

Rats displayed burying (active coping) if sawdust was provided on the floor and immobility (passive coping) if bedding was absent both during training and testing. The conditioned burying was accompanied by high plasma NE but low E and CORT concentrations, whereas immobility was associated with high CORT and low NE levels. A forced switch from the active to passive coping (training with and testing without sawdust) led to the highest rise in E concentration. The 5 -HT 1 A agonist <b>ipsapirone,</b> with anxiolytic properties, dose-dependently (0. 5 and 2. 5 mg/kg, IV) reduced defensive burying behavior and increased the amount of time spent on feeding behavior in the presence of bedding material. Both plasma E and CORT levels were further elevated by the higher dose of <b>ipsapirone.</b> In the absence of bedding material, <b>ipsapirone</b> failed to affect immobility behavior, but it dose-dependently elevated the stress-induced increase in E, NE, and CORT concentrations. Accordingly, the behavioral anxiolytic action of the 5 -HT 1 A agonist <b>ipsapirone</b> was restricted to active coping, whereas neuroendocrine activation by the drug was present in all conditions. It is suggested that the effects of <b>ipsapirone</b> on behavioral coping and neuroendocrine regulation are produced by different populations of 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the brain. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{designed}} to investigate the effects of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, <b>ipsapirone</b> (TVX Q 7821), a representative of a novel class of anxiolytics, and the classical benzodiazepine anxiolytic, diazepam, on cardiac and behavioural responses in an emotional stress situation. The emotional stress of fear of punishment, induced by training male Wistar rats in an inhibitory avoidance situation, was followed by a bradycardiac response relative to similarly trained, but non-punished, freely moving rats. The behavioural response of stressed rats was immobility in the dark compartment in which an electric footshock (0. 6 mA a. c. for 3 s) had been administered as punishment a day earlier. Diazepam administered i. p. in doses of 2. 5 mg/kg and 7. 5 mg/kg caused a decrease in the interbeat interval (IBI) in shocked and non-shocked rats whereas <b>ipsapirone</b> administered i. p. in doses of 2. 5 and 12. 5 mg/kg decreased the IBI in shocked rats only. <b>Ipsapirone</b> diminished the duration of immobility in both shocked and non-shocked animals whereas diazepam decreased immobility in shocked rats only. These results suggest a differential effect of the two anxiolytics on the behavioural and cardiac responses to an emotional stress situation.

It is demonstrated that in certain situations, probably due to a stress-induced sensitisation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors, anxiolytic doses of the drug may show prostress (anxiogenic) behavioural and neuroendocrine effects. Furthermore, brain corticosteroid receptors, probably interacting with the serotonergic transmission, are involved in anxiogenic/prostress processes.

All five agonists exerted effective dose-dependent decreases of offensive aggressive behavior in resident rats; 8 -OH-DPAT was the most potent (ID 50 = 0. 074 mg/kg), followed by eltoprazine (0. 24), buspirone (0. 72), <b>ipsapirone</b> (1. 08), and alnespirone (1. 24). However, in terms of selectivity of the antiaggressive effects as determined by the absence of decrements in social interest and general motor activity, alnespirone appeared to be superior. In the defensive aggression test, neither alnespirone nor any of the other four agonists changed defensive behaviors in the intruder rats. The involvement of 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the antiaggressive actions of these drugs was confirmed by showing that the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 (N-[2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2 -pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride), which was inactive alone, fully prevented the antiaggressive effects of alnespirone, 8 -OH-DPAT, and buspirone and partly reversed those of <b>ipsapirone</b> and eltoprazine. The data clearly indicate that alnespirone effectively suppresses offensive aggression with an advantageous profile of action compared with other full or partial 5 -HT 1 A agonists. These selective antiaggressive actions of alnespirone are mediated by stimulating 5 -HT 1 A receptors, presumably the somatodendritic autoreceptors at the raphe nuclei. Furthermore, the data provide evidence for a major involvement of these 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the modulation of aggressive behavior by 8 -OH-DPAT, <b>ipsapirone,</b> buspirone, and eltoprazine. ...|$|E

An {{elevated}} X-maze was used as a model of anxiety for rats and the actions of various ligands for the 5 -HT receptor, and its subtypes, were examined in this model. 5 -HT agonists, with varying affinities for the 5 -HT receptor subtypes, were demonstrated to have anxiogenic-like activity. The 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonists ritanserin and ketanserin exhibited an anxiolytic-like profile. The new putatuve anxiolytics <b>ipsapirone</b> and buspirone, which are believed to be selective for 5 -HT 1 receptors, were also examined. The former had an anxiolytic profile whilst the latter was without effect. Antagonism studies showed the anxiogenic response to 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(Di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT) to be antagonised by <b>ipsapirone,</b> pindolol, alprenolol and para-chlorophenylalanine, but not by diazepam, ritanserin, metoprolol, ICI 118, 551 or buspirone.

Results in this test mirrored the effects seen with the 5 -HT agonists, <b>ipsapirone</b> and pindolol, whilst the 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonists were without effect. Studies using operant conflict models of anxiety produced marginal and varying results which appear to be in agreement with recent criticisms of such models. Finally, lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were performed in order to investigate the mechanisms involved in the production of the anxiogenic response to 8 -OH-DPAT.

Using microdialysis, we examined the modifications of 5 -HT release induced by the selective 5 -HT 1 A agonist <b>ipsapirone</b> in both neuronal pathways. Maximal and minimal basal 5 -HT values (in the presence of 1 µM citalopram) were 45. 0 ± 4. 8 fmol/fraction in the median raphe nucleus and 8. 4 ± 0. 4 fmol/fraction in the dorsal hippocampus. <b>Ipsapirone</b> (0. 3, 3, and 10 mg/kg s. c.) reduced dose-dependently 5 -HT in the two raphe nuclei and four forebrain areas.

40|$|Biochemical and {{electrophysiological}} approaches {{were used}} to assess the possible changes in 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the rat brain after a long-term treatment with cericlamine [2 -(3, 4 -dichlorobenzyl) - 2 -dimethylamino- 1 -propanol], a novel serotonin reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant properties. Possible changes in other serotonin receptor binding sites (5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 C and 5 -HT 3) were also investigated after this treatment. Cericlamine was injected for 2 weeks at a dose (16 mg/kg i. p., twice daily) that ensured complete prevention of 4 -methyl-alpha-ethyl-meta-tyramine-induced depletion of brain serotonin. In vitro binding and quantitative autoradiographic studies showed that neither 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 C nor 5 -HT 3 receptor binding sites in various brain areas were affected by the 14 -day treatment with cericlamine. Although forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was significantly increased in hippocampal homogenates from cericlamine-treated rats, the reduction in this enzymatic activity due to 5 -HT 1 A receptor stimulation by 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT) was unchanged in these animals as compared with controls. In contrast, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recordings of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus revealed a clearcut functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors. Thus the potency of 8 -OH-DPAT and <b>ipsapirone</b> to depress the firing rate of these neurons in brain stem slices was significantly reduced after the 2 -week treatment with cericlamine. In vivo, the potency of an injection of cericlamine to inhibit the discharge of serotoninergic neurons was also markedly less in rats that had been pretreated for 2 weeks with this drug as compared with controls. However, the inhibitory effects of systemically injected 8 -OH-DPAT and <b>ipsapirone</b> on the electrical activity of serotoninergic neurons were as pronounced in cericlamine-treated rats as in controls. In addition, the reduction in serotonin synthesis due to an acute treatment with 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 1 or 0. 3 mg/kg s. c.) was not significantly different in both groups of rats. These data support the idea that postsynaptic (in the hippocampus) and somatodendritic (in the dorsal raphe nucleus) 5 -HT 1 A receptors are differently regulated in the rat brain, because only the latter receptors desensitized after a long-term blockade of serotonin reuptake by cericlamine. They also suggest that the inhibitory influence of systemically administered direct 5 -HT 1 A agonists such as 8 -OH-DPAT and <b>ipsapirone</b> on the electrical and metabolic activity of serotoninergic neurons does not result solely from the stimulation of somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors...|$|E

Administration of the 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor antagonist spiperone (0. 25 and 1 mg/ kg) produced a rapid, dose-dependent increase in the firing rate, suggesting that under physiological conditions serotonergic neurons are controlled by tonic feedback inhibition. This effect was evident during wakefulness (a period of relatively high neuronal activity), but not during sleep (a period of relatively low neuronal activity). Spiperone also blocked the inhibitory action of 8 -OH-DPAT in a dose- and time-dependent manner. There was a strong positive correlation between the magnitude of spiperone-induced neuronal activation and blockade of 8 -OH-DPAT-induced neuronal suppression. These effects of spiperone cannot be attributed to its dopaminergic D- 2 or serotonergic 5 -HT 2 antagonist properties, because administration of haloperidol and ritanserin produced no increase in neuronal activity and did not block the action of 8 -OH-DPAT.

By contrast, the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists <b>ipsapirone</b> and 5 -carboxamidotryptamine inhibited the discharge in both groups. However, the potency of these agonists was markedly decreased (by � 55 - and � 6 fold, respectively) in 5 -HTT�/ � compared with 5 -HTT�/ � animals. Similarly, intracellular recordings showed that the potency of 5 -carboxamidotryptamine to hyperpolarize 5 -H...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the 5 -hydroxytryptaminelA (5 -HT 1 A) agonist buspirone stimulated rat prolactin (PRL) secretion. Administration of the 5 -HT 1 agonists gepirone (GEP) or <b>ipsapirone</b> (IPS) s. c. in doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg had no effect on PRL secretion in male rats. However, pretreatment with GEP (1 0 mg/kg) or IPS (1 0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increase in serum PAL concentration elicited by the 5 -HT agonists 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine or 6 -chloro- 2 -(1 -piperazinyl) -pyrazine (MK- 21 2). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of GEP or IPS was related to a serotonergic mechanism or a more general inhibitory effect on PAL secretion, the ability of GEP and IPS to inhibit the haloperi-dol- or a-methyl-p-tyrosine-induced increase in PAL secretion was studied. GEP (1, 3 and 1 0 mg/kg) and IPS (1 0 mg/kg) inhibited the increase in PAL secretion produced by either halo...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} reports the neuroprotective {{efficacy}} of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT) and <b>ipsapirone</b> against in vivo excitotoxic neuronal injury. Excitotoxic cell death was induced by injections of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in the rat magnocellular nucleus basalis. The neurodegenerative effects were quantified by image analysis of the axonal density of the nucleus basalis projection to the somatosensory cortex visualized with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. Pretreatment with 8 -OH-DPAT-but not ipsapirone- 1 h prior to NMDA infusion showed significant preservation of cortical cholinergic innervation in all doses tested. Furthermore, 8 -OH-DPAT exhibited sustained efficacy under homeothermic conditions in which the body temperature was maintained at 36. 8 +/- 0. 1 degrees C. These data indicate that selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor activation by 8 -OH-DPAT protects against NMDA-induced excitotoxic neuronal damage, probably {{as a result of}} 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated neuronal hyperpolarization.

40|$|Serotonin(1 A) (5 -HT(1 A)) receptors {{are located}} on both 5 -HT cell bodies where they act as {{inhibitory}} autoreceptors and at postsynaptic sites where they mediate the effects of 5 -HT released from nerve terminals. The sensitivity of 5 -HT(1 A) receptors in humans can be measured using the technique of pharmacological challenge. For example, acute administration of a selective 5 -HT(1 A) receptor agonist, such as <b>ipsapirone,</b> decreases body temperature and increases plasma cortisol through activation of pre- and postsynaptic 5 -HT(1 A) receptors, respectively. Use of this technique has demonstrated that unmedicated patients with major depression have decreased sensitivity of both pre- and postsynaptic 5 -HT(1 A) receptors. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors further down-regulates 5 -HT(1 A) receptor activity. Due to the hypotheses linking decreased sensitivity of 5 -HT(1 A) autoreceptors {{with the onset of}} antidepressant activity, there is current interest in the therapeutic efficacy of combined treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 5 -HT(1 A) receptor antagonists...|$|E
40|$|Major {{depression}} {{is the most}} common form of mental illness, and is treated with antidepressant compounds that increase serotonin (5 -HT) neurotransmission. Increased 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor levels in the raphe nuclei act as a “brake” to inhibit the 5 -HT system, leading to depression and resistance to antidepressants. Several 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists (buspirone, flesinoxan, <b>ipsapirone)</b> that preferentially desensitize 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors have been tested for augmentation of antidepressant drugs with mixed results. One explanation could be the presence of the C(- 1019) G 5 -HT 1 A promoter polymorphism that prevents gene repression of the 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor. Furthermore, down-regulation of 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor expression, not simply desensitization of receptor signaling, appears to be required to enhance and accelerate antidepressant action. The current review focuses on the transcriptional regulators of 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor expression, their roles in permitting response to 5 -HT 1 A-targeted treatments and their potential as targets for new antidepressant compounds for treatment-resistant depression...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. There is {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} incidence and signifi-cance of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction in {{chronic fatigue syndrome}} (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM). Studies that utilize central acting stimulation tests, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), insulin stress testing (IST), d-fenfluramine, <b>ipsapirone,</b> interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and metyrapone testing, have demonstrated that HPA axis dysfunction of central origin is present in a majority of these patients. However, ACTH stimulation tests and baseline cortisol testing lack the sensitivity to detect this central dysfunction and have resulted in controversy and confusion regarding the incidence of HPA axis dys-function in these conditions and the appropriateness of treatment. While both CFS and FM patients are shown to have central HPA dysfunction, the dysfunction in CFS is at the pituitary-hypothalamic level while the dysfunction in FM is more related to dysfunction at the hypothalamic and supra-hypothalamic levels. Because treatment with low physiologic doses of cortisol (< 15 mg) {{has been shown to}} be safe and effective and routine dynamic ACTH testing does not have adequate diagnostic sensi...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the in vivo effects of various serotonin (5 -HT) receptor modulators on 5 -HT neurotransmission in the rat hippocampus. Vortioxetine, humanized-vortioxetine, and escitalopram blocked the 5 -HT transporter, but similar to <b>ipsapirone</b> did not dampen {{the sensitivity of}} postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Long-term administration of all treatments increased the tonic activation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A heteroreceptors, an effect common to all antidepressants. Vortioxetine decreased {{the function of the}} terminal 5 -HT 1 B autoreceptor under high but not a low degree of activation, thus showing that its partial agonism led to increased 5 -HT release and that long-term administration results in the desensitization of terminal 5 -HT 1 B autoreceptors. Vortioxetine overcame the effects of 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 3 receptor agonists. This study was unable to determine the involvement of 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonism exerted by vortioxetine affects 5 -HT neurotransmission. Therefore, vortioxetine would appear to exert different actions, via transporter and receptor activity, on the serotonergic system in the hippocampus, consistent with its unique pharmacological profile...|$|E
40|$|The rabbit {{isolated}} iris sphincter muscle {{maintained in}} an isotonic state is unaffected by applied serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine or 5 -HT) whereas carbachol causes the muscle to contract. Serotonin does, however, produce a relaxation of the contracted muscle in a dose-dependent manner. This effect is also {{induced by the}} 5 -HT receptor agonists 8 -OH-DPAT (8 -hydroxy- 2 -[di-n-propyl-amino] tetralin, RU 24969 (5 -methoxy- 3 - [1, 2, 3, 6, tetrahydro- 4 -pyridinyl]- 1 -indole) and <b>ipsapirone,</b> suggesting the involvement of 5 -HT 1 A receptors. This view {{is supported by the}} finding that metergoline, methysergide and propranolol all counteracted the effect produced by serotonin. While 5 -HT 3 receptors are not involved in the described process, a minor involvement of 5 -HT 2 receptors cannot be excluded as methysergide partially counteracted the serotonin response. These data provide evidence that serotonin receptors, in particular the 5 -HT 1 A subtype, may be associated with the iris sphincter muscle and suggest their involvement in the regulation of pupil size...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} role of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in rodent models of anxiety. Using the elevated X-maze {{it was possible to}} detect dose-dependent anxiolytic effects of diazepam and dose-dependent anxiogenic effects of FG 7142 (a β-carboline derivative) and idazoxan. The fear-potentiated acoustic startle paradigm also detected the effects of these compounds but the results were neither dose-dependent nor very reproducible. Using the X-maze the 5 -HT 1 A receptor partial agonist <b>ipsapirone</b> had no effect after either acute or chronic treatment, while both the 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist, ritanserin, and the 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, had anxiolytic activity after chronic treatment. Using in vivo mirodialysis it was demonstrated that extracellular levels of 5 -HT in the ventral hippocampus increase when the animal is on the X-maze, and both diazepam and F 2692 (1 -(3 '-trifluoro-methylphenyl) 1. 4 - dihydro 3 -amino 4 -oxo 6 -methyl pyrldazine) reduced the increased 5 -HT levels and produced an anxiolytic behavioural profile in the same animal. Thus the inhibition of increased 5 -HT release may be important for anxiolytic activity. However, <b>ipsapirone</b> also reduced the increased 5 -HT but did not produce an anxiolytic profile. The lack of an anxiolytic effect {{may be the result of}} postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptor stimulation. Rats reared in isolation immediately post-weaning (21 days of age) displayed enhanced locomotor activity and an anxiogenic profile on the X-maze. This anxiogenic profile was neither reversed by resocialisation of the isolation-reared rats nor produced by isolation of adult socially housed animals, indicating a permanent developmental change. Isolation-reared rats had reduced stimulated release of 5 -HT measured in the frontal cortex, indicating reduced presynaptic function and enhanced responsiveness to agonists acting at postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 receptors, suggesting supersensitivity at these sites. Overall, 5 -HT appears to be involved in anxiety with 'anxious' behaviour either on the X-maze or by isolation-rearing causing changes in 5 -HT function. Thus one of the mechanisms of action of established and putative anxiolytic and anxiogenic compounds may be via modulation of the ascending dorsal raphe serotonergic neuronal pathways.

40|$|Electrical {{activity}} in the dorsal hippocampus was recorded in freely moving cats in response to intravenous administration of 5 -HT 1 A agonist and antagonist drugs. Administration of low doses of the selective 5 -HT 1 A agonists 8 -OH-DPAT (5 - 20 mu g/kg) and <b>ipsapirone</b> (20 - 100 mu g/kg) produced rhythmic slow activity (theta) in rbe hippocampal EEC within 30 s. Similar effects were observed with BMY 7378 (20 and 100 mu g/kg), which acts as an agonist at presynaptic (somatodendritic) 5 -HT 1 A receptors and as an antagonist at postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Power spectral analysts showed that ail three compounds produced a dose-dependent increase in the EEG power occurring in the theta frequency band (3. 5 - 8. 0 Hz) {{as a proportion of}} total power from 0. 25 to 30. 0 Hz (relative theta power). The increase in relative theta power produced by 8 -OH-DPAT (20 mu g/kg) was greatly attenuated by spiperone (1 mg/kg), a highly effective 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor antagonist. Administration or spiperone alone had no significant effect on relative theta power. These results are discussed in relationship to the effects of these drugs on serotonergic neuronal activity. Our results suggest that preferential activation of presynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors, and subsequent inhibition of serotonin neurotransmission, facilitates the appearance of hippocampal theta {{activity in}} awake cats...|$|E
40|$|Impulsive {{aggression}} {{is associated with}} central serotonergic dysfunction. Animal models particularly implicate the 5 -HT 1 A receptor in this behavior. We tested the hypothesis that central 5 -HT 1 A receptor function is impaired in impulsive aggressive personality disorder patients. A total of 52 individuals with DSM-III-R personality disorders, all medically healthy adult outpatients without concurrent psychiatric medication treatment, underwent serial plasma cortisol, prolactin, and temperature measurements before and after <b>ipsapirone</b> 20 mg oral administration. Subjects completed self-report measures of impulsivity, hostility, depression and anxiety, and childhood maltreatment. Stepwise regression analysis revealed impulsivity alone among symptom measures {{to be associated with}} significantly decreased peak cortisol and prolactin responses. Diagnoses of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and intermittent explosive disorder-revised (IED-R) were associated with significantly increased and decreased cortisol responses, respectively. However, post hoc analyses indicated that impulsivity was significantly negatively correlated with cortisol responses in the BPD group, and may mediate the association of both BPD and IED-R with altered cortisol responses. Temperature response was associated with neither diagnostic nor symptom measures. Neither diagnostic nor dimensional measures of depression or anxiety, nor severity of childhood maltreatment, were significantly associated with cortisol, prolactin, or temperature responses. Impulsivity is related to impaired function at (or downstream to) postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors, and this relationship may be partly responsible for the association of impaire...|$|E
40|$|Aggression, impulsivity, {{and central}} serotonergic {{function}} were evaluated in {{two groups of}} human volunteers; one group having a history of substance dependence (DRUG+) and another group with no drug use history (DRUG-). The hypothesis was that DRUG+ subjects would be more aggressive, more impulsive, and have attenuated serotonergic function. Results showed that DRUG+ subjects behaved more aggressively in a computer paradigm of aggression and also reported more aggression on questionnaires than DRUG- subjects. In a computer paradigm of impulsivity, the DRUG+ group showed a lesser ability to delay gratification than the DRUG- group in the last session of testing. The DRUG+ subjects also reported more venturesomeness and problems associated with low impulse control on questionnaires. Serotonergic function was measured through the neuroendocrine and hypothermic response to an orally administered serotonin (5 -HT) agonist specific to the 5 -HT 1 A receptor subtype (<b>ipsapirone).</b> The neuroendocrine responses did not differ between DRUG± groups, indicating {{no difference in the}} sensitivity of the presynaptic or postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. An unexpected result was that the indicator hormone, cortisol, was at a lower baseline level in the DRUG+ group than the DRUG- group.

40|$|Modelos animais têm sido muito utilizados no estudo de mecanismos neuropsicológicos que envolvem os transtornos da ansiedade, assim como o efeito comportamental de novos compostos ansiolíticos. Porém, estudos de animais com diferentes níveis de ansiedade não têm sido muito utilizados. O presente estudo avaliou os efeitos comportamentais da administração sistêmica do ansiolítico serotonérgico ipsapirona em ratos com altos, normais e baixos níveis de reações de defesa submetidos a dois diferentes testes de ansiedade: o labirinto em cruz elevado (LCE) e o teste de condicionamento da resposta de congelamento (CRC). Para isso, foram utilizados animais de duas gerações consecutivas de linhagens que vêm sendo selecionadas de acordo com sua resposta de congelamento no teste de CRC no laboratório de psicologia da PUC-RJ, denominados Carioca de Baixo Congelamento (CBC) e Carioca de Alto Congelamento (CAC). Os resultados do teste de CRC indicaram diferenças comportamentais entre os animais controle e as linhagens selecionadas geneticamente, onde a linhagem CAC mostrou níveis de ansiedade mais elevados. Tais resultados não se repetiram no LCE, apesar de ter sido identificada uma tendência para tal. A ipsapirona administrada agudamente teve efeito ansiogênico e mais significativo na linhagem CBC. Adicionalmente, a resposta ao tratamento farmacológico foi significativamente influenciada pelo nível de ansiedade dos animais. Os resultados obtidos no presente trabalho indicam um possível efeito diferencial da droga sobre as linhagens desenvolvidas no teste de CRC, que pode estar relacionado ao nível de ansiedade específico dos ratos testados. Além disso, o uso de animais selecionados geneticamente pode ser uma importante ferramenta no desenvolvimento de novos compostos ansiolíticos/ansiogênicos. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTAnimal {{models have}} been {{extensively}} employed to study the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders, {{as well as the}} behavioral effects of putative/novel anxiolytics. However, little attention has been given to the use of animals with different anxiety-like traits. In the present study, male Wistar rats of two consecutive generations, selectively bred for either high or low anxiety-like behavior, were submitted to either a 5 - HT 1 A-receptor agonist <b>ipsapirone</b> (2, 5 mg/Kg; i. p.) or saline (i. p.) treatment and tested in the conditioned freezing procedure and in the elevated plus maze (EPM). The rat lines were developed according to their fear-induced context-conditioned freezing behavior at the PUCRJ laboratory and were named Carioca de Alto Congelamento (CAC) and Carioca de Baixo Congelamento (CBC), with high and low levels of freezing, respectively. The animals reacted differently, according to the anxiety-like trait, in the conditioned freezing test, with a significant increase in freezing behavior in the CAC rats. Differences in the EPM test were not significant but followed the same trend as for the previous test: CAC animals showing higher levels of anxiety behaviors than CBC rats. Acute <b>ipsapirone</b> administration significantly increased anxious-like behavioral parameters, with a more accentuated response in the CBC rats. In addition, response to the drug treatment was found to be significantly influenced by the level of anxiety. Taken together, the present results indicate a possible differential effect of the drug on the different strains of rats in the conditioned freezing procedure, which {{may be related to the}} specific high/low anxiety-like trait in the animals tested. Furthermore, the use of selectively bred animals may provide a unique approach for screening novel anxiolytic/anxiogenic compounds...|$|E
