40|$|This paper studies {{a growth}} model with {{public and private}} {{education}} alternatives. The impact of education vouchers for economic growth {{and the evolution of}} income inequality are considered. Results indicate that introducing education vouchers can increase economic growth. Households switching from public to private education experience higher incomes. This raises the tax base, in turn raising public education expenditures and growth of the whole economy. Vouchers are found to generally in- crease income inequality. Welfare comparisons show that voucher schemes may in some cases gain majority support, depending on assumptions and parameters.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} {{with a number of}} conceptual and practical issues {{associated with the use of}} vouchers to distribute public services. Section 1 proposes a definition of vouchers and considers the position which <b>voucher</b> <b>distribution</b> occupies in the spectrum of possible mechanisms for the production and distribution of public services; this leads into a discussion of the objectives which <b>voucher</b> <b>distribution</b> might promote. Section 2 classifies the contexts in which vouchers might be applied and types of voucher systems. This permits a preliminary mapping of combinations of policy objectives and characteristics of the public service in question onto alternative forms of <b>voucher</b> <b>distribution.</b> Section 3 provides an illustrative review of the use of <b>vouchers</b> in the <b>distribution</b> of public services. Many of the examples discussed are in the field of education, where discussion of or use of vouchers is most developed, but experience of other public services is included where it is available.

40|$|This paper uses {{a growth}} model with {{public and private}} {{education}} alternatives to investigate the implications of education voucher for economic growth {{and the evolution of}} income inequality. The results indicate that introducing education vouchers can increase economic growth. families that switch from public to private education due to vouchers experience higher incomes, leading to growth in the tax base which in turn raises public education expenditures and increases the growth of the whole economy. Vouchers have an ambiguous effect on income inequality. Gini coefficients indicate increasing inequality while other measures indicate decreased inequality. Comparing income distributions using generalised Lorenz curves, the <b>distribution</b> under a <b>voucher</b> scheme dominates the <b>distribution</b> without <b>voucher.</b> This implies that in the long run, vouchers offer a welfare improvement. In short run welfare comparisons however, more than half the population is worse off with vouchers, which is consistent with the repeated failures if voucher referenda in the US.

30|$|Some recent {{theoretical}} and empirical studies attempt to make headway in this direction. At the heart {{of them is the}} notion that school choice can only be expected to deliver what parents want. In an interesting recent study, Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) address this issue while combining some elements of the partial and general equilibrium approaches described above. Specifically, the authors implement a project in which applicants for vouchers were first recruited in a number of towns, with two lotteries carried out subsequently. First, some towns were selected for <b>distribution</b> of <b>vouchers.</b> Second, within the towns selected for treatment, some children were randomly selected to receive the vouchers. This allows Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) to go beyond the usual comparison (lottery-winning individuals versus lottery-losing ones) in most studies. As one example, by comparing nonapplicants in towns that did not receive vouchers to nonapplicants in towns that did, the authors can get a sense of negative effects on children “left behind” in the public sector. In the study, the authors do not find much evidence of such externalities.|$|R

Since 1992, it has made necessary the build-up of a new governmental and administrative structure and of an impressive legislative and regulatory framework. Though the methods of privatization were often similar to those used in the West, Russia has distinguished itself by setting up a system of "mass privatization" through the <b>distribution</b> of <b>vouchers</b> to the entire population. After the launching of two Programs in 1992 and 1994, the privatization of small enterprises was largely completed. As far as middle and large enterprises are concerned, the transfer of ownership has mostly benefited employees, or not too transparent investors and banks, but rarely foreigners. Since 1995 the process of privatization has come under criticism and has slowed down. Future developments will depend upon the unfolding of politics in Russia...|$|R

40|$|Three main {{criteria}} should govern a privatisation plan: speed, fairness, {{and efficient}} control.

To ensure efficient control of restructuring, there should be holding companies, each being the chief owner of enterprise drawn {{from a range of}} industries. Citizens should be given shares in each holding company. The holding company should be charged to restructure its enterprises and then sell all (or at least 50 per cent) of its shares within a 10 -year period. The final pattern of owners would include citizens, workers, foreigners, and pension funds, but provision would be made for some ''stable core'' of owners - either interlocking ownership among firms, or major holdings by foreigners, banks or holding companies. 3. For smaller companies a different approach would suffice, involving direct sale or leasing. 4. If mass unemployment is to be avoided, it is crucial to create a mass market in housing.

30|$|The {{success of}} {{undertaking}} <b>voucher</b> <b>distribution</b> in communities {{can be seen}} in the high proportion of vouchers which are then utilised by women, despite what are often thought to be intractable barriers to access arising from the complex interaction of cultural, ethnic and socioeconomic factors.

In voucher programmes in non-fragile settings, this proportion is often higher (Gorter and Bayou 2011).

40|$|The type of {{financial}} system that emerges in transition economies {{is a result}} of path dependent development with an outcome determined primarily by two factors: the chosen model of privatisation and the degree of concentration of the banking system. Due to the specifically transitionary nature of former communist economies, in particular, due to wide scale privatisation that was carried out in these countries during {{a relatively short period of}} time, chances to develop an American type financial system were generally even worse than in other emerging market economies (i. e. those without a communist past). The only significant exception may be Russia which seems to be drifting in the direction of a securities-based financial system due to the unique combination of a “securities friendly” nature of privatisation (give away of property to work collectives and <b>distribution</b> of <b>vouchers),</b> very decentralised banking system, and the period of very high inflation (1992 – 95) that undermined bank financing and virtually wiped out long term bank credits. This conclusion is based on the analysis of the developments preceding August 1998 financial crisis, but the weakening of the bank-based financial groups that occurred after the crisis provides additional support for such an interpretation. Cross country comparisons and cross industry comparisons for Russia seem to suggest that bank credit and the stock market, contribute to higher investment independently of each other; there is no evidence that bank-based financial system is superior for investment than the market based. Moreover, it appears that Russian banks redistribute funds from strong to weak enterprises, from relatively better off to poorly performing industries and hence do not really contribute to restructuring. ...|$|R

Key implementation challenges included limited feedback to providers on the outcomes of quality assurance and accreditation and budgetary constraints that limited effective marketing leading to inadequate information to clients on the benefit package.

40|$|The {{precarious}} {{state of}} the educational system {{in the inner cities}} of the United States, as well as its potential causes and solutions, have been popular topics of debate in recent years. Part of the dif � culty in resolving this debate is the lack of solid empirical evidence regarding the true impact of educational initiatives. The ef � cacy of so-called “school choice ” programs has been a particularly contentious issue. A current multimillion dollar program, the School Choice Scholarship Foundation Program in New York, randomized the <b>distribution</b> of <b>vouchers</b> in an attempt to shed some light on this issue. This is an important time for school choice, because on June 27, 2002 the U. S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a voucher program in Cleveland that provides scholarships both to secular and religious private schools. Although this study bene � ts immensely from a randomized design, it suffers from complications common to such research with human subjects: noncompliance with assigned “treatments ” and missing data. Recent work has revealed threats to valid estimates of experimental effects that exist in the presence of noncompliance and missing data, even when the goal is to estimate simple intention-to-treat effects. Our goal was to create a better solution when faced with both noncompliance and missing data. This article presents a model that accommodates these complications that is based on the general framework of “principal strati � cation ” and thus relies on more plausible assumptions than standard methodology.

40|$|Maternal {{health care}} is an {{important}} issue. In order for the population to be healthy, {{it is essential that}} children are well nourished and health from the moment of their conception. Unfortunately, in many countries – especially developing countries – the emphasis is directed away from health care, and the concept of health care in pregnancy is nearly non-existent. This occurs for a variety of reasons; cultural biases against medical involvement in health, biases against women, financial barriers and infrastructural barriers. One of the problems is that governments in developing countries often do not have money to invest in improving the medical health care system, or to provide the necessary care for their populations. The private sector in developing countries has an as yet undefined role in providing health care to the masses. Frequently, the private sector is purely occupied with providing health care to households who can afford to pay, which leaves a large section of the population dependent on health care provided by the public sector. One of the options which has recently arisen has been to involve the private sector in the provision of health care to the underprivileged, using subsidies from the public sector. These are known as Public-Private Partnerships. Voucher schemes are a form of Public-Private Partnership which specify exactly the sort of services which are included. Voucher schemes involve the <b>distribution</b> of <b>vouchers</b> to eligible individuals, subsidised partially or wholly by the Government, who can then redeem the vouchers at a specific private facility of their choice, conditional {{to the fact that the}} private facility has agreed to participate in the scheme. The private facility then provides the services that have been agreed upon to the voucher-holder, free of charge, but withhold the vouchers to hand back to the Government, in order to be reimbursed at a previously agreed-upon rate. The city of Lucknow, in Uttar Pradesh, has recently introduced the Sambhav Voucher Scheme, using similar reasoning. The Scheme itself is well thought-out, but the reality is somewhat different than the initial hopes for the project were. While the Scheme has excellent potential, there are certain improvements which are required, particularly in implementation. This thesis seeks to understand the background to the Scheme, and to provide suggestions for its improvement...|$|R

Mothers and fathers of 0 - 5 s who live in these areas are eligible for a free voucher entitling them to access a CANparent parenting course. These vouchers are redeemed by the class providers.

Recent evaluations suggest that vouchers {{have the potential to}} extend coverage of priority health services to the poor in developing countries. In Cambodia, a reproductive health voucher program was implemented in January 2011. This study aims to explore women’s early experiences accessing health services with their vouchers at accredited clinics. Methods This qualitative exploratory study used focus group methodology to gather information from five groups of older (> 25 years) and four groups of younger (18 – 25 years) women who were eligible for the voucher program in three rural provinces. Focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed and translated from Khmer into English. Data analysis was an iterative process, which comprised of open coding to find commonalities that reflected categories or themes and axial coding to relate initial themes to each other. Next, a basic framework for analysis was formed by integrating the themes into the framework. Results Two overarching themes were identified in the data: 1) factors that facilitate voucher use and 2) factors that inhibit voucher use. Within each of these themes, three subthemes were identified: 1) pre-existing factors, 2) distribution factors, and 3) redemption factors. Overall, women expressed positive feelings towards the voucher program, while several areas for program improvement were identified including the importance of addressing pre-existing demand-side barriers to using reproductive health services, the need for more comprehensive counselling during <b>voucher</b> <b>distribution,</b> and the persistent cost of unofficial payments expected by midwives after delivery irrespective of voucher use. Conclusions Early information from program beneficiaries can lead to timely and responsive changes that can help to maximize program success.
