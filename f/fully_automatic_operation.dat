In the early 1960s the United States Coast Guard initiated a program to replace these lightships with large steel towers, commonly known as Texas towers. Brenton reef was selected for such replacement, but a somewhat smaller facility was constructed instead. This light was originally a manned station, with living quarters and galley, as well as engine room to supply power to the light and living quarters. It {{was connected to the}} Beavertail Light by submarine cables and maintained by Coast Guardsmen out of the Newport, Rhode Island station, and was converted to <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>operation</b> during its active lifetime.

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that Web {{services}} are becoming a part of the essential fabric enabling machine-to-machine information exchange across the Web. However, there is also a perceptible progression toward the realisation that this principal means of invoking operations on remote hosts will become insufficient to their task almost as quickly as they rose to prominence. Already emerging amongst the community of adopters is a recognition that richer semantics are required to express any truly useful information about the nature of business processes {{and the way in which}} they interoperate. But ultimately, as the power to meaningfully express information improves, so does the need for automatic processes (i. e. agents), that are capable of interpreting, processing and deciding about this information. Given this, a means of connecting the realms of agents and Web services is required and so this paper reports on a proposed design for a Service Integration Gateway for seamlessly connecting Web services to agents and their services.

40|$|The next {{generation}} of balloon-borne and ground-based mm/sub-mm astronomy experiments will require operating temperatures near or below 0. 1 K. When these experiments are operated remotely on platforms or at sites with limited infrastructure and maintenance sup port, a compact and reliable dilution refrigerator becomes essential. We have investigated two different dilution refrigerators in order to evaluate which system is most suitable for these applications. We have carried out a feasibility study of the simplest of the two technologies, a single-shot dilution refrigerator. A thermal model for predicting its performance has been developed, and a first prototype which achieved temperatures of about 70 mK was built. We discuss {{advantages and disadvantages of}} a single-shot system and show how minor changes to the current design can make it useful for many astronomy applications. The second dilution refrigerator is based on the principle of condensation pumping. We have built and integrated such a refrigerator with a pulse-tube cooler {{in order to create a}} completely cryogen-free system. Temperatures below 50 mK have been achieved, and temperatures below 100 mK have been maintained for more than 10 hours with several micro-Watt of cooling power. Using two 3 He sorption coolers and gas-gap heat switches we have also demonstrated how this cooler can be operated in a continuous mode. The entire system is <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> in <b>operation</b> and can be controlled and monitored remotely through a standard http protocol. We show how existing thermal models can be used to predict the cooling power and lowest achievable temperatures of the refrigerator. Experimental results are analysed and used to estimate the condensation efficiency, the performance of the heat exchangers and the 3 He circulation rate...|$|R
5000|$|Type 97A {{carbines}} {{became available}} in Canada in 2008, {{were classified as}} Non-Restricted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and sold to general public.

[...] Around the same time a second shipment of Type 97A restricted firearms was also stopped by CBSA. On March 22, 2010 about 35 civilian owners of the Type 97A carbine originally imported by Lever Arms of BC (the only version ever available for sale) were sent notice by the RCMP indicating that the status of their firearm had been changed to 12.2 prohibited (<b>fully</b> <b>automatic),</b> and owners without such a firearm license had 30 days to turn in their Type 97A firearm to either individual or business that has such a license, or to police for destruction. [...] Canadian Type-97 owners initiated a reference hearing, to establish legality of re-classification of the Type-97 semi-automatic weapon to prohibited status. In early 2012 the challenge was lost, and the judge ruled that Type-97 firearms indeed are prohibited devices. While the exact details of the modification are kept secret, RCMP firearm technicians, allegedly, demonstrated to an expert on the defense side, that the Type-97 firearm can be readily and easily converted to <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode of <b>operation</b> in short time and with commonly available tools. As a result, Type-97 firearms were confiscated from the owners, and are no longer legal for civilian ownership in Canada (even for people with the so-called 12.2 <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm license).On April 28, 2013, Norinco's new EMEI T97NSR was classified as a non-restricted firearm by the RCMP with FRT Number 142760, and became legal for dealers to import for those with non-restricted possession and acquisition licenses. It is legal in Canada for hunting, varmint control, target practice and competitive shooting. It went into retail stores on September 17, 2013 and costs about $1,000 CAD.|$|R
