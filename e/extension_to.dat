5|$|Although {{work had}} begun on the Millfields station, {{including}} {{the completion of}} the station hotel (now the Unicorn pub), the population of Chesham were unhappy at the station being built such a distance from the town. With the <b>extension</b> <b>to</b> meet the LNWR abandoned the railway no longer needed to curve away from the town, and a public subscription raised £2,000 fund a 71-chain (1,562-yd; 1,428m) <b>extension</b> <b>to</b> a site near the town centre. Construction of the branch to Chesham began in late 1887.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, the U.S. Senate {{added an}} {{amendment}} to the surface transportation bill that authorized a one-year <b>extension</b> <b>to</b> the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. Oregon counties would have received a total of $102 million from the legislation in 2012, to be divided among all 33 counties that currently receive payments. In 2008, Oregon received $250 million from the program. The full transportation bill, including the amendment, passed the Senate by a 74–22 vote, but the U.S. House of Representatives refused to vote on the Senate bill, instead passing a three-month <b>extension</b> <b>to</b> the current transportation bill that did not contain a county payments extension. In July 2012, the Secure Rural Schools Act renewal amendment was included in the transportation bill approved by Congress and signed by the President. This was widely expected to be the last renewal of the program, but in September 2013, Congress passed another one-year <b>extension</b> <b>to</b> the program, though again at reduced levels.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} {{termination of}} the line at Elephant & Castle presented the opportunity for the line to be extended further, to serve Camberwell and other destinations in south-east London. In 1913, the Lord Mayor of London announced a proposal for the Bakerloo Tube to be extended to the Crystal Palace via Camberwell Green, Dulwich and Sydenham Hill, but nothing was done to implement the plan. In 1921, the LER costed an <b>extension</b> <b>to</b> Camberwell, Dulwich and Sydenham and in 1922 plans for an <b>extension</b> <b>to</b> Orpington via Loughborough Junction and Catford were considered. In 1928, a route to Rushey Green via Dulwich was suggested. Again, no action was taken, although the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee approved an <b>extension</b> <b>to</b> Camberwell in 1926.|$|E
