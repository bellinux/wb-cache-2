50|$|Brake <b>fade</b> {{is caused}} by a buildup of heat in the braking {{surfaces}} and the subsequent changes and reactions in the brake system components and can be experienced with both drum brakes and disc brakes.

50|$|Brake <b>fade</b> {{failures}} can cascade. For example, {{a typical}} 5-axle truck/trailer combination has 10 brakes. If one brake <b>fades,</b> brake load {{is transferred to}} the remaining 9 brakes, causing them to work harder, get hotter, and thus <b>fade</b> more. Where <b>fade</b> is non-uniform, <b>fade</b> may cause a vehicle to swerve. Because of this, heavy vehicles often use disproportionately weak brakes on steered wheels, which hurts the stopping distance and causes brakes on non-steered wheels to work harder, worsening <b>fade.</b> An advantage of low-fade brakes such as disc brakes is steered wheels can do more braking without causing brake steer.|$|R
