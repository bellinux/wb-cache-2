5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to give them a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> outage.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{scored a}} goal {{each in the}} second and third periods. In the second period, an early {{tripping}} penalty against Ottawa's Mike Fisher put the Flyers on the power play, during which Kim Johnsson extended Philadelphia's lead to 4–1. Ottawa received another penalty less than a minute later, which sent Todd Simpson to the penalty box for holding. A Flyers penalty against Radovan Somik for slashing Martin Havlat resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> play goal for the Senators' Zdeno Chara, closing the score to a two-goal gap once again. Fisher subsequently received his second penalty of the game, for high-sticking.|$|E
5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico.

Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, and they never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{political}} career began in July 1954, {{when he was}} appointed the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by former Emperor Bảo Đại, who was Head of State. At the time, Vietnam had been partitioned at the Geneva Conference after {{the defeat of the}} French Union forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, with the State of Vietnam ruling the country south of the 17th parallel. The partition was intended to be temporary, with national elections scheduled for 1956 to create a government of a reunified nation. In the meantime, Diệm and Bảo Đại were locked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> struggle. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm but selected him in the hope that he would attract American aid. The issue was brought to a head when Diệm scheduled a referendum for October 1955 on whether South Vietnam should become a republic. Diệm won the rigged referendum and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> {{struggle with the}} head of the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor {{was also}} active {{on the home}} front. Beginning in 1941, she co-chaired the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) with New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, working to give {{civilian}} volunteers expanded roles in war preparations. She soon found herself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> struggle with LaGuardia, who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense, while she saw solutions to broader social problems as equally important to the war effort. Though LaGuardia resigned from the OCD in December 1941, Eleanor {{was forced to resign}} following anger in the House of Representatives over high salaries for several OCD appointments, including two of her close friends.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during {{a demonstration of the}} Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E

5|$|In 1030, the Rus' {{raided the}} region of Shirvan; the ruler of Ganja then paid them much money to help {{suppress}} a revolt in Beylagan. Afterwards, the Rus' returned home. According to one source, in November 1031 the Rus' returned, but were defeated near Baku and expelled. The year of 1032 saw another Rus' raid into Shirvan; {{they were joined by}} the Alans and Sarir. Local Muslims defeated the Rus' in 1033. It is unclear to which Rus' grouping these raiders belonged. Omeljan Pritsak suggests that they operated out of a base near the Terek estuary and had their principal home in Tmutarakan. Pritsak also speculated that the Rus', operating from the Caspian basin, shortly thereafter lent support to the Oghuz <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> struggle in Khwarezm.|$|E
5|$|In 1643, Governor Winthrop became {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} over the propriety of taking sides <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> struggle going on in neighbouring French Acadia. Endecott pointed out {{that he should have}} let the French fight amongst themselves without English involvement, as this would weaken them both. The 1644 governor's election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy; Endecott was elected governor, with Winthrop as his deputy. During his one-year term he oversaw the division of the colony into four counties: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk. The ascent of the Salem-based Endecott also prompted an attempt by other Salem residents to have the colonial capital relocated there; the attempt was rejected by the governor's council of assistants.|$|E
5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period of his presidency, accusing him of {{increasing}} authoritarianism and the mixing {{of public and private}} interests. In addition, the benefits of the country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d'état.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that same}} year, Khánh became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> struggle with his deputy Khiêm {{as well as}} Minh, who had been retained as the titular head of state. Thảo {{was a close friend}} of Khiêm, so when Khánh prevailed in the power struggle, Khánh despatched Khiêm to Washington as the ambassador with Thảo was his press attaché. In August 1964, Khánh's leadership became increasingly troubled after he tried to augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency. This only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling for an end to military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future, which encouraged more groups to demand changes, and Khánh demoted certain Catholic pro-Diệm supporters. On 13 September, a Catholic-dominated group led by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, both of whom had been demoted, moved troops into Saigon but then withdrew after it became obvious they did not have the numbers to remove Khánh. Khiêm and Thảo were implicated in helping to plot Phát and Đức's attempted putsch; both were sent abroad by Khánh.|$|E
5|$|Some recent historians paint a more {{favourable}} {{picture of}} the emperor's rule. For example, Martijn Icks, in Images of Elagabalus (2008; republished as The Crimes of Elagabalus in 2012), doubts {{the reliability of the}} ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction? (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality {{played a role in the}} fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, his mother, and his immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day. Historians have not only kept the tradition alive, but often embellished it, reflecting their own bias against effeminacy, religious zealotry and other traits with which Elagabalus is commonly identified.|$|E

5|$|Subspecies (1991) follows three college students, Mara, Michelle, and Lillian, as {{they begin}} a study on Romanian culture and superstition {{in the small town}} Prejmer. They are befriended by Stefan, a student {{studying}} nocturnal animals. It is revealed that the nearby Castle Vladislas has been caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> struggle between vampire brothers Stefan and Radu. Centuries prior, King Vladislas was seduced and cursed by a sorceress who eventually gave birth to Radu. After banishing Radu's mother, the king met a mortal woman. She gave birth to Stefan, who prefers to live in the open, and loathes his vampire heritage. To gain control over the Bloodstone, a relic that is said to drip the blood of the saints, Radu kills his father. In an effort to hurt his brother, Radu turns Mara and Lillian into vampires. Stefan, having fallen in love with Michelle, helps her try and free Mara and Lillian from Radu's control. Stefan drives a stake through Radu's heart and severs his head with a sword, killing Radu. Unfortunately for Stefan, Radu bites Michelle before his brother can kill him and mingled his blood with hers, which forces Stefan to turn Michelle with his own blood in order to keep her from becoming like Radu. As Stefan and Michelle sleep, Radu's minions set about resurrecting their master.|$|E
