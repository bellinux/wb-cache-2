5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>library.</b> Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E
5|$|Pete Draper, {{who worked}} with Kamalakanna in Ghajini (2008), was {{selected}} as the pipeline technical director of the film. At that time, Kamalakannan was in Iran finalising the CG stadium and City with Adili. The majority of the film was shot in anamorphic format, but a Super 35 camera gate and lens were used for the stadium episode to minimise distortion. Post-production of the stadium scenes were given to Prasad EFX, and the film set up their own render farm in Chennai. The post process was done in several stages after the scan. The live stadium had only 7 steps, in which live people were positioned in 6 steps while the remaining 12 steps were CG extension. Adili created 3D CG people to fill the CG steps and their actions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>library</b> of 3000 frames.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George {{discusses}} breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while {{walking down the street}} with Marlene, and then hide out until she had given up on him. Although it was cut before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>library,</b> with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library.|$|E

25|$|The first {{treatise}} on architecture was De re aedificatoria ("On the Subject of Building") by Leon Battista Alberti in 1450.

25|$|By 1944, all forty {{volumes of}} the First Encyclopedia of Tlön are {{discovered}} and published <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>library</b> in Memphis. The material then becomes accessible worldwide, and immensely influential on Earth's culture, science and languages. By the time Borges concludes the story, presumably in 1947, the world is gradually disintegrating and transforming into Tlön. Borges then turns to an obsession of his own: a translation of Sir Thomas Browne's Urn Burial into Spanish. Arguably {{it is no more}} important than Tlön, but it is at least of his world.|$|E

2500|$|Since the DCMA was passed, librarians {{across the}} country protested the limited {{circumvention}} rights they were afforded. [...] The Association of Research Libraries addressed the problem of preservation head-on, arguing that “preservation is one of <b>a</b> <b>library’s</b> most critical functions... the DMCA is interfering with our ability to preserve these works.” The provisions of Section (VII) would effectively eliminate librarians' problems with preservation of works <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>library's</b> collection.|$|R

These begin with one apparently normal image that breaks into four quarters, each showing a different view or reflection of the other. The screen sections are divided, so the child <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>library</b> may climb up a ladder from the bottom left section, and {{end up in the}} top right segment.

25|$|Some {{programming}} languages may use {{a feature}} called smart linking whereby the linker {{is aware of}} or integrated with the compiler, such that the linker knows how external references are used, and code <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>library</b> that is never actually used, even though internally referenced, can be discarded from the compiled application. For example, a program that only uses integers for arithmetic, or does no arithmetic operations at all, can exclude floating-point library routines. This smart-linking feature can lead to smaller application file sizes and reduced memory usage.|$|E

25|$|Researchers Campbell and Hawley (1982) {{provided}} {{evidence of the}} regulation of arousal differences between introverts and extroverts. They found that when studying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>library,</b> extroverts {{were more likely to}} choose to work in areas with bustle and activity, while introverts were more likely to choose a quiet, secluded area. Accordingly, Adrian Furnham and Anna Bradley discovered that introverts presented with music at the time of two cognitive tasks (prose recall and reading comprehension) performed significantly worse on a test of memory recall than extroverts who were also presented with music {{at the time of the}} tasks. However, if music was not present at the time of the tasks, introverts and extroverts performed at the same level.|$|E
