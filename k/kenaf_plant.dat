50|$|The use of kenaf {{in paper}} {{production}} offers various environmental advantages over producing paper from trees. In 1960, the USDA surveyed more than 500 plants and selected kenaf {{as the most}} promising source of tree-free newsprint. In 1970, kenaf newsprint produced in the International Paper Company's mill in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was successfully used by six U.S. newspapers. Printing and writing paper made from the fibrous <b>kenaf</b> <b>plant</b> has been offered in the United States since 1992. Again in 1987, a Canadian mill produced 13 rolls of kenaf newsprint which were used by four U.S. newspapers to print experimental issues. They found that kenaf newsprint made for stronger, brighter and cleaner pages than standard pine paper with less detriment to the environment. Due partly to kenaf fibres being naturally whiter than tree pulp, less bleaching is required to create a brighter sheet of paper. Hydrogen peroxide, an environmentally-safe bleaching agent that does not create dioxin, has been used with much success in the bleaching of kenaf.|$|E

40|$|Great {{interest}} has been {{generated in the}} use of natural fibres as environmentally friendly reinforcing materials in polymeric composites, which do not require high load bearing capabilities. kenaf fibres extracted from <b>kenaf</b> <b>plants</b> (hibiscus cannabinus) have been identified as an attractive option due to its production cost and the ability of the <b>kenaf</b> <b>plants</b> to grow in a variety of climatic conditions. Polypropylene (PP) has a relatively low production cost, excellent corrosion resistance, good retention of mechanical properties and less recycling challenges in comparison to other matrix systems such as thermosets. Given the individual advantages of kenaf fibre and polypropylene, kenaf reinforced polypropylene composites (kenaf/PP composites) have considerable commercial interest in the composite industry. However, limitations arise with respect to the mechanical performance and to the resistance to moisture absorption when natural fibres are used. This study focuses on the improvement of the mechanical properties (e. g. tensile, flexural, fatigue and impact properties) and the resistance to moisture absorption of kenaf reinforced polypropylene composites by means of fibre treatments (e. g. alkali and alkali-silane treatments) and the use of filler materials (e. g. functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes). Kenaf reinforced polypropylene composites are manufactured by a modified compression moulding using the film–stacking technique. The crux of this technique is that kenaf mats are impregnated with polypropylene powder in order achieve a uniform material distribution and to lower the manufacturing temperature, thereby preventing the thermal alteration of the composite constituents (e. g. kenaf fibres) and silano functional groups attached to the multi-wall carbon nanotubes. Fibre treatments including alkali treatments and alkali followed by silane treatments (alkali-silane) are considered in order to improve the fibre-matrix interfacial adhesion. The concentrations of the alkali solutions range from 1...|$|R

Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV) infection was studied using kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.), a non-wood fiber-producing crop in this study. Infection by HCRSV reduced the fiber yield and concomitant economic value of kenaf. We investigated kenaf growth retardation and fluctuations of four selected miRNAs after HCRSV infection. Vegetative growth (including plant height, leaf size and root development) was severely retarded. From the transverse and radial sections of the mock and HCRSV-infected kenaf stem, the vascular bundles of HCRSV-infected plants were severely disrupted. In addition, four conserved plant developmental and defence related microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR 165, miR 167, miR 168 and miR 171) and their respective target genes phabulosa (PHB), auxin response factor 8 (ARF 8), argonaute 1 (AGO 1) and scarecrow-like protein 1 (SCL 1) displayed variation in expression levels after HCRSV infection. Compared with the mock inoculated <b>kenaf</b> <b>plants,</b> miR 171 and miR 168 and their targets SCL 1 and AGO 1 showed greater fluctuations after HCRSV infection.

In order to study its coat protein (CP) functions on virus replication and movement in kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.), two HCRSV mutants, designated as p 2590 (A to G) in which the first start codon ATG was replaced with GTG and p 2776 (C to G) in which proline 63 was replaced with alanine, were constructed. In vitro transcripts of p 2590 (A to G) were able to replicate to a similar level as wild type without CP expression in kenaf protoplasts. However, its cell-to-cell movement was not detected in the inoculated kenaf cotyledons. Structurally the proline 63 in subunit C acts as a kink for b-annulus formation during virion assembly. Progeny of transcripts derived from p 2776 (C to G) was able to move from cell-to-cell in inoculated cotyledons but its long-distance movement was not detected. Virions were not observed in partially purified mutant virus samples isolated from 2776 (C to G) inoculated cotyledons. Removal of the N-terminal 77 amino acids of HCRSV CP by trypsin digestion of purified wild type HCRSV virions resulted in only T = 1 empty virus-like particles.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{pre-treatment}} of cellulose from <b>kenaf</b> <b>plant</b> to yield sugar precursors {{for the production}} of ethanol or butanol for use as biofuel additives. In order to convert the crystalline cellulosic form to the amorphous form that can undergo enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond to yield sugars, kenaf pulp samples were subjected to two different pre-treatment processes. In the acid pre-treatment, the pulp samples were treated with 37. 5 % hydrochloric acid in the presence of FeCl 3 at 50 °C or 90 °C whereas in the alkaline method, the pulp samples were treated with 25 % sodium hydroxide at room temperature and with 2 % or 5 % sodium hydroxide at 50 °C. Microwave-assisted NaOH-treatment of the cellulose was also investigated and demonstrated to be capable of producing high glucose yield without adverse environmental impact by circumventing the use of large amounts of concentrated acids i. e., 83 – 85 % phosphoric acid employed in most digestion processes. The treated samples were digested with the cellulase enzyme from Trichoderma reesei. The amount of glucose produced was quantified using the QuantichromTM glucose bioassay for assessing the efficiency of glucose production for each of the treatment processes. The microwave-assisted alkaline pre-treatment processes conducted at 50 °C were found to be the most effective in the conversion of the crystalline cellulose to the amorphous form based on the significantly higher yields of sugar produced by enzymatic hydrolysis compared to the untreated sample...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{determine}} the effect of root-knot nematode infection on the growth of kenaf. Seeds of sixteen (16) varieties of kenaf, comprising of eight from Australia, three local and five accessions from Bangladesh were planted under controlled condition and inoculated with four level of 0, 1000, 5000 and 10000 RKN eggs per plant. The growth parameters of height, stalk diameter and number of node of plants were measured at interval of 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after planting. The results of this investigation showed that all <b>kenaf</b> <b>plant</b> cultivars studied here, differed in growth parameters (P = 0. 05) both in the absence and presence of nematode infection. M. incognita race 1 was found that can infect all of these cultivars. The damage due to nematode; however; differed based on cultivar, level of inoculation and month of growth. Reduction of plant height and stalk diameter was observed in all inoculated varieties. Number of internode, however; was increased instead. In different growing time, the values for these parameters were shown to be different as a function of growing age and nematode infection. When infected with RKN, a superiority of varieties KK 60 (M), G 4 (AUST) and entry 3740 concerning to others were observed for height, stalk diameter and internode respectively. The growth parameters of resistant varieties treated with RKN was significantly better over the time as compared to the susceptible one...|$|E
30|$|Agronomic {{properties}} (whole stalk yield, fiber length distribution, chemical composition) {{and whole}} stalk kraft pulp characteristics (total pulp yield, pulp fiber length distribution, pulp sheet strengths) were examined for kenaf (variety Zhehong 8310) at four plant populations, ranging from 135 000 to 405 000 plants/ha on arid hillside land at Anji, Zhejiang, China. For agronomic properties, the final whole stalk yield was higher as the plant population increased {{and as the}} altitude of the location on the slope decreased. Average fiber lengths of bast and core showed maxima at 225 000 plants/ha. Cellulose content increased as the plant population increased. For the kraft pulp characteristics of kenaf whole stalk, the total pulp yield was lower as the plant population increased, with the maximum difference about 1.3 %. Sheet strengths and average fiber length attained maxima at around 225000 – 315000 plants/ha. The largest pulp strengths (breaking length, burst index, and folding endurance) were seen at a plant population of 225000 plants/ha, and the largest tear index was seen at a plant population of 315 000 plants/ha. When the agronomic properties and whole stalk kraft pulp characteristics were combined, a plant population between 225 000 and 315 000 plants/ha, {{which is a little}} higher than that of kenaf bast production for textiles, was selected as the optimum cultivated <b>kenaf</b> <b>plant</b> population for whole stalk kraft pulp and papermaking on arid hillside land in China.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} of this work was to compare the biomass production of three varieties of kenaf in two Spain locations. Also, other objective was to study the effect of sowing date and population density on <b>plant</b> <b>kenaf</b> yield. The experiments were carried out in 2003 in Madrid (experimental farm “La Canaleja ” from INIA, Alcalá de Henares) and in Badajoz (experimental farm “La Orden”, Guadajira). Three kenaf varieties (Everglades 41; Salvador; Tainung 2) were sowed in two dates (S 1, end of May; S 2, beginning of June) and cultivated at two densities (D 1, 200000 plants/ha; D 2, 400000 plants/ha). The {{results show that the}} biomass production of kenaf was significantly greater in Badajoz than Madrid. No marked effect on biomass production was observed when different plant populations were used in the two localities. S 1 and S 2 sowings produced similar harvests in Badajoz, while the S 1 yield was significantly better than S 2 in Madrid. The response of each variety was different in the two locations. In Madrid, the maximum yield was obtained by Everglades 41, but the differences were not significant in Badajoz...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Increasing leaf {{photosynthetic}} rates {{seems to}} be a strait-forward way of increasing crop yield [1]. Fluorescents measurements can be useful to check out differences in kenaf crop. JIP-test method can control the stress in experimental kenaf field trials in comparison with real kenaf yield crop development. The parameters developed [2] can be analyzed in random field blocks checking out the ones as dependent variables who better represents the field treatments studied in each case. Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) [4] is an annual plant that can be useful as a source of low cost natural fibre. It is a fast-growing plant, and can be used in the industry {{for a wide range of}} products, especially for his fibre content useful for the paper production industry. To the farming point of view this crop can be also seen as a useful alternative to the irrigated summer crops in our zone. However, there are few data about the <b>plant</b> <b>kenaf</b> agronomy during the last decade for our continental climate in relation with their biomass plant production. Anova and Discriminant analysis was done in about 42 JIP-test variables and ratios between variables. Key words: agriculture, biomass production, biomass resource...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out with 33 Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) genotypes of diverse origin to obtain {{information}} on genetic variability, heritability and correlation between fibre yield and various yield attributes. A substantial variability was observed among the genotypes for all 8 characters studied. The character dry stick weight per plant exhibited the highest phenotypic and genotypic coefficients of variation (20. 30, 14. 11) followed by dry fibre yield per plant (18. 06, 12. 05) and green weight per plant (17. 25, 11. 41). Heritability ranged from 98. 36 for days to 50 % flowering to 15. 97 % for node number per plant. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance was observed for days to 50 % flowering and green weight per plant suggesting the dominant role of additive gene effects in the expression of these two characters. Correlation studies revealed that fibre yield was positively and significantly correlated with all the characters studied except node number per plant and days to 50 % flowering. The character node number per plant was negatively associated with fibre yield. To enhance yield status of <b>kenaf,</b> the characters <b>plant</b> height, base diameter, green weight and stick weight {{could be used as}} selection criteria...|$|R
