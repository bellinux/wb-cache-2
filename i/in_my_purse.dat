6000|$|... "I {{will have}} none of his coinage <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> though, Michael," [...] said mine host; [...] "I know what belongs to falsifying the Queen's coin." ...|$|E
6000|$|UNKNOWN. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> in the reticule. It was a crimson silk purse. Really, I wouldn't have come--I don't want to {{make any}} fuss. But I must get my money back--mustn't I? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or," [...] said Sir Miles Musgrave, [...] "if this worthy {{cavalier}} {{chooses to}} part with his charger for a reasonable sum, I have {{some part of the}} silver candlesticks still dancing the heys <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> which I shall be very willing to transfer to his." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} make much matter which I ride now, Paolo; we shall have the {{opportunity}} of seeing which has the most fire and endurance as we ride along; and at any rate I shall keep Enghien's four horses for my own riding, keeping two with me and leaving two behind at the castle. I shall buy four strong and serviceable horses for the troopers when I get my first rents, for <b>in</b> sooth <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> is beginning to run very low." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't indeed, my dear," [...] says he, [...] "unless I am {{obliged to}} it. I assure you I {{do not intend}} it; but if I should, I am not worth robbing now, for I have nothing about me but about six pistoles <b>in</b> <b>my</b> little <b>purse</b> and that little ring," [...] showing me a small diamond ring, worth about ten or twelve pistoles, which he put upon his finger, in the room of the rich one he usually wore.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked behind}} me anxiously at starting, and often {{afterward}} on the road; but never saw anything to excite <b>my</b> suspicions. <b>In</b> settling matters with the landlord over night, I had arranged {{that we should}} be driven to the nearest town at which a post-chaise could be obtained. My resources were just as likely to hold out against the expenses of posting, where public conveyances could not be obtained, as against the expense of waiting privately at hotels, until the right coaches might start. According to my calculations, my money would last till we got to Scotland. After that, I had my watch, rings, shirtpin, and Mr. Batterbury, to help <b>in</b> replenishing <b>my</b> <b>purse.</b> Anxious, therefore, as I was about other things, money matters, for once in a way, did not cause me the smallest uneasiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's very awkward, {{excessively}} {{awkward and}} vexatious. Here am I, ever so {{many thousands of}} miles away from home, without a single sovereign <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> and without even the right to borrow of the captain, for I have nothing certainly available even at home--Some! Why, I have no home!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, don't bother, I {{assure you}} I shall be all right. I've got ten shillings <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> {{and that will}} take me back from {{anywhere}} YOU have brought me to.' She hesitated. The rings were still on her fingers, two on her little finger, one on her ring finger. Still she hesitated.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{where is}} the money now, my dear?" [...] "O, snug <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> [...] . Aunt was SO slow In saving it--eighty weeks, or near." [...] "Let's spend it," [...] he hints. [...] "For she won't know. There's a dance to-night at the Load of Hay." [...] She passively nods. And they go that way.|$|E
6000|$|So I {{answered}} after I had waked {{from the}} trance-like dream. It was yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. [...] "It cannot be {{too early to}} commence the task I have to fulfil," [...] thought I. I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes. I knew where to find <b>in</b> <b>my</b> drawers some linen, a locket, a ring. In seeking these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago. I left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride's who had melted in air. The other articles I made up <b>in</b> a parcel; <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> containing twenty shillings (it was all I had), I put <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{it be that}} brute?" [...] {{she breathed}} out, meaning Schomberg, of course. [...] "He's getting too forward with me now. What can you expect? Only this evening, after supper, he--but I slipped away. You don't mind him, do you? Why, I could face him myself now that I know you care for me. A girl can always put up a fight. You believe me? Only it isn't easy {{to stand up for}} {{yourself}} when you feel there's nothing and nobody at your back. There's nothing so lonely in the world as a girl who has got to look after herself. When I left poor dad in that home--it was in the country, near a village--I came out of the gates with seven shillings and threepence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old <b>purse,</b> and <b>my</b> railway ticket. I tramped a mile, and got into a train--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So here I wait, {{without knowing}} how things will end with Midwinter <b>in</b> London; with <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> getting emptier and emptier, and no {{appearance}} so far {{of any new}} pupils to fill it; with Mother Oldershaw certain to insist on having her money back the moment she knows I have failed; without prospects, friends, or hopes of any kind--a lost woman, {{if ever there was}} a lost woman yet. Well! I say it again and again and again--I don't care! Here I stop, if I sell the clothes off my back, if I hire myself at the public-house to play to the brutes in the tap-room; here I stop till the time comes, and I see the way to parting Armadale and Miss Milroy forever!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Early in July--the 9th or 10th of the month, I think--I {{was sitting}} alone in my gallery, looking ruefully enough at the last two sovereigns <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> when a gentleman was {{announced}} who wanted a lesson. [...] "A private lesson," [...] he said, with emphasis, looking {{at the man who}} cleaned and took care of my weapons.|$|E
6000|$|He rode {{a little}} farther. Then {{suddenly}} he bethought himself, [...] "What a silly spectacle shall I {{cut in the}} town with no money <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> and with such fine clothes upon my back." [...] Once more the Genie was summoned. [...] "I should like," [...] said the fagot-maker, [...] "to have a box full of money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you think," [...] Anna interrupted, {{with a note}} {{of passion}} {{trembling}} also in her tone, [...] "that I would have taken alms from Sir John, the man to whom I had lied for your sake. It was not possible. I went at last when I had barely a shilling <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> to a dramatic agent. By chance I went to one who had known you in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A big, tall {{fellow in}} a motor-car stopped {{me on the}} Mayfield road. He poked a pistol <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face and took <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> and <b>my</b> watch. Sir Henry, that man was you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} one thing I could have done," [...] said Rollo. [...] "If I had put <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> inside jacket pocket, and buttoned up the jacket tight, then they could not {{possibly}} have got it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They wanted <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> to look at," [...] said Clarence hurriedly, [...] "and that's how {{the thing}} happened. Somebody put HIS OWN MONEY back into <b>MY</b> <b>purse</b> by accident." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It means this," [...] she explained: [...] "To-night I {{have money}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> jewels on my fingers, a motor car to ride home in. In a week's time, if things went badly with us, I might have nothing. Then father or I, {{or both of}} us, would {{go out into the}} world to replenish, and from whomever had most of what we desired we should take as {{opportunity}} presented itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|For a {{time the}} Knight said not a word, but a slow red arose into his cheeks; at last he looked Robin {{in the face and}} said, [...] "I know not why I should be ashamed, for it should be no shame to me; but, friend, I tell thee the truth, when I say that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> are ten shillings, and that that is every groat that Sir Richard of the Lea hath in all the wide world." ...|$|E
60|$|As for my poor twenty guineas, {{in three}} days I saw, with terror, that they had dwindled down to eight: theatres and taverns having already made such cruel inroads <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse.</b> At play I had lost, it is true, a couple of pieces; but seeing that every one round about me played upon honour and gave their bills, I, of course, {{preferred}} that medium to the payment of ready money, and when I lost paid on account.|$|E
25|$|Oswald: (3:52) Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take <b>my</b> <b>purse.</b>|$|R
5000|$|But I said, I've lost my waistcoat, {{my watch}} chain and <b>my</b> <b>purse!</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|....<b>my</b> <b>purse</b> {{is open to}} the call." [...] How {{much was}} donated is unknown.|$|R
6000|$|Constance {{rose and}} moved away, but before {{reaching}} the door she turned and spoke. [...] "Mother, I cannot {{pay any attention to}} such wild, unfounded accusations. If I must leave home without a shilling <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> after teaching Fan for a year, I can only say that you are treating me with the greatest injustice, and that a stranger would have treated me better." [...] Then she left the room, and for several days after no word passed between mother and daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} struck this day,' said Mr Pecksniff, 'with a walking stick (which I {{have every reason to}} believe has knobs upon it), on that {{delicate}} and exquisite portion of the human anatomy--the brain. Several blows have been inflicted, sir, without a walking-stick, upon that tenderer portion of my frame--my heart. You have mentioned, sir, my being bankrupt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse.</b> Yes, sir, I am. By an unfortunate speculation, combined with treachery, I find myself reduced to poverty; at a time, sir, when the child of my bosom is widowed, and affliction and disgrace are in my family.' ...|$|E
60|$|Having breakfasted at an outlay {{of exactly}} eight cents I {{returned}} to my chamber, which was a hall-room, eight feet by ten, and faced the north. It was heated (theoretically) from a register in the floor, {{and there was just}} space enough for my trunk, a cot and a small table at the window but as it cost only six dollars per month I was content. I figured that I could live on five dollars per week which would enable me to stay till spring. I had about one hundred and thirty dollars <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Gab. [...] I saw in you [...] A man {{above his}} station--and if not [...] So high, as now I find you, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> then [...] Conceptions, 'twas that I had rarely seen [...] Men such as you {{appeared}} in height of mind, [...] In the most high of worldly rank; you were [...] Poor, even to all save rags: I would have shared [...] 290 [...] <b>My</b> <b>purse,</b> though slender, with you--you refused it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{pretended to}} be drunk, same as the tec told me," [...] ses Sam, [...] "and then I felt 'em turn round and creep up behind me. One of 'em come up behind and put 'is knee <b>in</b> <b>my</b> back and caught me by the throat, and the other gave me a punch in the chest, and while I was gasping for breath took <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> away. Then I started on 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tempt you to nothing, young man," [...] {{answered}} Ursula; [...] "and, as I perceive {{you are too}} wilful to be wise, I will e'en put <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket, {{and look}} out for some one that will work my turn with better will, and more thankfulness. And you may go your own course,--break your indenture, ruin your father, lose your character, and bid pretty Mistress Margaret farewell, for ever and a day." ...|$|R
60|$|They gave me {{the best}} horses the stable possessed to carry me on my road to Dublin, and the strongest ropes for harness; and we got on pretty well, {{and there was no}} {{rencontre}} between the highwaymen and the pistols with which Fritz and I were provided. We lay that night at Kilcullen, and the next day I made my entry into the city of Dublin, with four horses to my carriage, five thousand guineas <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> {{and one of the most}} brilliant reputations in Europe, having quitted the city a beggarly boy, eleven years before.|$|E
6000|$|After {{the heat}} of my anger had cooled, I made two discoveries. One cost me a fee to a messenger, and the other exposed me to the {{insolence}} of a servant. I pay willingly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> and my pride, when the gain is peace of mind. Through my messenger I ascertained that Eunice had never left the farm. Through my own inquiries, answered by the waiter with an impudent grin, I heard that Philip had left orders to have his room kept for him. What misery our stupid housemaid might have spared me, if she had thought of putting that question when I sent her to the hotel! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doss thou prate so to me, sirrah?" [...] {{cried the}} Corn Engrosser in a rage. [...] "Now I will have thee soundly whipped if ever I catch thee in any {{town where the}} law can lay hold of thee! As for giving thee a penny, I swear to thee that I have {{not so much as}} a single groat <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>purse.</b> Were Robin Hood himself to take me, he might search me from crown to heel without finding the {{smallest}} piece of money upon me. I trust I am too sly to travel so nigh to Sherwood with money in my pouch, and that thief at large in the woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In eight days, too, <b>my</b> {{travelling}} <b>purse</b> will be exhausted. [...] It is yet utterly {{impossible for}} me to labour with <b>my</b> mind. [...] <b>In</b> <b>my</b> hand, therefore, are at present no resources.|$|R
6000|$|... "As long as there's {{the ghost}} of a chance left to me," [...] Lord Harry replied, [...] "I'll take any way of filling <b>my</b> <b>purse</b> but yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can then? The {{day after}} to-morrow, if you please. You are {{to pay all}} charges out of <b>my</b> <b>purse,</b> You hear the {{condition}} of your going?" ...|$|R
