500|$|Pham Van Dong, {{the second}} Prime Minister of Vietnam, served as North Vietnamese Prime Minister from 1955 until 1976, {{when he became}} prime {{minister}} of a unified Vietnam, and then until 1987, when he resigned. At his resignation, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Vietnamese history, and the oldest serving prime minister in the world. He often lamented {{that he was one}} of the world's weakest prime ministers, on one occasion saying; [...] "I can do nothing. When <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> nobody listens. If I propose changing a deputy minister, it turns out to be impossible. I cannot even choose my own ministers." [...] Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked Number 3 in the order of precedence of the Communist Party's Politburo.|$|E
500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{felt that the}} lyrics, along with being an answer-song, could also be {{interpreted}} as a rebellious one, where Madonna looks back on a relationship where she was not allowed to speak her mind. The song's lyrics contain sarcastic backing vocals with Madonna asking rhetorical questions based on her real-life actions, such as [...] "Did <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?" [...] Madonna explained that the lyrics were about [...] "basically saying don't put me in a box, don't pin me down, don't tell me what I can and can't say. It's about breaking out of the restraints." [...] With the Los Angeles Times she further clarified that there was a defensiveness with the lyrics for [...] "Human Nature": ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Aaron from Spin {{described}} the song as [...] "slinking through [...] low-ridin', gum-smackin' groove, Maddy's hard-bitten ingenue expresses no regrets, {{but this time}} you feel for her." [...] Aaron highlighted the lyrics [...] "Would it sound better if I were a man?" [...] as subversive and coy. Author Lucy O'Brien described in her book, , that [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "quirkiest" [...] tracks on Bedtime Stories, [...] "throbbing with a tightly restrained but devastating anger". For Barry Walters from Moscow-Pullman Daily News, the song had the catchiest chorus among all the other tracks from the album. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a negative review, noting that Madonna's [...] "on far surer ground thrashing through such neurotic (if not uncommon) views of relationships than she is trashing the media. In striking back at her critics, Madonna simply sounds self-righteous and smug. 'I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex,' she sneers in 'Human Nature'. 'Did <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> true?' Yes. But tooting your own horn about it just sounds petty". Rooksby said that the repetition of the sample was [...] "wearing" [...] and it [...] "did not suggest that the world of the singer was very appealing".|$|E

500|$|Dubbed at {{the time}} [...] "The Queen of obscene", Madonna and the Sex era is {{considered}} by many as the artist's most controversial and transgressive period. The book, widely panned by the press, is {{regarded as one of the}} factors that shaped the social reaction and critique towards Madonna during the early 1990s. Her fifth studio album Erotica was affected by the negative press surrounding the book. In March 1993, Spin magazine wrote an article praising the book, but months later in Mexico, social communicologist Nino Canún dedicated an episode of his morning talk show ¿Y usted qué opina? (English: So what's your opinion?), to Madonna. Some members of the audience, among them a priest, presented their arguments as to why [...] "this morally clueless singer shouldn't be allowed to perform in the country", making reference to The Girlie Show World Tour, which was set to visit Mexico. Later, during the concert, Madonna wore a charro sombrero and simulated an orgy with her dancers onstage, as a response to these comments. Continuing her provocative imagery, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which featured the singer fully nude and in scenes engaged in simulated sexual acts. In March 1994, Madonna appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that was required to be censored on television and handing Letterman a pair of her underwear and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit film, album and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics regard Madonna as a sexual renegade. She faced strong negative publicity from critics and fans, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over. Later, on the song [...] "Human Nature", from her sixth studio album Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna addressed the public backlash the book was still receiving, particularly with the lines [...] "Did <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?".|$|E

60|$|But now, when didst thou {{feel the}} power of this first part of the Scripture, the law, so mighty as to strike thee dead?

Yet if thou shouldest have felt something, <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>something</b> of the killing power of the law of God in thine heart, this is not an {{argument}} to prove that thou believest all the things contained in Scripture, for there is gospel as well as law, and therefore I shall speak to that also, that is, whether thou hast felt {{the power of}} the gospel, as well as something {{of the power of the}} law.|$|E
