40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new design {{and analysis of}} a <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> for a gastrointestinal endoscopy simulation. The gastrointestinal endoscopy is a procedure in which the digestive tract and organs of a patient are diagnosed and treated using a long and flexible endoscope. The developed <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> incorporates {{two degrees of freedom}} (DOF), each of which is necessary to describe the movements of an endoscope during the actual endoscopy procedures.

The endoscope included in the <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> is supported by a folding guide to prevent the endoscope from buckling. Force feedback in each direction is provided by wire-driven mechanisms.

A <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> allows a human "observer" to explore and interact with a virtual environment using the sense of touch. <b>Haptic</b> <b>interface</b> systems include three main components: the <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> (usually an electro-mechanical system capable of exerting forces on a user), a model of the environment to be touched, and a rendering algorithm which unites the first two by generating the feedback forces based on the environment model.

40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} {{evaluation}} procedures {{is to achieve}} both qualitative and quantitative statements on haptic rendering realism and performance. Since a <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> provides an interaction between a user and a virtual environment, fidelity of a <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> directly affects the performance. To our knowledge, a standard, generic and reusable validation method which comprehensively addresses all the attributes of haptic feedback {{has not been realized}} yet. Despite the large number of human factor studies, only few of them have been proposed as well for <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> performance measurements. For this reason, we review validation procedures for haptic rendering and propose an evaluation method based on testbeds to obtain a systematic <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> assessment. We integrated the approaches of human factor studies into the testbeds to obtain a simple and yet complete measure of human-machine interaction performance. The testbeds were tested on a <b>haptic</b> <b>interface,</b> the IHP of Xitact SA, and performance results are presented. In the testbeds, performance metrics for generic haptic interaction tasks are expressed in terms of information transfer (bits) and sensory thresholds which are indeed device specific benchmark metrics. Thus, the suitability of a <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> for a defined task can be verified, device comparisons become possible and the obtained information can be used to identify possible improvements.

40|$|Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) teleoperators {{suffer from}} a reduced {{situational}} awareness, contributing to a high UAV accident rate. The implementation of a <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> {{is a way to}} provide them with more information about obstacles in the environment in order to compensate for this. Research focused on systems that actively help the teleoperator to avoid collision at a last stage. The <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> as described in this paper guides the teleoperator in a more passive way, making him aware of unsafe trajectories in an earlier stage instead of actively trying to avoid collision. This new <b>haptic</b> <b>interface</b> changes the stiffness of the control device based on environmental constraints, leading to a changing non-linear force-displacement relationship for the control device. In order to explore the performance of this <b>haptic</b> <b>interface,</b> off-line simulations and a human-in-theloop experiment have been performed. The results of the off-line simulations showed the potential to prevent collisions at an early stage. However, the results of the human-in-the-loop experiment do not show the expected improvements for the <b>haptic</b> <b>interface,</b> no significant differences can be identified. The cause of this is hypothesized to be both due to a low task difficulty level and the boundaries of the feedback not corresponding to the physical dimensions of the UAV.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} to enlarge the impedance range of admittance-type <b>haptic</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Admittance-type <b>haptic</b> <b>interfaces</b> have advantages over impedance-type <b>haptic</b> <b>interfaces</b> in the interaction with high impedance virtual environments. However, the performance of admittance-type <b>haptic</b> <b>interfaces</b> is often limited by the lower boundary of the impedance {{that can be achieved}} without stability issue. Especially, {{it is well known that}} low value of inertia in an admittance model often causes unstable interaction. This paper extends recently proposed input-to-state stable approach [1] to further lower down the achievable impedance in admittance-type <b>haptic</b> <b>interfaces</b> with less conservative constraint compared with the passivity-based approaches. The primary challenge was identifying the nonlinear hysteresis components which are essential for the implementation of the input-to-state stable approach. Through experimental investigation and after separating and merging the admittance model and the position controller, the partial admittance model (from the measured human force to the desired velocity) and the velocity controller (from the velocity tracking error to the controller force) were found having counter-clockwise hysteresis nonlinear behavior. Therefore, it allows implementing the one-port in put-to-state stable (ISS) approach for making both components dissipative and ISS. An additional advantage of the proposed ISS approach is the easiness of the implementation. No model information is required, and the network representation is not necessary, unlike the passivity-based approaches. Series of experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach in term of significantly lowering the achievable impedance value compared with what the time-domain passivity approach can render...|$|R
