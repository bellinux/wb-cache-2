5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they <b>get</b> <b>less</b> sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|When organised, the {{defending}} team will offer no resistance until the attacking team has advanced {{to a certain}} height on the pitch. The pressure height, or at which depth the midfielders should start acting as first and second defenders, depends {{on a lot of}} factors. For example, as higher pressure is more tiring, it demands players with good stamina. In general, a defensive-minded team will tend to stay lower, thus diminishing defensive risks as opponents <b>get</b> <b>less</b> space. This however, also gives them a longer way to the goal {{in the event of a}} break and counter-attack, making the long through ball a typical alternative.|$|E

The candidates of both the pan-democracy and pro-Beijing coalitions stated {{that they would not}} allocate the votes within each camp, leading to infighting inside the caucuses. Martin Lee and Anson Chan announced that they would not stand, and would endorse other candidates. In addition, some incumbent legislators such as Audrey Eu of the Civic Party and Yeung Sum of the Democratic Party were placed second on their lists in an attempt to <b>get</b> <b>less</b> experienced members of their parties elected.|$|E

25|$|Some {{applications}} like AC/AC converters with DC-link for frequency {{controls in}} three-phase grids need higher voltages than electrolytic capacitors usually offer. For such applications electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series for increased voltage-withstanding capability. During charging, the voltage across {{each of the}} capacitors connected in series {{is proportional to the}} inverse of the individual capacitor's leakage current. Since every capacitor differs somewhat in individual leakage current, the capacitors with a higher leakage current will <b>get</b> <b>less</b> voltage. The voltage balance over the series-connected capacitors is not symmetrical. Passive or active voltage balance has to be provided in order to stabilize the voltage over each individual capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Financial {{incentives}} for photovoltaics, such as feed-in tariffs, {{have often been}} offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar-electric generating systems. Government has sometimes also offered incentives {{in order to encourage}} the PV industry to achieve the economies of scale needed to compete where the cost of PV-generated electricity is above the cost from the existing grid. Such policies are implemented to promote national or territorial energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which cause global warming. Due to economies of scale solar panels <b>get</b> <b>less</b> costly as people use and buy more—as manufacturers increase production to meet demand, the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come.|$|E
25|$|A player's ranking {{points for}} an event {{must be at least}} 1.2. Players who would <b>get</b> <b>less</b> than this using the above formula get no ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th {{position}} gets no points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players are guaranteed to receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the Humble eBook Bundle, John Scalzi {{noted that}} various factors, such as brand name recognition, a lack of DRM, a focus on charity, the {{uniqueness}} of the bundle and its format, and the variety of included authors, all made the Humble eBook Bundle a success. Scalzi notes that while people who participate in Humble Bundles will <b>get</b> <b>less</b> in net profit than they would have without the bundle (due to the variable percentages patrons can donate and publishers taking their cut of proceeds), but in return receive greater volume (the Humble Bundle sold 42,000 copies of eBooks in two weeks, almost as much as the average monthly bestseller). In conclusion, Scalzi lauds the idea of the Humble Bundle, and notes to future contributors that while the bundle is low-margin, it's also low-risk. Novelist Cory Doctorow, who organized both eBook bundles, noted that while no publisher aside from Tor Books would participate in the bundle because of no-DRM stipulations, they still raised around $2 million for books whose circulations were earning their authors little to no money.|$|E
25|$|An assay (analysis) {{is never}} an {{isolated}} process {{and must be}} combined with pre- and post-analytic procedures. The information communication (e.g. request to perform an assay and further information processing) or specimen handling (e.g. collection, transport and processing) that are done {{until the beginning of}} an assay are the preanalytic steps. Similarly, after the assay, the result may be documented, verified and transmitted/communicated in steps that are called post-analytic steps. Like any multi-step information handling and transmission systems, variation and errors in the communicated final results of an assay involve corresponding parts in every such step; i.e. not only analytic variations and errors intrinsic to the assay itself but also variations and errors involved in preanalytic and post analytic steps. Since the assay itself (the analytic step) gets much attention, steps that <b>get</b> <b>less</b> attention by the chain of users, i.e. the preanalytic and the post analytic steps, are often less stringently regulated and generally more prone to errors – e.g. preanalytic steps in medical laboratory assays may contribute to 32–75% of all lab errors.|$|E

Between the end of qualifying and race day, pole position was switched {{to the other side of}} the track without explanation. Senna complained that no longer being on the racing line, his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would <b>get</b> <b>less</b> grip and therefore a slower start compared to Prost who had been moved to the clean side of the grid. The Brazilian's appeal was rejected. At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two; but whilst braking for the first corner, Senna refused to back off and collided with Prost at , clinching the title for the Brazilian. Prost almost retired from the sport, saying [...] "What he did was disgusting. He is a man without value."
