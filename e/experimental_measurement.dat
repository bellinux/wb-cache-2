2500|$|Albert Einstein (1879-1955) in his 1916 paper The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity {{explained}} that gravity {{was due to}} curvature of space-time and removed Newton's assumption that changes propagate instantaneously. This led astronomers to recognize that Newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy in understanding orbits. In relativity theory, orbits follow geodesic trajectories which are usually approximated very well by the Newtonian predictions (except where there are very strong gravity fields and very high speeds) but the differences are measurable. Essentially all the experimental evidence that can distinguish between the theories agrees with relativity theory to within <b>experimental</b> <b>measurement</b> accuracy. The original vindication of general relativity {{is that it was}} able to account for the remaining unexplained amount in precession of Mercury's perihelion first noted by Le Verrier. [...] However, Newton's solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier to use and sufficiently accurate.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{situations}} where prediction of partition coefficients prior to <b>experimental</b> <b>measurement</b> is useful. For example, {{tens of thousands}} of industrially manufactured chemicals are in common use, but only a small fraction have undergone rigorous toxicological evaluation. [...] Hence {{there is a need to}} prioritize the remainder for testing. [...] QSAR equations which in turn are based on calculated partition coefficients can be used to provide toxicity estimates. Calculated partition coefficients are also widely used in drug discovery to optimize screening libraries and to predict druglikeness of designed drug candidates before they are synthesized. As discussed in more detail below, estimates of partition coefficients can be made using a variety of methods including fragment-based, atom-based, and knowledge-based that rely solely on knowledge of the structure of the chemical. [...] Other prediction methods rely on other experimental measurements such as solubility. The methods also differ in accuracy and whether they can be applied to all molecules, or only ones similar to molecules already studied.|$|E

The models used the hidden non-linear relationship between the <b>experimental</b> <b>measurements</b> and the target values to train the models.
