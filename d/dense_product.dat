40|$|The {{synthesis}} of ZrB 2 from elemental reactants via reactive spark plasma sintering (SPS) process is markedly {{affected by the}} heating rate conditions adopted. Specifically, when the temperature during SPS is increased at 500 °C/min or faster, the synthesis reaction proceeds under the combustion regime.

Although the route involving the combustion synthesis event permits the obtainment of pure <b>dense</b> <b>products</b> at relatively milder conditions, the gradual evolution of the synthesis reaction is preferable. Indeed, the inconveniences encountered during the process (gas pressure increase, powder expulsion, product inhomogeneity, abrupt sample displacement, die/punches breakage) make its practical exploitation difficult.

Here, we perform a weakly nonlinear analysis for an established model of the system with simple kinetics, and show that the resulting amplitude equation is analogous to that obtained in convection with insulating walls. We show that the amplitude description predicts that dominant pattern wavenumbers should decrease in the long term, but does not reproduce the aforementioned increasing wavenumber behavior {{in the initial stages}} of pattern development.
