However, composite structures are very susceptible to failure and thus strain monitoring in multiple locations throughout the structure will {{be essential to}} prevent catastrophic failure. In this experiment, composite hydrofoil was manufactured using resin transfer moulding (RTM) and embedded with a standard single mode optical fibre along the trailing and leading edges for distributed strain sensing. Distributed sensing with continuous fibre can be implemented in complex composite structures such as a <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> <b>composite</b> hydrofoil or propeller for structural monitoring purposes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polymer matrix {{composites}} (PMCs) {{are used}} extensively in industry, varying from <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> structural <b>composites</b> {{used in the}} aerospace industry, to products such as insulation boards used in the construction industry. At either end of this spectrum, the matrix could be regarded {{to have a different}} functionality. In <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> <b>composites,</b> the polymer forms a continuous phase around the reinforcement, whereas, in products such as particle boards, the matrix may no longer be continuous. Therefore, PMCs could be considered to be divided into continuous polymer matrix composites (CPMCs) and polymer consolidated composites (PCCs), the latter referring to where commonly the matrix might be regarded as simply a binder. Although the field of PMCs is well established, this has commonly not been extended to PCCs. This paper evaluates recent literature on materials used in PCCs, the factors that influence their behavior and how they can be defined as a subset of PMCs.
