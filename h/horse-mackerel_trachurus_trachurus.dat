40|$|Málaga Bay is an {{important}} area from the icthyoplankton viewpoint where {{it is possible to}} find more than 80 species belonging to 68 genera and 41 families. Furthermore, the bay is an essential spawning and nursery area for many species of commercial interest, such as sardine (Sardina pilchardus), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), Atlantic <b>horse-mackerel</b> (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>trachurus),</b> Mediterranean horse-mackerel (T. mediterraneus) or hake (Merluccius merluccius). Local bottom trawl, purse seine and polyvalent artisanal fleets, have traditionally fished in this bay targeting on many species of fishes, crustaceans and molluscs. An ecological and fisheries study was undertaken in 2013 and 2014 with the purpose of assessing the suitability of Málaga Bay as a Fishery Protected Area. One of the important aspects taken into account is the spatial distribution of the fishing effort to evaluate its impact in the area. The findings achieved in this study are essential and valuable information for a proper fisheries management integrating the ecosystem-based approach into fisheries advice. The results show that Málaga Bay supports a heavy fishing pressure in all the fishing grounds which may affect both its commercial resources and sedimentary habitats. Versión del edito...|$|E

During a cruise in November 2003 along the entire Mediterranean coast of Spain, individuals were collected of the following pelagic species: Sardina pilchardus, Sardinella aurita, Engraulis encrasico-lus, <b>Trachurus</b> <b>trachurus,</b> <b>Trachurus</b> mediterraneus, Scomber scombrus and Scomber colias.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure {{selected}} metal concentrations in <b>Trachurus</b> <b>trachurus,</b> <b>Trachurus</b> picturatus, and <b>Trachurus</b> mediterraneus, which are widely consumed in Spain. Principal component analysis suggested that the variable Cr was the main responsible variable for the identification of T. <b>trachurus,</b> the variables As and Sn for T. mediterraneus, and the rest of variables for T. picturatus. This well-defined discrimination between fish species provided by mineral element allows us to distinguish them on the basis of their metal content. Based on the samples collected, and recognizing the inferential limitation of the sample size of this study, the metal concentrations found are below the proposed limit values for human consumption. However, it should be taken into consideration that there are other dietary sources of these metals. In conclusion, metal contents in the fish species analyzed are acceptable for human consumption from a nutritional and toxicity point of view...|$|R
