5|$|After leaving school, Smith studied {{drama and}} {{creative}} {{writing at the}} University of East Anglia, graduating in 2005.

His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On the Shore of the Wide World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E

5|$|Bacall's {{first film}} {{appearance}} was with Humphrey Bogart in the 1944 film To Have and Have Not. The following year she married Bogart {{and went on}} to appear with him in The Big Sleep (1946), Dark Passage (1947), and Key Largo (1948). She also starred in comedies such as How to Marry a Millionaire in 1953 with Marilyn Monroe, Designing Woman in 1957 with Gregory Peck, and Sex and the Single Girl in 1964 with Natalie Wood. Bacall also appeared <b>in</b> <b>Murder</b> on the Orient Express (1976) and The Shootist (1976).|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} <b>in</b> <b>Murder</b> on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. <b>In</b> <b>Murder</b> on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations {{of the laws of}} war, as civilians were caught in the ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged <b>in</b> <b>murder</b> and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E
5|$|He was {{subsequently}} arrested and prosecuted {{on charges of}} creating mass disturbances, incitement of ethnic hatred, and complicity <b>in</b> <b>murder.</b> Following a trial protested by several international human rights groups for irregularities—including alleged torture and the courtroom intimidation of witnesses by police—Askarov was given a life sentence, which he is currently serving. In November 2010, Askarov's health {{was reported to be}} rapidly deteriorating {{as a result of his}} confinement. Numerous groups have advocated on his behalf, including Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, People In Need, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Amnesty International, the latter of which designated him a prisoner of conscience.|$|E
5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas <b>in</b> <b>Murder</b> on the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E

5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy <b>in</b> <b>murder</b> cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{settings}} for Christie's books were directly {{inspired by the}} many archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them. One such site featured in her work is the temple site of Abu Simbel, depicted in Death on the Nile. Also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site <b>in</b> <b>Murder</b> in Mesopotamia. Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artifacts. Most notable are the characters of Dr. Eric Leidner <b>in</b> <b>Murder</b> in Mesopotamia and Signor Richetti in Death on the Nile, while many minor characters were archaeologists in They Came to Baghdad.|$|E
