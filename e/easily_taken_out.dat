60|$|This {{branch of}} trade, being so long principally {{managed by the}} Company's {{servants}} for the Company and under its authority, cannot be <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of their hands and pass to the natives, especially when {{it is to be}} carried on without the control naturally inherent in all participation. It is not difficult to conceive how this forced preference of traffic in a raw commodity must have injured the manufactures, while it was the policy of the Company to continue the trade on their own account. The servants, so far from deviating from their course, since they have taken the trade into their own management, have gone much further into it. The proportion of raw silk in the investment is to be augmented. The proportion of the whole cargoes for the year 1783, divided into sixteen parts, is ten of raw silk, and six only of manufactured goods. Such is the proportion of this losing article in the scheme for the investment of private fortunes.|$|E

The time had been when they could have found enough in the conjectural fortunes and characters of their fellow-passengers to occupy them. This phase of their youth had lasted long, and the world was still full of novelty and interest for them; but it required all the charm of the dining-car now to lay the anxieties that beset them. It was so potent for the moment, however, that they could take an objective view at their sitting cozily down there together, {{as if they had}} only themselves in the world. They wondered what the children were doing, the children who possessed them so intensely when present, and now, by a fantastic operation of absence, seemed almost non-existents. They tried to be homesick for them, but failed; they recognized with comfortable self-abhorrence that this was terrible, but owned a fascination in being alone; at the same time, they could not imagine how people felt who never had any children. They contrasted the luxury of dining that way, with every advantage except a band of music, and the old way of rushing out to snatch a fearful joy at the lunch-counters of the Worcesier and Springfield and New Haven stations. They had not gone often to New York since their wedding journey, but they had gone often enough to have noted the change from the lunch-counter to the lunch-basket brought in the train, from which you could subsist with more ease and dignity, but seemed destined to a superabundance of pickles, whatever you ordered.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor Thesis {{is part of}} the Bachelor Computer Science and Engineering {{program at}} Delft University of Technology. During this project the team had to create an {{extension}} to an existing game framework. This extension consisted of improved artificial intelligence for the antagonist and a maze generator that could be re-used as a library. The original framework consisted of a game that was implemented in Unity. The game featured a bug that had to traverse several mazes that were interconnected by portals. These portals would allow it to travel between mazes. The mazes also featured an antagonist that will pursue the player and attempt to kill it. The intention of the game is to be challenging and difficult, and allow the framework to easily modify the difficulty settings. The game has an atmosphere that resembles a horror game and should be scary to a certain extent. The implementation of the artificial intelligence was done with Rain AI, a freely distributed library that is used in combination with Unity. This library allows for the creation and modification of the behaviour of the antagonist through use of a behaviour tree. This behaviour tree allows the antagonist to react differently depending on its state. The implementation of the maze generator was created separately from the main framework. This allows for it to be <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> as a whole, thus effectively acting as a library. It depends on various parameters to generate maze data, which the framework can provide. The framework can also specify a specific difficulty, making the maze generator use default parameters for that difficulty. The maze data is converted to actual Unity 3 D objects in the framework. In order to provide the parameters for the antagonist AI and the maze generator, a player-observer was made. This observer tracks the decisions made by the player and utilises this to generate statistics regarding the player. These are then converted to parameters that are used by the antagonist and the maze generator. This conversion depends on the difficulty settings set for the player. In addition there have been improvements to the graphical design and gameplay. The gameplay now features more items that can be used by the player as well as improved graphics and the usage of sound.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the process of}} developing a new package for food-related liquids. The assignment is done on behalf of the design and branding agency Motherland and is a Bachelor of Science degree in Innovation and Design at Karlstad University. The client wants to find a new design for packaging where the end product is similar to the Bag-in- box concept. The Bag-in-box concept is good in many ways, with its block-shaped design almost pallet optimised, it has a simple construction, less environmental impact than glass, aluminum and PET bottles and less expensive to produce. In spite of its popularity in Sweden and well {{as the rest of the}} world, the pre-study shows that there are many users who think that the concept has its flaws. Common users claim the package does not reflect the contents and is difficult to empty and disassemble. The package can only be used standing at the edge of the table. The goal of this product development project is to apply the designprocess to find one or more prototypes with new design which meets the demands of the consumers. The project is limited to finding a new solution on the outer packaging and do not take into account the dosing function. The product must be suited for storage and transport to meet the requirements of sustainable development. The feasibility study gave insight and knowledge of the output concept, the facts surrounding a number of food related liquids, information about effective tools for idea development, sustainable development and the approach to manufacture an environmentally friendly packaging. Facts gathered through literature studies, study, survey, form studies, component analysis and visits knowledgeable in relevant areas. The study resulted in a specification that was used as a guide in the product development process. The project resulted in two prototypes with the same engineering design and volume but with different dimensions on height and width. They have a new design and a new mindset when it comes drain but have the same final function as the starting product, to protect the fluid, contain fluid, moving liquids, and dosing liquid. They have an opening and resealable lid that allows the user to control the content and facilitates proper recycling. It enables the packaging to be <b>easily</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> and thus simplify the emptying of all content. Sketching and modeling has been of great help in the work and its results.  Denna rapport beskriver ett examensarbete där två prototyper på ytterförpackning för livsmedelsrelaterade vätskor är slutresultatet.

Replacing him was long time K-1 fan favorite Gary Goodridge. In the first match of the Eliminations, the future of K-1 collided in the form of Ruslan Karaev and Badr Hari. Many were eagerly anticipating this fight as it represented the true battle between opposites; the squeaky clean Karaev and the loud mouth Hari. The fight ended quickly and in controversy as Karaev knocked Hari down quickly and then accidentally kneed him in the face with what looked like a [...] "illegal" [...] knee. Hari refused to get up to meet the count and was thus given the lost. Hari screamed about the decision and even stated [...] "he would never fight in K-1 again".
