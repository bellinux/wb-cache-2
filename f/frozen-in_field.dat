40|$|From the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>field</b> lines concept, {{a highly}} {{conducting}} fluid can move freely along, but not traverse to, magnetic field lines. We discuss this topic {{and find that}} {{in the study of}} the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>field</b> lines concept, the effects of inductive and capacitive reactance have been omitted. When admitted, the relationships among the motional electromotive field, the induced electric field, the eddy electric current, and the magnetic field becomes clearer and the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>field</b> line concept can be reconsidered. We emphasize the importance of isomagnetic surfaces and polarization charges, and show analytically that whether a conducting fluid can freely traverse magnetic field lines or not depends solely on the magnetic gradient in the direction of fluid motion. If a fluid does not change its density distribution and shape (can be regarded as a quasi-rigid body), and as long as it is moving along an isomagnetic surface, it can freely traverse magnetic field lines without any magnetic resistance no matter how strong the magnetic field is. When our analysis is applied, the origin of the magnetic field of sunspots can be interpreted easily. In addition, we also present experimental results to support our analysis.

40|$|The PDE's of {{classical}} electromagnetism {{can be generated}} from two exterior differential systems that distinguish topologically the field intensities and potentials, F-dA= 0, from the field excitations and the charge current densities, J-dG = 0. The existence of potentials, A, leads to the independent 3 -forms of T-Torsion = A^F and T-Spin = A^G. The exterior derivatives (divergences) of these 3 -forms produce anomalies that define the two classic Poincare invariants. The closed integrals of these forms, when deformation invariants of <b>frozen-in</b> <b>fields,</b> define topological coherent structures in the plasma. Solutions when T-Torsion (T-Spin) is zero define transverse magnetic (electric) modes on topological grounds. When the divergence of T-Torsion is not zero there exists a classical mechanism for charge acceleration along the magnetic field lines producing symplectic plasma currents; large temperature gradients along the B field lines {{can act as a}} source of stellar plasma jets in neutron stars. In such circumstances, the Torsion vector is uniquely defined by conformal invariance of the Action potentials.

40|$|Abstract. The {{notion of}} <b>frozen-in</b> {{magnetic}} <b>field</b> originates from H. Alfvén, {{the result of}} a work on electromagnetichydrodynamic waves published in 1942. After that, the notion of <b>frozen-in</b> magnetic <b>field,</b> or ideal MHD, has become widely used in space plasma physics. The controversy on the applicability of ideal MHD started in the late 1950 s and has continued ever since. The applicability of ideal MHD is particularly interesting in regions where solar wind plasma may cross the magnetopause and access the magnetosphere. It is generally assumed that a macroscopic system can be described by ideal MHD provided that the violations of ideal MHD are sufficiently small-sized near magnetic x-points (magnetic reconnection). On the other hand, localized departure from ideal MHD also enables other processes to take place, such that plasma may cross the separatrix and acces...|$|R

30|$|Inherent in the {{previous}} studies on magnetic flux transport by BBFs and DFs {{is the assumption that}} magnetic flux is carried by plasma flow. This implies the validity of the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>field</b> line condition (FIC) in these structures. In this work, we examine several cases of DFs for the validity of FIC. These cases were based on observations from THEMIS (time history of events and macroscale interactions during substorms) (Angelopoulos 2008). The result shows that the FIC does not hold in most cases. Therefore, whether DFs can be related to magnetic flux transport needs to be investigated carefully. Furthermore, it is estimated that the magnetic flux transport for cases when the FIC holds is insignificant in comparison with what is needed to account for the magnetic flux increase during substorm dipolarization.|$|E

Appropriate linear combinations of the electron and ion fluid equations give a magnetohydrodynamic vorticity transport equation and an induction equation with a nonlinear Hall term.

This interpretation determines the brightness temperature, and hence the energy of the radiating electrons, implying a surprisingly large magnetic field. Attempts to avoid this conclusion by interpreting the spectrum as the result of inverse bremsstrahlung absorption do not lead to significantly lower fields.

The most important lesson from the quantum fluid is the scenario that reconnection is controlled by the physics of topological defects on the microscopic scale, and by the physics of turbulence on the macroscopic scale.

Compression pulse with southward field after short propagation interacts with dipole and creates well defined magnetosphere. Comparison of magnetospheres created by laser-produced plasma expanding in vacuum field and in magnetized background revealed fundamental differences in structure and behavior of electric potential in plasma.

Lui (2016 a) investigates the amount of magnetic flux transport associated with DFs by examining the <b>frozen-in</b> <b>field</b> line condition (FIC) for previously reported 18 DF events. The accumulated magnetic flux transport is only ~ 0.1 – 2.2  % of what is needed to account for magnetic flux increase in the near-Earth dipolarization during sub-storms, which casts doubt on the idea that DFs play a significant role in sub-storm dipolarization. Lui (2016 b) examines the similarities and differences between the concepts of current disruption (CD) and magnetic reconnection (MR) involved in the energy transfer. From the similarities and differences, Lui concludes that CD can be viewed as a form of generalized MR (GMR) in which the requirement for a specific magnetic field geometry and its constraint on the plasma flow pattern are removed. Therefore, the CD concept has a broader scope in applications than MR concept alone.|$|E
