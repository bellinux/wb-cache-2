2500|$|Portugal places its southernmost Exclusive Economic Zone claim {{south of}} the Savage Islands. Spain objects {{on the basis that}} the Savage Islands do not have a {{separate}} continental shelf, maintaining that the border should consist on an <b>equidistant</b> <b>line</b> drawn halfway between Madeira and the Canaries. According to article 121 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: [...] "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf." [...] The status of the Savage Islands as islands or rocks is thus {{at the core of the}} dispute. Despite the islands having numerous visitors, mostly for scientific purposes, and the fact that several settlements were tried throughout the centuries, today the Savage Islands are a special natural reserve whose only year-round inhabitants are the wardens of Madeira's Natural Park. Over the years, apart from the EEZ debate, a number of issues pertaining to the Savage Islands led to disputes between the two countries, namely the construction of a lighthouse, the administration of airspace (done from the closer Canary Islands), the right to perform military air exercises, and, most importantly, illegal fishing and poaching in the archipelago and its vicinity.|$|E

50|$|The {{treaty was}} signed in Tunis on 20 August 1971. The text of the treaty sets out a complex {{boundary}} in the Strait of Sicily representing a modified <b>equidistant</b> <b>line</b> between Sicily and Tunisia. The boundary terminates just short of an <b>equidistant</b> <b>line</b> between Malta and the Italian Pelagie Islands. The treaty created a 13-nautical-mile (radial distance) semi-enclave around the Italian island of Pantelleria. Another semi-exclave was created comprising overlapping 13-nautical-mile arcs around the Italian islands of Linosa and Lampedusa that also intersect a 12 nmi km zone around Lampione. Both semi-enclaves intersect Italian waters at the <b>equidistant</b> <b>line</b> but are otherwise surrounded by Tunisian waters. The westernmost point of the boundary line forms a maritime tripoint with Algeria.|$|E

40|$|For {{accurate}} {{determination of}} thickness-profile in vessel quantification, {{it is important}} to find appropriate vessel crosssections. To obtain vessel cross-sections, a centerline-based approach has been widely used, but it has several inherent problems causing improper cross-sections. First, this approach cannot define cross-sections in a unique way. Second, cross-sections are sensitive to the degree of smoothness of a detected vessel centerline. Third, a small variation in a centerline causes a considerable change in the resultant cross-sections and this phenomenon brings about improper crosssections in the abnormal vessel of asymmetric structure. Finally, wrong cross-sections may be detected due to the intersection with the other cross-sections in a region of high curvature. In this paper, instead of a centerline, we propose and adopt a complementary geodesic distance field. Then, we detect a sequence of <b>equidistant</b> <b>lines</b> by using the proposed distance field. Finally, we determine cross-sections by refining the obtained <b>equidistant</b> <b>lines.</b> Due to the prospective properties of the proposed distance field, we can alleviate all of the conventional problems and obtain the cross-sections more proper for vessel quantification. Through the intensive simulation using various 2 -D synthesized images, we prove that the proposed method provides non-intersecting cross-sections which are insensitive to local variation of geometrical shapes in abnormal vessels...|$|R
