5|$|The usual {{magnetostrictive}} {{materials used}} for the transducer are either ferrite or compressed powdered iron. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be {{used for the}} input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit.</b> The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye 007 closely {{follows the}} plot of the movie, though with some minor alterations. The game starts in Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 has {{uncovered}} a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane. Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia, where programmers Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work. Two years after the Severnaya mission, in 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.|$|E

40|$|Extract] This hook is an {{introduction}} to advanced <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> and modern electronics. The main reason for writing this book is to assist students in learning the basic concepts of advanced <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> and modern electronics {{and to do it}} in such a way that students can continue to learn additional <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> and electronics on their own. Although the field of <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> and electronics is changing, the fundamental laws describing the operation of <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> and electronic devices and the methods of analysis used to understand <b>electrical</b> and electronic <b>circuits,</b> change slowly, if at all. The purpose of this book is to prepare students to be able to read the current literature in the field of <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> and electronics and to be able to learn more <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> and electronics on their own. The goal of teaching students how to learn on their own is. after all, what higher education is all about...|$|R
5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance analogy. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit,</b> making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the mobility analogy, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit.</b> The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E

Then {{the three types}} of <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> were applied for the detection of Cu 2 +.

5|$|The main {{driver of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is the planet's rotation. In this respect Jupiter {{is similar to}} a device called a Unipolar generator. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points {{in the direction of the}} rotation, the Lorentz force, which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator. As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> is closed through it. A current called the direct current flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or Birkeland currents. The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E

25|$|Most {{algorithms}} {{are intended}} to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect looking for food), in an <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit,</b> or in a mechanical device.|$|E
30|$|Mechanical {{exfoliation}} of graphite on the pre-patterned electrodes is {{a popular}} method to fabricate high-quality graphene sheet-based <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits.</b> The extremely low throughput and lack of position precision severely limit the controllable fabrication of graphene sheet-based <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> [5]. Reduction of graphene oxide provides an alternative method to produce large quantities of reduced graphene oxide sheets (RGOS) [6]. The ease of material processing, low cost of synthesis, and mechanical flexibility make RGOS become a perfect candidate for the fabrication of <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits.</b> In addition, RGOS exhibit a highly sensitive response to the outer environment. Thus, it is meaningful to explore the electrical properties of the RGOS for application. The RGOS was prepared by chemical reduction of graphene oxide sheets (GOS). Graphene sheets can be randomly deposited on the prefabricated electrodes by drop-coating suspension to fabricate graphene sheet-based <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits.</b> However, this method is not suitable for controllable fabrication of <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits.</b> Thus, directed assembly of graphene sheets at predetermined locations is required.|$|R

25|$|Another newer technology, {{thin-film}} PV, {{are manufactured}} by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum.

After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.|$|E
25|$|Diodes {{will prevent}} {{currents}} in unintended directions. To supply power to an <b>electrical</b> <b>circuit</b> during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a battery. An {{uninterruptible power supply}} may use diodes in this {{way to ensure that}} current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.|$|E

ABSTRACT: The subject of this thesis is solving problem from the domain of <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits.</b> Because the theory of <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> itself is a broad subject, this thesis is going to focus only on a small subcategory, mainly <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits,</b> where the power sources supply the current and voltage either at a constant direct flow or with a harmonic waveform. Furthermore these circuits will be discussed only in their stabilized state. This may seem as a gross simplification of the subject, but majority of electronic devices works with direct or harmonic power supply. The goal set for this thesis is to define relationships {{for the design of}} selected <b>electrical</b> <b>circuits</b> derived from the much broader theory of electromagnetic field. Various methodologies and procedures for the design of electronic ci- rcuits exist, that are based on these relationships. These methods will be illustrated on solved examples. Aside from the physical characterization of circuits a mathematical apparatus will be needed to solve equations and sys- tem of equations, derived from the physical relationships...|$|R
