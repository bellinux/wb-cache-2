5|$|Frank Stilwell had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> in Bisbee {{with his}} livery stable partner, Pete Spence, {{when the two}} were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the {{preliminary}} hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence {{just as he had}} done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.|$|E
5|$|Kean saw the North Korean {{breakthrough}} at Haman as {{a serious}} threat to his division's line. At dawn on September 1, Kean requested permission from Walker to commit the entire 27th Infantry Regiment, <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> at Masan the previous evening and still held in Eighth Army reserve. Walker denied this request, but did release one battalion of the regiment to Kean's control.|$|E

That same year, the French magazine Paris Match commissioned him to produce a short comic documenting the Apollo 12 landings.|$|E
5|$|News reports {{recalled}} {{court held}} {{that day in the}} southern district, where 195 charges of riot and 17 charges of drunkenness were resolved.. That night the city was quiet. A telegram was dispatched from Adjutant General Edward D. Townsend to General Hancock, who had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> in the city earlier that day. He was directed to move his men to Pittsburgh, where riots were ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Percival's widow, Constance Lowell, {{entered into}} a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, {{and the search for}} Planet X did not resume until 1929. Vesto Melvin Slipher, the {{observatory}} director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.|$|E

5|$|Willis/Dupre feigns death, {{and when}} Phillips drops her wedding ring on him, {{he grabs her}} gun and kills her. He dies seconds later {{due to the lack}} of insulin. Mulder, who has <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> on the scene, {{releases}} Scully. Later Scully retrieves Willis' possessions from the morgue, including a watch she gave him for his thirty-fifth birthday. The watch stopped at 6:47, the moment Willis died after the bank shooting.|$|E
5|$|Foster and Eddy {{finally arrived}} at Truckee Lake on March 14, {{where they found}} their {{children}} dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> at the Murphy cabin, and she could have walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{wanted to}} give command of Fort Donelson to Beauregard, who had {{performed}} ably at Bull Run, but the latter declined because of a throat ailment. Instead, the responsibility went to Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd, who had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> following an unsuccessful assignment under Robert E. Lee in western Virginia. Floyd was a wanted man in the North for alleged graft and secessionist activities when he was Secretary of War in the James Buchanan administration. Floyd's background was political, not military, but he was nevertheless the senior brigadier general on the Cumberland River.|$|E

5|$|On 4 April, the Bosnian Croat TO {{captured}} Gornji Malovan. At {{the same}} time, the Bosnian Croat TO received reinforcements from Posušje, {{as well as}} a company from Bugojno and Uskoplje each. Fighting intensified as the JNA reinforcements arrived. A part of the Croatian reinforcements, which had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> from Bugojno and Uskoplje, fled after coming under attack near Zlosela. However, the JNA failed to achieve a breakthrough—even with five attack helicopters deployed in support of its advance towards Zlosela and Kupreška Vrata at 1:30 p.m.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{learned from}} {{questioning}} the prisoners that a French and Indian war party had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> at Carillon, {{and that the}} two forts were garrisoned by a thousand regulars. Concerned that the escaped sleds would raise the alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved of the return by the same route (a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines), but he overruled them, citing the need for speed and the deep snow. By early afternoon they had returned to their camp, rested, and {{were on their way}} south.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{then led}} {{many of the}} {{remaining}} smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold's Bay 2 miles south of Buttonmold Bay, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow. These boats were then run aground, stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship Congress. The surviving ships' crews, numbering about 200, then made their way overland to Crown Point, narrowly escaping an Indian ambush. There they found Trumbull, New York, Enterprise, and Revenge, all of which had escaped the British fleet, as well as Liberty, which had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> with supplies from Ticonderoga.|$|E

"We are a {{party of}} Maritzburg Scouts," [...] Chris said, with a smile at their {{astonished}} faces; [...] "though, as you see, we are got up as Boers {{so as to be}} able to get close to them without exciting suspicion.

5|$|The Byzantines {{tried to}} take {{advantage}} of the revolt, and began assembling forces at Messina and Reggio, while a fleet was dispatched from Constantinople. Abu'l-Abbas, however, did not tarry and as soon as he had suppressed the rebellion, marched against the Byzantines, ravaging the environs of Taormina and launching an unsuccessful siege of Catania before returning to winter in Palermo. In the next spring, he resumed his attack and assaulted Demona. To disrupt the Byzantine preparations, his forces then crossed over to the mainland. Reggio was captured on 10 July, and was subjected to a savage sack; a vast booty was collected, over 15,000 of its inhabitants were carted off as slaves, and the jizya imposed on the remainder. On his return to Sicily, Abu'l-Abbas came across a Byzantine fleet that had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> from Constantinople and thoroughly defeated it, capturing thirty of its vessels.|$|E
5|$|The sinking smack was {{abandoned}} by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered {{that he should be}} thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him and left him where he lay. He died in his son's arms a few minutes later. It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him. The Ethel & Millie had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> on the scene as the Nelson sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for Nelson's lifeboat to come alongside. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink.|$|E
5|$|Believing it {{was useless}} to {{continue}} arguing with Cao, Vann climbed back into his L-19 reconnaissance aircraft and left Tan Hiep. Throughout the afternoon, he continued to press Cao to quickly deploy the South Vietnamese paratroopers. He was fearful that the battle {{would turn out to}} be the largest defeat of South Vietnamese forces up to that point of the war. Cao promised to deploy the second Civil Guard battalion which had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> at the southwest flank of Ap Bac, and to drop the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion at around 16:00 behind Ba's armored personnel carriers. Late in the afternoon, a flight of C-123 Providers, with about 300 South Vietnamese paratroopers aboard, closed in on their objective and quickly drew machine gun fire from the hamlet. The C-123 pilots changed course to avoid the ground fire, but either the South Vietnamese jump master or the American flight leader did not compensate for the change. As a result, the paratroopers landed right in front of the entrenched Viet Cong positions, instead of behind the 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron and the Civil Guards.|$|E
60|$|The {{village was}} lost, and the {{defenders}} were falling back in disorder upon D'Andelot; who, with his division, was <b>just</b> <b>arriving</b> to their assistance. For a moment, the fugitive horse and foot broke up his ranks. But he rallied his men and, advancing, drove the Catholics {{out of the}} village and retook the abbey.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have several}} letters for you,' said Ferdinand, {{interrupting}} him, and trembling {{from head to}} foot lest he might say Miss Grandison. 'Do you know you are just the person I wanted to see? How fortunate that you should <b>just</b> <b>arrive!</b> I was annoyed to find you were away. I cannot tell you how much I was annoyed!' ...|$|R
60|$|The man bowed himself away, with a twenty-franc {{piece in}} the palm of his hand. The {{orchestra}} began a gay two-step. Macheson, starting up, passed his arm round the waist of a little fair-haired Parisienne <b>just</b> <b>arriving.</b> She threw her gold satchel on to a table, and they danced round the room. Davenant watched them with unwilling admiration.|$|R
5|$|Cannery Row {{is set in}} Monterey, California, before World War II. In Sweet Thursday, Doc {{returns from}} the war to find Cannery Row almost deserted {{and many of his}} {{colorful}} friends gone. Even his close friend Dora, who ran the Bear Flag Restaurant, a whorehouse, has died, and her sister Fauna has taken her place as madam. A former social worker, Fauna teaches the girls how to set a table properly, hopeful they will marry wealthy men. Doc's friends Mack (Mac in Pipe Dream) and Hazel (both men) are still around. They decide Doc's discontent is due to loneliness, and try to get him together with Suzy, a prostitute who has <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> in Monterey. The two have a brief romance; disgusted by her life as a hooker, Suzy leaves the bawdy house and moves into an abandoned boiler. She decides she cannot stay with Doc, but tells her friends that if Doc fell ill, she would care for him. The accommodating Hazel promptly breaks Doc's arm as he sleeps, bringing the two lovers back together. At the end, Doc and Suzy go off to La Jolla to collect marine specimens together.|$|E
5|$|From Methone, {{the fleet}} sailed up the Ionian Sea to Zacynthus, {{from where they}} crossed over to Italy. The {{crossing}} took longer than expected {{due to lack of}} wind, and the army suffered of lack of fresh water when the supplies they had brought aboard went bad. Eventually, the fleet reached Catania in Sicily, from where Belisarius sent Procopius ahead to Syracuse to gather intelligence on the Vandals' activities. By chance, Procopius met a merchant friend of his there, whose servant had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> from Carthage. The latter informed Procopius that not only were the Vandals unaware of Belisarius' sailing, but that Gelimer, who had just dispatched Tzazon's expedition to Sardinia, was away from Carthage at the small inland town of Hermione. Procopius quickly informed Belisarius, who immediately ordered the army to re-embark and set sail for the African coast. After sailing by Malta, they reached Cape Caputvada on the eastern shore of modern Tunisia some 162 Roman miles (240km) south from Carthage.|$|E
5|$|In Arnhem {{at around}} 03:30, the leading units of 11 Para reached 1st Parachute Brigade and the 2nd South Staffords, {{just as they}} started a new attempt to fight through to the bridge. As the {{battalion}} had <b>just</b> <b>arrived</b> and had no appreciation of the ground, it was held in reserve and played no part in the attack. By dawn and under intense fire, the attack faltered and 11 Para were ordered {{to carry out a}} left flanking attack to relieve the pressure on the South Staffords. Only the intervention of Major-General Urquhart, just freed from where he had been trapped, stopped the 11 Para assault. Having recognised the futility of the battle Urquhart was not prepared to reinforce failure. At 11:00 the Major-General ordered 11 Para still in the outskirts of Arnhem to support the advance of 4th Parachute Brigade by occupying the high ground on the north-west outskirts of Arnhem. At 14:30 the battalion was caught in the open and subjected to a mortar attack. The attacked caused heavy casualties including the commanding officer lieutenant-Colonel George Lea, unable to proceed around 150 of the survivors were forced to withdraw towards Oosterbeek.|$|E
60|$|They came {{in sight}} of the church beyond the Jordan, and, to their great joy, beheld the hermit <b>just</b> <b>arriving</b> at the door. They could hear him calling the nuns around him, and saw them settle {{themselves}} under a tree, with the hermit in their midst--all but one, who remained on guard, as was the custom.|$|R

5000|$|As amen is recited as an {{affirmation}} of what a blessing has just asserted, one who is unaware of which blessing was just recited can certainly not affirm its assertion with true conviction. Therefore, if someone <b>just</b> <b>arrives</b> in a place and hears others reciting amen to an unknown blessing, {{he or she may}} not respond amen together with them.|$|R
