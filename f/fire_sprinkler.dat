5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|Indium wire {{is used as}} {{a vacuum}} seal and a thermal {{conductor}} in cryogenics and ultra-high-vacuum applications, in such manufacturing applications as gaskets that deform to fill gaps. Indium is an ingredient in the gallium–indium–tin alloy galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers. Other alloys of indium with bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin, which have higher but still low melting points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems and heat regulators.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire {{broke out}} on the 11th floor of the North Tower. The fire spread through {{the core of the}} {{building}} to the 9th and 14th floors, as the insulation for telephone cables, located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors, had been ignited. Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors, water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had no <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system in high rise buildings.|$|E
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E

25|$|Preliminary {{underwater}} {{inspections of}} the Norman Atlantic {{revealed that the}} water intake pipes of the <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system were clogged with mussels; additional inspections are necessary to determine if this blockage contributed to the fire's spreading. Although the voyage data recorder (black box) has been recovered, still by mid-March no data have been extracted, apparently because {{the heat of the}} fire caused the plastic to melt onto the hard disk. Recordings of the Voyage data recorder published on 7 October 2015, say that the <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system wasn't working correctly and instead of spraying water there was smoke coming from the system. The investigations also state that there was a truck that had the engine working. Smoke was coming from the truck prior to the fire.|$|E

50|$|Automatic {{heat and}} smoke vents are {{required}} by model building codes in large, single-story factory and storage facilities in conjunction with control mode <b>fire</b> <b>sprinklers,</b> but {{are not permitted to}} be installed in conjunction with suppression mode, e.g., ESFR, <b>fire</b> <b>sprinklers</b> unless the vents are manually operated or have an operating mechanism with a thermal rating of not less than 360 °F. due to fear of overwhelming the sprinkler system and destroying the building.|$|R
25|$|A National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{investigation}} of the fire, using computer simulations with FDS and a mock-up of the stage area and dance floor, concluded that a <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system would have contained the fire long enough to give everyone time to exit safely. However, because of the building's age (built in 1946) and size (4,484 square feet (404 m²)), many believed the Station to be exempt from sprinkler system requirements. In fact, the building had undergone an occupancy change when it was converted from a restaurant to a nightclub. This change dissolved its exemption from the law, a fact that West Warwick fire inspectors never noticed. On the night in question, the Station was legally required to have a sprinkler system but did not; outcry over the event has sparked calls for a national <b>Fire</b> <b>Sprinkler</b> Incentive Act but those efforts have so far stalled.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{systems have}} a proven record for controlling and extinguishing unwanted fires. Many fire officials recommend that every building, including residences, have <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems.

50|$|If {{building}} codes do not explicitly mandate {{the use of}} <b>fire</b> <b>sprinklers,</b> the code often makes it highly advantageous to install them as an optional system. Most US {{building codes}} allow for less expensive construction materials, larger floor area limitations, longer egress paths, and fewer requirements for fire rated construction in structures protected by <b>fire</b> <b>sprinklers.</b> Consequently, the total building cost is often less by installing a sprinkler system and savings money in the {{other aspects of the}} project, as compared to building a non-sprinklered structure.|$|R

25|$|While {{there was}} much {{criticism}} {{of the lack of}} <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems, Geoff Wilkinson, the building regulations columnist for the Architects' Journal, wrote on 14 June 2017 that if a gas riser was leaking or the cladding was at fault, sprinklers would have had little effect. He also said that reports of combustible material stored in the common walkways suggested poor overall management. David Siber, an advisor to the Fire Brigades Union, said sprinklers would have prevented the fire, if it started in a kitchen, from ever spreading beyond that room.|$|E
25|$|While the {{exterior}} remains true to the original, {{the interior is}} highly modern. The ship has an electrical system and propellers powered by diesel engines.

Other enhancements include satellite navigation, communications equipment, modern facilities for the crew (kitchen, lavatories, washing machines, desalination equipment, ventilation, refrigerators), watertight bulkheads and fire protection (<b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> systems, fire hydrants etc.). Most of this new technology was necessary to pass national and international safety regulations.|$|E
50|$|Approved Drop out (or drop-out) {{ceilings}} {{allow the}} installation of a dropped ceiling beneath existing <b>fire</b> <b>sprinklers</b> because the tiles, sometimes called melt-out ceiling tiles, are heat sensitive and designed to fall from the dropped ceiling suspension grid {{in the event of}} a <b>fire,</b> allowing the <b>sprinklers</b> to do their job.|$|R

25|$|The fire {{occurred}} at the Sofa Super Store, composed of a 42,000ft² (3,902 m²) single-story steel trussed showroom building with a 17,000ft² (1,579 m²) warehouse building located behind the retail space, located at 1807 Savannah Highway in Charleston. The building had no <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system. The fire started at approximately 7:00p.m. in a covered loading dock area built between the showroom and warehouse buildings which was attached to both buildings. At the time, the business was open and employees were present. Charleston firefighters {{arrived on the scene}} within three minutes of the alarm, followed soon after by firefighters from the St. Andrews Public Service District.|$|E
25|$|As {{officers}} {{searched for}} shooters inside the building, others aided the wounded. Probation officers initially {{set up a}} makeshift triage center near {{the entrance of the}} building, but deemed it to be too close and relocated it across the street by 11:15a.m. Because survivors were soaked from water pouring from the <b>fire</b> <b>sprinkler</b> pipe, they became slippery for officers to hold. Injured victims were carried out by hand, with blankets, and even on chairs, as litters and tactical stretchers were unavailable at the time. An SBPD tactical medic supervised the extraction operation. It took 57 minutes to get the last of the injured to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|Following the fire, the Conservative {{leader of}} the council, Nicholas Paget-Brown said that the Grenfell Tower {{residents}} {{did not have a}} collective view in favour of installing sprinklers during the recent renovations. He also said that if they had been installed, it would have delayed the refurbishment and been more disruptive. ITV business editor Joel Hills stated that he had been told that the installation of sprinklers had not even been discussed. In a 2012 report, the British Automatic <b>Fire</b> <b>Sprinkler</b> Association said that sprinklers could be retrofitted in Grenfell Tower for an average cost of £1,150 per flat, which would have added up to a total cost of £138,000 for the whole block.|$|E
