2500|$|The inverse {{function}} of sine is arcsine (arcsin or asin) or <b>inverse</b> <b>sine</b> (...) [...] As sine is non-injective, {{it is not}} an exact inverse function but a partial inverse function.

2500|$|Indian {{astronomer}} and mathematician Aryabhata (476-550), in his Aryabhatiya (499) {{introduced a}} number of trigonometric functions (including sine, versine, cosine and <b>inverse</b> <b>sine),</b> trigonometric tables, and techniques and algorithms of algebra. In 628 AD, Brahmagupta suggested that gravity was a force of attraction. He also lucidly explained the use of zero as both a placeholder and a decimal digit, along with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system now used universally throughout the world. Arabic translations of the two astronomers' texts were soon available in the Islamic world, introducing what would become Arabic numerals to the Islamic World by the 9th century. [...] During the 14th–16th centuries, the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics made significant advances in astronomy and especially mathematics, including fields such as trigonometry and analysis.

40|$|Randomness in {{crop yields}} can be {{decomposed}} into two broad modeling focuses: {{the estimation of}} the mean or central tendency of the distribution and the dispersion around that central tendency. We propose modeling the central tendency of the distribution with a stochastic trend model and allowing for nonnonnality within the stochastic trend through an <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> distribution. Results are consistent with this construction. First, residuals around the stochastic trend model {{are found to be}} non normal. Second, the <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> modification of the stochastic trend model corrects both skewness and kurtosis of corn yields. Key words: <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine,</b> random trend, transformation of random variables. Distributions of commodity prices and yields are critical components of firm-level decision anal-ysis. Farm planning and sectoral policy models incorporating risk typically require distributions of yields and prices consistent with the period of analysis. In multi-period analysis, interest centers not only on selecting the appropriate probability density function but also on deter-mining its location over time. Deaton and La-roque recently have considered time-series models of commodity prices which attempt to account for price volatility. Here we consider time-series models of yields and attempt to account for their nonnormality. The fact that yields may not be normally dis-tributed in the relevant production range has al-ready been recognized. Day suggested that dis-tributions of field crop yields in the Mississippi delta had negative skewness. Nelson and Preckel found com distributions to be negatively skewed given average fertilizer use, and Gallagher re-ported that soybean yields are negatively skewed. Given the possibility of nonnormality, several modelling approaches have been suggested. Nelson and Preckel considered the conditional beta distribution. Taylor proposed that the hy...|$|R

This paper describes a possible solution to this problem-the <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> transformation-and shows how to implement this transformation optimally {{in the case of}} median regression. As an illustration of the usefulness of this transformation, I revisit a specification sometimes used to estimate the effect of tax incentives on household saving. ...|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{potential}} issue of differing time trends between {{the control and}} treatment groups, the other robustness checks designed to address potential attenuation (Tables  23 and 24) and test the sensitivity of our results to other specification (Tables  25, 26, 27, 28 and 29) show that our results seem to be robust to these issues. Our results are also robust to transforming our variables using the <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine,</b> which approximates the natural logarithm but maps zero to zero (see e.g. Burbidge et al. 1988; MacKinnon and Magee 1990) (results available on request).|$|R
40|$|The {{dependent}} double-hurdle {{model is}} generalized by an <b>inverse</b> hyperbolic <b>sine</b> {{transformation of the}} dependent variable. The resulting specification features a flexible parameterization, accommodates heteroskedastic errors, and nests a range of common limited dependent variable models. Results for U. S. household cheese consumption suggest that the homoskedastic and normal double-hurdle model is misspecified. Income elasticities are small and vary across household groups. Foodstamp recipients are more responsive to income changes than nonrecipients. Foodstamp recipients are also less likely to consume cheese but, conditional on consumption, spend more than nonrecipients. Copyright 1997, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

We will introduce three terms: critical point, domain of dependence and relative error. By comparing the relative errors of the transformed variances of [pi]([lambda]), B(n,p) and NB(r,p), and comparing the skewness and kurtosis of [pi]([lambda]), B(n,p) and NB(r,p) and their transformed variables, we obtain some better transformations with domains of dependence of the parameters. A new kind of transformation for B(n,p) is suggested. ...|$|R
