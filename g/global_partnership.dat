25|$|By 2010, 80 {{small towns}} with 35,000 {{connections}} were served by private operators. Service quality and user satisfaction have improved after the private operators {{took over the}} systems. But according to the Association of Private Water Operators, the contracts are too short to compensate the small, local private operators for their initial efforts in setting up their operations. Due to low tariffs and lack of funding for investments the private operators largely failed to expand the water system to connect the poor. Therefore, in 2005 the International Finance Corporation and the <b>Global</b> <b>Partnership</b> on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) designed a pilot project to provide performance-based subsidies to private operators to expand access to the poor.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, {{the private}} concessionaires in Casablanca, Tangiers and Tetouan, {{as well as}} the public water utility of Meknes began to {{implement}} water supply and sanitation pilot projects on the basis of an innovative output-based aid approach. The objective is to extend water and sewer connections to 11.300 households in poor, unzoned, periurban neighbourhoods. The pilot projects are part of the National Human Development Initiative and are funded through a US$ 7 million grant by the <b>Global</b> <b>Partnership</b> for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) administered by the World Bank. It {{is the first time that}} GPOBA, which promotes primarily the private sector, provided grants to a public water operator. The average subsidy level per connection amounts to USD 169 for water supply and to USD 606 for sanitation. The average subsidy level per connection is 35 percent. Operators also developed awareness raising campaigns to make people aware of the option to connect to sewers through teams that go to market places. Under the output-based aid approach investments are pre-financed by the concessionaires or the public utility that are being reimbursed by GPOBA only after a verification process certifies that the households have been connected and receive an adequate service. According to the World Bank, the output-based aid approach has helped to improve processes, overcome financing obstacles and mobilize stakeholder partnership.|$|E
