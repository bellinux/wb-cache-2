5|$|At the time, the Hollywood {{characters}} Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto {{were popular}} in the Indies, as were imported detective films in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically. This led Jo to make a detective film which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be successful with ethnic Chinese audiences. For this, he approached L.V. Wijnhamer, Jr., an Indo man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for Red Cross aid in war-torn China. Wijnhamer accepted the role.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the {{opportunity}} to play in New York. Although ecstatic, Chrisye was afraid of telling his father, who <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> disapprove of the idea. He eventually fell ill for several months, during which time the rest of the band left for New York. After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother, his father agreed that he could drop out of college to join Gipsy. After his health improved, in mid-1973, he left with Pontjo to meet Gipsy in New York. That same year he dropped out of Trisakti.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began {{running up and down the}} flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E

"He said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{go back to}} New York first," [...] {{said one}} of the stable men, [...] "and then <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go on to Chicago and after that visit some of his old places and cronies in Denver. But, of course, where he really did go to I haven't the least idea." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|The {{backward}} {{condition of}} shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory {{that he would}} have to look abroad to obtain the vessels that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be able to challenge the U.S. Navy. He selected two men as his primary representatives: James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir John Macdonald, {{made plans}} to create a 200-strong mounted police force to {{maintain}} order along the border; such a force, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>would</b> enable the colonisation {{of the region and}} be much cheaper than deploying regular military units for the task. The implementation of this proposal was delayed, however, first by the rebellion of the Métis, and then by the threat of a Fenian invasion. Meanwhile, a survey conducted in 1871 by Lieutenant William Butler recommended establishing a mounted force of up to 150 men under a magistrate or commissioner, based along the northern trade routes, leaving the border area as a liminal, ungarrisoned zone. Colonel Patrick Robertson-Ross conducted another survey in 1872, and recommended an alternate strategy of recruiting a larger force of 550 men who would be tasked to push south into the border region itself and establish law and order there.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by {{labor unions and}} certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who {{were in the middle of}} an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E
5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw {{the potential for}} a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a small print run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice the cost of an average novel– to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E

25|$|Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner {{also had}} some {{complaints}} about the anti-trust issues that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> arise from the proposed legislation since Southwest {{will be able to}} operate from 16 gates, American 2 gates, and Continental 2 gates without further gates available for other carriers.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the conversations}} were {{little more than}} gossip, and they spoke of their contemporaries without restraint. When the conversations were published, some of those contemporaries were outraged. Northcote denied the words were his; and Hazlitt was {{shielded}} from the consequences to a degree by his residing in Paris, where he was at work on what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be his masterpiece.|$|E

25|$|The classes {{continued}} {{and the band}} struggled for time to write together. Charlie noticed an advertisement in CCM Magazine for a talent contest, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be fun to enter—and had no expectations of being chosen to play live months later in Nashville for record companies. Ten finalists were chosen {{from all of the}} demos sent in, and Jars of Clay were elated to be one of them.|$|E

In the episode Protege, she brought her nephew Ian.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, Michigan hired Fritz Crisler as Kipke's successor. Crisler {{had been}} {{head coach of}} the Princeton Tigers and {{reportedly}} wasn't excited to leave Princeton. Michigan invited him to name his price, and Crisler demanded what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be unacceptable: the position of athletic director when Yost stepped down and the highest salary in college football. Michigan accepted, and Crisler became the new {{head coach of the}} Michigan football program.|$|E

25|$|The {{descriptive}} passages mix whimsical, often alliterative {{language with}} phonetically-spelled dialogue {{and a strong}} poetic sensibility ("Agathla, centuries aslumber, shivers in its sleep with splenetic splendor, and spreads abroad a seismic spasm with the supreme suavity of a vagabond volcano."). Herriman was also fond of experimenting with unconventional page layouts in his Sunday strips, including panels of various shapes and sizes, arranged in whatever fashion <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> best tell the story.|$|E
25|$|They marched along Ipswich Road {{reaching}} the Woolloongabba five-ways at 10.30am on 30 November 1915 where the Mayor of South Brisbane, Alderman J Davey and his aldermen greeted them.

25|$|On the {{day after}} the 1964 general election, Smith waited for what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> be a certain phone call to invite him to become a cabinet {{minister}} in Harold Wilson's government. However, Wilson had a vague suspicion of Smith, and Smith's alliance with the more moderate side of the Labour Party meant that no such invitation was made. In early 1965, George Brown appointed Smith as chairman of the Northern Economic Planning Council, on which he served until 1970.|$|E
