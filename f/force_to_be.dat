5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of fighting, the division was based around Aulnoye-Aymeries in France. The division was not chosen {{to be part of}} the British Army of the Rhine, the British occupation <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> based in the Rhineland. Instead, it was demobilised over a period of months. The first 3,000 soldiers were sent home during December, and the division ceased to exist by March 1919. Prior to the division's disbandment, the remaining men were visited by Edward Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII).|$|E
5|$|Coolidge, {{sensing the}} {{severity}} of circumstances were then in need of his intervention, conferred with Crane's operative, William Butler, and then acted. He called up more units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force. Curtis proclaimed {{that all of the}} strikers were fired from their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recruited.|$|E
5|$|Here, Brock met Tecumseh, and was {{immediately}} impressed. Brock also read American dispatches captured from Hull's army. He quickly judged Hull to be timid and afraid of the First Nations in particular, and the American <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> demoralised and short of rations. Against {{the advice of his}} officers, Brock immediately prepared to launch an attack on Detroit.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|Option 3 {{was later}} revised {{to provide for}} the use of USMC {{helicopters}} together with USAF helicopters and C-130 Airborne Mission Command based in Thailand, and for the ground security <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made up of marines rather than air force security police. The LZs were to be adjacent to the US Embassy in Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|Paraguay is a {{landlocked}} country and {{for much of}} its history it was difficult of access, except by sailing from the Atlantic up the River Paraná and hence the River Paraguay (see map) as the early Spanish explorers had done. There were other means of ingress, but they would have required an invading <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resupplied through difficult and hostile country. So the command of the river was key {{to the security of}} Paraguay, who feared and distrusted its two much larger neighbours Brazil and Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Sebille was {{the first}} person in the U.S. Air <b>Force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awarded the Medal of Honor since the branch's {{beginning}} in 1947, and the 31st MOH recipient of the Korea War. The Four U.S. Air Force members including Sebrille who received the medal in that war were pilots who were killed in action. They were the only USAF members to receive the Army version of the medal (the Air Force version was first awarded during the Vietnam War).|$|E
5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as integral to the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines. The mechanical advantage given by a simple machine allowed for less <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.|$|E
5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier <b>Force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces. Under strict secrecy, the PVA entered Korea on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|Appian {{claims that}} Lucullus had {{embarked}} from Rome {{with only a}} single legion; upon entering Anatolia to make war against Mithridates, he added four more legions to his army. The overall size of this force consisted of 30,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry. Following Mithridates' retreat to Armenia, Appian estimates Lucullus' invading <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> only two legions and 500 horsemen, although it is highly improbable {{that he would have}} undertaken the invasion of Armenia with such a small army. Historian Adrian Sherwin-White places the size of Lucullus' force to 12,000 seasoned legionaries (composed of three legions), and 4,000 provincial cavalry and light infantry. The Roman army was further bolstered by several thousand allied Gallic, Thracian, and Bithynian infantry and cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So {{for most of their}} history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E

5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reckoned with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E
5|$|Dobell's Eastern Force {{consisted}} of two infantry divisions, the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division commanded by Major General W. Douglas and the 52nd (Lowland) Division commanded by Major General W. E. B. Smith, {{as well as the}} Anzac Mounted Division, a mounted infantry division commanded by Chauvel, the 5th Mounted Brigade commanded by Brigadier General E. A. Wiggin and the Imperial Camel Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Clement Leslie Smith. Murray considered this <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under strength by at least a division for an advance to Beersheba, but felt he could gain El Arish and form an effective base on the coast, from which further operations eastwards could be supplied.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful <b>force,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E

5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were a <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reckoned with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was a big surprise not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of Hastings' outstanding bravery and leadership the award of the Distinguished Service Order was gazetted on 14 January 1916 for distinguished {{service in the}} field on Gallipoli.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
