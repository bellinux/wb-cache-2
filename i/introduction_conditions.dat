It was {{published}} in the journal, Journal of analytical atomic spectrometry [© RSC Publishing] and is available at: [URL] paper describes the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to the modelling of the performance of a cyclonic spray chamber with flow spoiler designed to provide good efficiency with rapid wash-out time. The modelling is carried out under two flow regimes, one corresponding to typical sample <b>introduction</b> <b>conditions</b> and one to low sample uptake. Velocity distributions, pressure distributions and mass flows are simulated, the latter employing the measured primary aerosol distributions as inputs to the computation. The dynamic performance of chambers is also modelled and the signal profiles produced are shown to correspond to those derived directly from measurement. Six different chambers are studied corresponding to a chamber with no spoiler, a single spoiler in four different positions, and a chamber with 3 spoilers. The position of the spoiler is shown to be critical in determining the flow field in the chamber and hence the efficiency and washout time. It is demonstrated that chamber geometry has maximum impact under low uptake conditions where the limited dispersion primary aerosol can effectively follow the gas flow lines. Computation indicates that a chamber with optimised spoiler, operating under low uptake conditions, provides the best combination of efficiency and response time. This was confirmed by experiment in which the performance of 3 different chambers was compared, with the optimised design providing detection limits 1. 5 – 19 better than those obtained with the chamber supplied with the ICP-AES instrument. A chamber with 3 spoilers indicates the formation of a low-volum...|$|E
40|$|<b>Introduction.</b> <b>Conditions</b> {{in which}} speech therapy {{treatment}} is applied in autistic children {{are often not}} in accordance with characteristics of opinions and learning of people with autism. A systemic multimodal approach means motivating autistic people to develop their language speech skill through the procedure which allows reliving of their personal experience according to the contents that are presented in the their natural social environment. This research was aimed at evaluating the efficiency of speech treatment based on the systemic multimodal approach to the work with autistic children. Material and Methods. The study sample consisted of 34 children, aged from 8 to 16 years, diagnosed to have different autistic disorders, whose results showed a moderate and severe clinical picture of autism on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. The applied instruments {{for the evaluation of}} ability were the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Ganzberg II test. The study subjects were divided into two groups according to the type of treatment: children who were covered by the continuing treatment and systemic multimodal approach in the treatment, and children who were covered by classical speech treatment. Results. It is shown that the systemic multimodal approach in teaching autistic children affects the stimulation of communication, socialization, self-service and work as well as that the progress achieved in these areas of functioning was retainable after long time, too. Conclusion. By applying the systemic multimodal approach when dealing with autistic children and by comparing their achievements on tests applied before, during and after the application of this mode, it has been concluded that certain improvement has been achieved in the functionality within the diagnosed category. The results point to a possible direction in the creation of new methods, plans and programs in dealing with autistic children based on empirical and interactive learning...|$|E

Under commensurate orders hypothesis, it is shown that a direct extension of the second Lyapunov's method is a tedious task. If the fractional order ν is such that 0 < v < 1, the stability domain is not a convex region of the complex plane. However, through a direct stability domain characterization, three LMI stability conditions are proposed. The first one is based on the stability domain deformation and the second one on a characterization of the instability domain (which is convex). The third one is based on generalized LMI <b>introduction.</b> These <b>conditions</b> are applied to the gain margin computation of a CRONE suspension...|$|R
