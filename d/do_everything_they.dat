In 1986 she {{appeared}} in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb's Theatre, in which the actors were given characters and situations by the audience members. In 1988 she {{had a role in}} Julia Sweeney's play Mea's Big Apology at Groundling Theatre in Los Angeles. She played Eunice, a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character. The company people <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> can to dismiss her because {{they do not want to}} pay her retirement benefits, which are about to take effect. Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play, also at Groundling Theatre.|$|E
25|$|News of {{the conference}} leaked and Tory churchmen were shocked that Rochester might have wavered in his faith. Rochester {{requested}} another conference and James consented. Rochester {{let it be known}} to influential Catholics at court that he would <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> requested (except convert) so long as he remained in office. He told them that as a Protestant he would prove more useful to them than as a Catholic. However, on 17 December James called Rochester into an audience and told him that so high an office of Lord Treasurer could not be held by a staunch Anglican under a Catholic monarch. James asked him to think again on his refusal to convert but Rochester would not and on 4 January 1687 he was dismissed. However he received a pension of approximately £4000 per annum and £40,000 and estates from a convicted traitor.|$|E

Although {{they are unable to}} get [...] "Timmy" [...] out, as the well is too small for any adult to fit in, the entire town offers moral support and <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> can to give him hope. Krusty even gets musician Sting to join other celebrities in recording a charity single, [...] "We're Sending Our Love Down the Well". However, Lisa catches Bart in the act and reminds him he put a label with his name on the radio. Bart falls into the well while trying to retrieve it after Eddie and Lou untie his rope. When the townspeople find him, he admits that Timmy O'Toole does not exist. Angry at being tricked, the townspeople leave Bart in the well.|$|E

Eight days were spent on {{mountains}} ranging from [...] In recreating the Hindu Kush mountain range that stretches between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the film crew shot at 10 separate locations in the national forest. Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was tasked with depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunt work, nor did he have the stunt performers use wires or dummies; he told them to fall [...] off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. [...] "We had to say, ‘Jump off the rock, land however you land, and go with it,’" [...] he said. [...] "When you’re doing that on a true hillside, you don’t have a choice. Gravity takes over. The only thing stopping the stunt people from dropping another thousand feet down the hillside was padding set up just outside of the shot." [...] Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control. Berg recalled, [...] "Some guys got hurt, some guys got bumped up and ribs were broken, a lung was punctured, some concussions, but these guys were determined to try and <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> could to capture what Marcus described in the book."

2500|$|As {{the last}} day of the regular season arrived, and with Torquay, Stevenage and Gillingham {{separated}} only by goal difference, it was vital for the Gulls to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> could in their match with Rotherham to ensure they secured one of the two remaining play-off berths. [...] However, it was to prove a challenging afternoon at the Don Valley Stadium. [...] Nerves began to jangle as soon as Ryan Taylor put the Millers 1-0 ahead after just ten minutes and, despite Chris Zebroski equalising in the 31st minute, Rotherham restored their lead just two minutes later thanks to a Danny Harrison strike. Meanwhile, with goals going in at the Stevenage and Gillingham games, Torquay found themselves in 6th, 7th and 8th position at various times during the afternoon and, when Oliver Banks put Rotherham 3-1 ahead in the 80th minute, they were now relying on scores from elsewhere if they were to book a place in the play-offs. [...] While Stevenage secured their place with an enthralling 3-3 draw against Bury, the Gulls were ultimately indebted to Chesterfield who, by beating Gillingham 3-1, not only clinched the League Two title for themselves, but also made sure that Torquay would finish the season in the final play-off spot, ahead of the unfortunate Gills on goal difference alone.|$|E
