500|$|Roger Ebert {{was among}} those who {{strongly}} supported the film, giving it a 4 out of a possible 4 stars and praising it for [...] "its heedless energy and joy, it reminded me of how I felt the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's like a film that escaped from the imagination directly onto the screen, without having to pass through reality along the way".|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism that I liked. I remember the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the cue where Griet opens the shutters. He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere." [...] Desplat was then known primarily for scoring films in his native language.|$|E

[...] Rienzi was staged to considerable acclaim on 20 October.|$|E

When Berg was eight, his family relocated to Los Angeles, California. While a sophomore at Palisades Charter High School, Berg researched the author F.

[...] Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E

500|$|At one point, {{the project}} was nearly {{abandoned}} because Peirce was not satisfied {{with most of the}} people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, [...] "But that's what Brandon would do". Swank's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a [...] "known actor" [...] to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank's audition was [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> someone who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants, who smiled and loved being Brandon." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{trying out}} with the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Koufax did {{the same for the}} Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. During his Pirates tryout, Koufax's fastball broke the thumb of Sam Narron, the team's bullpen coach. Branch Rickey, then the general manager of the Pirates, told his scout Clyde Sukeforth that Koufax had the [...] "greatest arm [...] ever seen". The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a {{contract}} until after he was already committed to the Dodgers. Dodgers scout Al Campanis heard about Koufax from a local sporting goods store owner. After seeing Koufax pitch for Lafayette, Campanis invited him to an Ebbets Field tryout. With Dodgers manager Walter Alston and scouting director Fresco Thompson watching, Campanis assumed the hitter's stance while Koufax started throwing. Campanis later said, [...] "There are two times in my life the hair on my arms has stood up: The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the second time, I saw Sandy Koufax throw a fastball." [...] The Dodgers signed Koufax for a $6,000 ($ today) salary, with a $14,000 ($ today) signing bonus. Koufax planned to use the money as tuition to finish his university education, if his baseball career failed.|$|E

He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle, published [...] from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas, a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon, who {{in addition to his}} staff work continued to freelance.

And further; [...] "I always had a queer feeling about actors and actresses on the screen... I knew I would have done it differently. I couldn't analyze it, but I could always feel it.". [...] "I'd go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I'd seen, living them before the glass."

[...] "They've got more snakes... like adders, grass snakes, slow worms, toads, frogs, newts, all kinds of rodents, all kinds of squirrels, a massive number of squirrels, foxes, and obviously, seagulls. [...] This is part of the new ecology. And for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the world in a new way.

And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it. It was a strange kind of optimism that I felt... but trying to get that into pop music is a challenge, anyway. But important." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roach {{made his}} Test debut on 9July 2009. He {{was part of}} an understrength team fielded by the West Indies against Bangladesh; in the 15-man squad, there were nine {{uncapped}} players and in the Test seven West Indies players made their debut. The side was captained by Floyd Reifer who had played the last of his four Tests ten years earlier. The first XI had made themselves unavailable due to a pay dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board. His first Test wicket was that of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Although Bangladesh won by 95runs, Roach helped put pressure on the Bangladesh batsmen through a combination of yorkers and swinging deliveries, although he bowled slightly wide to the left-handers. Reifer praised Roach's efforts, saying [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him as an under-19 bowler, I always {{thought he was going to}} play for West Indies. He does a lot, especially with the old ball, getting it to move in and out and he performed very well this morning, bowling decent lengths and lines". Although Bangladesh won the second Test to take the series 2–0, Roach again bowled with pace and aggression, unsettling the Bangladesh batsmen. Varying his length and exploiting the Bangladesh batsmen's weakness against short bowling– even hitting Raqibul Hasan on the elbow with one delivery– Roach proceeded to take career-best figures of 6/48 in the first innings. With 13wickets to his name, Roach finished as West Indies' leading wicket-taker from the series. Although Bangladesh won the three-match ODI series that followed 3–0, Roach was leading wicket-taker for the series, with 10wickets at an average of 16.20; in the first of the ODIs he took his maiden five-wicket haul in one day matches (5/44), beating his previous best figures of 2/29. In the second ODI, Roach was fined 10% of his match fee for bowling two beamers. The core of the same squad was retained for September's 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. Roach played in two of West Indies' three matches, as they exited the tournament in the first round, and took three wickets at 33.33.|$|E
