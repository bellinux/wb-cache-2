5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to <b>interchange</b> <b>instability.</b> The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of several processes—diffusion and <b>interchange</b> <b>instability</b> being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter. As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial {{currents}} flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation. These radial currents are also {{the source of the}} magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation. The particle number density of the plasma decreases from around 2,000cm−3 in the Io torus to about 0.2cm−3 at a distance of 35RJ. In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20RJ from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet. Eventually at the distances greater than 40RJ (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail. As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density plasma (temperature 20keV (200millionK) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere. This plasma, adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter, forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.|$|E

50|$|Although {{spacecraft}} have travelled {{many times}} in the inner and outer orbit of Earth since the 1960s, the spacecraft ATS 5 was the first major plasma experiment performed that could reliably determine the existence of radial injections driven by interchange motions. The analysis revealed the frequent injection of a hot plasma cloud is injected inward during a substorm in the outer layers of the magnetosphere et al. 1971. The injections occur predominantly in the night-time hemisphere, being associated with the depolarization of the neutral sheet configuration in the tail regions of the magnetosphere. This paper then implies that Earth’s magnetotail region is a major mechanism in which the magnetosphere stores and releases energy through the interchange mechanism.The <b>interchange</b> <b>instability</b> also has been found to have a limiting factor on the night side plasmapause thickness et al. 1990. In this paper, the plasmapause is found to be near the geosynchronous orbit in which the centrifugal and gravitational potential cancel exactly.

In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere.

The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.This highly hypothetical picture of the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere. These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field.

50|$|In the 1950s, {{the field}} of {{theoretical}} plasma physics emerged. The confidential research of the war time years became declassified and allowed the publication and spread of very influential papers. The world rushed {{to take advantage of}} the recent revelations on nuclear energy. Although never fully realized, the idea of controlled thermonuclear fusion motivated many to explore and research novel configurations in plasma physics. Instabilities plagued early designs of artificial plasma confinement devices and were quickly studied partly as a means to inhibit the effects.The analytical equations for interchange instabilities were first studied by Kruskal and Schwarzschild 1954. They investigated several simple systems including the system in which an ideal fluid is supported against gravity by a magnetic field (the initial model described in the last section). In Bernstein et al. 1958, Bernstein derives an energy principle that rigorously proves that the change in potential must be greater than zero for a system to be stable. This energy principle has been essential in establishing a stability condition for the possible instabilities of a specific configuration. In 1959, Thomas Gold attempted to use the concept of interchange motion to explain the circulation of plasma around the Earth, using data from Pioneer III published by James Van Allen. Gold also coined the term “magnetosphere” to describe “the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the Earth has a dominant control over the motions of gas and fast charged particles.” Marshall Rosenthal and Conrad Longmire described in their 1957 paper how a flux tube in a planetary magnetic field accumulates charge because of opposing movement of the ions and electrons in the background plasma. Gradient, curvature and centrifugal drifts all send ions in the same direction along the planetary rotation meaning that there is a positive build-up on one side of the flux tube and a negative build-up on the other. The separation of charges established an electric field across the flux tube and therefore adds an E x B motion, sending the flux tube toward the planet. This mechanism supports our <b>interchange</b> <b>instability</b> framework, resulting in the injection of less dense gas radially inward. Since the Kruskal and Schwarzschild’s paper a tremendous amount of theoretical work has been accomplished that handle multi-dimensional configurations, varying boundary conditions and complicated geometries. The motivation for new technologies in World War II and the Cold War also directly led to the advanced rocketry and satellite technology developed in the space race. This boded well for experimentalists who now had the means and support to build satellites that could orbit the Earth. Pioneers like James Van Allen, Louis Frank and others in space physics were finally able to acquire in situ data from Earth’s magnetosphere. Ever since the establishment of NASA in 1958, the program has overseen the bulk of American space exploration. Dozens of unmanned missions have been completed and many are still ongoing. From inner earth orbit to the interstellar medium, these missions have become essential in our understanding of the planets and the properties of their magnetospheres. Without them, the study of <b>interchange</b> <b>instability</b> would be much more brief and much less developed. These unmanned missions, that have now reached every planet in our solar system, have enabled a more comprehensive understanding of interchange motions in Jupiter and Saturn’s magnetospheres. Jupiter has had two major orbital missions: Galileo (launched in 1989) and Juno (launched in 2011 and currently operating in orbit). Saturn currently has the Cassini-Huygens probe in orbit. Cassini was launched in 1997 and has been at Saturn since 2004.|$|E

40|$|After {{introducing}} a mathematical {{definition of the}} tail-like equilibrium and the dipole-like equilibrium in the magnetosphere, it is shown by using physical intuition based on the Energy Principle that the incompressible assumption for the ballooning instability is more valid for the tail-like configuration when the unstable ballooning mode is strongly localized near the equator. Therefore, before the substorm onset, the near-Earth plasma sheet becomes more tail-like {{and more likely to}} be subject to the ballooning instability without the stabilizing influence of the compressibility, when the critical plasma β due to the stabilizing tension force is exceeded.

50|$|<b>Interchange</b> <b>instability</b> plays a {{major role}} in the radial {{transport}} of plasma in the Io plasma torus at Jupiter. The first evidence of this behavior was published in Thorne et al. 1997 in which they discovered “anomalous plasma signatures” in the Io torus of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Using the data from Galileo’s energetic particle detector (EPD), the study looked at one specific event. In Thorne et al. they concluded that these events had a density differential of at least a factor of 2, a spatial scale of km and an inward velocity of about km/s. These results support the theoretical arguments for interchange transport.Later, more injections events were discovered and analyzed from Galileo. Mauk et al. 1999 used over 100 Jovian injections to study how these events were dispersed in energy and time. Similar to injections of Earth, the events were often clustered in time. The authors concluded that this indicated the injection events were triggered by solar wind activity against the Jovian magnetosphere. This is very similar to the magnetic storm relationship injection events have on Earth. However, it was found that Jovian injections can occur at all local time positions and therefore can’t be directly related to the situation in Earth’s magnetosphere. Although the Jovian injections aren’t a direct analog of Earth’s injections, the similarities indicate that this process plays a vital role in the storage and release of energy. The difference may lie in the presence of Io in the Jovian system. Io is a large producer of plasma mass because of its volcanic activity. This explains why the bulk of interchange motions are seen in a small radial range near Io.|$|E

Inside about 10 Jupiter radii, the diffusion is probably driven by electric fields associated with the upper atmosphere dynamo which is driven by neutral winds in the ionosphere.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this work itermittent events in the plasma edge of the tokamak TEXTOR were characterized. For that data of {{measurements}} of the density and the poloidal electrical field were analysed. The data was collected by a reciprocating and a fixed probe as well as by a Lithium beam. The intermittent behaviour was quantified by the statistical moments of the data. If intermittency is high, coherent structures (also called blobs) can be detected. The detected blobs were described using the statistical method of conditional averaging. The main results can be summarised as follows: Intermittent behaviour has been detected in the scrap off layer of the tokamak TEXTOR and it is increasing with the radius from the last closed flux surface (LCFS) on. On the midplane the blobs in the limiter geometry have a radial size of up to 8 cm and move onto the wall with velocities as high as (1 - 7) % of the ion sound speed. It was found that intermittent transport causes 40 % of the total perpendicular transport in the investigated discharges. In {{the upper part of the}} tokamak there is less intermittency. This is reasonable if intermittency is caused by <b>interchange</b> <b>instabilities</b> which mainly occur on the low field side of the tokamak. With the Dynamic Ergodic Divertor (DED) and the associated formation of tearing modes intermittency is increasing. This can also be due to the steeper gradient of density in the scrap off layer close to the LCFS which is caused by gas puffing used for the regulation of the density. Outside the LCFS the ergodic field does not have any influence on the characteristics of blobs. Within the LCFS density holes have been found which propagate towards the centre of the plasma. The radial transport due to blobs is still the same. In general the velocity of the detected blobs is proportional to the square root of their poloidal size. That confirms the prediction of the blob model in which the nonlinear development of <b>interchange</b> <b>instabilities</b> causes the propagation of blobs...|$|R
