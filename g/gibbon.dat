50|$|He {{returned}} to Bermuda following the war. In 1946, <b>Gibbons</b> joined his family's company, {{which had been}} co-founded by his father. Graham <b>Gibbons</b> oversaw the retail divisions of Edmund <b>Gibbons</b> Ltd., while his brother, David <b>Gibbons,</b> oversaw the company's other holdings, including Bermuda Motors and Colonial Insurance. He served as the President of Edmund <b>Gibbons</b> Ltd. until his retirement during the 1980s. Additionally, <b>Gibbons</b> headed the Bermuda Chamber of Commerce from 1950 to 1951.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gibbons</b> {{married his}} wife, the former Ida Gibson, {{a painter and}} watercolorist, in 1949.

5|$|Colonel John <b>Gibbon,</b> whose men {{arrived at}} the battle on Tuesday, June 27, and also helped bury the dead, said he found Kellogg's body in a ravine where a number of men from Company E died. Kellogg's body was scalped and missing an ear; he was {{identified}} by the boots he wore.|$|E
5|$|In early September Marquis went to Lame Deer for the Cheyenne annual fair. There, Willis Rowland {{helped him}} compile {{a list of}} elderly Cheyennes. Although the Custer {{battlefield}} was on the Crow Reservation, the Crow {{had been on the}} US side during the Great Sioux War of 1876, of which the Custer battle was a part, and so would have no eyewitnesses to the battle, everybody fighting with Custer having been killed. Back in Lodge Grass, Marquis made two important contacts. In November, he had his first meeting with Thomas H. Leforge. Leforge lived among the Crow and had been a scout and interpreter for General <b>Gibbon</b> in the 1876 war. Leforge would be the subject of the first book Marquis succeeded in publishing, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian. The second contact was William H. White, who was with the Second Cavalry under <b>Gibbon.</b> White would be the subject of Custer, Cavalry & Crows.|$|E
5|$|The {{target of}} the Confederate assault {{was the center of}} the Union Army of the Potomac's II Corps, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. John <b>Gibbon</b> with the brigades of Brig. Gen. William Harrow, Col. Norman J. Hall, and Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb. (On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to <b>Gibbon</b> at a council of war that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon's sector the following morning.) To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. Alexander Hays, and to the south was Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's division of the I Corps, including the 2nd Vermont Brigade of Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard and the 121st Pennsylvania under the command of Col. Chapman Biddle. Meade's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister.|$|E
50|$|In 1890 Phillips {{purchased}} Stanley <b>Gibbons</b> & Co. for £25,000. It {{had first}} been offered to Theodor Buhl for £20,000. Phillips wrote numerous philatelic articles, including those published in The <b>Gibbons</b> Monthly Journal, The Stamp Advertiser and Auction Record and the <b>Gibbons</b> Stamp Weekly where he wrote articles on various collections {{he had helped}} build or sold. Eventually, after many changes, the <b>Gibbons</b> in-house journal became <b>Gibbons</b> Stamp Monthly.|$|R
5000|$|Edmund Graham <b>Gibbons</b> II [...] (10 March 1920 - 18 June 2016) was a Bermudian {{businessman}} and politician {{who served as}} the mayor of Hamilton from 1972 to 1988. <b>Gibbons</b> was the brother of the late Sir David <b>Gibbons,</b> the former Premier of Bermuda from 1977 until 1982. Together, the <b>Gibbons</b> brothers owned and operated the Edmund <b>Gibbons</b> Ltd., a holding company, and its affiliated companies, for more than forty years.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Gibbons</b> Baronetcy, of Stanwell Place in the County of Middlesex, {{was created}} in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 21 April 1752 for Sir William <b>Gibbons,</b> Speaker of the House of Assembly, Barbados. The second Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Stockbridge and Wallingford. The fifth Baronet was High Sheriff of Middlesex in 1891. Two other members of the family may also be mentioned. Frederick Kenrick Colquhoun <b>Gibbons</b> (1865-1954), son of Captain Frederick <b>Gibbons,</b> brother of the fifth Baronet, was a Captain in the Royal Navy. Sir William Kenrick <b>Gibbons</b> (1876-1957), son of Sir William <b>Gibbons,</b> {{grandson}} of Robert <b>Gibbons,</b> fourth son of the second Baronet, was Clerk of the House of Commons.|$|R
5|$|The work {{opened to}} the public in Chicago on October 22, 1883, to {{critical}} acclaim. General John <b>Gibbon,</b> one of the commanders of the Union forces who repelled Pickett's Charge, was among the veterans of the battle who gave it favorable reviews. So realistic was the painting that many veterans of the war were reported to have wept upon seeing it.|$|E
5|$|Open-air cages {{installed}} in the Monkey House resulted in a dramatic improvement in the life expectancy of its residents, but the potential for expansion and improvement after the First World War was limited by the post-war economy. Rising labour costs and minimal profits resulted in the gardens' increasing dilapidation. The zoo began to be neglected after the sale of Belle Vue in 1925, but it was rejuvenated by the appointment of Gerald Iles as zoo superintendent in 1933. A new <b>Gibbon</b> Cage and Monkey Mountain were created and the Reptile House was extended.|$|E
5|$|Beirut {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in {{writing as a}} major {{center for the study}} of law in the 239 works of Gregory Thaumaturgus, the bishop of Neo-Caesarea. Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. Edward <b>Gibbon</b> suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor Alexander Severus, who reigned during A.D. 222–235; this hypothesis had been supported by Gilles Ménage, a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist Scipione Gentili, however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian Karl Hase advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31BC). Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of Hadrian, while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.|$|E

5|$|During the day, Boadicea {{continued}} to close until Victor {{was forced to}} abandon Ceylon and sail in support of Vénus at 15:30. As soon as the French prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz <b>Gibbon,</b> the remaining officer on Ceylon, rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that the battered state of his flagship meant {{that he would not}} be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at Boadicea as she came up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|In early {{editions of}} , many {{well-known}} legendary creatures were included {{such as the}} phoenix, dragon and manticore as well as cryptids like the satyrus, which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, {{but they did not}} find any signs of its existence. Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar <b>gibbon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meade {{had his own}} detractors as well. Similar to the {{situation}} with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, {{but he had the}} misfortune of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, lambasted Meade before the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, where Radical Republicans suspected that Meade was a Copperhead and tried in vain to relieve him from command. Daniel E. Sickles and Daniel Butterfield accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates—Winfield S. Hancock, John <b>Gibbon,</b> Gouverneur K. Warren, and Henry J. Hunt, all heroes of the battle—defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.|$|E

5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines, more closely {{resembling}} New World monkeys in appearance, {{although it was}} larger—possibly {{the size of a}} <b>gibbon.</b> Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its sagittal crest (ridge of bone running lengthwise down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen was a male. These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines. Propliopithecoids, the oldest stem group of catarrhines, which date back 35 to 30mya, lacked a fully developed ectotympanic.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Saadanius provides new evidence for competing hypotheses about the facial {{appearance of the}} ancestral crown catarrhines, or common ancestor. One reconstruction is based on living catarrhine traits and predicts a short face and a rounded braincase, {{similar to that of}} a <b>gibbon.</b> Another reconstruction, based on the morphology of early Miocene apes and the basal cercopithecoid Victoriapithecus, predicts that the last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall face, like that of living baboons and the oldest fossil apes and Old World monkeys. The conservative features of Saadanius, {{similar to those of the}} older stem catarrhines, support the latter hypothesis, according to Zalmout et al. However, one palaeontologist, Eric Delson, has cautioned that geological pressure may have distorted the shape of the skull.|$|E
5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. <b>Gibbon</b> suggests that from here only a small spark was required to ignite a rebellion.|$|E
