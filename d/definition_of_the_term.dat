5|$|The final {{level is}} higher education, or háskóli (lit. “high school”). There are eight such {{institutions}} in the country, {{most of which are}} run by the state. The first institution, the University of Iceland, opened in 1911, and is still the principal higher education institution in the country. In recent years, however, more universities have opened across the country, widening the range of choices available. Legislation concerning higher education institutions was passed in 1997, which includes a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> háskóli (to include universities which do not carry out research). There is also separate legislation in place for each public institution, defining their role in research and general organisation. Private and public universities both receive funding from the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Ahhiyawa in western Anatolia is mentioned in various Hittite accounts from c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC. Ahhiyawa is generally {{accepted as a}} Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek), but a precise geographical <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> cannot {{be drawn from the}} texts. During this time, the kings of Ahhiyawa were evidently capable of dealing with their Hittite counterparts both on a diplomatic and military level. Moreover, Ahhiyawan activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs, with the support of anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the Ahhiyawan king used as agents for the extension of his influence.|$|E

25|$|The philatelic-based <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> {{developed}} as the discipline developed.

25|$|One common <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> {{focuses on}} three concepts: the fascist negations (anti-liberalism, anti-communism and anti-conservatism); {{nationalist}} authoritarian goals {{of creating a}} regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture; and a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence and promotion of masculinity, youth and charismatic leadership. According to many scholars, fascism—especially once in power—has historically attacked communism, conservatism and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right.|$|E

25|$|In {{most common}} law jurisdictions {{there is a}} Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in {{relation}} to negotiable instruments, including cheques, and this Act contains a statutory <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> banker: banker includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques {{does not depend on}} how the bank is structured or regulated.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace {{published}} Lemkin's {{most important}} work, entitled Axis Rule in Occupied Europe, in the United States. This book included an extensive legal analysis of German rule in countries occupied by Nazi Germany {{during the course}} of World War II, along with the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> genocide. Lemkin's idea of genocide as an offense against international law was widely accepted by the international community {{and was one of the}} legal bases of the Nuremberg Trials. In 1945 to 1946, Lemkin became an advisor to Supreme Court of the United States Justice and Nuremberg Trial chief counsel Robert H. Jackson.|$|E
25|$|One {{significant}} change {{that resulted from}} the new laws was the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> aggravated felony. Being {{convicted of a crime}} that is categorized as an aggravated felony results in mandatory detention and deportation. The new definition of aggravated felony includes crimes such as shoplifting, which would be a misdemeanor in many states. The new laws have categorized a much wider range of crimes as aggravated felonies. The effect of this has been a large increase in permanent residents facing mandatory deportation from the United States without the opportunity to plea for relief. The 1996 deportation laws have received a lot of criticism for their curtailing of residents' rights.|$|E

25|$|The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> contourite has varied {{throughout}} the decades. Originally, Heezen et al. (1966) defined the concept, without using the actual word, as a sedimentary deposit on the continental rise derived from thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents that flow parallel to bathymetric contours. They {{did this to}} emphasize {{the difference between these}} deposits and turbidites in order to explain the ubiquitous smoothness and lack of irregularities of the continental rise in the Blake-Bahama Basin. Before this, it was thought that only turbidity flows were capable of depositing and reworking sediment at depths greater than the continental slope. Hollister and Heezen (1972) adopted the name contourite for these deposits and provided a list of characteristics that described their sediments. Faugères and Stow (1993) note that as research on the subject developed, the term contourite was used to describe various forms of sedimentary deposits from bottom-currents including those at much shallower depths and even in lacustrine settings. They suggested going back to the original definition of a contourite, that is for deposits at depths greater than 500 m derived from stable thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents (i.e. deepwater bottom-currents), in order to avoid using the same name when describing sedimentary deposits formed by different processes. They also suggest the umbrella term bottom-current deposit, which includes contourites and deposits generated by other bottom-currents.|$|E
500|$|The {{constant}} publicity {{given to}} the debate contributed to a growing distrust of the truthfulness of popular nature writing of the day, and often pitted scientist against writer. The controversy effectively ended when President Theodore Roosevelt publicly sided with Burroughs, publishing his article [...] "Nature Fakers" [...] in the September 1907 issue of Everybody's Magazine. Roosevelt popularized the negative colloquialism by which the controversy would later be known to describe one who purposefully fabricates details about the natural world. The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> later expanded to include those who depicted nature with excessive sentimentality.|$|E
500|$|Related tax protester {{arguments}} {{with respect to}} wages paid by [...] "employers" [...] to [...] "employees" [...] are (1) that only federal officers, federal employees, elected officials, or corporate officers are [...] "employees" [...] for purposes of federal income tax, (2) that {{the inclusion of the}} United States government within the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> [...] "employer" [...] operates to exclude all other employers from the definition, and (3) that with respect to compensation, the tax is imposed only on compensation paid to federal government employees.
