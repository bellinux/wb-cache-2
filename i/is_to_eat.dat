5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E

Exodus 12:8 [...] From {{the evening of the}} fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day, you <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> matzo.

Thus you will remember the day you left the land of Egypt as long as you live.

500|$|Snake Rattle 'n' Roll {{features}} two snakes – Rattle and Roll – as {{they make}} their way through 11 [...] isometric levels. The object in each level <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> enough [...] "Nibbley Pibbleys" [...] – small round creatures found throughout each level – to gain enough weight to ring a bell on top of a weighing machine located {{at the end of the}} level; this causes a door for the next level to open. Players maneuver their snakes throughout the level with the control pad and are able to pick up Nibbley Pibbleys by pressing the B button on the controller. The snakes' lengths increase when they eat; players' snake length grows more quickly when they eat Nibbley Pibbleys of their own color, and they grow the most when they eat yellow ones. Located in each level are dispensers which randomly spew out Nibbley Pibbleys; however, they also spew out bombs which can damage the snakes. When a snake reaches a long enough length, the tail begins to flash, which means the snake is heavy enough to exit that level. [...] At that point, they must find and jump on the scale in order to ring the bell and open the exit door.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{believe that}} Christ is truly {{present in the}} Lord’s Supper; yea, {{we believe that there}} is no communion without the {{presence}} of Christ. This is the proof: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them' (Matt. 18:20). How much more is he present where the whole congregation is assembled to his honor! But that his body is literally eaten is far from the truth and the nature of faith. It is contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the world' (John 17:11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing' (John 6:63), that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> as the Jews then believed and the Papists still believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would shrink from eating his beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught). And this is in brief the substance of what we maintain in this controversy, and what not we, but the truth itself teaches." ...|$|E
5000|$|Future {{relative}} to a reference point is formed using the past tense of the copula, e.g. [...] "I <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> dinner" [...] (instead of the present [...] "I <b>am</b> going <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> dinner"). This may express past intention ("I <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> dinner") or prediction ("It <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> rain").|$|R
5000|$|Further constructions can be {{made with}} other auxiliary-like expressions, like (<b>to)</b> <b>be</b> going <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or (<b>to)</b> <b>be</b> about <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> which have future meaning. For more {{examples}} of the above types of construction, see [...]|$|R

2500|$|Eating in the sukkah {{does not}} cause a {{parallel}} problem because many people simply enjoy eating outdoors {{in the shade of}} a sukkah. Hence, seeing someone eating in a sukkah does not per se lead one to assume it is still ḥol hamoed. Likewise, eating in the sukkah does not per se impinge on one's own celebration of Shemini Atzeret. Therefore, the prevalent practice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in the sukkah on Shemini Azeret outside the Land of Israel, but not to recite the berakhah for sitting in a sukkah, as reciting it would [...] "impinge" [...] on the unique status of Shemini Atzeret.|$|E

They also prepare to celebrate the wedding of the troupe's leading comedian, Ludwig, to Lisa, a soubrette of the company. The marriage cannot take place, however, as there are no parsons available in the city: all clerics have been summoned to the palace by the Grand Duke of Pfennig-Halbpfennig to discuss his own forthcoming marriage. Everyone has grown to resent the Grand Duke, {{and all of the}} company had already become members of a plot to blow him up with dynamite and place a new man on the throne.
