40|$|Investigation of the ion and {{electron}} temperature rises caused by {{friction between the}} neutral gas winds and the plasma of the ionosphere. The results obtained indicate that within an altitude range of 150 - 200 km, ion temperatures can exceed {{electron temperature}}s {{by as much as}} 130 K. Ion temperature increases range from 50 to 200 K, depending upon the atmosphere model used. It is pointed out that failure to make allowance for <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> in determinations of neutral gas temperature may lead to considerable errors...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of cumulative fatigue damage under various repeated loads {{have been investigated}} by many reporters. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a simple theoretical concept of fatigue damage that is shown in reports and literatures and introduce this concept to predicting workabilities for the experimental tube end spinning. On the tube end spinning process, the material encountered with (i) Cyclic lateral bending at relief areas of the shaping die and (ii) Cyclic <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction,</b> so the tube end spinnability of any metal would be affected by cumulative damage fatigue under cyclic lateral bending, strain-rate and forming temperature. ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} {{is focused on}} the changes in thin surface layer of the brake disk due to the impact of severe plastic deformation and <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> process. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare structure, chemical and phase compositions of the surface layer in depth up to several hundreds of nanometers in the no affected central part of brake disk and the part which was in contact with brake pads by braking. The basic information on structure and phase composition was obtained by optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray Powder Diffraction and Mössbauer Spectroscopy. The thin surface layer was studied using Conversion Electron Mössbauer Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. We explain the observed changes with the knowledge on effects of plastic deformation and/or diffusion of alloying elements in the material of the brake disk...|$|E

5000|$|The {{amount of}} moving parts in a machine {{is a factor}} in its {{mechanical}} efficiency. The greater the number of moving parts, the greater the amount of energy lost to <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> between those parts. [...] In a modern automobile engine, for example, roughly 7% of the total power obtained from burning the engine's fuel is lost to friction between the engine's moving parts.|$|R
5000|$|This {{formulation}} {{does not}} mention heat and {{does not mention}} temperature, nor even entropy, and does not necessarily implicitly rely on those concepts, but it implies {{the content of the}} second law. A closely related statement is that [...] "Frictional pressure never does positive work." [...] Using a now-obsolete form of words, Planck himself wrote: [...] "The production of <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> is irreversible." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{coal cutter}} {{consists}} of a rotating part {{with a number of}} teeth or picks. When these picks hit a pocket of hard rock such as pyrites or quartz they can generate a finely divided powder which is <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction.</b> Blunt picks are more likely to produce this grinding and heating than sharp ones. Sparking from the cutters in the Duckbill district had been observed before, but as nothing had followed from the sparking it was ignored.|$|R
5000|$|Friction {{stud welding}} {{is a solid}} phase welding {{technique}} involving a stud or appurtenance being rotated at high speed while being forced against a substrate, generating <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction.</b> The metal surfaces reach a temperature at which they flow plastically under pressure, surface impurities are expelled and a forged weld is formed.

50|$|The compact {{object is}} thought to be orbited by a thin, flat disk of accreting matter known as an {{accretion}} disk. This disk is intensely <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> between ionized gas in faster-moving inner orbits and that in slower outer ones. It is divided into a hot inner region with a relatively high level of ionization—forming a plasma—and a cooler, less ionized outer region that extends to an estimated 500 times the Schwarzschild radius, or about 15,000 km.|$|R
50|$|Pin mills are {{commonly}} {{use in the}} manufacture of pharmaceuticals, as they can achieve particle sizes as low as a few micrometers. However, <b>heat</b> generated <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> can sometimes be a concern.|$|R

50|$|Drum brakes, {{like most}} other brakes, convert kinetic energy into <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction.</b> This <b>heat</b> should {{dissipate}} into the surrounding air, but can just as easily transfer to other braking system components. Brake drums must be large {{to cope with the}} massive forces involved, and must be able to absorb and dissipate a lot of heat. Heat transfer to air can be aided by incorporating cooling fins onto the drum. However, excessive heating can occur due to heavy or repeated braking, which can cause the drum to distort, leading to vibration under braking.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two kinds}} of sparks which may take place during switch operation. On closure, a few sparks, like those from a flint-and-steel, may appear as a tiny bit of metal is <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> to incandescence, melted, and thrown off. On opening, a bluish arc may occur, with a {{detectable}} [...] "electrical" [...] (ozone) odor. Subsequently, the contacts may be seen to be darkened and pitted. Damaged contacts have higher resistance, rendering them more vulnerable to further damage and causing a cycle in which the contacts soon may fail completely.|$|R
50|$|An {{equivalent}} dumping coefficient is {{a mathematical}} coefficient {{used in the}} calculation of the energy dispersed when a structure moves. As a civil engineering term, it defines the percent of a cycle of oscillation that is absorbed (converted to <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction)</b> for the structure or sub-structure under analysis. Usually {{it is assumed that}} the equivalent dumping coefficient is linear, which is to say invariant compare to oscillatory amplitude. Modern seismic studies have shown this not to be a satisfactory assumption for larger civic structures, and have developed sophisticated amplitude and frequency based functions for equivalent dumping coefficient.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem is}} the <b>heat</b> {{generated}} <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> as the air flows over the aircraft. Most supersonic designs use aluminium alloys such as Duralumin, which are cheap and easy to work but lose their strength quickly at high temperatures. This limits maximum speed to around Mach 2.2.|$|R
50|$|A {{regenerative}} brake is an energy recovery mechanism which slows a vehicle or object by converting its kinetic energy {{into a form}} which can be either used immediately or stored until needed. This contrasts with conventional braking systems, where the excess kinetic energy is converted to unwanted and wasted <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> in the brakes, or with dynamic brakes, where energy is recovered by using electric motors as generators but is immediately dissipated as heat in resistors. In addition to improving the overall efficiency of the vehicle, regeneration can greatly {{extend the life of}} the braking system as its parts do not wear as quickly.|$|R
50|$|Spin welding is a {{friction}} welding technique used on thermoplastic materials, {{in which the}} parts to be welded are <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction.</b> The <b>heat</b> may be generated by turning on a lathe, a drill press, or a milling machine, where one part {{is driven by the}} chuck, and the other is held stationary with the spinning part driven against it. This is continued until the heat of friction between the parts reaches a sufficient level for the parts to weld. The stationary part is then released to spin as well, while pressure is applied along the axis of rotation, holding the parts together as they cool.|$|R
50|$|Lacquering {{may also}} be done on a lathe. For slender and {{delicate}} items, hand-lathe is preferred. A lac stick is pressed against the toy which is fixed to the lathe. While the toy keeps revolving, the <b>heat</b> generated <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> softens the lac, making it stick to the toy.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle {{braking systems}} have varied {{throughout}} time, as motorcycles evolved from bicycles with an engine attached, to the 220 mph prototype motorcycles seen racing in MotoGP. Most systems work by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy (<b>heat)</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction.</b> On motorcycles, approximately 70% of the braking effort is {{performed by the}} front brake. This however can vary for individual motorcycles; longer-wheelbase types having more weight biased rearward, such as cruisers and tourers, can have a`greater effort applied by the rear brake. In contrast, sports bikes with a shorter wheelbase and more vertical fork geometry can tolerate higher front braking loads. For these reasons, motorcycles {{tend to have a}} vastly more powerful front brake compared to the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Saturn has a hot interior, {{reaching}} 11,700 °C at its core, and it radiates 2.5 {{times more}} energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy {{is generated by}} the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but this alone may {{not be sufficient to}} explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive.

50|$|Despite its {{invisible}} interior, {{the presence}} of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk <b>heated</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction,</b> forming some of the brightest objects in the universe. If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems, and established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of our own Milky Way galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the large}} area of sliding contact between the moving and {{stationary}} threads, screws typically have large frictional energy losses. Even well-lubricated jack screws have efficiencies of only 15% - 20%, {{the rest of the}} work applied in turning them is lost to friction. When friction is included, the mechanical advantage is no longer equal to the distance ratio but also depends on the screw's efficiency. From conservation of energy, the work Win done on the screw by the input force turning it is equal to the sum of the work done moving the load Wout, and the work dissipated as <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>friction</b> Wfric in the screwThe efficiency η is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1 defined as the ratio of output work to input work ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A wear tester was developed. MC PA (nylon) {{filled with}} MoS 2 and PU (polyurethane) {{were used as}} the {{material}} of the rubber wheel of roller guide shoes. Their wear performances was investigated with the tester. The {{results show that the}} wear rate of MC PA increases firstly and then decreases with increasing load, and reverses with increasing velocity. The wear rate of PU decreases firstly and then increases with increasing velocity. In addition, the main wear mechanisms of PU are plough wear and abrasive wear at the low load (200 N). At the loads of 200 N~ 500 N, the main wear form of MC PA is the adhesive wear. Adhesive wear is the main mechanism of MC PA at the low velocity (3 m/s). Due to inner <b>heat</b> accumulation <b>by</b> <b>friction,</b> squama-peering occurs on MC PA surface at the high velocity (8 m/s). The dominant wear mechanisms of PU are abrasive wear and fatigue pitting. And the main reason of PU’s failure is the interior <b>heat</b> accumulation caused <b>by</b> <b>friction...</b>|$|R

Furthermore, {{we did not observe}} any other noticeable difference between the mechanical and manual boring, in terms of the frequency in borer damage (nicked blades or broken shaft of the bit), probably because the reduced rotation speed (14 – 67  rpm) of our device does not differ greatly from that of manual sampling.|$|R
