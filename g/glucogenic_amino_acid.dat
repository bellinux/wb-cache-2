40|$|The liver {{occupies}} {{a major role}} in metabolic homeostasis with important functions in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are common in all forms of liver disease although fasting hypoglycaemia is surprisingly rare. Blood concentrations of the gluconeogenic precursors, lactate and pyruvate, are raised in liver disease, particularly hepatic cirrhosis, although <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> levels tend not to be raised except in hepatic coma. The lipid fuels, non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol, are present in elevated concentration in plasma although ketone body levels tend not to be raised. Plasma triglycerides show variable changes. The metabolic hormones, insulin, glucagon, cortisol and growth hormone both act on and are degraded by, the liver, while catecholamines and thyroid hormones also have major effects on normal hepatic metabolism. In liver disease, particularly cirrhosis, insulin degradation is impaired, with consequent hyperinsulinaemia. There is also insulin resistance due presumably to impaired action of insulin on the liver. Growth hormone levels tend to show paradoxical elevation, while cortisol half-life is prolonged although levels are only variably raised. Plasma glucagon levels are raised only in association with severe liver damage although glucagon action on liver is more often impaired. The changes in metabolic functions of the liver in liver disease may be explained by the combination of parenchymal damage and disordered hormonal action, although changes are less than expected owing to the large reserve capacity of the liver...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{examine the effect of}} L-ornithine {{hydrochloride}} ingestion on lipid oxidation during submaximal endurance exercise following resistance exercise. Ten healthy young male adults with no history of regular resistance exercise (age: 26. 0 +/- 4. 4) conducted resistance exercise after L-ornithine hydrochloride or placebo ingestion (0. 1 g/kg). Subjects exercised for 60 min on an ergometer at 50 % VO 2 peak 120 min after resistance exercise. Plasma ornithine concentrations measured immediately, 120 min and 180 min after resistance exercise in the L-ornithine hydrochloride ingestion condition were significantly greater than those in the placebo condition. No significant difference was found in serum growth hor mone concentrations between both conditions (F = 4. 4, p = 0. 065). Serum free fatty acid concentrations were significantly greater immediately after submaximal ergometer bicycle exercise in both conditions than those before ingestion, immediately after resistance exercise and 120 min after resistance exercise (F = 43. 4, p. 001, 300 % - 508 %), but no significant difference was found between both conditions (F = 3. 6, p = 0. 090). A similar trend was observed in serum ketone bodies as well. Although total energy production during submaximal ergometer exercise did not significantly differ (t = 0. 74, p = 0. 238), a significant difference was found in energy production via carbohydrate and lipid oxidation; the former was greater in the Lornithine hydrochloride ingestion condition (t = 1. 89, p = 0. 046, d = 0. 44, 106 %), and the latter was greater in the placebo condition (t = 1. 89, p = 0. 046, d = 0. 78 %, 145 %). From the above, L-ornithine hydrochloride ingestion may not affect lipid metabolism during submaximal endurance exercise following resistance exercise.

30|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, {{although}} milk FAA {{can be considered as}} micronutrients, several amino acids are suspected to have physiological effects in the infant, especially in the first few months after birth. A few animal experiments and clinical trials of FAA supplementation have confirmed these effects. This is particularly the case for glutamine and alanine, the major FAA present in the milk of the three species tested. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body accounting for about 60 % of FAA in human body, and plays many documented roles. For instance, glutamine is a major fuel for the enterocyte, a substrate for purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, a regulator of protein synthesis (Hankard et al. 1996), and a major donor of carbon for gluconeogenesis (Hankard et al. 1997). Glutamine also supports the function of gut associated intestinal mucosal system (Wu and Knabe 1994), and gut redox state (Humbert et al. 2007), and a role of glutamate has recently been proposed for glutamate in the regulation of food intake (Ventura et al. 2012). Studies performed in human infants have shown that glutamine is extensively taken up by splanchnic tissues in {{the first few days of}} life even in preterm infants with a very low birth weight (Darmaun et al. 1997). Supplementation of infant enteral feeding with glutamine was shown to decrease infectious morbidity but not feeding tolerance in very-low birth weight infants (van den Berg et al. 2005). Alanine, a non essential amino acid in human, is a major substrate involved in gluconeogenesis, and in the citric acid cycle. In a rodent model, alanine was shown to compete for the taurine transport site and to reduce renal cortex taurine content after its ingestion (Chesney 1988). Taurine and lysine, the two other prominent FAA in maternal and bovine milk, respectively, are considered key nutrients for growth and development. Through its role in bile acid conjugation, taurine plays a key role in intestinal fat absorption. Taurine also plays a role in the protection of neurons against oxidative damage (Huxtable 1992; Wharton et al. 2004) although its beneficial effect on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome has still to be proven for preterm infants (Verner et al. 2007). The second most abundant FAA in milk rat, proline, is a <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid,</b> a precursor of the polyamines, which play a key role in gut maturation in human neonates (Plaza-Zamora et al. 2013). In addition, proline is a precursor of arginine (Tomlinson et al. 2011), the sole endogenous precursor of nitric oxide, which plays a critical role in the regulation of intestinal blood flow. Arginine supplementation was suggested to decrease risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants (Amin et al. 2002). Wu et al (2011) showed the nutritional importance of the arginine–proline cycle for the growth and development of piglet intestine, and supplementation in arginine increased sow’ milk production and enhanced the growth of suckling piglets (Mateo et al. 2008).|$|E
50|$|Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a {{metabolic}} pathway {{that results in}} the generation of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates.

50|$|During gluconeogenesis {{mitochondrial}} oxaloacetate {{is reduced}} to malate which is then transported out of the mitochondrion, to be oxidized back to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Cytosolic oxaloacetate is then decarboxylated to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is the rate limiting step in the conversion of nearly all the gluconeogenic precursors (such as the <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and lactate) into glucose by the liver and kidney.|$|R
40|$|Intravenous {{infusion}} of dexamethasone (Dex) in the fetal lamb causes a two- to threefold increase in plasma glutamine and other <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and {{a decrease of}} plasma glutamate to approximately one-third of normal. To explore the underlying mechanisms, hepatic <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> uptake and conversion of L-[1 -(13) C]glutamine to L-[1 -(13) C]glutamate and (13) CO(2) were measured in six sheep fetuses before {{and in the last}} 2 h of a 26 -h Dex infusion. Dex decreased hepatic glutamine and alanine uptakes (P < 0. 01) and hepatic glutamate output (P < 0. 001). Hepatic outputs of the glutamate (R(Glu,Gln)) and CO(2) formed from plasma glutamine decreased to 21 (P < 0. 001) and 53 % (P = 0. 009) of control, respectively. R(Glu,Gln), expressed as a fraction of both outputs, decreased (P < 0. 001) from 0. 36 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 18 +/- 0. 04. Hepatic glucose output remained virtually zero throughout the experiment. We conclude that Dex decreases fetal hepatic glutamate output by increasing the routing of glutamate carbon into the citric acid cycle and by decreasing the hepatic uptake of <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R

In a normal 70 kg adult, only about 8,000 kilojoules of glycogen are stored in the body (mostly in the striated muscles).The body also engages in gluconeogenesis to convert glycerol and <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> into glucose for metabolism. Another adaptation is the Cori cycle, which involves shuttling lipid-derived energy in glucose to peripheral glycolytic tissues, which in turn send the lactate back to the liver for resynthesis to glucose.

30|$|The {{positive}} effect of alanine to glycine in Ins 2 +/− {{can be explained}} by upregulated gluconeogenesis (Figure  4 D). In terms of metabolic mechanisms, glycine and alanine are typical <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Relevant metabolic pathways generate glucogenic metabolites in the tricarboxylic-acid cycle and also via the glycine–pyruvate metabolic linkage and alanine shuttle in gluconeogenesis. Alanine is known to be a major gluconeogenic precursor. It has been reported that alanine increased in Ins 2 +/−, and the BS itself was the most important factor related to the alanine metabolism rather than insulin secretion (Robert et al. 1985; Shulman et al. 1980). It has been reported that in hepatocytes, glucose production from glycine increases in diabetic individuals, while this type of glucose production is low under healthy conditions (Hetenyi et al. 1988). Glycine is synthesized from glycolytic intermediates via 3 -phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, which is an NAD-linked enzyme that converts 3 -phosphoglycerate to 3 -phosphohydroxypyruvate (Noguchi et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|<b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{deprivation}} and glucagon are both potent inducers of autography and proteolysis in liver.

Alternatively, glucagon could act independently of <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> To clarify the mode of hormonal action and also {{the relationship between the}} two cellular responses, livers from fed rats were perfused, with and without glucagon, with plasma <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> over a concentration range of 0 to 10 times normal. Individual <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> constancy at each level was ensured by perfusion in the single-pass mode. <b>Amino</b> <b>acids</b> alone strongly regulated autophagy and proteolysis in a coordinated fashion; maximal suppression was achieved at twice normal concentration; both effects increased rapidly to maximum at less than normal concentration.

40|$|This work {{describes}} an exploratory NMR metabonomic study of second trimester maternal urine and plasma, {{in an attempt}} to characterize the metabolic changes underlying prenatal disorders and identify possible early biomarkers. Fetal malformations have the strongest metabolic impact in both biofluids, suggesting effects due to hypoxia (leading to hypoxanthine increased excretion) and a need for enhanced gluconeogenesis, with higher ketone bodies (acetone and 3 -hydroxy-butyric acid) production and TCA cycle demand (suggested by <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and cis-aconitate overproduction). Choline and nucleotide metabolisms also seem affected and a distinct plasma lipids profile is observed for mothers with fetuses affected by central nervous system malformations. Urine from women who subsequently develop gestational diabetes mellitus exhibits higher 3 -hydroxyisovalerate and 2 -hydroxyisobutyrate levels, probably due to altered biotin status and <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> and/or gut metabolisms (the latter possibly related to higher BMI values). Other urinary changes suggest choline and nucleotide metabolic alterations, whereas lower plasma betaine and TMAO levels are found. Chromosomal disorders and pre-preterm delivery groups show urinary changes in choline and, in the latter case, in 2 -hydroxyisobutyrate.

T 1 AM administration induces a profound tissue-specific antilipogenic effect in liver and muscle by lowering gene expression of key regulators of lipid metabolism, PTP 1 B and PLIN 2, significantly increasing metabolites (<b>glucogenic,</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> carnitine, and citrate) levels, while enhancing protection against oxidative stress.

METHODS: Twenty wild-type (WT) and 20 PAH(enu 2) (PKU) C 57 BL/ 6 mice were placed in cages with (exercise, Exe) or without (sedentary, Sed) running wheels during 53 days. At day 43, a balance beam test was performed. Plasma and brain were collected for analyses of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> levels and the oxidative stress parameters superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, sulfhydryl and reduced glutathione (GSH) contents, total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP), and total antioxidant reactivity (TAR). RESULTS: SedPKU showed poor coordination (p < 0. 001) and balance (p < 0. 001), higher plasma and brain phenylalanine (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and increased brain oxidative stress (p < 0. 05) in comparison to SedWT. ExePKU animals ran less than ExeWT (p = 0. 018). Although no improvement was seen in motor coordination and balance, exercise in PKU restored SOD, sulfhydryl content, and TRAP levels to controls.

40|$|Objectives: Early {{nutrition}} influences metabolic {{programming and}} long-term health. We explored the urinary metabolite profiles of 48 premature infants (birth weight < 1500 g) randomized to an enhanced or a standard diet during neonatal hospitalization. Methods: Metabolomics using {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (NMR) was conducted on urine samples obtained {{during the first week}} of life and thereafter fortnightly. Results: The intervention group received significantly higher amounts of energy, protein, lipids, vitamin A, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid as compared to the control group. Enhanced nutrition did not appear to affect the urine profiles to an extent exceeding individual variation. However, in all infants the <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> glycine, threonine, hydroxyproline and tyrosine increased substantially during the early postnatal period, along with metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (succinate, oxoglutarate, fumarate and citrate).

Conclusion: This first nutri-metabolomics study in premature infants demonstrates that the physiological adaptation during the fetal-postnatal transition as well as maturation influences metabolism during the breastfeeding period.

C. albicans was used as a model to study the function of various pairings of the reductase and dehydrogenase from the two ascomycetes. Transcription profiling confirmed the presence of GRE 3 and XYL 2 in growing strains and the absence in non-growing strains. It was found that the CaGRE 3 possessed an N-terminal extension that improved the functioning of heterologous GRE 3 /SOR 1 combinations. Metabolite analysis showed increased import of xylose when subject to xylose adaption compared to unadapted strains. C. albicans is able to use <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> as a source of carbon, with or without the presence of xylose enzymes. Overall, this work establishes the enzymatic interactions between the xylose reductase and xylose dehydrogenase in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, as well as their effects on the cell...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To characterise the {{influence}} of the fat free mass on the metabolite profile in serum samples from participants of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) S 4 study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Analyses were based on metabolite profile from 965 participants of the S 4 and 890 weight-stable subjects of its seven-year follow-up study (KORA F 4). 190 different serum metabolites were quantified in a targeted approach including <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), sphingomyelins and hexose. Associations between metabolite concentrations and the fat free mass index (FFMI) were analysed using adjusted linear regression models. To draw conclusions on enzymatic reactions, intra-metabolite class ratios were explored. Pairwise relationships among metabolites were investigated and illustrated by means of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs). RESULTS: We found 339 significant associations between FFMI and various metabolites in KORA S 4. Among the most prominent associations (p-values 4. 75 × 10 (- 16) - 8. 95 × 10 (- 06)) with higher FFMI were increasing concentrations of the branched chained <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (BCAAs), ratios of BCAAs to <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> and carnitine concentrations. For various PCs, a decrease in chain length or in saturation of the fatty acid moieties could be observed with increasing FFMI, as well as an overall shift from acyl-alkyl PCs to diacyl PCs. These findings were reproduced in KORA F 4. The established GGMs supported the regression results and provided a comprehensive picture of the relationships between metabolites. In a sub-analysis, most of the discovered associations did not exist in obese subjects in contrast to non-obese subjects, possibly indicating derangements in skeletal muscle metabolism. CONCLUSION: A set of serum metabolites strongly associated with FFMI was identified and a network explaining the relationships among metabolites was established.

40|$|Caloric {{restriction}} (CR) increases healthy {{life span}} {{in a range}} of organisms. The underlying mechanisms are not understood but appear to include changes in gene expression, protein function, and metabolism. Recent studies demonstrate that acute CR alters mortality rates within days in flies. Multitissue transcriptional changes and concomitant metabolic responses to acute CR have not been described. We generated whole genome RNA transcript profiles in liver, skeletal muscle, colon, and hypothalamus and simultaneously measured plasma metabolites using proton nuclear magnetic resonance in mice subjected to acute CR. Liver and muscle showed increased gene expressions associated with fatty acid metabolism and a reduction in those involved in hepatic lipid biosynthesis. <b>Glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> increased in plasma, and gene expression for hepatic gluconeogenesis was enhanced. Increased expression of genes for hormone-mediated signaling and decreased expression of genes involved in protein binding and development occurred in hypothalamus. Cell proliferation genes were decreased and cellular transport genes increased in colon. Acute CR captured many, but not all, hepatic transcriptional changes of long-term CR. Our findings demonstrate a clear transcriptional response across multiple tissues during acute CR, with congruent plasma metabolite changes. Liver and muscle switched gene expression away from energetically expensive biosynthetic processes toward energy conservation and utilization processes, including fatty acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. Both muscle and colon switched gene expression away from cellular proliferation. Mice undergoing acute CR rapidly adopt many transcriptional and metabolic changes of long-term CR, suggesting that the beneficial effects of CR may require only a short-term reduction in caloric intake...|$|R
40|$|The {{first goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{investigate}} whether totally pancreatectomized patients are glucagon deficient and if so, to what degree. Immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) concentrations in peripheral plasma of nine pancreatectomized patients were not significantly different from those of 10 normal controls as measured by two antisera (30 -K and RCS- 5) both detecting the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule and one (RCS- 5) postulated to be specific for pancreatic glucagon. Plasma from six of nine pancreatectomized patients were fractionated over Sephadex G- 50 and IRG was measured with both antisera in the column eluates. Using 30 -K, 80. 8 +/- 9 % of the IRG eluted within the void volume. This material was rechromatographed on Sephadex G- 200 and found to have an apparent mol wt of approximately 200, 000. Only 18. 3 +/- 9 % eluted in the IRG 3500 region. IRG 3500 was significantly reduced in pancreatectomized patients as compared to normal controls (49 +/- 9 vs. 18 +/- 9 pg/ml, P less than 0. 05). Using RCS- 5, all IRG (corresponding to 20 +/- 6 pg/ml of plasma) eluted in the IRG 3500 region. The second {{goal of this}} study was to investigate the effects of chronic glucagon deficiency on plasma <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> In the nine pancreatectomized patients studied, postabsorptive plasma concentrations of serine, alanine, arginine, glycine, threonine, citrulline, alpha-aminobutyrate, and tryosine were significantly elevated compared to values obtained from 20 normal controls. Physiological glucagon increments produced in two pancreatectomized patients by infusion of glucagon (6. 25 and 8. 0 microgram/h, respectively) resulted in normalization of the hyperaminoacidemia within 22 h. We conclude (a) that pancreatectomized patients are partially glucagon deficient because of diminished basal as well as diminished stimulated glucagon secretion; (b) that fasting concentrations of certain <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> are elevated in pancreatectomized patients probably as result of reduce; hepatic gluconeogenesis; and (c) that the RCS- 5 antiserum is not "pancreatic glucagon" specific...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} {{during the}} perinatal period influence metabolic and developmental processes in mammals and avian species, which could impact pre- and postnatal survival and development. The current {{study investigated the}} effect of eggshell temperature (EST) on glucose metabolism in broiler chicken embryos. Broiler eggs were incubated at a high (38. 9 °C) or normal (37. 8 °C) EST from day 10. 5 of incubation onward and were injected with a bolus of [U- 13 C]glucose in the chorio-allantoic fluid at day 17. 5 of incubation. After [U- 13 C]glucose administration, 13 C enrichment was determined in intermediate pools and end-products of glucose metabolism. Oxidation of labeled glucose occurred for approximately 3 days after injection. Glucose oxidation was higher in the high than in the normal EST treatment from day 17. 6 until 17. 8 of incubation. The overall recovery of 13 CO 2 tended to be 4. 7 % higher in the high than in the normal EST treatment. An increase in EST (38. 9 °C vs 37. 8 °C) increased 13 C enrichment in plasma lactate at day 17. 8 of incubation and 13 C in hepatic glycogen at day 18. 8 of incubation. Furthermore, high compared to normal EST resulted in a lower yolk-free body mass at day 20. 9 (- 2. 74 g) and 21. 7 (- 3. 81 g) of incubation, a lower hepatic glycogen concentration at day 18. 2 (- 4. 37 mg/g) and 18. 8 (- 4. 59 mg/g) of incubation, and a higher plasma uric acid concentration (+ 2. 8 mg/mL/+ 43 %) at day 21. 6 of incubation. These {{results indicate that the}} glucose oxidation pattern is relatively slow, but the intensity increased consistently with an increase in developmental stage of the embryo. High environmental temperatures in the perinatal period of chicken embryos increased glucose oxidation and decreased hepatic glycogen prior to the hatching process. This may limit glucose availability for successful hatching and could impact body development, probably by increased gluconeogenesis from <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> to allow anaerobic glycolysi...|$|R
40|$|Suboptimal {{incubation}} conditions can negatively affect survival {{and development of}} chicken embryos. However, physiological mechanisms that may explain these effects, and the long-lasting consequences are largely unknown. Therefore, the first aim of this thesis was to investigate effects of eggshell temperature (EST) and O 2 availability during incubation on survival, development, physiology, and nutrient utilization of chicken embryos. The second aim was to investigate long-lasting effects of suboptimal EST on survival and subsequent performance of broiler chickens. The first study investigated effects of a high (38. 9 °C) or a normal (37. 8 °C) EST combined with a low (17 %), normal (21 %), or high (25 %) O 2 concentration from day 7 until 19 of incubation on the survival rate, nutrient utilization, and the developmental and physiological status of broiler embryos. The second study investigated effects of high EST on glucose metabolism in broiler embryos using [U- 13 C]glucose. The third study investigated effects of high EST on growth performance and the incidence of ascites in broiler chickens. Finally, effects of a high EST and {{a hole in the}} air cell on the developmental and physiological status of layer hatchlings were investigated. Results showed that a high EST or low O 2 availability from the first week of incubation onward negatively affected survival and development of broiler chickens from their perinatal period until slaughter age. Body development of broiler hatchlings was reduced after high EST incubation because of a lower efficiency in protein utilization for growth. This was possibly due to the use of <b>glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> as a <b>glucogenic</b> energy source, because high EST increased the glucose oxidation in broiler embryos {{during the second half of}} incubation and resulted in lower hepatic glycogen. Body development was proportional to the O 2 availability during incubation. In addition, differences in O 2 concentration during incubation seem to affect the development of adaptive mechanisms, and these mechanisms might possible influence nutrient utilization and body development. High EST in the last week of incubation in layer embryos negatively affected hatchling development, but the effect of a hole in the air cell was minimal. Effects of high EST were long-lasting in broiler chickens expressed by a lower body weight and a higher ascites incidence during the growout period. In conclusion, negative effects of suboptimal {{incubation conditions}} can be partly explained by changes in nutrient utilization and metabolite levels in the perinatal period and can have long-lasting effects on the survival and performance of broiler chickens...|$|R
40|$|Back Ground Severe and {{complicated}} Plasmodium falciparum infections continue {{to threaten the}} survival of young children in sub-Saharan Africa. A reduction in the mortality and morbidity may only come about by {{better understanding of the}} pathophysiological processes that are responsible for the manifestation of severe malaria. Hypoglycemia is a frequently encountered complication in falciparum malaria that is usually ascribed to increased glucose uptake and impaired glucose production caused by the inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This study sets out to examine the pathophysiological aspects of severe malaria in children related to blood glucose homeostasis, prevalence and possible causes of hypoglycaemia in severe malaria. It also examines clinical indicators and laboratory parameters associated with severe malaria in children, so as to propose appropriate laboratory tests as indicators for high risk children with severe malaria. Patients and Methods This is a cross- sectional cohort study based on clinical presentations and laboratory findings. It was conducted at Khartoum Paediatric and Bashaeir Hospitals during the period September 2006 to September 2007. The total number of patients with malaria included in this study and confirmed by thin and thick blood films were 80 patients. Children from 0 to 12 years with Plasmodium falciparum infection were included in the study using the WHO inclusion criteria for severe malaria (45 children). For comparison a matched group of uncomplicated malaria was studied (35 children). All patients underwent a complete clinical examination with general and systemic examination by a medical doctor in hospital. Five ml of venous blood were taken from each patient in both groups on admission after informed consent. All laboratory investigations were done on blood samples collocted before treatment. Hb, K+, Random blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, urea and the serum <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> were measured in both groups of patients. Results 11 Children with severe malaria were younger (mean age, 4. 7 years) compared to those with uncomplicated malaria (mean age, 8. 1 years). Hypoglycaemia was an uncommon complication; it was found only in two patients, (4. 4 %) of patients with severe malaria. No difference was found in random blood glucose levels in children with severe and uncomplicated malaria (99. 58 and 96. 18 mg/dl respectively). The mean insulin level was significantly lower in patients with severe malaria 5. 31 mIU/L, compared with the mean in the uncomplicated malaria group 8. 59 mIU/L (P, 0. 01). The mean of C-peptide was nearly equal between the two groups and no significant difference was found. However the incidence of hypoinsulinaemia in severe malaria was significantly higher (P, 0. 002). Hypokalaemia was found to be common in both groups but the incidence was much higher in patients with uncomplicated malaria. Arginine concentrations were low in individuals with severe malaria (25. 63 μmol/l) and uncomplicated malaria (29. 79 μmol/l). Arginine was significantly lower in severely anaemic patients (19. 3 μmol/l) compared with uncomplicated malaria (29. 79 μmol/l). But it was also found that most of the <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> were consistently lower in patients with anaemia. <b>Glucogenic</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> did not show differences between the two groups. Phenylalanine was significantly higher in severe malaria than uncomplicated malaria (P = 0. 001), particularly in cerebral malaria. Large neutral <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (except tryptophane) were significantly higher in patients with cerebral malaria. Children who had convulsions did not show any significant difference in the mean of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> except for Phenylalanine which was significantly higher; but not to the extent found in cerebral malaria. Conclusions: Hypoglycaemia was an uncommon complication in this study. The study suggests unimpaired gluconeogenesis in severe and uncomplicated malaria except for the two patients with hypoglycaemia. Insulin levels were significantly low in the severe malaria group compared with uncomplicated malaria. As C-peptide did not show a difference between the two groups. This study suggests a decreased half life of insulin in severe malaria. Arginine concentrations were low in individuals with severe and 12 uncomplicated malaria which indicates reduced NO production and therefore reduced killing of patients. Large neutral <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and in particular phenylalanine were significantly higher in CNS involvement and may be part of the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria...|$|R
