25|$|Several {{members of}} the United States Congress have called for {{mandatory}} production of flexible fuel vehicles. Also the E85 and Biodiesel Access Act proposed to modify current IRS limits on the tax credit which today only allows for the amount a dual <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser</b> exceeds {{the cost of a}} conventional dispenser. The E85 and Biodiesel Access Act would increase the credit from 30 {{percent of the cost of}} clean fueling property to 50 percent and increase the maximum credit to $100,000.

25|$|If {{a filling}} station allows {{customers}} to pay at the register, {{the data from}} the dispensers may be transmitted via RS232, RS485 or Ethernet to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station's building, and fed into the station's cash register operating system. The cash register system gives a limited control over the <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser,</b> and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank's status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data is fed to a terminal in the back room, where it can be downloaded or printed out. Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank data transmitted directly into an external database.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser</b> {{is used to}} pump gasoline, diesel, {{or other}} types of fuel into {{vehicles}} or containers. As the automobile was not invented yet, the gas pump was used for kerosene lamps and stoves. Sylvanus F. Bowser of Fort Wayne, Indiana invented the gasoline/petrol pump on September 5, 1885.

50|$|A <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser</b> is {{a machine}} at a filling station {{that is used}} to pump gasoline, petrol, diesel, CNG, CGH2, HCNG, LPG, LH2, ethanol fuel, {{biofuels}} like biodiesel, kerosene, or other types of fuel into vehicles.

Besides <b>fuel</b> <b>dispensers,</b> one other significant device which {{is also found in}} filling stations and can refuel certain (compressed-air) vehicles is an air compressor, although generally these are just used to inflate car tyres. Also, many filling stations incorporate a convenience store, which like most other buildings generally have electricity sockets; hence plug-in electric vehicles can be recharged.|$|R

5000|$|A Pyréolophore engine {{consists}} of two principal interconnected chambers: a [...] chamber and a combustion chamber. There is also a bellows for injecting air, a <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser,</b> an ignition device, and a submerged exhaust pipe.

50|$|The {{company is}} named after the Norwegian John J. Tokheim. Working in a {{hardware}} store in Iowa, he was conscious {{of the dangers of}} storing fuel. In 1898, he designed an exterior storage system, served by a modified water pump. This development had the advantage of allowing him to accurately meter the delivery of fuel. In 1901, he patented the world's first vehicle <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{forecourt}} is {{the part}} of a filling station where vehicles are refueled. <b>Fuel</b> <b>dispensers</b> are placed on concrete plinths, as a precautionary measure. Additional elements may be employed, including metal barriers. The area around the <b>fuel</b> <b>dispensers</b> must have a drainage system. Since fuel sometimes spills on the ground, as little of it as possible should penetrate the soil. Any liquids present on the forecourt will flow into a channel drain before it enters a petrol interceptor which is designed to capture any hydrocarbon pollutants and filter these from rainwater which may then proceed to a foul sewer, stormwater drain or to ground.|$|R
50|$|In cascade storage {{systems for}} {{hydrogen}} storage, as for example at hydrogen stations, <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser</b> A draws hydrogen from tank A, while dispenser B draws fuel from hydrogen tank B. If dispenser A is over-utilized, tank A will become depleted before tank B. At {{this point the}} dispenser A is switched to tank C. Tank C will then supply dispenser A and B and tank A until tank A is filled to the same pressure as tank B and the dispensers are disconnected, after which the control system will close the control valves to switch to its former state.|$|E

50|$|A {{suitably}} sized chamois skin is soaked in clean fuel and {{placed over the}} grid in the funnel and brought up the sides, forming a bowl, to prevent any leakage past the skin. Fuel can then be pumped {{into the top of}} the funnel by the <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser</b> and watched for signs of water accumulation. The process can be stopped to lift out the assembly from the tank and the trapped water removed so that the job can be continued. Chamois leather is used thus as a fuel filter by boaters, auto detailers—and aircraft refuellers, particularly of a past age when aircraft were flown into very remote areas.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>fuel</b> <b>dispensers</b> had a {{very wide}} range of designs to solve the {{mechanical}} problems of mechanical pumping, reliable measurement, safety, and aesthetics. This has led to some popularity in collecting antique dispensers, especially in the USA.|$|R

Wetterman had come out to assist and had begun talking to Vest. Johnson had then exited the car from the driver’s side and had walked {{to the back of}} the vehicle. Vest had asked him if he had the gun on him, to which Johnson had responded by lifting his shirt to display the pistol tucked into his trousers. As Vest had {{replaced}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser,</b> he heard a shot and had looked around to see Wetterman falling to the ground. Vest and Johnson had hurried into the car and sped away.|$|E

50|$|Skimming is {{the crime}} of getting private {{information}} about somebody else's credit card used in an otherwise normal transaction. The thief can procure a victim's card number using basic methods such as photocopying receipts or more advanced methods such as using a small electronic device (skimmer) to swipe and store hundreds of victims’ card numbers. Common scenarios for skimming are restaurants or bars where the skimmer has possession of the victim's payment card out of their immediate view. The thief may also use a small keypad to unobtrusively transcribe the 3 or 4 digit Card Security Code, which is not present on the magnetic strip. Call centers are another area where skimming can easily occur. Skimming can also occur at merchants such as gas stations when a third-party card-reading device is installed either outside or inside a <b>fuel</b> <b>dispenser</b> or other card-swiping terminal. This device allows a thief to capture a customer’s card information, including their PIN, with each card swipe.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>fuel</b> <b>dispensers</b> are {{the focal}} point of distributing fuel to the general public, and fuel is a {{hazardous}} substance, they are subject to stringent requirements regarding safety, accuracy and security.

40|$|Regularly on {{the filling}} {{stations}} (FS) there are failures at priming of transport vehicles, when a driver, driving away after priming, forgets to smuggle {{out of a}} pistol {{from the mouth of}} filling tank of car.
