40|$|Wintering {{of dairy}} cows on high {{yielding}} forage crops {{is a key}} contributor towards total farm nitrate leaching loses. High stocking density’s, and subsequent excretion of nitrogen- loaded urine, onto bare, saturated soils results in high nitrate leaching rates. Incorporation of standoff facilities into traditional in situ wintering systems has been suggested as a viable approach to mitigating nitrate leaching., but limited quantitative data exists for percentage of urine captured, {{and the performance of}} non-lactating dairy cows wintered under such systems. Two winter systems were compared between June and July 2017 at the Ashley Dene Research and Development Station (ADRDS). Both systems fed <b>fodderbeet</b> (7 KgDM/cow/day <b>fodderbeet,</b> 4 Kg DM/cow/day silage) but in the control system, cows spent 23 hours/day grazing <b>fodderbeet</b> in situ, with a one hour supplement allocation period on a concrete feedpad while the comparison was a standoff pad system, were cows were restricted to a 6 hour <b>fodderbeet</b> allocation period (plus one hour on the feedpad), and spent 17 hours/day on a variety of stand of pad surfaces (stones, sand, woodchip and carpet). To quantify variation in urine deposition between the two systems, PEETER urine sensors were attached to cows and used to measure urination frequency and volume. Urination behavior from eight cows were successfully measured for a period of 24 hours. To compare the suitability of the farms systems from a production perspective, <b>fodderbeet</b> and supplement utilization, cow liveweight, and body condition score were also measured throughout the trial. Results show {{there was no difference in}} dry matter utilization (94. 2 + ± 3. 4 %), and liveweight gain (580 ± 6. 7 gCow/day) between systems. Apparent energy consumption (123 MJME/cow/day) suggested that body condition score gain targets of 0. 5 units would be achievable over a 60 day wintering period. Urination behavior was unaffected by wintering system, with average urination event volumes, urination event frequency’s, and total daily urine volumes of (1. 8 ± 1. 03 l/event), (8. 37 ± 4. 34 events/day) and (15. 12 ± 5. 5 l/cow/day) were recorded. The percentage of total urine captured under the standoff pad system (82 ± 8. 66 %) suggest that the expected quantity captured is reflective of the duration of a stand off period. When compared to a 24 hour in situ system, the capture of 82 % of urine reduced estimated urine coverage from 54. 6 % to 9. 6 % of total paddock area. Based on established leaching values under <b>fodderbeet</b> in stony, Canterbury soil types, this reduction in paddock urine coverage resulted in an estimated reduction in winter nitrate leaching of 31. 4 Kg N/ha or 61. 6 %. It was therefore concluded that stand off pad systems can be effectively used to mitigate winter nitrate leaching whilst maintaining acceptable levels of cow performance...|$|E
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} was conducted under greenhouse conditions with two subspecies of beet, <b>fodderbeet</b> (Beta vulgaris cv. Majoral) and seabeet (Beta maritima), under saline conditions. Growth and physiological parameters (dry weight, leaf area, water relations and net photosynthesis) were recorded. The two subspecies responded differently {{in terms of}} growth parameters. Plant growth was significantly reduced at 400 mM NaCl, while no significant growth reduction occurred at 200 mM NaCl. Fairly high values of relative growth rate {{were associated with the}} leaf area of the cultivars. The water content of the shoot decreased with plant age. The <b>fodderbeet</b> cultivar. Majoral showed a significant increase in dry matter at 200 mM NaCl after 5 weeks. This growth improvement {{may be related to the}} better adaptation of the plants under saline conditions...|$|E
40|$|During germination, {{cultivar}} Monoval tolerated the salinity {{as well as}} higher temperature {{better as}} compared to Majoral, Monored and Polygroeningia cultivars of <b>fodderbeet</b> (Beta vulgaris). Whereas, cultivar Majoral had the lowest salinity and temperature tolerance during germination. The number of leaves, leaf length and root girth was not affected in cvs. Monoval and Monored under same soil conditions. Fresh weight of leaves and beet in cv. Majoral increased significantly over control. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in cv. Majoral increased significantly. Total protein of leaf and sugar content of beet were comparatively higher under saline conditions {{as compared to the}} non-saline soil...|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse {{studies on}} <b>fodderbeet</b> cultivars Beta vulgaris (cvs. Majoral, Monored, and Polygroeningia) and of Beta maritima (Seabeet) showed {{significant}} differences for Relative Growth Rate (RGR) among themselves while {{no significant differences}} were observed for salinity treatments until the first harvest. Plants had adapted themselves to salinity after six weeks of treatment and showed significant differences in RGR and Net Assimilation Rate (NAR) during the whole period of growth. Leaf thickness did not change significantly with salinity. B. vulgaris cv. Majoral and B. maritima were found to be better adapted 150 mM NaCl concentration in soil solution than cv. Monored and Polygroeningia under greenhouse conditions...|$|E
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} saline sodic soil (pH = 9. 49, EC = 7. 92 dSm‾ 1, SAR = 73. 26, ESP = 51. 64) {{to determine the effect}} of farm yard manure (FYM) amendment on the growth of <b>fodderbeet</b> using two types of seeds i. e. coated and non-coated. Shoot growth was enhanced by the addition of FYM in either non saline or saline sodic soil. Non-coated seeds produced taller plants than coated ones. Root growth was slower than shoot. Number of leaves/plant significantly (P < 0. 05) increased by the addition of FYM to the soil. Plant fresh and dry weight is increased in the presence of FYM in the soil. Protein and chlorophyll "b" content increased in plants produced from the coated seeds in the presence of FYM treatment...|$|E
40|$|The South Island {{high country}} makes up 15 % of New Zealand’s total land area. Farm systems in this {{environment}} are typified by large expanses of low producing land and extensive livestock operations. Increasingly the potential to increase system intensity in the high country through developed and specialised pastures is being realised {{and as a result}} there is a growing interest in high country land development. This interest and potential for increase in farm productivity and profitability from land development form the basis for this study. The feasibility and economic opportunity for development of marginal hill land in a South Island high country environment was investigated based on farmer case study information, and computer based modelling using Farmax Pro and Microsoft Excel linear programming. Five scenarios were produced to highlight a range of land use options and potential development outcomes above that of the baseline, Oversown Hill, model. Development scenarios include, intensively cropped pasture of Plantain/Red Clover on both areas of flat and steep topography, permanent grass/clover pasture on steep topography, and a Selective Development scenario combining areas of undeveloped land, intensive Plantain/Red Clover, and <b>Fodderbeet</b> winter forage crop. The scenarios were produced based on a combination of historic data gathered from farmer interviews and assumptions drawn from appropriate literature. All scenarios were constructed and analysed using Farmax Pro and then reproduced in a Microsoft Excel linear programme as a means of result validation. Scenarios were based on production from a Romney maternal ewe flock with the driver being to maximise livestock productivity from the available area, 100 ha. The key metric for success of development scenarios was profitability, measured as EBIT/ha...|$|E
