This randomised phase II trial was designed to assess the activity and safety of a high-dose infusional weekly 5 FU alone (HDFU) and the combination of 5 FU, folinic acid (FA) and CDDP. Patients were included if they had histologically proven locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma, World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status < or = 2, bilirubin < 2 x upper normal limit, adequate haematological and renal functions and had not received prior chemotherapy, even in the adjuvant setting. Treatments: Arm A (HDFU) consisted of cycles of 5 FU 3 g/m(2) intravenously (i. v.), 24 h infusion, weekly, for 6 weeks, followed by 1 week rest, every 7 weeks; Arm B (5 FU+FA+CDDP) consisted of cycles of 5 FU 2. 0 g/m(2) i. v. with folinic acid 500 mg/m(2), 2 h-infusion, weekly, for 6 weeks, followed by 1 week rest plus cisplatin 50 mg/m(2), once every two weeks, for 6 weeks, followed by 1 week rest, every 7 weeks. From February 1997 to June 1999, 58 patients were randomised (29 <b>in</b> each <b>arm).</b> Patients had a median age of 58 years <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> A and 62 years <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> B, locally advanced disease was present in 21 % of the patients <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> A and 11 % <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> B.

Twenty-eight patients were eligible <b>in</b> each <b>arm</b> and one patient did not start the allocated therapy <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> B. The median number of cycles was 2 [range 1 - 12] <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> A and 2 [range 1 - 6] <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> B.

40|$|This {{randomized}} {{trial was}} designed to investigate the feasibility, toxicity, and activity of two different schedules of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in previously untreated patients with advanced (International Union Against Cancer (UICC) Stage IIIB-IV) nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). METHODS: From February 1997 to September 1998, 82 patients with advanced NSCLC were entered onto the study and were randomized to gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on Days 1, 8, and 15 plus cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) on Day 2 (arm A) or Day 15 (arm B) every 28 days. RESULTS: All the patients were assessable for toxicity (arm A/arm B: 151 / 177 cycles; median, 4 of 5 cycles per patient), and the following Grade 3 - 4 toxicities were reported (percentage of cycles <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A vs. arm B) : anemia, 7. 9 % and 2. 3 % (P < 0. 05); leukopenia, 6. 0 % and 6. 7 %; thrombocytopenia, 15. 0 % and 1. 6 % (P < 0. 01); no World Health Organization (WHO) Grade 3 - 4 nonhematologic toxicities were observed. These side effects led to gemcitabine dose reductions in 35. 1 % of courses <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 22. 0 % of courses <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (P < 0. 05) and to gemcitabine omissions in 28. 5 % of courses <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A versus 7. 3 % of courses <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (P < 0. 01). Dose intensities (DIs) of gemcitabine were 607. 5 mg/m(2) /week <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 711. 6 mg/m(2) /week <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (P < 0. 01); DIs of cisplatin were 18. 1 mg/m(2) /week <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 18. 8 mg/m(2) /week <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B. The total delivered doses of gemcitabine were 9315. 5 mg/m(2) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 12, 631. 0 mg/m(2) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (P < 0. 01); the total delivered doses of cisplatin were 277. 1 mg/m(2) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 333. 0 mg/m(2) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (P < 0. 01). Response rates according to intention to treat were 40. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 25. 5 - 55. 3) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 45 % (95 % CI, 29. 5 - 60. 5) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B. The overall median duration of response was 7. 4 months; the median time to disease progression was 6 months (95 % CI, 3 - 9) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 9 months (95 % CI, 4 - 14) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (P < 0. 02); the median overall survival was 10 months (95 % CI, 7. 0 - 12. 5) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 17 months (95 % CI, 13. 0 - 21. 6) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (P < 0. 01); the 1 -year survival rates were 34 % and 63 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that arm B (cisplatin on Day 15) is less toxic than arm A (cisplatin on Day 2) and allows the administration of significantly higher total doses and dose intensities of chemotherapy. No significant differences in response rates were observed between the two schedules; patients on arm B experienced a significantly more prolonged progression free and overall survival; however, the study was not powered to detect differences in these outcomes.

40|$|Background: Paclitaxel and platinum-based {{chemotherapy}} {{is considered}} to be a standard approach for locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In recent years, paclitaxel on a weekly schedule in combination with carboplatin has been widely used because it is associated with a lower incidence of neuropathy and myelosuppression.

Purpose: The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin compared with the classic 3 -weekly schedule of paclitaxel and carboplatin as initial therapy and the feasibility of subsequent maintenance therapy versus observation in elderly patients with locally advanced (stage IIIB) and metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC. Patients and methods: Ninty patients ⩾ 65  years with stage IIIB–IV NSCLC were randomly assigned to one of the following arms: arm 1, paclitaxel 90  mg/m 2 weekly for 3 of 4  weeks with carboplatin (area under the curve {AUC} =  6) on day 1 of each 4  week cycle; and arm 2, paclitaxel 200  mg/m 2 with carboplatin (AUC =  6) on day 1 of each 3 -week. After four cycles of chemotherapy, those with objective response or stable disease were randomized to weekly paclitaxel (70  mg/m 2, 3 of 4  weeks) or observation as maintenance therapy. Primary end point was response while second end points included survival and toxicity. Results: Eighty-six patients were evaluable for response, overall responses were recorded in 42. 9 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> 1 versus 31. 8 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> 2; stable disease was 38. 1 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> 1 versus 27. 3 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> 2 and progressive disease was 19 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> 1 versus 40. 9 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> 2.

Recommended phase II dose for arm A is pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 and bortezomib 1. 3 mg/m 2 twice weekly. For arm B, the recommended dose is pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2, bortezomib 1. 6 mg/m 2 weekly. ConclusionsPemetrexed with bortezomib is feasible and tolerable at recommended single-agent doses. Based on the observed efficacy, a phase II study in non-small cell lung cancer is warranted...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE The antiepidermal {{growth factor}} {{receptor}} monoclonal antibody cetuximab has improved survival {{in patients with}} metastatic, chemotherapy-refractory, wild-type K-RAS colorectal cancer. The addition of brivanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and fibroblast growth factor receptor, to cetuximab has shown encouraging early clinical activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with combination chemotherapy were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive cetuximab 400 mg/m 2 intravenous loading dose followed by weekly maintenance of 250 mg/m 2 plus either brivanib 800 mg orally daily (arm A) or placebo (arm B). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS A total of 750 patients were randomly assigned (376 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 374 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B). Median OS in the intent-to-treat population was 8. 8 months <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 8. 1 months <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 88; 95 % CI, 0. 74 to 1. 03; P =. 12). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5. 0 months <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 3. 4 months <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (HR, 0. 72; 95 % CI, 0. 62 to 0. 84; P <. 001). Partial responses observed (13. 6 % v 7. 2 %; P =. 004) were higher <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A. Incidence of any grade ≥ 3 adverse events was 78 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 53 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B. Fewer patients received ≥ 90 % dose-intensity of both cetuximab (57 % v 83 %) and brivanib/placebo (48 % v 87 %) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A versus arm B, respectively. CONCLUSION Despite positive effects on PFS and objective response, cetuximab plus brivanib increased toxicity and did not significantly improve OS in patients with metastatic, chemotherapy-refractory, wild-type K-RAS colorectal cancer.

40|$|Patients with {{measurable}} or evaluable locally advanced or metastatic {{squamous cell}} carcinoma of the oesophagus were treated with cisplatin (CDDP), 100 mg/m 2, combined with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) at a dose of 1000 mg/m 2 as a continuous infusion from days 1 - 5 (Arm A) or with CDDP alone (Arm B). Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. 92 patients were randomised centrally, 88 were eligible. The response rate was 35 % (95 % CI (confidence interval), 20 - 54 %) <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> A and 19 % (95 % CI, 8 - 35 %) <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> B. One complete response was observed <b>in</b> each <b>arm.</b> The median duration of survival was 33 weeks and 28 weeks for Arm A and Arm B, respectively. Haematological and non-haematological toxicities were more frequent and more severe <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> A. The most prominent toxicities were grade 4 aplasia and septicaemia (2), meningeal haemorrhage (1), cerebrovascular accident (3) and ischaemia of the lower limbs (1) all occurring <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> A. Overall, seven treatment-related deaths (16 %) were observed <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> A, none <b>in</b> <b>Arm</b> E. The severe side-effects induced by the combination suggest that, currently, no standard chemotherapy can be recommended for patients with advanced squamous cell oesophageal cancer.

40|$|Background: Pakistan faces huge {{challenges}} in eradicating polio due to widespread poliovirus transmission and security challenges. Innovative interventions are urgently needed to strengthen community buy-in, {{to increase the}} coverage of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and other routine immunisations, and to enhance immunity through the introduction of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in combination with OPV. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability and effect on immunisation coverage of an integrated strategy for community engagement and {{maternal and child health}} immunisation campaigns in insecure and conflict-affected polio-endemic districts of Pakistan. Methods: We did a community-based three-arm cluster randomised trial in healthy children aged 1 month to 5 years that resided within the study sites in three districts of Pakistan at high risk of polio. Clusters were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm using restricted randomisation in blocks of 20 by an external statistician (1 : 1 : 1) to receive routine polio programme activities (control, arm A), additional interventions with community outreach and mobilisation using an enhanced communication package and provision of short-term preventive maternal and child health services and routine immunisation (health camps), including OPV (arm B), or all interventions of arm B with additional provision of IPV delivered at the maternal and child health camps (arm C). An independent team conducted surveys at baseline, endline, and after each round of supplementary immunisation activity for acceptability and effect. The primary outcome measures for the study were coverage of OPV, IPV, and routine extended programme on immunisation vaccines and changes in the proportion of unvaccinated and fully vaccinated children. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01908114. Findings: Between June 4, 2013, and May 31, 2014, 387 clusters were randomised (131 to arm A, 127 to arm B, and 129 to arm C). At baseline, 28   760 children younger than 5 years were recorded <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A, 30   098 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B, and 29   126 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> C. 359 clusters remained in the trial until the end (116 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A, 120 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B, and 123 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> C; with 23   334 children younger than 5 years <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A, 26   110 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B, and 25   745 <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> C). The estimated OPV coverage was 75 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A compared with 82 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (difference vs arm A 6 · 6 %; 95 % CI 4 · 8 – 8 · 3) and 84 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> C (8 · 5 %, 6 · 8 – 10 · 1; overall p< 0 · 0001). The mean proportion of routine vaccine doses received by children younger than 24 months of age was 43 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A, 52 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B (9 %, 7 – 11) and 54 % <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> C (11 %, 9 – 13; overall p< 0 · 0001). No serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation were reported after immunisation. Interpretation: Despite the challenges associated with the polio end-game in high-risk, conflict-affected areas of Pakistan, a strategy of community mobilisation and targeted community-based health and immunisation camps during polio immunisation campaigns was successful in increasing vaccine coverage, including polio vaccine coverage.

5|$|In 1529, Pedrarias Dávila sent an {{expedition}} led by Martín de Estete to annex {{the territory of}} El Salvador to his domains in neighbouring Nicaragua, {{going so far as}} to distribute the unconquered natives of the Gulf of Fonseca in encomienda to his followers. At the time, Diego de Rojas was in command of the Spanish forces attempting to pacify indigenous resistance centred on Popocatepet. In January or February 1530, Martín de Estete captured Rojas, and marched on San Salvador, but was unable to gain the support of the residents there, and set up camp at Perulapan (modern San Martín Perulapán), just to the south, which he called Ciudad de los Caballeros ("City of the Knights"). The acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Orduña, sent his captain Francisco López at the head of {{an expedition}} to drive out the interlopers. López left Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala in March 1530 with thirty cavalry, and an unspecified body of infantry. The residents of San Salvador rose up <b>in</b> <b>arms</b> to join the relief force; Estete abandoned his camp and retreated towards Nicaragua, taking with him 2000 enslaved Cuzcatlecos. López pursued Estete and caught up with his forces after crossing the Lempa River. Estete and his second-in-command fled for Nicaragua, and his soldiers surrendered to López. Diego de Rojas was freed, and the slaves recovered. This intervention put an end to Pedrarias Dávila's hopes of securing El Salvador as part of Nicaragua.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phase II {{randomised}} trial was to determine which of two schemes, raltitrexed-irinotecan or raltitrexed-oxaliplatin, offered better activity and less toxicity in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 94 patients with previously untreated metastatic CRC were included and randomised to receive raltitrexed 3 [*]mg[*]m− 2 followed by oxaliplatin 130 [*]mg[*]m− 2 on day 1 (arm A), or CPT- 11 350 [*]mg[*]m− 2 followed by raltitrexed 3 [*]mg[*]m− 2 (<b>arm</b> B). <b>In</b> both <b>arms</b> treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed an overall response rate of 46 % (95 % CI, 29. 5 – 57. 7 %) for arm A, and 34 % (95 % CI, 19. 8 – 48. 4 %) for arm B. Median time to progression was 8. 2 months for arm A and 8. 8 months for arm B. After a median follow-up of 14 months, 69 % of patients included <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A were still alive, compared to 59 % of those included <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B. Overall, 31 patients (65 %) experienced some episode of toxicity <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 32 patients (70 %) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B, usually grade 1 – 2. The most common toxicity was hepatic, with 29 patients (60 %) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A and 24 patients (62 %) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B, and was grade 3 – 4 in four (8 %) and four (9 %) patients, respectively. In all, 14 patients (29 %) from arm A and 24 patients (52 %) from arm B had some grade of diarrhoea (P< 0. 03). Neurologic toxicity was observed in 31 patients (64 %) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> A, and was grade 3 – 4 in five patients (10 %), while a cholinergic syndrome was detected in nine patients (19 %) <b>in</b> <b>arm</b> B.
