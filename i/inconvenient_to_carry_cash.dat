5000|$|In Canada, {{the debit}} card is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "bank card". It is a client card issued by a bank that provides access to funds and other bank account transactions, such as transferring funds, checking balances, paying bills, etc., as well as point of purchase transactions connected on the Interac network. Since its national launch in 1994, Interac Direct Payment has become so widespread that, as of 2001, more transactions in Canada were completed using debit cards than cash. This popularity may be partially attributable to two main factors: the convenience of not having <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>cash,</b> and the availability of automated bank machines (ABMs) and Direct Payment merchants on the network.|$|R

The first expedient was to try a lighter substitute. Laws were passed giving value to linen and cotton, in the raw material; then compounded and manufactured; next, written on, and reduced in bulk, until, having passed through the several gradations of wrapping-paper, brown-paper, foolscap and blotting-paper, and having set the plan fairly at work, and got confidence thoroughly established, the system was perfected by a coup de main,--'promises' in words were substituted for all other coin.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that strategic underperformance of debt-service obligations by equity holders can resolve the gap between observed yield spreads and those generated by Merton (1974) -style models. We show {{that this is not}} quite correct. The value of the option to underperform on debt-service obligations depends on two other optionalities available to equity holders, namely, the option <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>cash</b> reserves within the firm and the option to raise new external financing. We disentangle the effects of the three factors, and characterize the impact of each in isolation as well as their interaction. We find, among other things, that while strategic behavior can increase spreads significantly under some conditions, its impact is negligible in others, and in some cases it even leads to a decline in equilibrium spreads. We show that this last apparently paradoxical result is a consequence of an interaction of optionalities that results in a trade-off between strategic and liquidity-driven defaults. ...|$|R
40|$|Continuously {{monitoring}} the ECG signals over hours combined with activity status {{is very important}} for preventing cardiovascular diseases. A traditional ECG holter is often <b>inconvenient</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> because it has many electrodes attached to the chest and because it is heavy. This work proposes a wearable, low power context-aware ECG monitoring system integrated built-in kinetic sensors of the smartphone with a self-designed ECG sensor. The wearable ECG sensor is comprised of a fully integrated analog front-end (AFE), a commercial micro control unit (MCU), a secure digital (SD) card, and a Bluetooth module. The whole sensor is very small with a size of only 58 × 50 × 10 mm for wearable monitoring application due to the AFE design, and the total power dissipation in a full round of ECG acquisition is only 12. 5 mW. With the help of built-in kinetic sensors of the smartphone, the proposed system can compute and recognize user’s physical activity, and thus provide context-aware information for the continuous ECG monitoring. The experimental results demonstrated the performance of proposed system in improving diagnosis accuracy for arrhythmias and identifying the most common abnormal ECG patterns in different activities. In conclusion, we provide a wearable, accurate and energy-efficient system for long-term and context-aware ECG monitoring without any extra cost on kinetic sensor design but {{with the help of the}} widespread smartphone...|$|R

40|$|Plastic cards have {{invaded the}} {{monetary}} {{market as a}} payment instrument used to purchase goods and services. There are several types of plastic cards in the circulation namely, credit cards, debit cards, charge cards, stored value cards and smart cards. The first credit card used to eliminate the need <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>cash</b> was the Mobil Oil, USA card issued in 1914 and the first form of charge card was the Diners card, which was used by businessmen in the 1950 's to purchase meals on an expense account. Since then, a variety of cards have been introduced to customers that have a multitude of functions for their daily transactional needs. The numbers of individuals that rely on cards have increased {{from year to year}} and presently the plastic card has become an indispensable instrument in the money wallet. Among all the different types of plastic cards, the most favoured by customers is the credit card. Statistics provided by Bank Negara Malaysia indicate that as at August 2007, principal card holders number 8. 22 million; supplementary card holders' number 1. 15 million; and in August 2007 the number of credit card transactions using (local and foreign) credit cards totaled 20. 21 million. 2 The credit card appears to be the most favourite plastic card among Malaysians. However, the downside of owning the credit card is the danger of it being used by unauthorized third parties to illegally purchase goods/services or to withdraw moneys/credit advances from the automated teller machine.

To examine the therapeutic effects on mean blood pressure (MBP), blood pressure variability, and endothelial function by giving Bushen Qinggan Formula, a compound Chinese Herbal Medicine and also to evaluate the difference in efficacy between decoction and granule. Methods. A total of 150 patients with hypertension were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive the placebo, Bushen Qinggan decoction, or Bushen Qinggan granule in addition to the standard medications (amlodipine- 5 [*]mg/d) for the treatment of essential hypertension (EH). The outcome was the reduction in the MBP and BPV and also included changes in the endothelial markers including endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and nitric oxide (NO) after 8 weeks of treatment. Results. Compared with the control group, the Bushen Qinggan decoction and granule groups had significant improvement (P 0. 05). Conclusion. Based on the standard treatment, Bushen Qinggan Formula further improved BPV and endothelial function. The efficacy of Bushen Qinggan decoction and granule is similar in improving BPV and endothelial function. However, no significant antihypertensive effects could be demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of center‐specific outcomes is often through survival analysis methods. Such evaluations must account {{for differences in}} the distribution of patient characteristics across centers. In the context of censored event times, it is also important that the measure chosen to evaluate centers not be influenced by imbalances in the center‐specific censoring distributions. The practice of using center indicators in a hazard regression model is often invalid, <b>inconvenient,</b> or undesirable <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out. We propose a semiparametric version of the standardized rate ratio (SRR) useful for the {{evaluation of}} centers with respect to a right‐censored event time. The SRR for center j can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected number of deaths in the total population (if the total population were in fact subject to the center j mortality hazard) to the observed number of events. The proposed measure is not affected by differences in center‐specific covariate or censoring distributions. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived, with finite‐sample properties examined through simulation studies. The proposed methods are applied to national kidney transplant data.
