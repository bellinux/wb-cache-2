40|$|This paper reflectively {{describes}} {{the use of}} Pressure Writing Practice (PWP) to enhance students‘ soft skills in Paragraph Writing Class in second semester at EED of the University of Muria Kudus (UMK) in academic year of 2013 / 2014. PWP is administered weekly. In PWP, the students must <b>individually</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> paragraph {{on a sheet of}} paper. They have only 30 minutes to complete the task without any access and help from their peers, teachers, textbooks, notes, dictionaries, cellphones and laptops. Initially some confussions and behavioral concerns took place but after several applications of PWP, students‘ original paragraphs improved in quality and length. Students‘ soft skills and writing fluency were clearly observed. In doing the composition, the students also looked more relaxed and confident. The students hardly turned to their mates for help or discussions and accessed any notes {{even in the absence of}} their instructor. They had a better attendance, punctuality and time-management. Honesty, independence, descipline, determination, personality and independence were clearly obersved after PWP application. Copy-paste modus was totally eradicated in their paragraphs. Some students directly expressed their supports and thanks to PWP. After every PWP session, the students had to revise and improve their original compositions. After PWP, they were strongly encouraged to have questions and reflections through group-work, peer‘s correction, and instructor‘s feedback. They were also allowed to access and make use of their smart gadgets and computers...|$|E

40|$|Epistemic dialogues, {{involving}} {{explanation and}} argumentation, {{have been recognized}} as potential vehicles for conceptual understanding. Although the role of dialogue in learning has received much attention, the problem of creating situations in which students engage in epistemic dialogue has only begun to be addressed. This article highlights the set of factors that {{must be taken into}} account in designing a computer-supported collaborative learning situation that encourages students to discuss scientific notions. These factors include the choice of the domain issue, the activities proposed to students, and the role of technology. We describe the design of CON-NECT, an integrated environment and task sequence for the collaborative confrontation, negotiation, and construction of text. Results are then presented from a study in which students <b>individually</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>an</b> interpretation of a sound phenomenon, were matched in dyads so as to maximize semantic differences between their texts, and then collaboratively discussed and wrote common texts across the network using CONNECT. We show how careful engineering of the CONNECT environment favors the occurrence of epistemic dialogue and creates opportunities for conceptual understanding. The discussion centers on why these opportunities might be missed, as well as on the conditions required for students to exploit them.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} Donald Winnicott's theory of {{transitional}} space and play casts new light upon the ontological dimensions of students' experiences of transition within Higher Education. Winnicott enables the illumination {{of the different}} ways that students might react, cope and personally develop when faced with similarity, difference and change, demonstrating this can have powerful influences upon the facilitation and hindrance of individuals’ transitions. The qualitative case study, conducted at a Russell Group University, involves an in depth exploration of eight second-year undergraduate Biological Science students' transitional journeys during their study of one module. The students' study included designing their own experiments, working with others, presenting orally, analysing their data and <b>individually</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> scientific report, {{as part of a}} creative group project. I argue throughout this thesis that this module invited learners to engage in adult, transitional academic play spaces. Here, learners had the freedom to risk putting him or herself into relation with sameness, uncertainty, difficulty, challenge and change. The study reports that the potential and enjoyment of transition, as Winnicott proposed, might be only fully realised when the conditions are 'good enough' {{in the mind of the}} learner. This involves achieving a delicate balance between firstly, the provision of a teaching and learning environment that provides the freedom and opportunities to engage with transition and secondly, the capacities of students to engage with change which might include, toughness, resilience and a will to learn. In the light of the empirical findings it is argued that students' transitional journeys are both idiosyncratic and complex and students emerge in different ways. It is found that at this stage in their degree study all students required the sensitive support of teaching staff in order to have the confidence to engage within transitional space.

40|$|This thesis explores {{collaborative}} {{writing and}} the differences between collaboratively and <b>individually</b> <b>written</b> texts in terms of sentence complexity and linguistic accuracy. Collaboratively and <b>individually</b> <b>written</b> texts have been extensively compared in previous studies all over the world, but in Estonia, collaborative writing {{has been out of}} research focus altogether. In addition, there have been few studies concentrating on comparing and analysing <b>individually</b> and collaboratively <b>written</b> texts that have been written by the same students. The main aims of this thesis are to find out if there are any significant differences between students’ collaboratively and <b>individually</b> <b>written</b> texts, and if there are any significant differences between the texts written before and after <b>a</b> collaborative <b>writing</b> task in terms of sentence complexity and linguistic accuracy. The literature review discusses what skills and competences foreign language learners might need to excel in writing tasks. The section also provides an overview of collaborative writing as such, and discusses previous studies on collaborative writing in terms of the differences between collaboratively and <b>individually</b> <b>written</b> texts as well as what effects collaborative writing might have on students’ writing skills. Previous studies have shown that collaborative <b>writing</b> has <b>a</b> positive effect on foreign language learners’ writing skills. In addition, collaboratively written texts {{have been shown to be}} considerably more accurate and complex. However, the studies comparing collaboratively and <b>individually</b> <b>written</b> texts have analysed the texts written by different students at the same time, not the ones written by the same students at different times. This thesis aims to fill that gap. The empirical part compares <b>individually</b> and collaboratively <b>written</b> texts as well as <b>individually</b> <b>written</b> texts with one another. Thirteen upper secondary level English as a foreign language students wrote one text collaboratively in groups and two texts individually – one before the collaborative writing task and the other after collaborative writing task.

40|$|A wiki {{was used}} {{as part of a}} blended {{learning}} approach to promote collaborative learning among students in a first-year university statistics class. One group of students analysed a data set and communicated the results by jointly <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> practice report using a wiki. A second group analysed the same data but communicated the results in a practice report that they <b>wrote</b> <b>individually.</b> Both groups were taught the same material. The report was used for practice as a way to support student learning and was not submitted for assessment. Both approaches improved report writing knowledge and did not differ in the mark obtained on <b>an</b> <b>individually</b> <b>written</b> research report subsequently submitted for assessment. The wiki approach produced higher engagement with other students, cognitive engagement, and class attendance than the individual approach. Qualitative feedback suggested some drawbacks to using a wiki. Overall participation was also low with only 2 of the 22 wiki subgroups completing all components of the practice report. The present findings suggest that student engagement, but not performance on assessment, may be enhanced when a wiki is used to support learning in higher education.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} first to describe the writing processes and products of students in grades 7, 8, and 9 and second to explore patterns of differences related to cognitive development. From the 117 students enrolled at a midwestern university laboratory school who voluntarily completed the Arlin Test of Formal Reasoning, 12 subjects were chosen {{on the basis of}} sex, grade, and test score. Each subject <b>individually</b> <b>wrote</b> four letters. <b>A</b> talk-aloud procedure was employed during three sessions and stimulated recall was used during the last session. Finally, all subjects were interviewed. Audio tapes of interviews and videotapes of writing sessions were transcribed. Final copies of texts were typed. Interview responses were examined and summarized. The letters were rated holistically and scored for audience awareness. Counts of words, T-units, and clauses were conducted. Verbalizations in protocols were coded. Further, all data produced during stimulated recall were examined for information about time use, fluency, and pausing, as well as revising and editing. The data revealed that writers considered themselves capable, but the papers received mediocre ratings and scores. The analysis of products showed that subjects wrote more in response to an expressive/informative task, but syntax was more mature on information and persuasion. Overall, formal thinkers wrote more syntactically mature discourse and usually received higher ratings. The analysis of processes data failed to reveal consistent differences, but there were many similarities. The subjects prewrote mentally and focused on producing text quickly. They reread text and edited often, but they rarely revised. Descriptions of processes and rhetorical principles were vague. Although the writers employed many strategies, had some intuitive sense of purpose and audience, and made decisions on the basis of many factors, they lacked control over their composing activities and were unable to transfer strategies from one task to the next. The study concluded with a series of recommendations for composition instruction and further research, particularly a call for teaching the processes of composing at the middle school level and for measuring the effects of this instruction against the baseline of data provided in this study.
