40|$|This {{study is}} based on {{analyses}} of dual-polarization radar observations made by the 11 -cm-wavelength Colorado State University–University of Chicago–Illinois State Water Survey (CSU–CHILL) system during four significant winter storms in northeastern Colorado. It was found that values of specific differential phase KDP often reached local maxima of; 0. 158 – 0. 48 km 21 in an elevated layer near the 2158 C environmental temperature isotherm. The passage of these elevated positive KDP areas is shown {{to be linked to}} increased surface precipitation rates. Calculations using a microwave scattering model indicate that populations of highly oblate ice particles with moderate bulk densities and diameters in the; 0. 8 – 1. 2 -mm range can generate KDP (and differential reflectivity ZDR) values that are consistent with the radar observations. The persistent correlation between the enhanced KDP level and the 2158 C temperature regime suggests that rapidly growing dendrites likely {{played a significant role in}} the production of the observed K DP patterns. The detection of organized regions of S-band K DP values greater than; 0. 18 – 0. 28 km 21 in winter storms may therefore be useful in identifying regions of active <b>dendritic</b> <b>particle</b> growth, as a precursor to aggregate snowfall. 1...|$|E

During this study the use of dendritic copper microparticles embedded in an alginate matrix as a rapid method for the deactivation of Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 was investigated. The copper/alginate produced a decrease in the minimum inhibitory concentration from free copper powder dispersed in the media from 0. 25 to 0. 065 mg/ml. Beads loaded with 4 % Cu deactivated 99. 97 % of bacteria after 90 minutes, compared to a 44. 2 % reduction in viability in the equivalent free copper powder treatment. There was no observed loss in the efficacy of this method with increasing bacterial loading up to 10 (6) cells/ml, however only 88. 2 % of E. coli were deactivated after 90 minutes at a loading of 10 (8) cells/ml. The efficacy of this method was highly dependent on the oxygen content of the media, with a 4. 01 % increase in viable bacteria observed under anoxic conditions compared to a > 99 % reduction in bacterial viability in oxygen tensions above 50 % of saturation.

The goals of this research are to promote the use of TEM as an ultrafine particle analysis tool by developing new sample preparation methods, and to exploit the new TEM techniques for analysis of particles in semiconductor processing fluids. A TEM methodology for the analysis of particulate contaminants in fluids with an elemental detectability limit as low as 0. 1 part per trillion (ppt), and a particle concentration detectability limit as low as 1 particle/ml for particles greater than 0. 2 pm was developed and successfully applied to the analysis of particles in HF, H 202, de-ionized (DI) water, and on the surface of an electronic device.

50|$|Amorphous metals {{have higher}} tensile yield {{strengths}} and higher elastic strain limits than polycrystalline metal alloys, but their ductilities and fatigue strengths are lower. Amorphous alloys {{have a variety}} of potentially useful properties. In particular, they tend to be stronger than crystalline alloys of similar chemical composition, and they can sustain larger reversible ("elastic") deformations than crystalline alloys. Amorphous metals derive their strength directly from their non-crystalline structure, which does not have any of the defects (such as dislocations) that limit the strength of crystalline alloys. One modern amorphous metal, known as Vitreloy, has a tensile strength that is almost twice that of high-grade titanium. However, metallic glasses at room temperature are not ductile and tend to fail suddenly when loaded in tension, which limits the material applicability in reliability-critical applications, as the impending failure is not evident.

Silver particles with various morphologies are synthesized by a solution-based reduction approach at the addition of amino acids.

40|$|The {{theory of}} van der waals' forces holds for {{interpretation}} of data from melting/solidification experiments using the nickel-based superalloy CMSX 6 - 1 vol% Al_ 2 O_ 3 (< 100 nm 0). As a consequence it is deduced {{that it is impossible}} to maintain the powder-metallurgically realized homogenity during melting and solidification. The general conclusion is extended to any metal-ceramic dispersion, e. g. SiC/Al and Al_ 2 O_ 3 /Cu. During solidification of the CMSX 6 /Al_ 2 O_ 3 system, the alumina particles form clusters and chains, which are delocated by the growing alloy crystals and subsequently inclosed by the <b>dendritic</b> alloy <b>particles.</b> Bubble-free solidification requires a gas pressure of at least 1 bar.

40|$|Broadband antireflective (AR) superhydrophobic {{self-cleaning}} coatings were fabricated {{based on}} novel dendritic porous silica nanoparticles (HPSNs) by a facile dip-coating method. The coatings comprised a bottom AR nanoporous silica layer {{and a top}} superhydrophobic HPSNs layer. <b>Dendritic</b> silica <b>particles</b> with unique hierarchical pore structures and surface roughness not only increased the roughness of coating surface, but also did not obviously decrease the transmittance of the coated glass slide. A glass slide with the optimal coating had a maximum transmittance of 96. 2 % at a wavelength of 522 nm, minimum reflection of 2. 3 % at a wavelength of 580 nm, and excellent superhydrophobicity (WCAs: 157. 8 degrees, sliding angle: < 1 degrees). The average transmittance {{increased by more than}} 4. 0 % at a wavelength range of 400 - 1100 nm. This work provides a promising way to design and prepare a broadband AR superhydrophobic self-cleaning coating for optical devices and energy harvesting...|$|R
40|$|Surface active {{elements}} in liquid steel {{may affect the}} morphology of non-metallic particles during deoxidation. The effect of Te on the morphology of alumina particles was therefore studied by adding Te to molten iron before Al deoxidation at 1873 K. Dendritic, spherical, faceted, plate-like and clustered particles were identified in all samples. Te, however, considerably changes the rela-tive frequencies of the morphologies, decreasing the amount of <b>dendritic</b> and spherical <b>particles</b> whereas {{increasing the amount of}} faceted and plate-like particles. This effect is closely related with the supersaturation degree, stirring, and Te content. The way Te influences the morphology of the alumina particles and the factors influencing Te effectiveness are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} of incident {{electromagnetic radiation}} with surface plasmons on nanoscale <b>dendritic</b> metal <b>particles</b> {{has been observed}} to cause localization of the electromagnetic field, or ‘hot spots’. This has led to observed enhancements of nonlinear optical processes, including surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), second harmonic generation (SHG), and multiphoton photoemission [1]. These effects are reportedly strongest in aggregates that have a fractal nature. We report on the nonlinear optical properties of dendritic silver nanostructures. The particles precipitated onto quartz cover slips and were spin coated with poly(vinyl alcohol) to reduce oxidation of the samples. An ultrafast laser capable of 10 fs pulses at a repetition rate of 97 MHz was brought into the rear port of an inverted microscope and focused with a 60 x/ 1. 45 NA objective to a focal spot size of 0. 2 µm. The pulses were spectral phase corrected using MIIPS [2]. The sample was raster scanned and data was collected with a CCD camera. A problem encountered when studying these samples is the low power threshold at which irreversible damage to the sample occurs. We have determined that at powers greater than 3 µW, damage to the silver nanoparticle aggregate sample occurs. Additionally, we have seen damage that spreads 10 diameters beyond the focal spot at higher powers, indicating a possible longer-distanc...|$|R
40|$|This work {{characterizes the}} coating surface and profile (cross-section {{perpendicular}} to the substrate surface) of plasma-sprayed deposits. Metal (mild steel and a composite of Ni-Al) and ceramic (alumina and zirconia based materials) deposits were produced and examined by scanning electron microscopy. The ceramic coatings were also examined by transmission electron microscopy. Structural observations from the controlled fracture of coatings are also included. The ceramic coatings exhibited similar morphological features to the metal coatings {{in the form of}} flattened <b>particles,</b> <b>dendritic</b> artefacts on the particle surface, a columnar crystal structure and porosity of various forms. The columnar structure that was observed in some flattened particles may be explained by assuming efficient heat extraction through the underlying structure (substrate or coating). In a similar manner the dendritic artefacts would be expected to preferentially nucleate on the surfaces of large particles...|$|R
