5|$|In 1885, the North-West Rebellion {{broke out}} along the North Saskatchewan River valley. Driven by a {{combination}} of political and economic issues, Louis Riel and his Métis followers intended to form a provisional government, gain the support of the Cree First Nation, defeat the mounted police and seize the region, forcing the Canadian government to the negotiation table. There had been worries among the police about potential instability since the previous <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> force had increased its presence in the area over the winter. As tensions rose, Commissioner Irvine, who had replaced Macleod in 1880 after accusations of financial mismanagement, began to mobilise any spare police manpower in Regina, bringing the force up to an operational strength of 562.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January, a {{group of}} rebels {{attacked}} a Catholic mission at Nguludi belonging to Father Swelsen. The mission was defended by four African armed guards, {{one of whom was}} killed, Father Swelsen was also wounded in the fighting and the church was burnt down. The military and militia forces assaulted Mbombwe again the same day but encountered no resistance. Many rebels, including Chilembwe, had fled the village disguised as civilians. Mbombwe's <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government troops' subsequent demolition of Chilembwe's church with dynamite ended the rebellion. Kaduya was captured and brought back to Magomero where he was publicly executed.|$|E

5|$|Orographic or relief {{snowfall}} {{is caused}} when masses of air pushed by wind are forced {{up the side}} of elevated land formations, such as large mountains. The lifting of air {{up the side of}} a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier, warmer air on the descending, leeward side. The resulting enhanced productivity of snow <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> decrease in temperature with elevation means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|The Witchwood public house, in the St Petersfield {{area of the}} town, {{has been}} a music venue since the 1960s, hosting acts such as Muse, The Coral, and Lost Prophets. In 2004 The Witchwood came under threat when the area was being redeveloped, but was saved from {{demolition}} after a campaign by locals and led by Tom Hingley, drawing support from musicians such as Bert Jansch, The <b>Fall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Chameleons.|$|E

5|$|The {{suggestion}} {{has also}} been made that Jack and Jill represent Louis XVI of France, who was deposed and beheaded in 1793 (lost his crown), and his Queen Marie Antoinette (who came tumbling after), a theory made difficult {{by the fact that}} the earliest printing of the rhyme pre-dates those events. There is also a local belief that the rhyme records events in the village of Kilmersdon in Somerset in 1697 when a local spinster became pregnant; the putative father is said to have died from a rock <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> woman died in childbirth soon after.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{recognized}} {{calls for the}} mockingbird: the nest relief call, hew call, chat or chatburst, and the begging call. The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use, as chats are year-round, and chatbursts occur in the fall. Another difference is that chatbursts appear {{to be used in}} territorial defense in the <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chats are used by either sex when disturbed. The nest relief and begging calls are only used by the males.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into four {{different}} single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final stage occurs at 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage involves Mario removing eight rivets which support Donkey Kong. Removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hero {{to be reunited with}} Pauline. These four stages combine to form a level.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} for the 2008 Leyenda de Plata tournament was a singles match between CMLL's top tecnico Místico and one of CMLL's top rudo workers, Perro Aguayo Jr., who had been long-time rivals even prior to the match. Aguayo Jr. won the first fall pinning Místico, while Místico won the second fall with an armbar submission. After the second fall, Aguayo Jr. claimed he needed to have his arm checked out by the doctor, {{stalling}} for time and seeking to frustrate his opponent. During the third fall Aguayo's fellow Los Perros del Mal teammates came to the ring, but their interference was stopped by Dos Caras Jr. and Héctor Garza, allowing Místico to win the third <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Leyenda de Plata tournament {{for the third year}} in a row.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of inner London (then the County of London) {{had been in}} decline as more residents moved into the outer suburbs since its creation in 1889, and this continued after the Second World War. In contrast, the {{population of}} Middlesex had increased steadily during that period. From 1951 to 1961 {{the population of the}} inner districts of the county started to <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> population grew only in eight of the suburban outer districts. According to the 1961 census, Ealing, Enfield, Harrow, Hendon, Heston & Isleworth, Tottenham, Wembley, Willesden and Twickenham had each reached a population greater than 100,000, which would normally have entitled each of them to seek county borough status. If this status were to be granted to all those boroughs it would mean that the population of the administrative county of Middlesex would be reduced by over half, to just under one million.|$|E
25|$|The Crusaders' Siege of Antioch {{resulted}} in its <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Crusaders caused significant damage during the First Crusade including a 3-day massacre {{of its population}} both Christian and Muslim.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{completed}} using the phenomenological research strategy to understand <b>the</b> effect that <b>falling</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fear of <b>falling</b> has on independently living residents at a continuing care retirement community in eastern North Carolina. To understand the residents' perspectives, interviews, the Mini Mental State Exam [MMSE], and a poetry exercise were employed. The residents completed {{one to two}} interviews, lasting approximately 45 minutes in length, took <b>the</b> MMSE, <b>and</b> wrote down key words and phrases regarding their singular perspectives on <b>falling</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fear of <b>falling.</b> Fifteen men <b>and</b> women, aged 78 - 94, participated.

25|$|Some areas {{experienced}} {{slow but}} steady technological advances, with important developments such as the stirrup and moldboard plough arriving every few centuries. There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological progress. Most important, perhaps, was the Mediterranean area during the Hellenistic period, when hundreds of technologies were invented. Such periods were followed by periods of technological decay, as during the Roman Empire's decline and <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ensuing early medieval period.|$|E

25|$|After Buckingham's assassination, a {{large amount}} of satirical verse was {{circulated}} on the subject. Most of this reflected on how pride goes before a <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> damage he had done the kingdom, while several pieces commended John Felton's action. The dagger, claimed to have been used by him, was recorded by a late Victorian gazetteer as still on display at the now demolished Newnham Paddox in Warwickshire. This was the seat of the Earls of Denbigh, whose first earl Buckingham's sister Susan had married.|$|E

Mostly without any amplification, the line-up was Perera on acoustic guitar, Thomas on bass guitar, Moore on a small drum kit and Graney on vocals. In 2010 , a third narrative style show was performed at the Butterfly Club. MC Bits featured the duo of Graney accompanied by Fitzgibbon on piano.|$|E
