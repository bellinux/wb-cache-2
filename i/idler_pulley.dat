50|$|A {{serpentine}} belt, {{also known}} as a multi-vee, poly-v, or multi-rib belt, is a single, continuous belt used to drive multiple peripheral devices in an automotive engine, such as an alternator, power steering pump, water pump, air conditioning compressor, air pump, etc. The belt may also be guided by an <b>idler</b> <b>pulley</b> and/or a belt tensioner (which may be spring-loaded, hydraulic, or manual).|$|E

40|$|A new haptic {{feedback}} mechanism with five active {{degrees of freedom}} (dof), part of a training simulator for urological operations, is presented. The mechanism consists of a 2 -dof 5 -bar linkage, and a 3 -dof spherical joint. To reproduce very small forces and moments, the mechanism has low friction, inertia and mass, is statically balanced, and has a simple mass matrix. Roll-pitch-yaw motions of the tool result in motions of the corresponding actuator. Force feedback transmission is achieved via capstan drives and <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys.</b> The computation of the currents {{and the structure of}} the control loop are described...|$|R
50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the polygroove belt that makes them popular {{is that they can}} run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with V-belts with a single <b>idler</b> <b>pulley</b> for tensioning, a polygroove belt may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.|$|E
50|$|Another method uses an {{eccentric}} mechanism {{either in the}} bottom bracket or in the rear hub. If neither of these are an option, when working with an existing frame not originally designed for single-speed use for example, some kind of <b>idler</b> <b>pulley,</b> such as the Surly Singleatoror simply a short cage rear derailleur {{can be used to}} take up chain slack. As well, finetuning the combination of chainring, cog, and chain length may suffice until the chain develops significant wear.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 19th century, British millwrights {{discovered}} that multi-grooved pulleys connected by ropes outperformed flat pulleys connected by leather belts. Wire ropes were occasionally used, but cotton, hemp, manila {{hemp and flax}} rope saw the widest use. Typically, the rope connecting two pulleys with multiple V-grooves was spliced into a single loop that traveled along a helical path before being returned to its starting position by an <b>idler</b> <b>pulley</b> that also served to maintain the tension on the rope. Sometimes, a single rope was used to transfer power from one multiple-groove drive pulley to several single- or multiple-groove driven pulleys in this way.|$|E
50|$|Round belts are a {{circular}} cross section belt designed {{to run in}} a pulley with a 60 degree V-groove. Round grooves are only suitable for <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys</b> that guide the belt, or when (soft) O-ring type belts are used. The V-groove transmits torque through a wedging action, thus increasing friction. Nevertheless, round belts are for use in relatively low torque situations only and may be purchased in various lengths or cut to length and joined, either by a staple, a metallic connector (in the case of hollow plastic), gluing or welding (in the case of polyurethane). Early sewing machines utilized a leather belt, joined either by a metal staple or glued, to great effect.|$|R
50|$|All of the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engines have a {{timing belt}} made of rubber and cord. This belt must be {{replaced}} at 105,000 mi. These engines are interference engines, meaning that if the timing belt breaks or stretches, the pistons will hit the valves, resulting in an engine teardown, and a likely rebuild. Also, if this belt is replaced around 105,000 miles, {{it is a good}} idea to change the water pump, thermostat, belt tensioner and all the <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys</b> for this belt. The water pump and thermostat are behind this belt.In Australia for the Series II (MY06) cars, Subaru changed the recommended service interval for the timing belt replacement from 100,000 kilometers to 125,000 kilometers.The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in the first-generation Foresters featured head gaskets which were prone to premature failure. For 2003 and later, this issue was addressed with a revised, higher performing design, but is still an issue.|$|R
50|$|Another Campagnolo {{invention}} {{that made}} use of the quick-release mechanism was the Cambio Corsa, a multi-gear changing system consisting of a rear wheel quick-release lever with a mechanical extension that placed the lever itself near the bicycle's saddle, combined with a fork {{that served as a}} primitive version of a rear derailleur (without <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys</b> to take up slack), that also had a control lever near the bicycle saddle. This innovation enabled bicycle riders quickly to change gears while in motion by releasing the axle, moving the rear wheel slightly forward by applying tension to the chain, actuating the fork to change to a larger sprocket, and tightening the quick release again; or else releasing the axle, actuating the fork to change to a smaller sprocket, moving the wheel slightly rearward by braking, and tightening the quick release again. The quick-release mechanism, along with other innovations and high standards of manufacture, enabled Campagnolo to become a leading road cycling and track cycling component manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|A {{conveyor}} belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system {{is one of}} many types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of carrying medium—the {{conveyor belt}}—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley while the unpowered pulley is called the <b>idler</b> <b>pulley.</b> There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more.|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of the twist grip {{throttle}} control was on the Roper steam velocipede of 1867-69. Rather than a sleeve that rotated around the handlebar, Sylvester H. Roper's steam motorcycle's entire handlebar rotated, with a dual mode operation. When rotated forward it opened the throttle, and when rotated backwards it applied the spoon brake. Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr said that pioneering this technology was a point {{in favor of the}} Roper's precedence as the first motorcycle, in response to Cycle World Technical Editor Kevin Cameron's position that the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was more deserving because it used the more successful technology, internal combustion rather than steam. The design drawings of the Reitwagen depicted a twist grip speed control, also applying the brake when turned one way, but when turned the other way, it would have tensioned the belt drive's <b>idler</b> <b>pulley,</b> applying power to the rear wheel {{in the manner of a}} clutch. The actual working model, however, did not have the twist grip, belt drive, or brakes.|$|E

The wick-type carburetor was crude, consisting of a metal box with internal baffles stuffed with cotton batting.

40|$|Purpose. A {{drive is}} one of the basic {{elements}} of belt conveyers. To determine the drive power it is necessary to conduct calculations by standard methodologies expounded in modern technical literature. Such calculations demand a fair amount of time. The basic design parameters of a belt conveyer include type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions. The article aims to build the parametric dependence of belt conveyer drive power on its design parameters, that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of belts, <b>idlers</b> and <b>pulleys.</b> Methodology. The work examines a belt conveyer with two areas: sloping and horizontal. Using the methodology for pulling calculation by means of belt conveyer encirclement, there are built parametric dependences of pull forces in the characteristic conveyer path points on the type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions.

For the belt conveyers of the considered type there are built parametric dependences of drive power on type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions, taking into account the belt standard dimensions and corresponding assumptions in relation to <b>idler</b> and <b>pulley</b> types.

Use of the built drive power dependences on design parameters for the belt conveyers with sloping and horizontal areas gives an opportunity of relatively rapid determination of drive power approximate value at the design stage. Also it allows quality selection of its basic elements at specific design characteristics and requirements. The offered dependences can be used for determination of general character of drive power dependence on the project efficiency. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} at Strépy-Thieu {{consists of}} two independent counterweighted caissons which travel vertically between the upstream and downstream sections. Due to Archimedes' Principle, the caissons weigh the same whether they are laden with a boat or simply contain water. In practice, variations in the water level mean that the mass of each caisson varies between 7200 and 8400 tonnes. The caissons have useful dimensions of 112 m by 12 m and a water depth of between 3.35 and 4.15 m. Each caisson is supported by 112 suspension cables (for counterbalance) and 32 control cables (for lifting/lowering), each of 85 mm diameter. The mass of the counterbalance was calculated to keep the tension {{in each of the}} control cables below 100 kN at all times. The suspension cables pass over <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys</b> with a diameter of 4.8 m. Four electric motors power eight winches per caisson via speed-reduction gearboxes and the 73.15-metre lift is completed in seven minutes. The structure is massively reinforced to provide rigidity against torsional forces during operation and has a mass of approximately 200,000 tonnes. The vertically moving watertight gates are designed to withstand a 5 km/h impact from a 2000 tonne vessel.|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of precision laser targets requires {{a wide variety}} of specialized mesoscale manufacturing techniques. The diamond wire saw developed in this study provides the capability to precisely section meso-scale workpieces mounted on the assembly stations used by the Target Fabrication Group. This new capability greatly simplifies the {{fabrication of}} many types of targets and reduces the time and cost required to build the targets. A variety of materials are used to fabricate targets, including metals, plastics with custom designed chemical formulas, and aerogels of various densities. The materials are usually provided in the form of small pieces or cast rods that must be machined to the required shape. Many of these materials, such as metals and some plastics, can be trimmed using a parting tool on a diamond turning machine. However, other materials, such as aerogels and brittle materials, cannot be adequately cut with a parting tool. In addition, the geometry of the parts often requires that the workpieces be held in a special assembly station, which excludes the use of a parting tool. In the past, these materials were sectioned using a small, handheld coping saw that used a diamond-impregnated wire as a blade. This miniature coping saw was effective, but it required several hours to cut through certain materials. Furthermore, the saw was guided by hand and often caused significant damage to fragile aerogels. To solve these problems, the diamond wire saw shown in Figure 1 was developed. The diamond wire saw is designed to machine through materials that are mounted in the Target Fabrication Group's benchtop assembly stations. These assembly stations are the primary means of aligning and assembling target components, and there is often a need to machine materials while they are mounted in the assembly stations. Unfortunately, commercially available saws are designed for very different applications and are far too large to be used with the assembly stations. Therefore, a custom diamond wire saw was designed and constructed. The diamond wire saw cuts through workpieces using a continuous loop of diamond-impregnated wire of length 840 mm. The wire loop runs around several <b>idler</b> <b>pulleys</b> and is driven by a simple geared DC motor that rotates at 17 rpm. The linear speed of the wire is 107 inches/minute. The saw is oriented at an angle of 20 {sup o} from horizontal, so the operator can view the wire through the cutout at {{the front end of the}} saw. When looking through a microscope or camera with a horizontal line of sight, the operator can clearly see the wire as it cuts through the workpiece, as shown in the right side of Figure 1. The saw is mounted on a two-axis stage that allows the operator to align the wire with the workpiece. To cut through the workpiece, the operator drives the wire through the workpiece by turning the feed micrometer. An image of the interior of the diamond wire saw appears in Figure 2. This picture was taken after removing the protective cover plate from the saw...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 A need {{exists to}} develop a high speed dynamic tow {{carriage}} used to motivate hydrodynamic specimens through a fluid environment. It is desired to simulate high Reynolds number unsteady flow about the specimen by towing the specimen through the fluid. The fluid environment is to be provided by the existing uni-directional wave tank at O. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory at Oregon State University. This paper is both a feasibility study and a conceptual design of the dynamic tow carriage. The {{first part of this}} paper develops a first order theoretical model of the dynamic tow carriage. The model has four main components, 1) the carriage/specimen model, 2) the wire rope model, 3) the <b>idler</b> <b>pulley</b> model, and 4) the driver pulley model. The carriage/specimen is modeled as a large point mass with viscous damping. Power is input to the driver pulley which transfers the power to the wire rope. The wire rope is modeled as linear springs with discretized mass and structural damping. The wire rope then transfers power to the carriage/specimen to propel it {{along the length of the}} wave tank. The second half of this paper develops a conceptual design of the system. Theoretical results from the system model are interpreted and used for design parameters for each component of the real system. The carriage/specimen structure is a 5. 5 m long 3. 7 m wide light weight yet rigid space frame made of aluminum tubing. This component was designed using finite element techniques for both a static and vibrational analysis. The carriage is supported and guided by rigid linear motion bearings that nearly span the length of the wave tank. Power is supplied by a 400 kW hydrostatic drive to a 1. 5 m diameter driver drum with enough stored cable to pull the carriage through 60 m oscillations. The analysis and design suggest that the 1000 Kg carriage/specimen structure can be driven to velocities exceeding 17 m/s and accelerations on the order of gravity. For cylindrical tow specimens having a length of 3. 4 m and a diameter ranging from 2 to 600 mm a maximum Reynolds number equal to 4 x 10 ⁶ and Kuelegan Carpenter parameter equal to 8 x 10 ³ appear feasible...|$|E
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the Human Powered Vehicle Frame Design senior project’s {{contributions to the}} design, manufacture, testing, and competition of the Cal Poly Human Powered Vehicle Club’s 2015 vehicle, Sweet Phoenix. The project’s guiding rules and timeline were dictated by the ASME Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (HPVC), held in April 2015. The Club sought to improve upon its previous vehicle, Aria, which suffered {{from a range of}} faults including a catastrophic structural failure at the 2014 HPVC. Largely in response to this failure, the Frame Design project’s major focus was Sweet Phoenix’s frame, from concept to manufacturing. During the design process in the Spring and Fall of 2014, several other issues were tackled in order to define the frame’s design parameters. These secondary efforts included the fairing shape, vehicle stability requirements, handling characteristics, and rider ergonomics. A handling prototype was constructed in late Fall 2014, which successfully validated the solutions to these secondary requirements before the final design was constructed. Ultimately, Sweet Phoenix’s frame is a hybrid design – a composite monocoque fairing to which several weldments are mechanically fastened. The team used extensive finite element analysis to evaluate structural properties for both of these frame subsystems during the final development stages. Sweet Phoenix was produced during the Winter quarter of 2015, with much physical help from the HPV Club members and financial support from several sponsors. The production effort was quite successful, in part thanks to two significant manufacturing improvements – sponsored out-of-house machining of the fairing tools, and a frame-to-fairing alignment jig. The vehicle’s construction quality was recognized at HPVC with a “Best Craftsmanship” award. Testing of the final vehicle revealed very low stiffness of the weldments’ fairing mounts, which was resolved by adding additional bracing locations to the fairing. In addition, the team discovered several drivetrain-related issues that were attacked with numerous attempted solutions, but were not solved prior to HPVC. The drivetrain also contributed to localized delamination of the fairing near a chain <b>idler</b> <b>pulley</b> mount. Unfortunately, these drivetrain issues resulted in several broken chains and poor performance in the acceleration-heavy Endurance Event at HPVC. On the other hand, Sweet Phoenix placed 1 st in Design and Men’s Sprint, both satisfying results for the Club, and the Frame Design project was an overall success...|$|E
