The potential applications of furan-based {{building blocks for}} polymer applications has been extensively reviewed by Gandini. A notable example is Polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate, but also other polyesters and various polyamides and polyurethanes have been described in literature. Amongst others like Dupont and Corbion, the company [...] claims to have developed a cost effective route to produce FDCA and the derived polyesters via so-called YXY Building Blocks. [...] FDCA has also been applied in pharmacology. It was demonstrated that its diethyl ester had a strong anaesthetic action similar to cocaine. Dicalcium 2,5-furandicarboxylate was shown to inhibit the growth of Baccillus megatorium. Screening studies on FDCA-derived anilides showed their important anti-bacterial action. The <b>diacid</b> itself is a strong complexing agent, chelating such ions as: Ca2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+; it is utilized in medicine to remove kidney stones. Interestingly, HMF is metabolized via FDCA in mammals including humans. A very diluted solution of FDCA in tetrahydrofuran is utilized for preparing artificial veins for transplantation. At {{the beginning of this}} chapter, it was mentioned that FDCA is a chemically stable compound. This property has been well benefited in industry – FDCA as most of polycarboxylic acids can be an ingredient of fire foams. Such foams help to extinguish fires in a short time caused by polar and non-polar solvents.|$|E

The temporal variations of atmospheric tracer compounds (CO, levoglucosan, 2 -methyltetrols, pinic acid, glyoxylic acid, glyoxal and methylglyoxal) suggest that the increases of <b>diacids</b> are due to an enhanced precursor emissions associated with more anthropogenic than biogenic activities followed by their chemical processing in the atmosphere. The trends of <b>diacids</b> are opposite to the reported decreases of sulfate, nitrate and ammonium in the recent years in East Asia. This study demonstrates that recent pollution control strategies in East Asia could not decrease organic acidic species in the atmosphere.

We analyzed the filter samples for <b>diacids,</b> oxoacids, pyruvic acid, alpha-dicarbonyls and fatty acids {{to better understand the}} sources and atmospheric processes in the outflow regions of Asian pollutants. Molecular distributions of <b>diacids</b> show a predominance of oxalic acid (C- 2) followed by malonic (C- 3) and succinic (C- 4) acids. Total <b>diacids</b> strongly correlated with secondary source tracers such as SO 42 - (r = 0. 87), NH 4 + (0. 90) and methanesulfonate (MSA(-)) (0. 84), suggesting that <b>diacids</b> are secondarily formed from their precursor compounds. We also found good correlations among C- 2, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in the Okinawa aerosols, suggesting that <b>diacids</b> are mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. However, a weak correlation of <b>diacids</b> with levoglucosan, a biomass burning tracer, suggests that biomass buring is not the main source of <b>diacids,</b> rather <b>diacids</b> are secondarily formed by photochemical oxidation of organic precursors derived from fossil fuel combustion. We found a strong correlation (r = 0. 98) between inorganic nitrogen (NO 3 -N + NH 4 -N) and total nitrogen (TN), to which organic nitrogen (ON) contributed 23 %. Fatty acids were characterized by even carbon number predominance, suggesting that they are derived from biogenic sources. The higher abundances of short chain fatty acids (C- 20) further suggest that fatty acids are largely derived from marine phytoplankton during spring bloom. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} compound specific stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C- 13) of organics in assessment of their photochemical aging in the atmosphere, batch UV irradiation experiments were conducted on two ambient (anthropogenic and biogenic) aerosol samples in aqueous phase for 0. 5 - 120 h. The irradiated samples were analyzed for delta C- 13 of <b>diacids,</b> glyoxylic acid (omega C- 2) and glyoxal. delta C- 13 of <b>diacids</b> and related compounds became larger with irradiation time (i. e., aging), except for few cases. In general, delta C- 13 of C- 2 -C- 4 <b>diacids</b> showed an increasing trend with decreasing chain length. Based on delta C- 13 of <b>diacids</b> and related compounds and their relations to their concentrations, we found that C- 2 and C- 3 are enriched with C- 13 during the photochemical decomposition and production from their higher homologues and oxoacids. Photochemical breakdown of higher (>= C- 3) to lower <b>diacids</b> is also important in the enrichment of C- 13 in C 3 -C 9 <b>diacids</b> whereas their production from primary precursors causes depletion of C- 13.

Among <b>diacids</b> and related compounds, oxalic acid (C 2) was found to be the most abundant, followed by succinic acid (C 4) in biomass burning aerosols, while malonic acid (C 3) dominated in marine aerosols. Lower relative abundances of C 2 -C 4 <b>diacids,</b> unsaturated <b>diacids,</b> and α-dicarbonyls in total <b>diacids</b> and related compounds were observed in biomass burning aerosols than in marine aerosols, whereas those of C 5 -C 11 <b>diacids,</b> branched <b>diacids,</b> multifunctional <b>diacids,</b> and ketoacids were higher in biomass burning aerosols.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the factors {{influencing}} {{the formation of}} a binary compound and the proton transfer within the binary compound have been investigated. The formation of a binary compound, or heteromeric system, over a homomeric system requires the heteromeric system to be more energetically favourable than the homomeric system. In some circumstances, however, no solid crystallises at all. Proton transfer within the binary compound can lead to {{the formation of a}} salt, whereas a binary compound containing neutral components is called a co-crystal. The ‘rule of three’ which predicts that proton transfer requires a difference of at least three units between the pKa of the acid and the pKa of the conjugate acid has also been investigated. In particular the relevance of this rule to diprotic acids and bases, and amide groups has been examined. The expression of starting material properties in the binary compounds was also explored. To achieve this an array of <b>diacids</b> and bases have been chosen that consist of ?,?-alkanedicarboxylic acids, ?,?-alkenedicarboxylic acids and tartaric acids with a selection of aliphatic amines, nitrogen-containing heterocycles and imidazole derivatives. The nitrogen-containing heterocycles include some amide functionalities. These compounds have been systematically crystallised together using a liquid-handling robot in a high-throughput manner commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. The novel structures of 42 salts, 11 co-crystals and 6 mixed co-crystal/salt systems have been prepared and characterised using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Together with the binary compounds already present on the CSD, this has provided the opportunity {{to assess the impact of}} various factors on the crystal structures and properties of a total of 61 salts, 11 co-crystals and 8 mixed salt/co-crystal systems. Across the series of ?,?-alkanedicarboxylic acids it has been found that members with an even number of carbons in their alkyl chain (even <b>diacids)</b> form binary compounds more often than those with an odd number of carbons (odd <b>diacids).</b> The <b>diacids</b> with four carbons in their alkyl chains are most likely to form binary compounds. The melting point alternation seen in the ?,?-alkanedicarboxylic acids is also expressed in the binary products. This is particularly prominent with the 2 -imidazoldinone-alkanedicarboxylic acid co-crystals, where the supramolecular structure formed by the even <b>diacids</b> is different to that formed by the odd <b>diacids.</b> This has been attributed to the different orientation of the carboxyl groups in the odd <b>diacids.</b> Although the ‘rule of three’ has been found to be applicable to the first ionisation of the <b>diacids,</b> it does not account for the ubiquitous formation of diprotonated bases where the pKa difference is often less than 2 units. Indeed the stoichiometry of the binary compounds was found to often be unpredictable and difficult to rationalise simply. The deprotonation of the <b>diacids</b> appeared to be determined by the optimal hydrogen bonding motifs rather than the pKa.

Such high levels of tPh and Ph were different from those in other Asian cities where malonic acid (C- 3) is {{the second or third}} highest species, mostly owing to significant emissions from coal combustion and uncontrolled waste incineration.
