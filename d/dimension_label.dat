30|$|Even {{if it is}} not {{central to}} the present {{reasoning}} we will nevertheless shortly cover the issue of measuring subjective success. Scholars have argued that taking standard measures of – subjective – career success is an objectivist approach that does not consider its social constructivist character (Arthur et  al. 2005; Dries et  al. 2008; Savickas 2005). A subjectivist approach to career success, in contrast, considers an individual's subjective construction of success. Career success then is what the individual understands as career success. This understanding differs between people, between employments, between age groups, and between cultures. Subjective constructions of career success may also be dynamic and change over time as well as with career stages. Dries et  al. (2008), for instance, found that their participants' subjective conceptualizations of career success could be depicted in a two-dimensional space with the horizontal <b>dimension</b> <b>labeled</b> affect versus achievement and the vertical <b>dimension</b> <b>labeled</b> intra-personal versus inter-personal. Nine regions are embedded in this structure. They denote different subjective meanings of career success like performance, advancement, self-development, creativity, security, satisfaction, recognition, cooperation, and contribution. It should be noted, however, that objectivist versus subjectivist approaches do not preclude one another. A research could, for instance, start with an analysis of the study of participants' subjective constructions of career success and could then proceed to operationalize these constructions by means of questionnaire items which later participants can answer.|$|R

50|$|Let's Turkey Trot is {{a popular}} song written by Gerry Goffin and Jack Keller. Some sources, {{including}} the original 45 LP have incorrectly credited the music to Carole King (King was Goffin's wife and usual songwriting partner but had no hand in this song). It was recorded by Little Eva and was released as her third single for the <b>Dimension</b> <b>label.</b> The Little Eva's recording debuted on the charts on February 2, 1963, and peaked at #20 on the Hot 100. It was her third top 40 record. The record features girl group The Cookies on background vocals, with the Cookies' lead Earl-Jean McCrea getting some solo lines. The song's title is {{a reference to the}} turkey trot dance step, a step that was only briefly popular fifty years before the song was released; the song is played at a tempo much slower than the one used for the dance in its heyday.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and {{intended}} for Bobby Vee, for whom they had already written the song [...] "Take Good Care of My Baby", a number one hit in the United States in 1961 and which remains Vee's biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100. King recorded the demo version of the song and this version was released as a double A-side single with [...] "Nobody's Perfect". Although she had recorded earlier for ABC-Paramount and Alpine Records, '.....September' was Carole King's first commercial success as a singer, having already {{had a number of}} hits as a songwriter. The recording was only ever intended as a demo, and as such there is no master tape, only an acetate. This is the reason why all digital releases of this recording are of inferior quality compared to other songs of this era. However, Don Kirshner liked Carole King's version of [...] "September" [...] so much that even after hearing Bobby Vee's version, he decided to release King's version as a single on the <b>Dimension</b> <b>label.</b> Carole King had two small children and did not have any interest in traveling the country to promote the record. Despite this, Carole King was ultimately persuaded by Don Kirshner and Gerry Goffin to appear on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, where King lip-synched to the record (as was almost always done on the show) and, unlike many other performers who were given good ratings, was given a terrible rating of a 42 out of 100 by the Bandstand kids. While King was devastated by the terribly-rated performance, the song still became popular.|$|E
