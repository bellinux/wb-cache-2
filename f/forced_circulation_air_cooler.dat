For the method to be proposed and furthered in this study, it was decided that: Drying would be done with <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> of unheated <b>air.</b> Drying would be done after grain was put into storage bins.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to offer some solutions to the many disadvantages of using phase change material (PCM) to refrigerate the insulated container for transporting both fresh and frozen goods. Design/methodology/approach - In order to transport both fresh products (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen products (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C), the PCM elements are filled with one eutectic liquid only, so as to avoid problems related to filling and emptying the eutectic plates, and to plate corrosion. Moreover, specially shaped air ducts and a cool flow control system are designed to maintain a uniform <b>circulation</b> of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> and constant humidity values. All the structures of the container are correctly designed by means of FEM calculations to assure that all the structural, safety standards parameters are satisfied.
