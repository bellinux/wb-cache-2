40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new modelling framework for day-ahead electricity prices based on multivariate Levy semistationary (MLSS) processes. Day-ahead prices specify the prices for electricity delivered over certain time {{windows on the}} next day and are determined in a daily auction. Since there are several <b>delivery</b> <b>periods</b> per day, we use a multivariate model to describe the different day-ahead prices for the different <b>delivery</b> <b>periods</b> {{on the next day}}. We extend the work by Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2010) on univariate Levy semistationary processes to a multivariate setting and discuss the probabilistic properties of the new class of stochastic processes. Furthermore, we provide a detailed empirical study using data from the European Energy Exchange (EEX) and give new insights into the intra-daily correlation structure of electricity day-ahead prices in the EEX market. The flexible structure of MLSS processes is able to reproduce the stylized facts of such data rather well. Furthermore, these processes can be used to model negative prices in electricity markets which started to occur recently and cannot be described by many classical models...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} this electricity market mechanism, let us consider the Dutch electricity market. Market participants, referred to as Program Responsible Parties (PRPs), submit their price-quantity bids before 11 am for the <b>delivery</b> <b>period</b> covering the following day from midnight to midnight. The Program Time Unit (PTU) on the balancing market is of 15 minutes. Balancing of the 15-minute averaged power is required from all electrical producers and consumers connected to the grid, who for this purpose may be organised in sub-sets. Since these sub-sets {{are referred to as}} Programmes, balancing on the 15-minute scale is referred to as Programme Balance. Programme Balance now is maintained by using the production schedules issued the day before delivery and measurement reports (distributed the day after delivery). When the measured power is not equal to the scheduled power, the Programme Imbalance is the difference between the realised sum of production and consumption and the forecast sum of production and consumption. If only production from wind energy is taken into account, Programme Imbalance reduces to realised wind production minus forecast wind production. The programme imbalance is the wind production forecast error.|$|E

Considering that a power producer {{has signed a}} forward contract to sell electricity and a call option {{to have the right}} to buy electricity during the same <b>delivery</b> <b>period.</b> In that case, if the generating unit owned by the producer fails just before the <b>delivery</b> <b>period</b> of both contracts and the pool price is expected to be high, the producer can exercise the call option to buy electricity. This way, the producer can comply with its contracting selling obligation by buying the electricity through the call option at the strike price, which will be probably lower than the average pool price during the <b>delivery</b> <b>period.</b> On the other hand, if either the generating unit does not fail or the pool prices are expected to decrease below the strike price, the call option is not exercised.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, to {{evaluate}} how a put option {{is used to}} hedge against the pool price risk faced by a power producer, we consider that the generating unit owned by the power producer does not fail. Besides, {{we assume that the}} realization of high/low pool prices prior to the exercising time of the option will lead to high/low pool prices during its <b>delivery</b> <b>period.</b> In that case, if electricity prices become high before the expiration date, the producer decides not to exercise the option so as to sell its production in the pool at higher prices. On the other hand, falling pool prices between the purchase and the exercising time of the option would encourage the power producer to exercise the put option to sell electricity at the pre-specified strike price, which will be probably higher than the average pool price realization during the <b>delivery</b> <b>period</b> of the option. In this way, the acquisition of the put option allows the producer to hedge against the risk corresponding to the high volatile prices.|$|E

The equilibrium price from compulsory call auctions for distribution companies {{within the framework of the}} Iberian Power Futures Market is not optimal for remuneration purposes as it seems to be slightly upward biased, though such a premium is not significant (only around 2 % above the average of Settlement Prices). In the period considered (August 2006 to September 2008), monthly futures contracts behave similarly to quarterly contracts.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{insight into}} the time-varying relation between electricity futures prices and fundamentals {{in the form of}} contract prices for fossil fuels. As supply curves are not constant and different producers have different marginal costs of production, we argue that the relation between the prices of electricity futures and those of underlying fundamentals such as natural gas, coal and emission rights varies over time. We test this view by applying a model that linearly relates electricity futures prices to the marginal costs of production, and calculate the loglikelihood of different time-varying and constant specifications of the coefficients. To do so, we formulate the model in state-space form and apply the Kalman filter to observe the dynamics of the coefficients. We analyze historical prices of futures contracts with different <b>delivery</b> <b>periods</b> (calendar year and seasons, peak and off-peak) from Germany and the United Kingdom. The results indicate that analysts should choose a time-varying specification to relate the futures price of power to the prices of underlying fundamentals...|$|R

Thus, the objective is to develop an integrated system from globally coordinated planning and short-term production control with distributed cooperative local control stations.

Empirical part was carried out between December 2012 and March 2013. The examined file was built of ten respondents - five midwifes and five women who used {{at least one of these}} methods during pregnancy, <b>delivery</b> and puerperium <b>period.</b> Due to two examined files two types of interviews had to be made. The data were recorded or written down by hand. Records were after the interview written down in standard language. Afterwards the classification of the data was made by using colour marks to be able to find easier the main topics. By interpreting quotations of the respondents were used. The result of the research was that the relationship of midwifes to Homeopathy is mainly positive. One midwife had a different opinion. Acupuncture is not as close to midwifes as the Homeopathy. Two midwifes had a positive opinion to this method. Three were indifferent which is to explain as a positive and negative opinion in certain matters. Acupressure was evaluated in all cases as positive. Homeopathy is the most prevalent method. All five midwifes have a personal experience with Homeopathy. Three from five use this method in practice. Acupuncture is not used by anyone. Only one midwife has her own experience with Acupuncture. Acupressure is used by two midwifes of five in practice. Two midwifes described a personal experience with Acupressure, but they do not use it in practice. One midwife has neither a personal experience nor uses the method in practice. From the results it was clearly visible that all women have a positive opinion about Homeopathy. From the further answers results that two women have a positive opinion about Acupuncture. Two women have an indifferent opinion? one was not sure about the capabilities of the therapist and the other was unsure about the effectiveness of the method. The last woman had a negative opinion.
