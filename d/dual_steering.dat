50|$|The Summit VXL 1/16 was {{released}} on November 1, 2010. It is a smaller version of the 1/10 scale Summit without locking diffs, LED lights and <b>dual</b> <b>steering</b> servos. It {{is powered by a}} Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC. Almost all of the major components are shared with the E-Revo VXL 1/16 {{with the exception of a}} few suspension parts, wheels, tires, body and bumpers. The claimed top speed is 25-40 mph depending on whether one or two battery packs are used. Optional front and rear LED lights are available, pre-drilled holes are located in the front and rear bumpers.|$|E
50|$|Released in {{late spring}} 2009, the E-Revo VXL 1/16 is {{essentially}} a scaled down version of the larger 1/10 scale E-Revo. The body, wheels, tires, suspension and drive components are all nearly identical in design to the 1/10 scale E-Revo, just scaled down. It {{is powered by a}} Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC, both scaled down versions of the Velineon 3500kv brushless motor and VXL-3s brushless ESC used in Traxxas' 1/10 scale brushless vehicles. Some of the inevitable sacrifices inherent with the smaller scale include the lack of the optional two-speed transmission, many rubber sealed components, and <b>dual</b> <b>steering</b> servos offered on the 1/10 scale version. Claimed top speeds depend on which battery packs are used. One 7.2 v NiMH pack will reach 30 mph. Two 7.2 v NiMH packs will reach 50 mph. One 3s 11.1v lipo pack will reach 50 mph.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} today’s vehicles gives drivers help {{with everything from}} adaptive cruisecontrol to warning lights for low fuel level. But the increasing functionality also increases the risk offailures in the system. To prevent system failures, different safety analytic methods can be used, e. g.,fault trees and/or FMEA-tables. These methods are generally performed manually, and due to thegrowing system size the time spent on safety analysis is growing with increased risk of human errors. If the safety analysis can be automated, lots of time can be saved. This thesis investigates the possibility to generate fault trees from safety requirements as wellas which additional information, if any, that is needed for the generation. Safety requirements are requirements on the systems functionality {{that has to be}} fulfilled {{for the safety of the}} system to be guaranteed. This means that the safety of the truck, the driver, and the surroundings, depend on thefulfillment of those requirements. The requirements describing the system are structured in a graphusing contract theory. Contract theory defines the dependencies between requirements and connectsthem in a contract structure. To be able to automatically generate the fault tree for a system, information about the systems failure propagation is needed. For this a Bayesian network is used. The network is built from the contract structure and stores the propagation information in all the nodes of the network. This will result in a failure propagation network, which the fault tree generation will be generated from. The failure propagation network is used to see which combinations of faults in the system can violate thesafety goal, i. e., causing one or several hazards. The result of this will be the base of the fault tree. The automatic generation was tested on two different Scania systems, the fuel level displayand the <b>dual</b> circuit <b>steering.</b> Validation was done by comparing the automatically generated trees withmanually generated trees for the two systems showing that the proposed method works as intended. The case studies show that the automated fault tree generation works if the failure propagationinformation exists and can save a lot of time and also minimize the errors made by manuallygenerating the fault trees. The generated fault trees can also be used to validate written requirementsto by analyzing the fault trees created from them...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} the on-road driving performance {{of patients with}} glaucoma. METHODS. The sample comprised 20 patients with glaucoma and 20 subjects with normal vision, all licensed drivers, matched for age and sex. Driving performance was tested over a 10 -km route incorporating 55 standardized maneuvers and skills through residential and business districts of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Testing was conducted by a professional driving instructor and assessed by an occupational therapist certified in driver rehabilitation, masked to participant group membership and level of vision. Main outcome measures were total number of satisfactory maneuvers and skills, overall rating, and incidence of at-fault critical interventions (application of the <b>dual</b> brake and/or <b>steering</b> override by the driving instructor to prevent a potentially unsafe maneuver). Measures of visual function included visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual fields (Humphrey Field Analyzer; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA; mean deviation [MD] and binocular Esterman points). RESULTS. There {{was no significant difference}} between patients with glaucoma (mean MD = − 1. 7 dB [SD 2. 2] and − 6. 5 dB [SD 4. 9], better and worse eyes, respectively) and control subjects in total satisfactory maneuvers and skills (P = 0. 65), or overall rating (P = 0. 60). However, 12 (60 %) patients with glaucoma had one or more at-fault critical interventions, compared with 4 (20 %) control subjects (odds ratio = 6. 00, 95 % CI, 1. 46 – 24. 69; higher still after adjustment for age, sex, medications and driving exposure), the predominant reason being failure to see and yield to a pedestrian. In the glaucoma group, worse-eye MD was associated with the overall rating of driving (r = 0. 66, P = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS. This sample of patients with glaucoma with slight to moderate visual field impairment performed many real-world driving maneuvers safely. However, they were six times as likely as subjects with normal vision to have a driving instructor intervene for reasons suggesting difficulty with detection of peripheral obstacles and hazards and reaction to unexpected events. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|For the Australian market, the Tarago eight-seater {{launched}} in February 1983. Like European models, Tarago frontal styling mirrored the TownAce rather than MasterAce Surf—therefore single-unit headlamps and slimmer bumpers were on offer. At launch, {{three levels of}} trim were on offer—base DX, GL and luxury GLS—all fitted with the 1.8-liter 2Y-C gasoline engine rated at [...] and 140 Nm (designated YR20). The 2.0-liter 2C diesel giving [...] and 118 Nm arrived in July 1983 as an option for the DX trim (designated CR21RG). Five-speed manual transmission was standard, with four-speed automatic on the GLS model that also added power <b>steering,</b> <b>dual</b> zone air-conditioning, power windows, a moonroof, alloy wheels, an ice box, and from October 1984—cruise control and front seat armrests. Gasoline models received an engine upgrade in March 1984 to the 2.0-liter 3Y-C rated at [...] and 162 Nm (designated YR21), with the DX and GL now gaining the option of a three-speed automatic. With an October 1985 facelift, the MasterAce Surf styling updates were specified—thus twin headlamps and bulky bumpers now featured alongside trim and equipment upgrades. At the same time, the YR21 GL became the GX, {{and a series of}} 2.2-liter 4Y-E gasoline models with [...] and 180 Nm appeared in the new manual-only GLi and updated automatic GLS (YR22). The GLS also gained a high-roof skylight and individual second row chairs, which reduced its carrying capacity to seven people. A new GLi Xtra Trak four-wheel drive also arrived in October 1985 with the 2.2 gasoline engine (YR31). By early 1987, escalating sales led to the introduction of a budget-conscious RV 2.2-liter gasoline manual (rear-wheel drive). By 1988, the optional three-speed automatic had completely made way for the four-speed unit on the DX (YR21), GLi (YR22) and GLi Xtra Trak (YR31). In late 1988 the GX gained the 2.2-liter engine to become the GXi; {{at the same time a}} series of refinements were implemented across the range.|$|R
