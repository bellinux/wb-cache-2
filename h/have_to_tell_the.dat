500|$|Upon {{viewing the}} {{performance}} of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Guèye decided to return to the Olympics once again. He maintained that he had a hard time explaining the sport to his fellow countrymen, saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> people what snow is, what skis are, I have to tell them what big mountains are. They don't have any reference on these things." [...] Joining Guèye at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and becoming the second Senegalese athlete to compete at a Winter Games, was ski instructor Alphonse Gomis, who resides in Tignes, near Albertville. As at the 1984 Winter Games, Guèye was Senegal's flagbearer during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony. No support staff were sent with the skiers, so that when Guèye injured his back, a doctor from the American team treated him.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 review asserted: [...] "Many are the {{knowledgeable}} and discriminating {{people for whom}} Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific, brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all." [...] In 1987, however, John Rockwell of The New York Times reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while South Pacific had been innovative for 1949, [...] "Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, South Pacific epitomized {{the concerns of the}} day– America's responsibilities {{in the world and the}} dangers of racism.... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with M*A*S*H having contemporized this same setting". [...] A 2008 Huffington Post review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on [...] "exotic background roles" [...] in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she [...] "speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." [...] South Pacific is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, Helmet for My Pillow, after he walked out of a performance: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story of how it really was. I have to let people know the war wasn't a musical." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{scheduled}} to spend June and July 2006 on the main stage of the Warped Tour, but on July 28, 2006, {{it was announced that}} Underoath was dropping off the remaining dates of the tour. A statement from the band stated that the members [...] "felt it necessary to take some immediate time to focus on our friendship, as that's more important than risking it for the sake of touring at this time." [...] In an Alternative Press cover story on Underoath, Michael [...] "Fat Mike" [...] Burkett told the magazine that Chamberlain had confided in him that Underoath's band members had been [...] "having a lot of arguments over their religious beliefs." [...] Burkett admitted to Punknews.org that he had poked fun at the band for their beliefs, but emphasized that he befriended Underoath's band members {{at the start of the}} tour and had a personal policy of not making jokes on-stage about anyone he was not friends with or did not like personally. It was also spread that the band's withdrawal from the tour was due to Chamberlain's rumored drug problems and time spent in rehabilitation, to which Gillespie responded, [...] "If there was something serious going on like that and he was in rehab, we'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> press. But it's just not true." [...] Underoath toured extensively throughout Europe, Australia and Asia in the late 2006, from February to April in 2007 toured with Taking Back Sunday and Armor for Sleep.|$|E

2500|$|Bowes asked Gowrie {{again later}} in November, and wrote to Walsingham {{saying he had}} told Gowrie that Queen Mary was now {{claiming}} they were forgeries, and was hoping to obtain them herself to deface and destroy them (perhaps to further the [...] "Association".) Bowes argued that Mary had the means to steal them from Scotland {{and they would be}} safer in England. Gowrie said he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> King about the request and Bowes preferred not. In their next interview, Gowrie told Bowes that James VI already knew where the letters were.|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese wrote that, [...] "I {{was playing}} full-back and dropped a few bombs the All Blacks put up to me.

2500|$|Several {{commentators}} {{complained that}} because Pietersen changed {{from being a}} right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. Gideon Haigh said that [...] "A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming {{will depend on the}} placement of the off stump". Ian Healy seconded this by saying [...] "It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit {{to one side of the}} field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups." [...] Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued [...] "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> umpire if he is going over or round the wicket." ...|$|E
60|$|Wet {{clothing}} was changed for dry, {{and then the}} captain and the boys listened to what Baxter and <b>the</b> girls <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>The</b> captain was glad to learn {{that so many of}} his men had been saved, and asked for the names.|$|R

60|$|Then {{their story}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be told in detail. Soon it became noised {{all over the}} place that the Dartaway had been wrecked, and before they could get a mouthful to eat <b>the</b> three Rovers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story over and over again.|$|R
