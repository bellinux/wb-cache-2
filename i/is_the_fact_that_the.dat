5|$|Of {{particular}} interest <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Schechter Letter account of Oleg's death (namely, that he fled to and raided FRS, tentatively identified with Persia, and was slain there) bears remarkable parallels to {{the account of}} Arab historians such as Ibn Miskawayh, who described a similar Rus' attack on the Muslim state of Arran in the year 944/5.|$|E
5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E

5|$|This {{disparity}} between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in south-western Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and south-western Scotland <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Grey Mare and her Colts—a chambered long barrow located two and a half miles south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's point of view <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out {{to serve as the}} test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that {{it is virtually impossible to}} pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E
5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud between father and son <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> image of Ivan Sratsimir {{was not included in the}} Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E

25|$|Testimony to {{the close}} {{relationship}} shared by Iraq and western Iran during the Abbasid era and later centuries, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two regions came {{to share the}} same name. The western region of Iran (ancient Media) was called 'Irāq-e 'Ajamī ("Persian Iraq"), while central-southern Iraq (Babylonia) was called 'Irāq al-'Arabī ("Arabic Iraq") or Bābil ("Babylon"). And the name Iraq comes from the ancient Mesopotamian city Uruk, which suggests an even older relationship.|$|E
25|$|The Civil War was {{the last}} time a belligerent power seriously resorted to privateering.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{theory of}} Linear Pottery culture origin {{is that it}} came from the Starčevo-Körös culture of Serbia and Hungary. Supporting this view <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> LBK appeared earliest about 5600–5400 BC on the middle Danube in the Starčevo range. Presumably, the expansion northwards of early Starčevo-Körös produced a local variant reaching the upper Tisza that may have well been created by contact with native epi-Paleolithic people. This small group began a new tradition of pottery, substituting engravings for the paintings of the Balkanic cultures.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{usually has}} a major effect on the rate of a {{chemical}} reaction. Molecules at a higher temperature have more thermal energy. Although collision frequency is greater at higher temperatures, this alone contributes {{only a very small}} proportion to the increase in rate of reaction. Much more important <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proportion of reactant molecules with sufficient energy to react (energy greater than activation energy: E>E'a) is significantly higher and is explained in detail by the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution of molecular energies.|$|E
25|$|Most importantly, from a lawyer's perspective, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{principle}} of stare decisis {{does not apply}} to tribunals. In other words, a tribunal adjudicator could legally make a decision that differs from a past decision, on the same subject and issues, delivered by the highest court in the land. Because a tribunal is not bound by legal precedent, established by itself or by a reviewing court, a tribunal is not a court even though it performs an important adjudicative function and contributes to the development of law like a court would do.|$|E

25|$|In Alone Together, Turkle explores where {{technology}} is taking us and how society adapts to answer new questions {{brought on by}} the rise of mobile technologies, robots, computers, and other electronic gadgets. In particular, Turkle raises concerns about the way in which genuine, organic social interactions become degraded through constant exposure to illusory meaningful exchanges with artificial intelligence. Underlying Turkle's central argument <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> technological developments which have most contributed to the rise of inter-connectivity have at the same time bolstered a sense of alienation between people. The alienation involves links between social networks favouring those of proper conversations.|$|E
25|$|LORAN was {{a simple}} system that {{compared}} the arrival times of pulses to make a measurement. Ideally, perfectly formed rectangular blips would be displayed on the CRT, whose leading edge could be compared with accuracy. In practice, the transmitters cannot turn on and off instantly, and due {{to a variety of}} factors the resulting blips are spread out in time. Adding to this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shape of the resulting blip, the envelope, depends on the frequency of the system, meaning the lower-frequency systems like LORAN will generally have less accuracy than higher-frequency ones like Gee.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metals such as {{lead and}} cadmium have {{been implicated in}} osteoporosis. Cadmium and lead {{promotes}} the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) which is the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis (the mechanism by which the body breaks down clots) and {{shown to be a}} cause of hypofibrinolysis. Persistent blood clots can lead to congestive blood flow (hyperemia) in bone marrow, impaired blood flow and ischaemia in bone tissue resulting in lack of oxygen (hypoxia), bone cell damage and eventual cell death (apoptosis). Of significance <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> average concentration of cadmium in human bones in the 20th century has increased to about 10 times above the pre-industrial level.|$|E
