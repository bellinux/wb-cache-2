40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the aerobic stability and losses during the fermentation process of triticale silages in single crop or in mixtures <b>with</b> <b>oats</b> and/or legumes. The following crops were used for silage production: triticale (X. Triticosecale Wittimack), triticale intercropped with forage pea (Pisum arvense) and triticale intercropped <b>with</b> <b>oats</b> (Avena strigosa Schreb), forage pea and vetch (Vicia sativa). The dry matter content and its recovery did not differ among the silages. Buffer capacity was higher for tricale silage intercropped <b>with</b> <b>oats,</b> forage pea and vetch(88. 67 m eq. NaOH/ 100 g DM) followed by triticale intercropped with forage pea (80. 80 m eq. NaOH/ 100 g DM). Electric conductivity values were higher in the intercropped triticale silages. Triticale silage presented the lowest temperatures observed in the silos, and the silages of intercropped triticale silages presented higher heat retention and higher pH values. Silage of triticale intercropped <b>with</b> <b>oats</b> and legumes presented lower aerobic stability but it did not reduce the aerobic stability of the total feed. Dry matter recovery during storage and in stability evaluations in aerobiosis is similar among the silages...|$|R

40|$|Four {{groups of}} eight New Zealand hybrid rab- bits were <b>fattened</b> <b>with</b> ad libitum {{access to the}} {{following}} pelleted experimental diets: ryegrass meal or alfalfa meal fed either alone or <b>with</b> <b>oats</b> meal in a ratio of 1 : 1. After 25 weeks they were slaughtered and dissected. Fatty acid (FA) proﬁles of caecotrophs (re-ingested fermentation products of the caecum), perirenal adipose tissue and intramuscular fat in the Musculus quadriceps were deter- mined. With high proportions of branched-chain FA (BFA) and trans FA, and increased proportions of saturated FA relative to the diets, the caecotroph FA proﬁle showed a clear ﬁngerprint of anaerobe microbial lipid metabolism including biohydrogenation. By contrast, the FA proﬁles of adipose and lean tissue comprised high proportions of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), whilst BFA and trans FA occurred in much lower proportions compared to the ca- ecotrophs. Thus, coprophagy did not substantially modify the FA composition of the tissues investigated. Use of forage-only diets, compared to the oats supplemented diets, led to extraordinary high proportions of n- 3 PUFA (including 18 : 3 and long-chain n- 3) in the fat of adipose (21. 3 vs. 6. 7 %) and lean tissue (15. 4 vs. 5. 7 %). The forage type diet (grass vs. alfalfa) had smaller effects on the FA proﬁles. Indications of diet effects on endogenous desatu- ration, chain elongation and differential distribution offunctional FA between the two tissues investigated were found...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine how tillage intensity, the use of biofumigation brassica cover crops and mixed cropping <b>with</b> <b>oats</b> affect the performance of organic peas with respect to weed pressure, diseases, and yield. Fields were either ploughed {{to a depth of}} about 15 - 20 cm or only to about 8 cm in late summer followed by either Sinapis alba (low glucosinolate (GSC) content), Raphanus sativus (medium GSC) or Brassica juncea (high GSC). Brassicas were mulched in fall right before flowering and incorporated in the top soil. In mixtures <b>with</b> <b>oats</b> seed rate for peas was as in pure stands, for oats it was 20 %. There was a dramatic spring drought in 2011 resulting in severe water stress for the peas in 2011. Weeds were significantly reduced by about 45 % by oats in both years. Neither tillage nor any of the brassica cover crops or mixing <b>with</b> <b>oats</b> had a significant effect on root disease severity of peas or the pathogen composition. In both years pea lower stems and roots were mostly infected by Phoma medicaginis. In 2011, about half of the infected plants were also infected by Mycosphaerella pinodes and up to 20 % with Ascochyta pisi. Pea yields were 2. 2 t ha- 1 and 2. 1 t ha- 1 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Oat yields were 3. 0 and 4. 9 t ha- 1, respectively. Mixing <b>with</b> <b>oats</b> reduced pea yields by 32 and 63 % in 2010 and 2011, respectively while the oats yielded about 45 % of the pure stands. Tillage did not affect yields, however, pea yields in plots that had been planted to R. sativus as cover crop were significantly reduced. Subsequent wheat yields in the rotation were significantly higher after peas and the pea-oat mixture than after oats alone...|$|R

40|$|One {{farm with}} green oaks and another with cork oaks were chosen. Aiming to {{minimize}} weather effects {{and to provide}} swine equivalent pastures, under oak canopy, density of trees was similar and geographic area limited within Ourique County. Alentejano hogs, born and raised inside the region and recorded in the breed herd book, were fattened exclusively under oaks. Chemical composition of acorns from green oaks (AG) and from cork oaks (AC) were analysed including the fatty acids profile. Pigs were weighted 3 times during fattening period and ecographies were performed to evaluate back fat thickness (BF) and loin depth (LD). After slaughter samples of back fat were taken and analysed on chemical crude composition and fatty acids. Weight losses of hams were recorded along ripening period. Chemical composition of AG and AC were different. Considering percent of DM, we got for AG vs AC: NDF 24. 9 vs 29. 8 (p< 0. 001); CP 3. 67 vs 5. 57 (p< 0. 05); Lipids 8. 00 vs 6. 20 (p< 0. 05). Fatty acids profile have shown higher percentage of saturated on AG (p< 0. 001) and exhibit higher percentage of unsaturated on AC (p< 0. 001). Acorns type, AG vs AC, didn’t affect significantly ADG neither the BF, but LD was deeper in hogs <b>fattened</b> <b>with</b> AC. Fatty acids of pigs <b>fattened</b> <b>with</b> AG vs pigs <b>fattened</b> <b>with</b> AC reflected the feed influence (C 16 : 0, AG 19. 53 vs AC 18. 62 p< 0. 001; C 18 : 0, AG 8. 91 vs AC 8. 43 p< 0. 05; C 18 : 1, AG 56. 09 vs AC 55. 17 p< 0. 001; C 18 : 2 AG 8. 23 vs AC 10. 42 p< 0. 001).

40|$|Postweaning {{management}} strategies that include {{an element of}} social enrichment may reduce weaning stress and improve welfare and productive performance. We analyzed the effect of postweaning handling strategies on welfare and production traits in lambs. After weaning, 36 lambs were assigned to 3 experimental groups with 12 lambs each (control [C], <b>fattening</b> <b>with</b> gentle human female contact [H], and <b>fattening</b> <b>with</b> 2 adult ewes [E]). The average daily gain (ADG) was estimated. Blood samples were taken, and infrared thermography was used to estimate stress variables. There were significant differences among treatments (in favor of alternative strategies) regarding production and stress variables (cortisol, glucose, and creatine kinase). The {{results suggest that the}} lambs handled gently during the fattening were less reactive and better able to modulate their physiological stress. The E group adapted better to acute stress than the C group but was less efficient in modulating chronic stress. Both treatments showed higher slaughter live weights and better ADGs compared with the control.

40|$|Winter oats {{were grown}} {{according}} to European organic farming regulations in monoculture (oats) and in intercropping with bard vetch (BAV), bitter vetch (BIV) or both legumes (MIX) {{to evaluate the}} effects of intercropping on forage yield and nutritive value for ruminants. The experiment was carried out as a {{randomised complete block design}} with four replications, and whole forage samples were obtained at two harvest dates (June and July). For both harvest times, all intercrops increased (P < 0. 05) forage yield compared <b>with</b> <b>oats,</b> but forage crude protein content was only increased (P < 0. 05) for BAV and MIX. Compared <b>with</b> <b>oats,</b> intercropping <b>with</b> BAV increased (P < 0. 05) in vitro rate of gas production and total volatile fatty acid production, indicating a higher rate and extent of rumen degradation of BAV forage. In contrast, BIV forage harvested in June had lower (P < 0. 05) rate of gas production and total volatile fatty acid production than June oats, but in general no differences in the in vitro rumen fermentation were detected between oats and BIV samples harvested in July. The results indicate that forage yield and quality can be enhanced by intercropping <b>oats</b> <b>with</b> BAV; however, intercropping with BIV increased yield but decreased nutritive value of the forage. © CSIRO 2014.
