We use a stylized mathematical model of the world GDP whose growth leads to the increase of <b>industrial</b> <b>emission</b> provided in investment in "cleaning" technology acts as a control parameter in the model. The optimal control maximizing a standard economic utility index is described. Two components in total emission are distinguished: <b>industrial</b> <b>emission</b> and natural emission. It is assumed that natural emission is uncertain. We use IPCC scenarios for the world GDP and fossil fuel emission to calibrate the model. For a given range of uncertain values of natural emission, we construct a bundle of optimal trajectories of the GDP, <b>industrial</b> <b>emission,</b> "production" technology stock and "cleaning" technology stock. We analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} optimal trajectories and optimal utility to variations in the values of natural emission. Finally, we introduce a modified control policy assuming reduction of natural emission prior to intensive development of "cleaning" technology, and carry out its cost-benefit analysis...|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{measurements}} of tropospheric column O 3 and NO 2 in eastern and southeastern Asia are analyzed {{to study the}} spatial and seasonal characteristics of pollution in these regions. Tropospheric column O 3 is derived from differential {{measurements of}} total column ozone from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), and stratospheric column ozone from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). The tropospheric column NO 2 is measured by Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME). A global chemical and transport model (Model of Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 2; MOZART- 2) is applied to analyze and interpret the satellite measurements. The study, {{which is based on}} spring, summer, and fall months of 1997 shows generally good agreement between the model and satellite data with respect to seasonal and spatial characteristics of O 3 and NO 2 fields. The analysis of the model results show that the <b>industrial</b> <b>emission</b> of NOx (NO[*]+[*]NO 2) contributes about 50 %– 80 % to tropospheric column NO 2 in eastern Asia and about 20 %– 50 % in southeastern Asia. The contribution of <b>industrial</b> <b>emission</b> of NOx to tropospheric column O 3 ranges from 10 % to 30 % in eastern Asia. Biomass burning and lightning NOx emissions have a small effect on tropospheric O 3 in central and eastern Asia, but they have a significant impact in southeastern Asia. The varying effects of NOx on tropospheric column ozone are attributed to differences in relative abundance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with respect to total nitrogen in the two regions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractReduction of {{industrial}} emissions {{is a central}} target within the general goal of environmental protection. In Germany, the Emission Control Act of 1974 provided a thorough basis for emission restriction causing chemical industry to react and to start programs to reduce air pollution by technical measures, leading to a substantial improvement {{of the quality of}} life in the neighborhood {{of industrial}} complexes. Despite of large improvements achieved in the last decades, there is still room for more. In this paper an overview will be given about how these programs were applied in a medium size resin producing unit.

Ambient observations and industrial process data, such as mass flow rates for industrial flares, indicate that the VOCs associated with these <b>industrial</b> <b>emissions</b> can have significant temporal variability. To characterize {{the effect of this}} variability in emissions on ozone formation in Houston, data were collected on the temporal variability of <b>industrial</b> <b>emissions</b> or emission surrogates (e. g., mass flow rates to flares).
