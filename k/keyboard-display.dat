5000|$|In 1970, {{concurrent}} {{with the}} announcement of System/370, {{the next generation of}} mainframes after System/360, a new system was announced, called RETAIN/370. This system was designed for use by special Technical Support Centers located in regional centers, rather than by the branch office. This new system was designed to support display terminals, rather than the old typewriter-based ones. A special version of the 2915 display, originally designed for the airline reservations systems, such as SABRE, was used. The 2915 was a small <b>keyboard-display</b> driven by a large electronic controller and data interchange unit, the IBM 2948. Each 2948 supported up to 31 display terminals, which had to be located within a few hundred feet. The cost of this display system, with its large controller, prevented the 2915 terminals from being utilized in branch offices. Thus, the use of regional support centers for this system. The older RETAIN system continued to be used for several years afterwards, running in parallel with RETAIN/370, still providing direct support to branch-office terminals. It was sometimes called the [...] "RETAIN/360" [...] system, although that designation was never formalized. In time, after RETAIN/370 became available via 3270 terminals in the branch offices, the old RETAIN system was phased out, and RETAIN/370 was renamed to simply RETAIN.|$|E
