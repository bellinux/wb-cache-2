We see old black-and-white footage showing the devastation of Berlin, the work of Trümmerfrauen — women in long lines relaying buckets of rubble — and the haunting green shadows of troops photographed with night-vision cameras in Iraq. Rather than rendering a cohesive argument, Suderburg relies on juxtaposition and the associations generated by seeing patterns of power, oppression, destruction and rebuilding.

However, Suderburg’s images are striking for the sharp differences they suggest between the imperialist order that was shaken in World War II and the contemporary call for shock and awe. It’s clear that the regimes taking shape now, which wield enormous power, demand new modes of resistance — a project undertaken by Suderburg’s engaging film and its call for active, thoughtful viewers to step forward and make sense of our world.

40|$|The {{present study}} was a {{systematic}} investigation of <b>hierarchical</b> skill <b>sequences</b> in the early social development domain. Recent {{research has suggested that}} social development may be conceptualized as a phenomena involving a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>sequencing</b> of competencies. In particular, social development may involve sequential changes in capability, reflecting successively higher levels of functioning within these competencies. The conceptual problem of this study focused on the construction and validation of a meaningful representation of ability in early social development. Ability was conceptualized as a composite of cognitive procedures governing the performance of specific tasks. The process for constructing skill sequences to reflect ability involved identifying task characteristics or demands which imposed various requirements on cognitive functioning. <b>Hierarchical</b> skill <b>sequences</b> were constructed to tap a variety of capabilities within the early social development domain. These skill sequences included understanding emotions, identifying and mediating needs, understanding friendships, and understanding fairness in decision making. Assessment items were developed to reflect each of these skill sequences based on the cognitive processes that are necessary for correct performance. This involved varying the task demands imposing various requirements on cognitive processing. The data were from 18, 305 Head Start children ranging from 30 to 83 months of age. Latent trait models were constructed to reflect the hypothesized skill sequences by allowing the discrimination and difficulty parameters to be free to vary or by constraining them to be equal to other parameters. To arrive at a preferred model, each latent trait model was statistically compared against alternative latent trait models. In general, the results from the present investigation supported the hypothesis that the acquisition of social skills is a developmental phenomena involving a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>sequencing</b> of competencies. Moreover, the study supports the assumption that changes in capability can be defined by progress toward abstraction, complexity, stability, and the handling of increasing quantities of information. While the results provide a deeper understanding of early social development, future research is needed to extend the developmental structure to higher levels of ability. Moreover, {{research is needed to determine}} how the information gleaned from developmental assessment can be utilized in planning learning experiences to enhance development...|$|R

The {{goal of this}} project {{was to develop a}} general, complete linkage hierarchical clustering method that 1) substantially improves upon the accuracy of the standard complete linkage method and 2) can be fully automated or used with minimal operator supervision. For {{the first part of the}} project, a new, complete linkage hierarchical clustering method was developed. The INCLude (InterNodal Complete Linkage) hierarchical clustering method unwinds the assumptions that underlie the standard complete linkage method. Further, evaluating pairs of data points for linkage is decoupled from constructing cluster sets, and cluster sets are constructed de novo instead of updating previously constructed cluster sets. Thus, it is possible to construct only the cluster sets for select, possibly noncontiguous levels of an n(n - 1) / 2 + 1 -level <b>hierarchical</b> <b>sequence.</b> However, by unwinding the assumptions that underlie the standard complete linkage method, the size of a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>sequence</b> reverts back from n levels to n(n - 1) / 2 + 1 levels, and the time complexity to construct cluster sets becomes O(n 4). For the second part of the project, a means was developed for finding meaningful levels of an n(n- 1) / 2 + 1 -level <b>hierarchical</b> <b>sequence</b> prior to performing a cluster analysis. The means includes constructing at least one distance graph, which is visually examined for features that correlate with meaningful levels of the corresponding <b>hierarchical</b> <b>sequence.</b> Thus, it is possible to know which cluster sets to construct and construct only these cluster sets. This reduces the time complexity to construct cluster sets from O(n 4) to O(ln 2), where l is the number of meaningful levels. The second part also looked at how increasing the dimensionality of the data points helps reveal inherent structure in noisy data, which is necessary for finding meaningful levels. The third part of the project resolved how to mathematically capture the graphical relationships that underlie the above-described features and integrate the means into the new clustering method. By doing so, the new method becomes self-contained and incurs almost no extra cost to determine which cluster sets should be constructed and which should not.
