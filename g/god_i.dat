5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my <b>God,</b> <b>I</b> hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of <b>God.</b> <b>I</b> know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my <b>god!</b> <b>I</b> can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

25|$|You have {{misunderstood}} {{the whole}} article, because you {{jumped to the}} conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call <b>God</b> <b>I</b> call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter.

25|$|In Travnik, he {{established}} a Divan, a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up the Bosnian government.

One anecdote that illustrates this is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether he was scared of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. <b>God</b> <b>I</b> fear slightly, Gradaščević replied, the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more than my own horse.|$|E
