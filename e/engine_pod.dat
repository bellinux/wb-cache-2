25|$|Engines on the 737 Classic series (-300, -400, -500) and Next-Generation series (-600, -700, -800, -900) do {{not have}} {{circular}} inlets like most aircraft. The 737 Classic series featured CFM56 turbofan engines, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy {{and a reduction in}} noise over the JT8D engines used on the −100 and −200, but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737. Boeing and engine supplier CFMI solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of (rather than below) the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides (rather than the bottom) of the <b>engine</b> <b>pod,</b> giving the 737 a distinctive non-circular air intake.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{power unit}} {{comprises}} two Soloviev D-25VF [...] turbo-shaft engines mounted below main gearboxes which each drive five-bladed [...] diameter rotors and the synchronisation shafts which run from wing-tip to wing-tip. Each paired <b>engine</b> <b>pod</b> has large access panels which open up for maintenance access and also form platforms for servicing crews to operate from.|$|E

2500|$|Gen. Charles [...] "Chuck" [...] Yeager's 10 December 1963 flying {{accident}} {{during a}} test flight in a modified rocket-boosted Lockheed NF-104A Starfighter {{was featured in}} The Right Stuff motion picture. The aircraft used for filming was a standard German Luftwaffe F-104G, flying with its wingtip fuel tanks removed; it otherwise lacked any of the NF-104A's modifications, most visibly the rocket <b>engine</b> <b>pod</b> {{at the base of}} the vertical stabilizer.|$|E
2500|$|Boeing {{engineer}} Mark Gregoire led {{a design}} team, which cooperated with CFM International to select, modify and deploy a new engine and nacelle {{that would make}} the 737-300 into a viable aircraft. They chose the CFM56-3B-1 high-bypass turbofan engine to power the aircraft, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise, but also posed an engineering challenge, given the low ground clearance of the 737 and the larger diameter of the engine over the original Pratt & Whitney engines. Gregoire's team and CFM solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan (which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be), placing the engine ahead of the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides of the <b>engine</b> <b>pod,</b> giving the engine a distinctive non-circular [...] "hamster pouch" [...] air intake. Earlier customers for the CFM56 included the U.S. Air Force with its program to re-engine KC-135 tankers.|$|E

50|$|The tilting engine concept {{introduced}} complexities in {{the design}} of the <b>engines</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>pods</b> to be able to shift from operating horizontally to operating vertically. Those problems were addressed fairly early in the XV-15 program.|$|R
25|$|In 1950, Convair (then still Consolidated-Vultee) {{developed}} streamlined pods, {{looking like}} oversize drop tanks, that were mounted {{on each side}} of the B-36's fuselage to carry spare engines between bases. Each pod could airlift two <b>engines.</b> When the <b>pods</b> were empty, they were removed and carried in the bomb bays. There is no record of the special <b>engine</b> <b>pods</b> ever being used.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} Zeppelin Riesenflugzeuge, the R.XV had two <b>engine</b> <b>pods</b> with four <b>engines</b> in a {{push-pull}} configuration, {{large enough for}} some inflight maintenance. Additional power was provided by a fifth engine mounted in {{the nose of the}} aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Seawind is most {{distinctive}} for its <b>engine</b> <b>pod,</b> which juts {{forward from the}} leading edge of the very large vertical fin. The design is also noted for its long, low profile and sleek curves made practical by composite construction.|$|E

50|$|The PD-1's wings fold {{along its}} sides, {{and the main}} landing gear and road <b>engine</b> <b>pod</b> slide aft along special rails, {{creating}} a driving configuration. The driving configuration compensates for the rearward center of gravity created by the folded wings, and provides additional stability for road travel.|$|E
2500|$|During development, the Avro 730 {{underwent}} re-design work so that {{it could}} perform as a bomber as well as a reconnaissance platform. Although the new version looked much like the original, it was larger overall and featured a new wing planform. In order to increase wing area, extra [...] "winglettes" [...] were added outside of the <b>engine</b> <b>pods</b> and the entire planform was re-shaped {{to be more of a}} classic delta wing. The wing inside the <b>engine</b> <b>pods,</b> about ⅔ of the overall span, was swept at about 45°, the smaller area outboard of the engine was more highly swept at about 60°. The forward sweep on the trailing edge was removed. The <b>engine</b> <b>pods</b> were now specified to carry four Armstrong-Siddeley P.176 engines each, for a total of eight. The pods were circular at the front and mounted a single large shock cone, and grew progressively more [...] "square" [...] to the rear, where they ended flush with the rear of the wing. Much of the layout was generally the same as the earlier version, with the rectangular canards, [...] "hidden" [...] cockpit and large cropped-delta vertical fin at the rear.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>pod</b> {{carries a}} {{separate}} engine for road travel {{with its own}} fuel tank. The wheels are driven through an automatic transmission with a reverse gear. The lightweight fuselage coupled with a low power engine allows 25 mpg fuel economy with [...] of usable fuel. The aircraft is registered in Washington State as a motorcycle due to its 3-wheel configuration.|$|E
50|$|The Seawolf {{version was}} {{designed}} for light maritime patrol duties and features a hardpoint under each wing to carry external stores, including bombs, rocket pods, gun pods, or rescue equipment. Provision for a radar unit was made on the forward end of the <b>engine</b> <b>pod.</b> The Seafury includes improved anti-corrosion measures and a hardened interior to improve its servicability in saltwater environments, {{as well as a}} storage compartment carrying survival gear.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 the 160th ARG {{participated in}} Operation Ready Go, the first all United States Air National Guard (ANG) {{non-stop}} deployment of fighter aircraft to Europe.

25|$|The second {{prototype}} XG-20, following {{public display}} in early 1950 at Pope AFB during Exercise Swarmer, was taken {{aside for a}} more radical transformation, being fitted with two twin bomber <b>engine</b> <b>pods</b> containing J47 turbojets, and flying in early 1951 as the XC-123A, the United States' first jet-powered transport aircraft.|$|R
50|$|PTOL {{capability}} enables UAVs {{and aircraft}} {{to land and}} take off in very confined locations like rooftops, ship decks and forest clearings. This is comparable to VTOL, but it helps fixed-wing/simple UAVs achieve this, avoiding the complexity and cost of air-vehicle construction required for VTOL which include jet-thrust-rotation <b>engines,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>pods</b> or rotor tilting mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|The Gyro UP was {{introduced}} in October 1985. It differs from the Gyro X by replacing {{the front and rear}} tie-down racks with a single heavy-duty baggage platform fixed directly to the rear <b>engine</b> <b>pod,</b> giving the appearance of a scooter pick-up truck. This platform has a rubber-mat loading area of 450 mm × 570mm that is rated for 30 kg. Honda claims it is sized for a 20 bottle beer crate, a container that is roughly similar to the plastic milk crate common in other countries.|$|E
25|$|In June 1964, the Air Staff {{approved}} the modification of 28 B-52Fs under a project known as South Bay. They could carry 24 750-pound bombs externally. The bombs were carried on external pylons installed underneath each wing inboard {{of the inner}} <b>engine</b> <b>pods.</b> These pylons had originally been designed to carry the Hound Dog cruise missile.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Skymonster and CL-44 Guppy. The CL-44-O was a single CL-44D4-2 (c/n 16) {{converted}} by Conroy Aircraft, who removed the fuselage shell above the floorline, and rebuilt an enlarged fuselage {{to make it into}} a Guppy-type aircraft. It was intended to transport Rolls-Royce RB211 <b>engine</b> <b>pods</b> to the United States for Lockheed's L-1011 Tristar.|$|R
50|$|A <b>podded</b> <b>engine</b> is a jet <b>engine</b> in a <b>pod,</b> {{typically}} attached {{below the}} wing {{or to the}} tail of the aircraft. The pod itself is called a nacelle.|$|R
