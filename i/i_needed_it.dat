500|$|Senator David B. Hill of New York, a gold supporter, was next. As Hill {{moved to}} the podium, a {{reporter}} friend passed Bryan a note urging {{him to make a}} patriotic speech without hint of sectionalism; Bryan responded, [...] "You will not be disappointed." [...] Hill gave a calm speech defending the gold position, and swayed few delegates. He was followed by two other gold men, Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William E. Russell. Vilas gave a lengthy defense of the Cleveland administration's policies, so long that Russell, fearing that Vilas' speech would cut into his time, asked that the time given to the gold proponents be extended by ten minutes. Bryan consented, on condition that his own time was extended by the same amount; this was agreed to. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> for the speech I was to make." [...] Bryan later wrote, [...] "This was another unexpected bit of good fortune. I had never had such an opportunity before in my life and never expect to have again." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E

He said, [...] "You gave me a job when <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> the most. I never could have made it without you." [...] Lucy Lopez died on 31 May 1994 at the age of 80. The impact of the Mama Lucy Gang on state politics in the 1970s is still remembered.|$|E

2500|$|Brahms {{has been}} {{described}} as an agnostic and a humanist. The devout Catholic Antonín Dvořák wrote in a letter: [...] "Such a man, such a fine soul – and he believes in nothing! He believes in nothing!" [...] When asked by conductor Karl Reinthaler to add additional sectarian text to his German Requiem, Brahms is reported to have responded, [...] "As far as the text is concerned, I confess that I would gladly omit even the word German and instead use Human; also with my best knowledge and will I would dispense with passages like [...] On the other hand, I have chosen one thing or another because I am a musician, because <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it,</b> and because with my venerable authors I can't delete or dispute anything. But I had better stop before I say too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor had {{thoughts}} of retiring {{by the time}} he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music. [...] "I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while," [...] he recalled in 1995. [...] "I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what <b>I</b> <b>needed.</b> <b>It</b> helped get me back on track." [...] The song [...] "Only a Dream in Rio" [...] was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song [...] "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61. On the album track [...] "Only You," [...] the backing vocals were performed by an all star duo of Joni Mitchell and Don Henley.|$|E
