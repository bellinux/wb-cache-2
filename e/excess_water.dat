40|$|Gold {{tailings}} were {{deposited in}} thick lifts at full depth where tailings slurry was deposited {{to fill up}} the settling column in one lift within the shortest time possible (2 minutes) and thin lifts (660 mm to 580 mm) under simulated rates of rise of 20 m/yr and 10 m/yr in the laboratory using instrumented settling column apparatus. Rate of rise (RoR) was taken as the vertical increase in height of settled tailings over a given period of time expressed in metres per year. The deposited tailings segregated along the height of settling columns depicting a height profile ranging from fine grained to coarse grained particles from the top {{to the bottom of}} the settling columns. Tailings permeability values of the segregated tailings profiles increased with decreasing settling column height. Scanning electron microscope micrographs based fabric, particle size gradations, saturated vertical permeability and <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures correlated well with segregated tailings profiles. Low magnitude <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures in the range of 6 kPa maximum were recorded. Full depth deposition yielded the highest values of <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures followed by the <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures for 20 m/yr RoR at 50 % of the full depth deposition magnitudes, with the least <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures generated for the 10 m/yr RoR which were 30 % of the full depth deposition <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressure magnitudes. 90 % of the <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures dissipated during the sedimentation phase and coincided with the occurrence of the bulk of the tailings settlement. The remaining 10 % of <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures took a disproportionately longer period of time to dissipate and were resurgent with any disturbances.

5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} at the {{anterior}} end, and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> swallowed while feeding.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, the gaps between low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> from one will flow into the other. The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground conduits have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E

MMP pile is {{a method}} of foundation treatment, and driving pile brings the <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressure in the surrounding subgrade. By using a software ABAQUS to build a three-dimensional model, the process of MMP pile driven at a site of railway foundation in Shanghai is simulated using theory of Biot consolidation and modified Cam-clay model with three-dimension effect being considered. The changes in the excess pore pressure are obtained.

5|$|Fierce waves pushed {{large amounts}} of water to coastal areas in Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates, forcing roads to be closed and traffic diverted. Civil defence and police were on duty to manage the road closures, while {{municipal}} workers pumped the <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> off the roads. The road connecting Kalba and Fujairah was closed due to the road being submerged by water. The waves along the coastline were reported to be 10m (32ft) high, which destroyed about a dozen fishing boats. About 300boats were moved from the water or emptied of equipment, and overall damage to the port of Fujairah was reported as severe. A boat sank by the port, leaving its ten passengers missing.|$|E
5|$|Ships {{carrying}} ice {{needed to}} be particularly strong {{and there was a}} premium placed on recruiting good crews, able to move the cargo quickly to its location before it melted. By the end of the 19th century, the preferred choice was a wooden-hulled vessel, to avoid rust corrosion from the melting ice, while windmill pumps were installed to remove the <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> from the hull using bilge pumps. Ice cargoes tended to cause damage to ships in the longer term, as the constant melting of the ice and the resulting water and steam encouraged dry rot. Shipment sizes varied; depending on the ports and route. The typical late 19th century U.S. vessel was a schooner, carrying around 600 tons (500,000kg) of ice; a large shipment from Norway to England might include up to 900 tons (800,000kg).|$|E
5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared {{two weeks after the}} storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> or delivering it when needed.|$|E

5|$|The main {{job of the}} Drain is {{to gather}} the waters pumped from the Kesteven Fens, the Holland Fens and the Weir Dyke, a soak dike in Bourne North Fen, {{alongside}} the Bourne Eau and River Glen, northwards and eastwards to the Black Sluice at Boston, where they are discharged to the tidal waters of The Haven. The Weir Dyke {{takes its name from}} a weir in the bank of the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, which was constructed by the Black Sluice Commissioners, to allow water from the Bourne Eau to overflow the bank when <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood. The overfall weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The race began {{without a}} {{formation}} lap {{and despite the}} slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. After three laps under the safety car, conditions were unchanged; drivers reported on the circuit's condition via radio and the race was suspended. Light rain prevented the resumption of the Grand Prix for over forty-five minutes until the marshals and road sweeping trucks removed some of the <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> and dirt on the track. Resin on the newly laid track surface had prevented water from soaking into the ground. The rain had eased slightly during the suspension. Teams were allowed to change the set-up of their cars, which were largely optimised for dry weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Establishment of the C made Everglades National Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C for assistance, the C offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering {{the east side of}} the park and carrying <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|This study {{involves}} {{an evaluation of}} the impact of the heating rate on the volume change of compacted silt. A temperature-regulated oedometer refurbished as part of this study was used to measure thermally induced volume changes. It was found that the impact of heating rates on the thermally induced volume change in soils lies in the difference between the drained and undrained behavior of soils. When a soil is heated in undrained conditions, the particles and water will expand at the same rate as the rate of heating. In addition, the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the soil particles and the water during heating will result in the generation of <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures. If drainage is allowed to occur, these <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures will dissipate, leading to a time-dependent consolidation of the soil. The dissipation of thermally induced <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressure was found to depend on the rate of heating. If the rate of heating is slow, the <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures will be able to dissipate at a constant rate, leading to a corresponding decrease in volume. The rate of consolidation will be greater than the rate of thermal expansion of the soil particles and water. If a soil is heated quickly, the particles and water will expand much faster than the dissipation of <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressure. In this case, the thermally induced <b>excess</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures will be generated instantaneously and a consolidation process will occur afterward. In this case, the amount of thermal consolidation was found to be greater than the amount of thermal expansion, leading to a greater net volume change than in the case of slow heating...|$|R
5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} forages {{for food}} both {{during the day}} and at night. It feeds primarily on benthic bony fishes and invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted via suction; the <b>excess</b> <b>water</b> is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including salps and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn. The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these include the copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and the killer whale (Orcinus orca). When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its back like a scorpion. Smaller fishes have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting their own prey. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti, and the monogeneans Heterocotyle tokoloshei and Dendromonocotyle sp.|$|E
