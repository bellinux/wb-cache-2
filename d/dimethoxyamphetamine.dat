50|$|DMA, or <b>dimethoxyamphetamine,</b> is {{a series}} of lesser-known {{psychedelic}} drugs similar in structure to amphetamine and to trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA). They were first collectively characterized by Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved). Little is known about their dangers or toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that two}} other {{positional}} isomers of <b>dimethoxyamphetamine,</b> 2,6-DMA and 3,5-DMA, {{have also been}} made, but these drugs have not been tested in humans and their effects are unknown. However, {{it is likely that}} these compounds would also produce amphetamine-like stimulation or possibly hallucinogenic effects.|$|E
40|$|Abstmck Iodlnation of methoxyamphetnmincs with iodine/silver sulfate at room {{temperature}} gives iodometboxyamphetamines in good yield. Radioiodo-labelled amphetamines are widely used in brain imaging and therefore are of great value in medicinal chemistry. The synthesis of iodoamphetamine is difficult because iodine is the least reactive halogen in electrophilic aromatic substitution. 1 Also, because the amine group can interfere {{in a number of}} reactions uch as oxidative halogenation; protection of the amine group is usually required for the iodination procedure. Iodoamphetamines have been synthesized by the use of El, * chloramine T, 3 silver trifluoroacetate, 4 iododediaxotixation 5 and iododeboration. 6 It was reported that direct iodination of 25 dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamin by chloramine T was unsuccessful because the ring is not sufficiently activated. 3 a An attempt to iodinate the 25 <b>dimethoxyamphetamine</b> by ICI resulted in an oxidative attack on the amine group. ‚Äù A low yield was obtained by direct iodination of the N-acetyl derivative of 2, 5 <b>dimethoxyamphetamine</b> with iodine and silver trifluoroacetam 4 Recently, it was found in our laboratories that iodine / silver sulfate is an excellent iodination reagent. This reagent has been used for iodinating alkyl and alkoxybenzenes, 7 aromatic amines * and uridines. 9 The iodine I silver sulfate system has now been applied to the syntheses of iodomethoxyamphetamines.

40|$|The six regioisomeric <b>dimethoxyamphetamines</b> are {{prepared}} from the commercially available dimethoxybenzaldehydes. The <b>dimethoxyamphetamines</b> show very similar mass spectra, and chromatographic methods {{must be used}} to differentiate the positional isomers. Bromination of the six isomeric <b>dimethoxyamphetamines</b> yields a monobromination product as the major component in all cases except for 3, 5 -dimethoxyamphetamine, which yields the 2, 6 -dibrominated species as the major product. Mass spectrometric analysis readily divides the regioisomeric bromodimethoxyamphetamines into two groups of three compounds each. Only those isomers having a bromine substituent "ortho- " to the alkylamine side-chain show a major fragment at m/z 194 from loss of bromine from the molecular ion. The major drug of abuse 4 -bromo- 2, 5 -dimethoxyamphetamine (DOB) {{is one of three}} compounds that do not yield the m/z 194 ion. Though the mass spectra for the three "non-m/z 194 " isomers show some subtle differences, these compounds are best differentiated by a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic system...|$|R
40|$|The cyclic voltammetric {{characteristics}} of two nitroamphetamine derivatives (2 -nitro- 4, 5 <b>dimethoxyamphetamine</b> and 2 -nitro- 4, 5 -methylenedioxyamphetamine) {{have been investigated}} in different media. In mixed media (aqueous buffer and DMF, dioxane, or acetonitrile) a reversible oneelectron reduction takes place to form a stable nitro radical anion. At more negative potential values, a further three-electron reduction occurs irreversibly to give the hydroxylamine derivative. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been employed to study the tendency of the nitro radical anions to undergo further chemical reactions. The subsequent chemical reaction corresponds to a second-order process, a dismutation reaction electrochemically initiated. Data about rate constantS and half-life times in mixed media are reported.

40|$|The enantiomers of {{a series}} of methoxy- and alkyl-substituted phenylisopropylamines were {{prepared}} by low-pressure reduction of imines formed by reaction of the appropriate phenylacetones with either (+) - or (-) -a-methylbenzylamine, followed by hydrogenolysis of the hydrochlorides of the resulting N-(a-phenethy 1) phenylisopropylamines. Values of [a]D are reported and enantiomeric purities were-in the range 96 - 99 %. Overall yields ranged from 30 to 60 %. Glc or fluorine nmr analy-sis of enantiomeric purity was accomplished using a-methoxyir-trifluoromethylphenylacetamides. Glc analysis of the N-trifluoroacetyl-Si-prolylamides was used to confirm R- (-) and S<+) absolute configurations of all compounds. (+) - or (-) - 2, 5 <b>dimethoxyamphetamine</b> was brominated to give the (+) - or (-) - 4 -bromo compound. The enantiomers of 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydr 0 - 2 -naphthylamine could not be prepared by this method. Generally, optical isomers of a drug molecule possess differing degrees of biological activity. In the case of amphe-tamine, norepinephrine uptake into synaptosomes from nor-adrenergic regions of the brain is inhibited to a greater degree by the 9 (+) than by the R-(-) enant i~mer.
