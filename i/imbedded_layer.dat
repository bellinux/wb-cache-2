The {{scattered}} sunlight absorption efficacy by a {{solar cell}} with <b>imbedded</b> <b>layer</b> of spherical plasmonic nanoparticles is simulated versus {{the parameters of}} the imbedded particles, the material they are made of, their density and location in the polymeric buffer layer inclusive. It was shown that the embedded plasmonic nanoparticles cause an increase of the relative efficacy of an organic solar cell with the P 3 HT:PCBM photosensitive layer and the PEDOT buffer layer of up to 10 - 20 %. This increase depends also on the angle at which the sunlight shines the solar cell, which was also studied in detail...|$|E
40|$|An electrostatically {{actuated}} silicon membrane {{was designed}} and fabricated utilizing a siliconon- insulator wafer. The SOI wafer contains three layers- a 400 μm thick “handle” layer of silicon followed by a 2 μm thick oxide layer topped with a 20 μm thick “device” layer of silicon. The embedded oxide layer acts as an etch-stop during silicon etching, leaving a thin membrane of consistent thickness on the device side. The device dimensions were chosen to provide acceptable membrane deflection predicted by calculations and Finite Element Analysis. A microfabrication process plan was designed to produce thin membranes appropriate for electrostatic actuation. A 700 nm layer of silicon dioxide was grown {{on both sides of}} the SOI wafer to be used as a mask during silicon etching. The handle side of the SOI wafer was coated with positive photo resist and the wafer was patterned through lithography using a measured light integral of 4. Following lithography, the exposed silicon dioxide on the handle side was etched with a buffered oxide etch, leaving regions of exposed silicon on the handle. The entire wafer was then placed in tetramethylammonium hydroxide at 85 °C to etch through the 400 μm of exposed silicon on the handle. Previous experiments with TMAH gave an average etch rate of 35 μm/s for silicon. The TMAH etch was stopped by the <b>imbedded</b> <b>layer</b> of silicon dioxide, leaving the 22 μm thick silicon membranes. Finally, the remaining silicon dioxide was removed with another buffered oxide etch. The final etch depth was measured with a profilometer...|$|E
40|$|An {{international}} standard has emerged {{for the first}} true multimedia format. Digital Versatile Disk (by its official name), you may know it as Digital Video Disks. DVD has applications in movies, music, games, information CD-ROMS, and many other areas where massive amounts of digital information is needed. Did I say massive amounts of data? Would you believe over 17 gigabytes on {{a single piece of}} plastic the size of an audio-CD? That`s the promise, at least, by the group of nine electronics manufacturers who have agreed to the format specification, and who hope to make this goal a reality by 1998. In this major agreement, which didn`t come easily, the manufacturers will combine Sony and Phillip`s one side double-layer NMCD format with Toshiba and Matsushita`s double sided Super-Density disk. By Spring of this year, they plan to market the first 4. 7 gigabyte units. The question is: Will DVD take off? Some believe that read-only disks recorded with movies will be about as popular as video laser disks. They say that until the eraseable/writable DVD arrives, the consumer will most likely not buy it. Also, DVD has a good market for replacement of CD- Roms. Back in the early 80 `s, the international committee deciding the format of the audio compact disk decided its length would be 73 minutes. This, they declared, would allow Beethoven`s 9 th Symphony to be contained entirely on a single CD. Similarly, today it was agreed that playback length of a single sided, single layer DVD would be 133 minutes, long enough to hold 94 % of all feature-length movies. Further, audio can be in Dolby`s AC- 3 stereo or 5. 1 tracks of surround sound, better than CD-quality audio (16 -bits at 48 kHz). In addition, there are three to five language tracks, copy protection and parental ``locks`` for R rated movies. DVD will be backwards compatible with current CD-ROM and audio CD formats. Added versatility comes by way of multiple aspect rations: 4 : 3 pan-scan, 4 : 3 letterbox, and 16 : 9 widescreen. MPEG- 2 is the selected image compression format, with full ITU Rec. 601 video resolution (72 Ox 480). MPEG- 2 and AC- 3 are also part of the U. S. high definition Advance Television standard (ATV). DVD has an average video bit rate of 3. 5 Mbits/sec or 4. 69 Mbits/sec for image and sound. Unlike digital television transmission, which will use fixed length packets for audio and video, DVD will use variable length packets with a maximum throughput of more than 1 OMbits/sec. The higher bit rate allows for less compression of difficult to encode material. Even with all the compression, narrow-beam red light lasers are required to significantly increase the physical data density of a platter by decreasing the size of the pits. This allows 4. 7 gigabytes of data on a single sided, single layer DVD. The maximum 17 gigabyte capacity is achieved by employing two reflective layers {{on both sides of the}} disk. To read the <b>imbedded</b> <b>layer</b> of data, the laser`s focal length is altered so that the top layer pits are not picked up by the reader. It will be a couple of years before we have dual-layer, double-sided DVDS, and it will be achieved in four stages. The first format to appear will be the single sided, single layer disk (4. 7 gigabytes). That will allow Hollywood to begin releasing DVD movie titles. DVD-ROM will be the next phase, allowing 4. 7 gigabytes of CD-ROM-like content. The third stage will be write-once disks, and stage four will be rewritable disks. These last stages presents some issues which have yet to be resolved. For one, copyrighted materials may have some form of payment system, and there is the issue that erasable disks reflect less light than today`s DVDS. The problem here is that their data most likely will not be readable on earlier built players...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe principles of invariance form {{the foundation of}} the study of irradiance fields in the sea. By review of the existing theory, it is shown how these principles may be applied to <b>imbedded</b> <b>layers</b> to derive complete reflectance and transmittance factors for the containing layer. These complete factors in turn yield the desired irradiance fields. They are also used to develop local invariance principles and the associated local transmittance and reflectance factors. Differential equations for reflectance and transmittance are developed, based on these local factors, and in turn are used in numerical computations of the re- flectance and transmittance factors for arbitrarily deep layers of water. Boundary conditions on the upper and lower surfaces of the layer are chosen so that the complete reflectance and the complete transmittance factors generate the irradiances of the appropriate light field. Numerical computations are based on real data for eight natural media. To study the dependence of the light field on extreme cases of the optical properties, two hypothetical cases are also considered. [URL] (Junior Grade), United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the typical}} institution, social {{patterns}} {{are all but}} solidified: enter off the street, funnel through the grand multi-story lobby, take the elevator, and get to work. Everyone associates together in a single space, and everyone subsequently operates in isolation. By collapsing two-dimensional urbanism and the three-dimensional institution, the emerging articulated surface {{has the ability to}} tear down the boundary between architecture and city and integrate itself with the surroundings by leveraging the common space of interaction in the city—the street. The result is an interruption in the strict patterns of the city as street, side- walk, lot and building are disassembled, circulation is uncoupled, and the ground plane of the gridded city is reconstructed. Rather than constructing the institution around an all-encompassing connection between all of its publics in equal measure, this thesis sets out to tailor relationships between publics of the institution {{as well as with the}} segmented publics outside of it by leveraging a series of internal streets rather than a single, common one. In doing so, particular publics can be paired, specific spatial relationships can be constructed, and generative social relationships can be structured between publics. These streets will be tempered by their relationship to the ground plane and the exterior, the surrounding program, and types of connection. Relationships will not only be structured between urbanism and institution, but also within the <b>imbedded</b> <b>layers</b> of the institution, moving with and against the street. The institution that most easily encapsulates this condition is the Fashion Institute as it con- tains multiple user groups, or publics, that engage each other in multiple ways.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA primitive equation general circulation model with <b>imbedded</b> mixed <b>layer</b> physics {{has been used}} to investigate the response of the equatorial Pacific ocean to daily varying winds and westerly wind bursts. The major issue addressed by this study is the impact of daily varying winds, including westerly wind bursts, in the modeling of the tropical Pacific ocean and El Nino. In the developmental phase, the sensitivity of the model to the integration time step and the domain size were investigated. The results of this work were used to determine the optimal time step and model domain size for the main experimental model runs. In the experimental phase, the model was spun-up using time averaged wind stresses. The model ocean was then exposed to two years of realistic daily varying wind stresses covering the period of 1991 and 1992. The model developed an El Nino like response that corresponded in several respects with observed features of the 1991 - 92 El Nino.

40|$|The {{steady state}} and dynamic {{properties}} of semiconductor self-assembled island structures made from III-V materials are studied by photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence. The islands layer contains {{a number of}} hemispherical caps with a low-gap material inside the cap and a high-gap material outside. The experiments performed are aimed at probing {{the nature of the}} bound states inside the islands, looking specifically at the dimensionality of these islands through the mapping of the density of states. First, a system consisting of an Al 0. 45 In 0. 55 As <b>layer</b> <b>imbedded</b> in an Al 0. 35 Ga 0. 65 As matrix emitting in the visible (red) is used to directly probe the properties of "individual" islands and compare them with different systems: two-dimensional (quantum well), one-dimensional (quantum wire) and zero-dimensional (quantum dot). The observed temperature independent linewidth and lifetimes are attributed to quantum dot properties. Next, the strong emission obtained under resonant excitation conditions in this system is used to study the influence of phonons on the relaxation processes in zero-dimensional semiconductor heterostructure systems. The other material system studied consists of a single In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As self-assembled <b>layer</b> <b>imbedded</b> in GaAs emitting in the infra-red. A model based on a quantum well with in-plane parabolic confinement is developed and compared with experimental results. Magneto-photoluminescence measurements reveal the symmetry of the electronic shell structure which is found to be consistent with the model developed, thus confirming the zero-dimensional nature of the carrier confinement. The presence of excited states is then exploited by studying the inter-sublevel dynamics of carriers in quantum dots. Despite the discreteness of the density of states, fast inter-sublevel dynamics is observed and all experimental observations are found to be consistent with state-filling dynamics for which the inter-sublevel relaxation is impeded only when lower energy levels are filled...|$|R
40|$|A model {{based on}} the {{alternating}} structure of the <b>imbedded</b> conduction <b>layers</b> (the Cu-O 2 planes) with the charge-transfer-insulator (CTI) layers is proposed. There are three kinds of carriers, each with a different behavior: conduction-like holes in the Cu-O 2 layers and electrons and normal holes in the CTI matrix between the Cu-O 2 layers. This structure explains the strong anisotropies. The relationship is obtained between the concentration nq of conduction-like holes in the Cu-O 2 layers and the temperature T. The anomalous temperature behavior of the resistivity {{as well as the}} Hall constant also follows. We give the hole density in ab plane a definite physical meaning, and also define explicitly optimal doping, overdoping and underdoping. Our model gives the correct temperature dependence of the resistivity and the hole constant on optimal doping, overdoping and underdoping, and it predicts the temperature behavior of the cotangent of the Hall angle quite well. Based on this model, we can also understand that the HiTc materials become "Fermi Liquids" in the extremely overdoped region, and the dR/dT becomes negative below some temperature T< 1. 211 T 0 in the underdoped case. Based on this model, the thermal behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility in different doping can also be easily explained. The resistivity along c-axis is discussed.

40|$|Established {{disturbance}} theory {{aimed at}} understanding community structure maintains that externally imposed disturbances occur randomly over {{the landscape and}} interrupt competitive exclusion, thereby increasing community diversity. In contrast to this idea, our detailed landscape surveys show that disturbances happen most frequently in sub regions of the bed that support the greatest productivity and hence thickest cover of Mytilus californianus. Crowding reduces the attachment strength of mussels, making them more susceptible to dislodgment, and also lowers the reproductive condition of those <b>imbedded</b> individuals.

BAM is among the most frequent found pesticide residues in European groundwater. As pesticide analysis of drinking water is currently being done by laboratory analysis, an in-line sensor will therefore be beneficial for water quality monitoring. Cantilever-based assays for pesticide detection has been reported [1, 2], but few description of repeated measurements using cantilever-based detection systems are available. As a central principle of a possible cantilever-based competitive assay, we have tested the binding of a BAM antibody to a cantilever surface passive coated with a BAM ovalbumine conjugate. In a working assay, the BAM molecules in a water sample would compete with BAM attached to a cantilever surface for the binding to anti-BAM monoclonal antibodies, similar to a BAM ELISA described by Bruun et al [3]. The binding of anti-BAM antibodies {{to the surface of the}} cantilever will change the surface stress, causing bending of the cantilever. The bending is then detected by a change in resistance of the <b>imbedded</b> piezoelectric <b>layer</b> in the cantilever [4 – 6]. To investigate whether the system is suited as a transducer for a pesticide bio-assay, the variance of the cantilever bending signal during 10 antibody binding experiments was analyzed.

An upper mantle and crustal model for southern Puget Sound was determined from inferred reflections from interfaces above the source. The main features of the model include a distinct 15 -km-thick low-velocity zone with a 2. 5 -km/sec P-wave-velocity contrast lower boundary situated at approximately 56 -km depth. Ray calculations which allow for sources in dipping structure indicate that the inferred high contrast value can trade off significantly with interface dip provided the structure dips eastward. The effective crustal model is less than 15 km thick with a substantial sediment section near the surface. A stacking technique using the instantaneous amplitude of the analytic signal is developed for interpreting short-period teleseismic observations. The inferred reflection {{from the base of}} the low-velocity zone is recovered from short-period P and S waves.

The soils are saline {{because of the presence of}} shallow groundwater (45 - 138 cm) with salinity levels of > 24 dS m(- 1). Prevention of upward water movement from the saline groundwater could be an important factor in facilitating reclamation of the soil above the water table, as well as the long-term sustainability of any reclamation that is achieved. The possibility of placing a 20 -cm thick layer of gravel-sand at a depth of 80 cm to block upward water movement was evaluated in a three-year field experiment conducted during 2009 - 2011. Soil salinity and growth of landscape plant species were measured. Irrigation water was the local deep groundwater with electrical conductivity of 1. 7 - 2. 1 dS m(- 1) and SAR (sodium adsorption ratio) of 4. 3 mmol L- 1. Results indicated that the extent of desalinization (the ratio of salt content leached to the initial salt content) for the <b>imbedded</b> gravel-sand <b>layer</b> (GL) was larger than that for the non-gravel-sand layer treatment (NGL). Less salt accumulated in the surface soil during winter in GL compared to NGL. The mean electrical conductivity of saturated paste extracts (ECe) were < 5 dS m(- 1) in root distribution zones (0 - 40 cm) for NGL compared to 3 dS m(- 1) for GL; the corresponding pH of saturated paste extracts (pHe) were 8. 5 and 8. 7. The influences of time, treatment and time x treatment on soil ECe and pHe were significant. At the end of the treatment, the salinity levels in root zones for both treatments were suitable for the growth of plants that were moderately sensitive to salinity (3 - 4 dS m(- 1)). The results provide theoretical and technological guidance for salt leaching and landscaping of highly saline lands located along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
