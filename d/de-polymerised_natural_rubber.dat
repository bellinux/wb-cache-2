We examined whether repeated application of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex on mouse skin causes sensitization to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex and dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex produced a significant influx of mononuclear cells, CD 4 + CD 3 + cells, and eosinophils to the sensitized skin sites. The number of degranulated mast cells in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-sensitized skin sites was significantly higher compared with control sites treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The expression of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 4 mRNA was markedly increased in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-sensitized skin sites. Moreover, significant increases in the mRNA expression of chemokines CCL 2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1), CCL 11 (eotaxin- 1), CCL 3 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α), and CCL 4 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β) were found. In {{addition to}} the cutaneous inflammatory response, epicutaneous sensitization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex induced a striking increase in the total and specific immunoglobulin E levels {{but not in the}} immunoglobulin G 2 a levels. Intraperitoneal immunization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex induced a strong <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-specific immunoglobulin G 2 a response, but only a weak immunoglobulin E response. We also studied the role of two major <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex allergens, the highly hydrophilic prohevein and the hydrophobic rubber elongation factor. Cutaneous application of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex elicited a strong immunoglobulin E response against prohevein, but not against rubber elongation factor. On the contrary, intraperitoneal immunization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex elicited strong immunoglobulin G 2 a production to rubber elongation factor but not to prohevein. These results demonstrate that epicutaneous sensitization with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex induces T helper 2 -dominated dermal inflammation and strong immunoglobulin E response in this murine model of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex induced protein contact dermatitis.

High quality microscopic Raman spectra of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> are obtained and the depth profile of ozone and UV treated <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> surface is investigated. <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> {{is one of the}} most important industrial polymer materials, and used as tyres and various parts of automobiles and airplanes. <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is composed mainly from polyisoprene and vulcanized to make cross-links between <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> main chains. It is known that degradation features of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> are cleavage of C=C double bonds and changes of 3 D cross-link structure. The degradation mechanism is investigated by many spectroscopic methods, for example, FT-IR and NMR. By using Raman spectroscopy, some information about C=C double bonds, characteristic to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> can be obtained. However, because of the strong fluorescence, it was quite difficult to obtain Raman spectra of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> with visible light excitation. It can be possible to obtain Raman spectra of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> only when near infrared light is used as an excitation source. From that point of view, FT-Raman spectroscopy {{is applied to}} investigate a structural change of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> which does not provide microscopic information [1, 2, 3]. Since the near infrared Raman system used here is equipped with a microscope, the rubber degradation can be analysed with a spatial resolution of 1 µm.

These networks allow fabricated shape memory <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (SMNR) to deform and recover its shape at a temperature above the melting point of palmitic acid. Under controlled uniaxial stress, the <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> sample with 0 parts per hundred rubber (phr) carbon black loading exhibits fixity and recovery of 80  ±  10 %. Motivation of this research is primarily on practicability of palmitic acid {{to be used as a}} swelling agent for shape memory properties. Results show that palmitic acid is a relatively good swelling agent to induce shape memory properties into <b>natural</b> <b>rubber...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The thermal {{oxidation}} kinetics of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> containing hydrazine dihydrochloride or hydrazine sulfate used as tackifier were studied, and the effective storage time of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> containing tackifier was predicted with {{a method of}} heat accelerated storage aging. The {{results show that the}} {{thermal oxidation}} activation energy of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> containing hydrazine dihydrochloride is 105. 6 kJ / mol, being a little higher than that (104. 7 kJ / mol) of the control. The thermal oxidation activation energy of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> containing hydrazine sulfate is 103. 1 kJ / mol, being a little lower than that of the control. The effective storage time of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> containing hydrazine dihydrochloride is 13. 4 years at 30 ℃, 27. 0 years at 25 ℃, and 55. 9 years at 20 ℃. The effective storage time of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> containing hydrazine sulfate is 11. 6 years at 30 ℃, 23. 0 at 25 ℃, and 46. 8 years at 20 ℃. The effective storage times of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> containing two tackifiers hydrazine dihydrochloride or hydrazine sulfate are higher than that of the control at the same condition...|$|R
50|$|Ebonite is a {{brand name}} for very hard rubber first {{obtained}} by Charles Goodyear by vulcanizing <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> for prolonged periods. For vulcanizing <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> he received patent number 3633 from the United States Patent Office on June 15, 1844. Besides <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> Ebonite contains about 25-80% sulfur and linseed oil. Its name comes from its intended use as an artificial substitute for ebony wood.|$|R

5000|$|Tires with {{sidewalls}} made of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> {{are called}} [...] "gum wall". The tan colored, <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> lacks carbon black to decrease rolling resistance, as its added wear resistance isn't {{needed in the}} sidewall.|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet curable acrylated liquid <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> was {{prepared}} by grafting of photosensitive molecule onto liquid <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> for surface coating application. The liquid <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (LNR) was firstly obtained by degradation of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex with hydrogen peroxide and cobalt acetylacetonate at 65 oC for 72 hrs. The preparation of acrylated <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> {{was carried out}} by the reaction of acrylic acid and epoxidized liquid <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (ELNR) prior obtained from LNR with formic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the ratio of 2 : 1 by weight in toluene at 80 oC for 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 hrs. It was found that the percentage of acrylate grafted onto liquid <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> depended on the reaction time. Surface coating was performed by using acrylated liquid <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> and 1, 6 -hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) or tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) as a crosslinker and Irgarcure 184 or Irgarcure 651 as a photoinitiator under UV exposure for 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The hardness test of cured products was investigated using the Pencil hardness test at pencil level of 2 B to 6 H. It was found that the highest hardness of surface coating was at pencil level of 4 H for the product using TPGDA and Irgacure 651 in the ratio of 80 : 10 parts per hundred of rubber (phr). The cured products were able to resist to 2 % H 2 SO 4 and distilled water for more than 24 hrs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is {{a unique}} {{biopolymer}} of strategic importance that, in many of its most significant applications, cannot be replaced by synthetic alternatives. The rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis is the almost exclusive commercial source of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> currently and alternative crops should be developed for several reasons, including: a disease risk to the rubber tree that could potentially decimate current production, a predicted shortage of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> supply, increasing allergic reactions to rubber obtained from the Brazilian rubber tree and a general shift towards renewables. This review summarizes our knowledge of plants that can serve as alternative sources of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> of rubber biosynthesis and the scientific gaps that must be filled to bring the alternative crops into production...|$|R
50|$|Its {{resilience}} makes NBR {{a useful}} material for disposable lab, cleaning, and examination gloves. Nitrile rubber is more resistant than <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> to oils and acids, and has superior strength, but has inferior flexibility. Nitrile gloves are therefore more puncture-resistant than <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> gloves, {{especially if the}} latter are degraded by exposure to chemicals or ozone.
