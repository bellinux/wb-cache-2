The form provides the employer with a Social Security number. Also, on the form employees declare the number of withholding allowances they believe they are entitled to. Allowances are generally {{based on the number of}} personal exemptions plus an amount for itemized deductions, losses, or credits. Employers are entitled to rely on <b>employee</b> <b>declarations</b> on Form W-4 unless they know they are wrong.|$|R
