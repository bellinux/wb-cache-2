However, <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> of this and successive types were both expensive and unreliable, as well as fragile. <b>Seed</b> <b>drills</b> would not come into widespread use in Europe until the mid-19th century. Early drills were small enough to be pulled by a single horse, {{and many of these}} remained in use into the 1930s.

5000|$|A <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> is {{a device}} that sows the seeds for crops by {{metering}} out the individual seeds, positioning them in the soil, and covering them to a certain average depth. The <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> sows the <b>seeds</b> at equal distances and proper depth, ensuring that the seeds get covered with soil and are saved from being eaten by birds. Before {{the introduction of the}} <b>seed</b> <b>drill,</b> a common practice was to plant <b>seeds</b> by <b>hand.</b> Besides being wasteful, planting was usually imprecise and led to a poor distribution of seeds, leading to low productivity.

40|$|Abstract: At {{the present}} time, {{the most widely}} used machine for seed and oilseed {{planting}} is a <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> with a roller-type-metering device. Due to nonuniform spacing of seeds along the rows and lack of control on planting depth, this machine aggravates the growth related problems and degrades the quality of a sensitive crop such as oilseed rape. To solve the above-mentioned problems, an attempt was made to develop a precision <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> with a roller-type-metering device and a depth control system. Some of the design parameters affecting the uniformity of seed distribution were studied from the view point of roller and brush geometry. Computer software packages were used to design the machine and simulate its operational performance. In the laboratory test, {{it was found that the}} precision <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> performed satisfactorily and its speed and vibration did not affect the performance of metering system significantly. In the field test, a uniform distribution of seed with a reasonable spacing along the row planting was achieved and seed scattering was found to be within an acceptable range.

40|$|A special {{application}} area of {{the sensor}} system presented here, is the detection of grain in <b>seed</b> <b>drills.</b> With the highly precise measurement of the seed, the crop yield can be strongly improved.

Because of the touching piezoelectric measuring principle, the mounting contact mode of the sensor is either in the distributor head or {{in each of the}} seed hoses of the <b>seed</b> <b>drill.</b> Up to 15 thousand grains must be counted per second. For the detection of these high grain frequencies, a novel design of the sensor element was developed.

40|$|Smallholders in Asia and Africa require {{low-cost}} <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> for minimal soil disturbance while establishing various crops. A <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> {{that can}} be drawn by the widely-available two-wheel tractor (2 WT) is an attractive option for mechanization of no-till in small-sized fields. The Versatile Strip <b>Seed</b> <b>Drill</b> (VSSD) was designed with the capacity to make up to 40 mm wide and 60 mm deep strips in untilled land along with seed and basal fertilizer application in a single-pass operation, while powered by the 8. 95 to 11. 93 kW 2 WT. An important innovation of the VSSD was to fit the seed box with both fluted roller-type seed meters for delivery of sufficient small-size seeds to achieve adequate plant density per unit row length; and vertical disk-type seed meters for precision and spaced row planting of larger seeds. Both incessant seed dropping by fluted roller seed meters and spaced planting by vertical disk type seed meters provided optimum plant populations that were generally higher than in conventional, full-tillage plots with the same rate of <b>hand</b> broadcasted <b>seed</b> and fertilizers. Time required for crop establishment by VSSD ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 18 ha·h− 1. When the VSSD {{was attached to the}} 2 WT for crop establishment, the diesel fuel consumption varied from 4. 4 to 6. 1 L·ha− 1, which was lower than for most 2 WT-based planters previously used in Bangladesh. In on-farm multi-locations trials, wheat crops established with the VSSD had statistically similar grain yield compared to conventional tillage; however, significantly higher grain yield was obtained from mustard and lentil, by 14 % and 19 %, respectively. The VSSD is a unique, minimum-soil-disturbance multi-crop planter, and can be a platform on which to build conservation agriculture systems for small farms in Asia and Africa...|$|R
