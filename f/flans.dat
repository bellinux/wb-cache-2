In some cases, emergency money {{have been issued}} under unfavourable conditions, such as a city under siege. Such , while the city was besieged by the troops of the Ottoman Empire. Due to the conditions at the time, such coins are frequently minted on square <b>flans,</b> rather than round ones (it was easier and quicker to produce a square flan than a round one). European square coins of this era are known by their German name 'klippe'. Coins might also be issued with the specific purpose of financing a military campaign, or for the payment of tribute or war indemnity by a feudal lord to his sovereign.|$|E

[...] The Mirabelle plum is a specific cultivar used to make Tarte aux mirabelles (plum tart). A Galette aux fruits {{is a type of}} galette made with yeast dough and covered with previously cooked fruit in season, such as plums (or quinces, apples, apricots). The fruit in these open tarts or <b>flans</b> is cut into suitably sized pieces and the cake is glazed: red glaze is recommended for red plum and rhubarb <b>flans,</b> [...] whereas apricot glaze is recommended in yellow plum and apricot <b>flans.</b>|$|E

2500|$|During the Crisis of the Third Century, {{constant}} wars {{required a}} lot of coins to be produced, leading to heavy debasing of precious metal coinage. The antoninianus was eventually debased {{to the point where}} <b>flans</b> (blank metal disks) were produced with 5% silver or less, and pickled to dissolve the copper from the surface producing a spongy surface of almost pure silver. When these coins struck, the force of striking would produce a thin shiny layer of silver on the surface, which would quickly wear away. These [...] "silvered" [...] coins are not considered fourrées, since they are not actually plated since the metal is actually a continuous layer and these coins were not created to deceive.|$|E
2500|$|During Jackson's first {{stint as}} Lucky, the character's {{relationship}} with Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) {{was called a}} supercouple, compared to Lucky's parents Luke and Laura. The characters first became popular during the storyline of Elizabeth's rape in 1998, a storyline that received critical acclaim. Viewers wrote to the series praising the story and how it helped rape victims to heal. The storyline won General Hospital a SHINE Award (Sexual Health IN Entertainment) in 1998. Fans also responded to Jackson's performance; Robyn <b>Flans</b> of Soap Opera Magazine stated in 1998: [...] "Jonathan's sensitive portrayal {{of a young man}} experiencing the awakening of his own male stirrings while horrified by this hideous act of violence has been magnificent, and you have an amazing character – one that Jackson manipulates to perfection." [...] Lucky and Elizabeth's romantic relationship took place gradually as result of the rape, and viewers liked the slow pacing that made the relationship honest and innocent, something unique among soap opera couples at the time. Each character dealing with personal issues, the couple's first kiss happened months into the relationship, and was anticipated and celebrated by fans. The series used the popular teen characters as an opportunity to reach young viewers with a social message through Lucky and Elizabeth's decision to abstain from sex. Executive producer at the time Wendy Riche explained her desire to show the decisions and pressures teenagers face, stating to Soap Opera Weekly: [...] "We have the opportunity with these beloved characters who have struggled together and who have loved together and who are exploring sexuality together to reach an audience that doesn't really want to be preached to, but wants to feel it." [...] Herbst and Jackson's popularity continued after Jackson's April 1999 departure; that July they were voted number one actor, actress and couple by fans of Soaps In Depth.|$|E

6000|$|Old {{official}} gentlemen, {{military for}} most part; Grumkow, Derschau, Old Dessauer (when at hand), Seckendorf, old General <b>Flans</b> (rugged Platt-Deutsch specimen, capable of TOCADILLE or backgammon, capable of rough slashes of sarcasm when {{he opens his}} old beard for speech): these, and the like of these, intimate confidants of the King, men who could speak a little, or who could be socially silent otherwise,--seem {{to have been the}} staple of the Institution. Strangers of mark, who happened to be passing, were occasional guests; Ginckel the Dutch Ambassador, though foreign like Seckendorf, was well seen there; garrulous Pollnitz, who has wandered over all the world, had a standing invitation.

60|$|Poor Friedrich Wilhelm is {{in truth}} very ill; tosses about all day, {{in and out}} of bed,--bed and wheeled-chair drearily alternating; suffers much;--and again, in Diplomatic circles, the rumors are rife and sinister. Ever from this chill at Schulenburg's the {{medicines}} did him no good, says Pollnitz: if he rallied, it was the effect of Nature, and only temporary. He does daily, with punctuality, his Official business; perhaps the best two hours he has of the four-and-twenty, for the time hangs heavy on him. His old Generals sit round his bed, talking, smoking, as it was five years ago; his Feekin and his Children much about him, out and in: the heavy-laden, weary hours roll round as they can. In general {{there is a kind of}} constant Tabaks-Collegium, old <b>Flans,</b> Camas, Hacke, Pollnitz, Derschau, and the rest by turns always there; the royal Patient cannot be left alone, without faces he likes: other Generals, estimable in their way, have a physiognomy displeasing to the sick man; and will smart for it if they enter,--"At sight of HIM every pain grows painfuler!"--the poor King being of poetic temperament, as we often say. Friends are encouraged to smoke, especially to keep up a stream of talk; if at any time he fall into a doze and they cease talking, the silence will awaken him.|$|E

50|$|The Modern English word <b>flan</b> {{comes from}} French <b>flan,</b> from Old French flaon, in turn from Medieval Latin fladonem, {{derived from the}} Old High German flado, a sort of flat cake, {{probably}} from an Indo-European root for 'flat' or 'broad'.

50|$|The {{preparation}} of the <b>flan</b> or planchet has varied over the years.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the cis-acting sequences required for transcription of the divergent, cell cycle-regulated <b>flaN</b> and flbG operons of Caulobacter crescentus. Previous work showed that transcription of flbG in vivo {{depends on a}} sigma 54 promoter and a sequence element called ftr 1 that is located about 100 bp upstream from the transcription start site (D. A. Mullin and A. Newton, J. Bacteriol. 171 : 3218 - 3227, 1989). We now show that regulation of <b>flaN</b> transcription in vivo depends on a sigma 54 promoter and two ftr elements located downstream of the transcription start site at + 86 (ftr 2) and + 120 (ftr 3). Mutations in or between the conserved elements at - 24 and - 12 in this sigma 54 promoter reduced or abolished <b>flaN</b> transcription, and one mutation that eliminated <b>flaN</b> expression led to an increased level of flbG transcript. Mutations in ftr 2 resulted in greatly reduced levels of <b>flaN</b> transcript but had no noticeable effect on flbG transcript levels. All three mutations constructed in ftr 3 resulted in elevated <b>flaN</b> and flbG transcript levels. We conclude that ftr 2 is required for positive regulation of <b>flaN,</b> whereas ftr 3 appears to play a negative regulatory role in <b>flaN</b> and flbG expression. To explain the coordinated positive activation and negative autoregulation of these two transcription units {{and the effect of}} mutations on gene expression, we propose a model in which the <b>flaN</b> and flbG promoters interact through alternative DNA looping to form structures that are transcriptionally active or inactive...|$|R
