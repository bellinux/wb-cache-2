The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa Stour are a Special Area of Conservation. The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred.|$|E
5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky <b>eyebright</b> (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
5|$|A {{tree nursery}} was {{established}} at Kinloch in 1960 {{in order to}} support a substantial programme of re-introducing twenty native species including silver birch, hawthorn, rowan and holly. The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall á Ghoirtein. The island's flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book A Rum Affair by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book told of a long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on Rùm by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison—discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is widely believed to have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his theory about the geological development of the Hebridean islands. Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and <b>eyebright,</b> as well as more common species such as sundew, butterwort, blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 higher plant and fern taxa have been recorded.|$|E

50|$|Vegetation {{changes with}} altitude, aspect, cold air {{drainage}} and soil saturation. Low elevations with dry aspects carry red stringybark, white gum, broad-leaved peppermint, candlebark and brittle gum. Moist sites have alpine ash, mountain gum, narrow-leaved peppermint, manna gum and brown barrel, with tree ferns, blackwood and sassafras in gullies. Between 1000 - 1500 m alpine ash and mountain gum dominate and abruptly change to sub-alpine snow gum woodlands, heath, grasslands and bogs between 1500 - 1800 m. Common species include snow grasses, leafy bossiaea, yellow kunzea, alpine pepper and sphagnum bogs, with candle heath and swamp heath. Alpine herbfield and rare feldmark communities are found above {{the tree line}} at 1800 m. Common species include prickly snow grass, alpine wallaby grass, silver snow daisy, ribbony grass, white purslane, <b>eyebrights,</b> gentians and buttercups. Most alpine species have a limited range.|$|R
25|$|In 1876 William Brown, a {{professor}} of agriculture and then superintendent of the experimental farm at Guelph, Ontario, was granted permission {{by the government of}} Ontario to purchase Aberdeen Angus cattle for the Ontario Agricultural College. The herd comprised a yearling bull, Gladiolus, and a cow, <b>Eyebright,</b> bred by the Earl of Fife and a cow, Leochel Lass 4th, bred by R.O. Farquharson. On January 12, 1877, <b>Eyebright</b> gave birth to a calf, sired by Sir Wilfrid. It was the first to be born outside of Scotland. The OAC went on to import additional bulls and cows, eventually began selling Aberdeen Angus cattle in 1881.|$|E

60|$|Cheasing <b>Eyebright</b> had {{of course}} a Vicar. There are vicars and vicars, and of all sorts I love an innovating vicar--a piebald {{progressive}} professional reactionary--the least. But the Vicar of Cheasing <b>Eyebright</b> {{was one of the}} least innovating of vicars, a most worthy, plump, ripe, and conservative-minded little man. It is becoming to go back a little in our story to tell of him. He matched his village, and one may figure them best together as they used to be, on the sunset evening when Mrs. Skinner--you will remember her flight!--brought the Food with her all unsuspected into these rustic serenities.|$|E
6000|$|He {{made little}} boats out of whole newspapers, an art he learnt by {{watching}} the Spender boy, and he set them sailing down the stream--great paper cocked-hats. When they vanished under the bridge which marks the boundary of the strictly private grounds about <b>Eyebright</b> House, he would give a great shout and run round and across Tormat's new field--Lord! how Tormat's pigs did scamper, to be sure, and turn their good fat into lean muscle!--and so to meet his boats by the ford. Right across the nearer lawns these paper boats of his used to go, {{right in front of}} <b>Eyebright</b> House, right under Lady Wondershoot's eyes! Disorganising folded newspapers! A pretty thing! ...|$|E
60|$|And far away, {{miles and}} miles away, a steeple and a hanger grew insensibly out of the vague blue to mark more and more {{distinctly}} the quiet corner where Cheasing <b>Eyebright</b> sheltered from the tumult of the world, recking little or nothing of the Herakleophorbia concealed in that white bundle that struggled so persistently towards its orderly retirement.|$|E

60|$|She {{went out}} by the front door, going that way not {{because she wanted to}} go to Hickleybrow (her goal was Cheasing <b>Eyebright,</b> where her married {{daughter}} resided), but because the back door was impassable on account of the canary creeper that had been growing so furiously ever since she upset the can of food near its roots. She listened for a space and closed the front door very carefully behind her.|$|E
60|$|They buried him in {{the churchyard}} of Cheasing <b>Eyebright,</b> near to the largest yew, and the modest {{tombstone}} bearing his epitaph--it ended with: Ut in Principio, nunc est et semper--was almost immediately hidden from the eye of man by a spread of giant, grey tasselled grass too stout for scythe or sheep, that came sweeping like a fog over the village out of the germinating moisture of the valley meadows in which the Food of the Gods had been working.|$|E
60|$|And {{while these}} eight adventurers fought with rats about the Experimental Farm, nine miles away, {{in the village}} of Cheasing <b>Eyebright,</b> an old lady with an {{excessive}} nose struggled with great difficulties by the light of a flickering candle. She gripped a sardine tin opener in one gnarled hand, and in the other she held a tin of Herakleophorbia, which she had resolved to open or die. She struggled indefatigably, grunting at each fresh effort, while through the flimsy partition the voice of the Caddles infant wailed.|$|E
60|$|By-and-by {{she joined}} Ethel, and Norman {{was summoned to}} help them to trace out the old lines of encampment, ditch, rampart, and gates--happy work on those slopes of fresh turf, {{embroidered}} with every minute blossom of the moor--thyme, birdsfoot, <b>eyebright,</b> and dwarf purple thistle, buzzed and hummed over by busy, black-tailed, yellow-banded dumbledores, the breezy wind blowing softly in their faces, and the expanse of country--wooded hill, verdant pasture, amber harvest-field, winding river, smoke-canopied town, and brown moor, melting grayly away to the mountain heads.|$|E
60|$|But even so secluded a {{place as}} Cheasing <b>Eyebright</b> could not rest for long {{in the theory of}} Hypertrophy--Contagious or not--in view of the growing hubbub about the Food. In a little while there were painful {{explanations}} for Mrs. Skinner--explanations that reduced her to speechless mumblings of her remaining tooth--explanations that probed her and ransacked her and exposed her--until at last she was driven to take refuge from a universal convergence of blame in the dignity of inconsolable widowhood. She turned her eye--which she constrained to be watery--upon the angry Lady of the Manor, and wiped suds from her hands.|$|E
60|$|To tell fully of its coming {{would be}} to write a great history, but {{everywhere}} there was a parallel chain of happenings. To tell therefore of the manner of its coming in one place is to tell something of the whole. It chanced one stray seed of Immensity fell into the pretty, petty village of Cheasing <b>Eyebright</b> in Kent, and from the story of its queer germination there and of the tragic futility that ensued, one may attempt--following one thread, as it were--to show {{the direction in which}} the whole great interwoven fabric of the thing rolled off the loom of Time.|$|E
60|$|Many weeks after, {{amidst the}} charred {{ruins of the}} Experimental Farm, there was found {{something}} {{which may or may}} not have been a human shoulder-blade and in another part of the ruins a long bone greatly gnawed and equally doubtful. Near the stile going up towards <b>Eyebright</b> there was found a glass eye, and many people discovered thereupon that Skinner owed much of his personal charm to such a possession. It stared out upon the world with that same inevitable effect of detachment, that same severe melancholy that had been the redemption of his else worldly countenance.|$|E
60|$|Then this dirty {{old woman}} did {{what seems to}} me a quite heroic deed of mercy. She left her bundle and {{umbrella}} {{in the middle of the}} brick path and went to the well and drew no fewer than three pailfuls of water for the chickens' empty trough, and then while they were all crowding about that, she undid the door of the run very softly. After which she became extremely active, resumed her package, got over the hedge at the bottom of the garden, crossed the rank meadows (in order to avoid the wasps' nest) and toiled up the winding path towards Cheasing <b>Eyebright.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{a couple}} of score of miles {{there was nothing else}} to {{foreshadow}} in any way the strange bigness of the wheat and of the weeds that were hidden from him not a dozen miles from his route just over the hills in the Cheasing <b>Eyebright</b> valley. And then presently the traces of the Food would begin. The first striking thing was the great new viaduct at Tonbridge, where the swamp of the choked Medway (due to a giant variety of Chara) began in those days. Then again the little country, and then, as the petty multitudinous immensity of London spread out under its haze, the traces of man's fight to keep out greatness became abundant and incessant.|$|E
6000|$|In the genera Geranium, Polygonum, Veronica, {{and several}} others there is a {{gradation}} of forms from large and bright to small and obscure coloured flowers, and in every case the former are adapted for insect fertilisation, often exclusively, while in the latter self-fertilisation constantly occurs. In the yellow rattle (Rhinanthus Crista-galli) there are two forms (which have been named major and minor), the larger and more conspicuous adapted to insect fertilisation only, the smaller capable of self-fertilisation; and two similar forms exist in the <b>eyebright</b> (Euphrasia officinalis). In both these cases there are special modifications in the length and curvature of the style {{as well as in}} the size and shape of the corolla; and the two forms are evidently becoming each adapted to special conditions, since in some districts the one, in other districts the other is most abundant.[159] ...|$|E
6000|$|His queer voice, {{the voice}} that had been so bad for school {{discipline}} at Cheasing <b>Eyebright,</b> smote the multitude to silence while it sounded and splashed them all to tumult at the end. Some wit was audible screaming [...] "Speech, speech!" [...] "What's he saying?" [...] was the burthen of the public mind, and an opinion was abroad that he was drunk. [...] "Hi, hi, hi," [...] bawled the omnibus-drivers, threading a dangerous way. A drunken American sailor wandered about tearfully inquiring, [...] "What's he want anyhow?" [...] A leathery-faced rag-dealer upon a little pony-drawn cart soared up over the tumult {{by virtue of his}} voice. [...] "Garn 'ome, you Brasted Giant!" [...] he brawled, [...] "Garn 'Ome!

6000|$|It {{was a day}} or {{so after}} this conversation--{{a day or so}}, that is, after the burning of the Experimental Farm--that Winkles came to Redwood and showed him an {{insulting}} letter.

[...] "You are only taking credit for a natural phenomenon," [...] said the letter, [...] "and trying to advertise yourself by your letter to the Times. You and your Boomfood!

6000|$|... 3. None {{of which}} {{particulars}} concern any reasonable mortal, {{looking at a}} Foxglove, in the smallest degree. Whether hairs which he can't see are glandular or bristly,--whether the green knobs, which are left when the purple bells are gone, are divided into two lobes or two hundred,--and whether the style is split, like a snake's tongue, into two lobes, or like a rogue's, into any number--are merely matters of vulgar curiosity, which he needs a microscope to discover, and will lose a {{day of his life}} in discovering. But if any pretty young Proserpina, escaped from the Plutonic durance of London, and carried by the tubular process, which replaces Charon's boat, over the Lune at Lancaster, cares to come and walk on the Coniston hills in a summer morning, when the <b>eyebright</b> is out on the high fields, she may gather, {{with a little help from}} Brantwood garden, a bouquet of the entire Foxglove tribe in flower, as it is at present defined, and may see what they are like, altogether.|$|E
60|$|The {{room had}} been his study for four-and-twenty years. It had been {{furnished}} at his marriage, and all the essential equipment dated from then, the large complex writing-desk, the rotating chair, the easy chair at the fire, the rotating bookcase, the fixture of indexed pigeon-holes that filled the further recess. The vivid Turkey carpet, the later Victorian rugs and curtains had mellowed now to a rich dignity of effect, and copper and brass shone warm about the open fire. Electric lights had replaced the lamp of former days; that was the chief alteration in the original equipment. But among these things his connection with the Food had left abundant traces. Along one wall, above the dado, ran a crowded array of black-framed photographs and photogravures, showing his son and Cossar's sons and others of the Boom-children at various ages and amidst various surroundings. Even young Caddles' vacant visage had its place in that collection. In the corner stood a sheaf of the tassels of gigantic meadow grass from Cheasing <b>Eyebright,</b> and on the desk there lay three empty poppy heads as big as hats. The curtain rods were grass stems. And the tremendous skull of the great hog of Oakham hung, a portentous ivory overmantel, with a Chinese jar in either eye socket, snout down above the fire....|$|E
6000|$|In pure yellow flowers, as in pure white, human {{interest}} is wanting. It {{is true that}} yellow is a human colour, since in the hair we find yellows of different shades--it is a pity that we cannot find, or have not found, a better word than [...] "shades" [...] for the specific differences of a colour. There is the so-called tow, the tawny, the bronze, the simple yellow, and the golden, which includes many varieties, and the hair called carroty. But none of these has the flower yellow. Richard Jefferies tells us that when he placed a sovereign {{by the side of}} a dandelion he saw how unlike the two colours were--that, in fact, no two colours could seem more unlike than the yellow of gold and the yellow of the flower. It is not necessary to set a lock of hair and any yellow flower side by side to know how utterly different the hues are. The yellow of the hair is like that of metals, of clay, of stone, and of various earthy substances, and like the fur of some mammals, and like xanthophyll in leaf and stalk, and the yellow sometimes seen in clouds. When Ossian, in his famous address to the sun, speaks of his yellow hair floating on the eastern clouds, we instantly feel the truth as well as beauty of the simile. We admire the yellow flower for the purity and brilliance of its colour, just as we admire some bird notes solely for the purity and brightness of the sound, however unlike the human voice they may be. We also admire it in many instances for the exquisite beauty of its form, and the beauty of the contrast of pure yellow and deep green, as in the yellow flag, mimulus, and numerous other plants. But however much we may admire, we do not experience that intimate and tender feeling which the blues and reds inspire in us; in other words, the yellow flower has not the expression which distinguishes those of other colours. Thus, when Tennyson speaks of the [...] "speedwell's darling blue," [...] we know that he is right--that he expresses a feeling about this flower common to all of us; but no poet would make so great, so absurd a mistake as to describe the purest and loveliest yellow of the most prized and familiar wild flower--buttercup or kingcup, yellow flag, sea poppy, marsh marigold, or broom, or furze, or rock-rose, let us say--by such a word--the word that denotes an intimate and affectionate feeling--the feeling one cherishes for the loved ones of our kind. Nor could that word of Tennyson be properly used of any pure white flower--the stitchwort for instance; nor of any white and yellow flower like the Marguerite. But no sooner do you get a touch of rose or crimson in the whitest flower, as we see in the daisy and <b>eyebright,</b> than you can say of it that it is a [...] "dear" [...] or a [...] "darling" [...] colour, and no one can find fault with the expression.|$|E
