40|$|Operations were {{performed}} at four different levels {{on the fifth}} nerve of the monkey to determine which procedure offers {{the best chance of}} avoiding ocular complications after surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (Figure 18). (1) Section of the ophthalmic branch of N V results in immediate corneal anesthesia. After one week, chromatolysis of the unipolar <b>gasserian</b> <b>ganglion</b> cells subserving the first division occurs and Wallerian degeneration of the corneal nerves of the ipsilateral eye is seen. This is associated with perilimbal round cell invasion of the superficial cornea and subconjunctival area. In addition, iritis develops de novo or becomes worse if it pre-exists. Miosis occurs, but the chemodiagnostic tests of cocaine and adrenalin indicate an intact sympathetic system. The cause for this inflammatory reaction and pupillary change is unexplained by this study. The intraocular pressure is slightly lower {{on the side of the}} section than in the normal fellow control eye after surgery, but the difference is not statistically significant. (2) Section of the posterior sensory root of N V in the middle cranial fossa at a point between the gasserian glanglion and the tentorium results in similar ocular changes as is seen after interrupting the ophthalmic division alone. Wallerian degeneration of the corneal nerves, however, is not seen after seven, twelve or twenty-one days. (3) Transtentorial section of the trigeminal posterior sensory root performed in the middle cranial fossa, results in immediate corneal anesthesia. The <b>gasserian</b> <b>ganglion</b> cells, however, remain healthy and there is no perilimbal round cell invasion of the superficial cornea or subconjunctival tissue. Miosis occurs but the chemodiagnostic tests of cocaine and adrenalin indicate an intact sympathetic system.

(4) Suboccipital rhizotomy of the posterior sensory root of NV at the pons results in immediate corneal anesthesia. The <b>gasserian</b> <b>ganglion</b> cells remain healthy and there is no perilimbal round cell invasion of the superficial cornea or subconjunctival tissue. Miosis occurs in most animals (2 of 3) and is associated with an intact sympathetic system as indicated by the chemodiagnostic tests of cocaine and adrenalin. Intraocular pressure is very slightly lower on the side of section than in the control eye, but the difference is not statistically significant. (5) Thinning of the corneal epithelium occurs in an anesthetic eye regardless of the location of the section of N V and is not adversely affected by tarsorrhaphy.

The posterior hypothalamic area may act as the trigger of Cluster Headache attacks, as it is found to be activated in brain image studies specifically in this trigemino-autonomic cephalalgias but not in other primary headaches, such as migraine. Deep brain stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic area is an effective experimental treatment in intractable Cluster Headache patients. Cluster Headache attacks are characterized by a striking clockwise regularity, excruciating unilateral trigeminal pain and concomitant ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. We aimed to develop an animal model to document the effect of PH electric stimulation on the systemic and cranial autonomic system and on the peripheral cranial pain system (the trigeminal ganglion) and to evaluate the effect of nitroglycerin in this model. Using stereotaxic co-ordinates we accessed the PH area and the <b>gasserian</b> <b>ganglion</b> in male adult Wistar rats. The PH was stimulated and activity was obtained in the <b>gasserian</b> <b>ganglion</b> at baseline and after glyceryl trinitrate. Pupil size and tearing were monitored. Firing frequency and post-trigger histograms were analysed and paired-samples T test was used to compare means before and after interventions. Mean differences in firing rates of ganglion cells between experimental conditions were significant when comparing PH stimulation with baseline (t 2. 353, p 0. 040), PH stimulation after nitroglycerin administration with baseline (t 2. 517, p 0. 030) and PH stimulation after nitroglycerin with isolated PH stimulation (t 3. 017, p 0. 013).

We found an evident and consistent effect of increased trigeminal ganglion neuronal firing after electric stimulation of the PH of the rat that was potentiated by nitroglycerine without activation of the trigeminal-parasympathetic system.

When conservative treatment fails and microdecompression is not indicated, percutaneous procedures are helpful.

Although simple and safe, this puncture demands some expertise from neurosurgeons. for that, a partnership between neurosurgeons and bio-engineers has developed a model for foramen ovale puncture, allowing practice for residents and young neurosurgeons.
