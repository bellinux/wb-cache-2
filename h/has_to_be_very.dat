25|$|Kapton tape {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used tapes and methods for TC and TC {{conductor}} attachment. When several layers are applied, each layer has an additive effect on the insulation and may negatively impact a profile. A disadvantage of this tape is that the PCB <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> clean and smooth to achieve an airtight cover over the thermocouple weld and conductors. Another disadvantage to Kapton tape is that at temperatures above 200°C the tape becomes elastic and, hence, the TCs have a tendency to lift off the substrate surface. The result is erroneous readings characterized by jagged lines in the profile.|$|E

2500|$|Britain did {{not possess}} in 1944 the {{resources}} to rebuild shattered divisions and it was imperative for Montgomery to protect {{the viability of the}} British army so that Britain could still play an important part in the final victory. It was reported to the War Office that [...] "Montgomery <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> careful of what he does on his eastern flank because on that flank is the only British Army there is left {{in this part of the}} world".

2500|$|... "Direct blowing" [...] {{assumes the}} coal and the {{oxidizer}} being supplied towards {{each other from}} the {{opposite sides of the}} reactor channel. In this case the oxidizer passes through coke and (more likely) ashes to the reaction zone where it interacts with coal. The hot gas produced then passes fresh fuel and heats it while absorbing some products of thermal destruction of the fuel, such as tars and phenols. Thus, the gas requires significant refining before being used in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Products of the refinement are highly toxic and require special facilities for their utilization. As a result, the plant utilizing the described technologies <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> large to be economically efficient. One of such plants called SASOL is situated in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). It was built due to embargo applied to the country preventing it from importing oil and natural gas.

2500|$|A bowler reaches his {{delivery}} stride {{by means}} of a [...] "run-up" [...] and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being [...] "in play". Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no {{more than a couple of}} steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over [...] and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making use of the seam of the ball so that it [...] "swings" [...] (or [...] "curves") in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be [...] "caught behind" [...] by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder. At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often [...] "buy his wicket" [...] by [...] "tossing one up" [...] (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> wary of such deliveries as they are often [...] "flighted" [...] or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be [...] "trapped" [...] into getting himself out. In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.|$|E

60|$|It <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> grim, all that, to {{be truly}} effective; and here, already, we have a touch in the Americanized Christmas story of the moralistic quality of the American Thanksgiving story.

I rather think that it deals more probably with character to this end than its English cousin, the Christmas story, does. It is not so improbable that a man should leave off being a drunkard on Thanksgiving, as that he should leave off being a curmudgeon on Christmas; that he should conquer his appetite as that he should instantly change his nature, by good resolutions. He would be very likely, indeed, to break his resolutions in either case, but not so likely in the one as in the other.|$|E

6000|$|I was {{sufficiently}} interested {{to continue to}} read such literature as came in my way. I was amazed to find what a number of great men--men whose names were to the fore in science--thoroughly believed that spirit was independent of matter and could survive it. When I regarded Spiritualism as a vulgar delusion of the uneducated, I could afford to look down upon it; {{but when it was}} endorsed by men like Crookes, whom I knew to be the most rising British chemist, by Wallace, who was the rival of Darwin, and by Flammarion, the best known of astronomers, I could not afford to dismiss it. It was all very well to throw down the books of these men which contained their mature conclusions and careful investigations, and to say [...] "Well, he has one weak spot in his brain," [...] but a man <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> self-satisfied if the day does not come when he wonders if the weak spot is not in his own brain. For some time I was sustained in my scepticism by the consideration that many famous men, such as Darwin himself, Huxley, Tyndall and Herbert Spencer, derided this new branch of knowledge; but when I learned that their derision had reached such a point that they would not even examine it, and that Spencer had declared in so many words that he had decided against it on a priori grounds, while Huxley had said that it did not interest him, I was bound to admit that, however great, they were in science, their action in this respect was most unscientific and dogmatic, while the action of those who studied the phenomena and tried to find out the laws that governed them, was following the true path which has given us all human advance and knowledge. So far I had got in my reasoning, so my sceptical position was not so solid as before.|$|E
60|$|His nurses, governesses, {{simultaneous}} and successive, {{mostly of}} French breed, are duly set {{down in the}} Prussian Books, and held in mind {{as a point of}} duty by Prussian men; but, in foreign parts, cannot be considered otherwise than as a group, and merely with generic features. He had a Frau von Kamecke for Head Governess,--the lady whom Wilhelmina, in her famed Memoires, always writes KAMKEN; and of whom, except the floating gossip found in that Book, there is nothing to be remembered. Under her, as practical superintendent, SOUS-GOUVERNANTE and quasi-mother, was the Dame de Roucoulles, a more important person for us here. Dame de Roucoulles, once de Montbail, the same respectable Edict-of-Nantes French lady who, five-and-twenty years ago, had taken similar charge of Friedrich Wilhelm; a fact that speaks well for the character of her performance in that office. She had done her first edition of a Prussian Prince in a satisfactory manner; and not without difficult accidents and singularities, as we have heard: the like of which were spared her in this her second edition (so we may call it); a second and, in all manner of ways, an improved one. The young Fritz swallowed no shoe-buckles; did not leap out of window, hanging on by the hands; nor achieve anything of turbulent, or otherwise memorable, in his infantine history; the course of which was in general smooth, and runs, happily for it, below the ken of rumor. The Boy, it is said, and is easily credible, was of extraordinary vivacity; quick in apprehending all things, and gracefully relating himself to them. One of the prettiest, vividest little boys; with eyes, with mind and ways, of uncommon brilliancy;--only he takes less to soldiering than the paternal heart could wish; and appears to find other things in the world fully as notable as loud drums, and stiff men drawn up in rows.

When {{a family of}} three persons has to live upon an income of three hundred a year, and, nevertheless, makes some pretence of going into society, it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> mindful of small details, even though that family may consist only of ladies. Of this Mrs Dale was well aware, and as it pleased her that her daughters should be nice and fresh, and pretty in their attire, many a long hour was given up to that care. The squire would send them shawls in winter, and had given them riding habits, and had sent them down brown silk dresses from London,--so limited in {{quantity}} that the due manufacture of two dresses out of the material had been found to be beyond the art of woman, and the brown silk garments had been a difficulty from that day to this--the squire having a good memory in such matters, and being anxious to see the fruits of his liberality. All this was doubtless of assistance, but had the squire given the amount which he so expended in money to his nieces, the benefit would have been greater. As it was, the girls were always nice and fresh and pretty, they themselves not being idle in that matter; but their tire-woman in chief was their mother. And now she went up to their room and got out their muslin frocks, and--but, perhaps, I should not tell such tales!-- She, however, felt no shame in her work, as she sent for a hot iron, and with her own hands smoothed out the creases, and gave the proper set to the crimp flounces, and fixed a new ribbon where it was wanted, and saw that all was as it should be. Men think but little how much of this kind is endured that their eyes may be pleased, even though it be but for an hour.|$|E
