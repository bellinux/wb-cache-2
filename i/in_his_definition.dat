He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers actively engaged in combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>definition</b> of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies were more like one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing the Chinese in Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed {{a large number of}} Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E

A 2003 effort (Meikle and Fleuriot) to formalize the Grundlagen with a computer, though, found that some of Hilbert's proofs appear to rely on diagrams and geometric intuition, and as such revealed some potential ambiguities and omissions <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>definitions.</b>|$|R
500|$|According to MacKenzie, {{authors in}} the revisionist {{tradition}} range from [...] "extreme admirers [...] {{the fringes of}} the far-right", such as Richard Landwehr and Jean Mabire, to partisan authors (Gordon Williamson and Edmund L. Blandford), and popular historians who generally present the Waffen-SS in a positive light. These include John Keegan, [...] James S. Lucas and Bruce Quarrie. The historian Henning Pieper notes non-scholarly works by Christopher Ailsby, , and Tim Ripley as part of [...] "militaria literature" [...] genre (<b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>definition),</b> while the military historian Robert Citino includes books by Willi Fey and Michael Reynolds among uncritical works aimed at [...] "military history buffs".|$|E
500|$|Some {{areas of}} Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Staffordshire have Northern {{characteristics}} and include satellites of Northern cities. Towns in the High Peak borough of Derbyshire {{are included in}} the Greater Manchester Built-Up Area, due to their close proximity to the city of Manchester, and before this the borough was considered {{to be part of the}} Greater Manchester Statutory City Region. More recently, the Chesterfield, North East Derbyshire, Bolsover, and Derbyshire Dales districts have joined with districts of South Yorkshire to form the Sheffield City Region, along with the Bassetlaw district of Nottinghamshire, although for all other purposes these districts still remain in their respective East Midlands counties. The geographer Danny Dorling includes most of the West Midlands and part of the East Midlands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>definition</b> of the North, claiming that [...] "ideas of a midlands region add more confusion than light". Conversely, more restrictive definitions also exist, typically based on the extent of the historical Northumbria, which exclude Cheshire and Lincolnshire. Though at its height, Northumbria did include the Kingdom of Lindsey, which corresponds to modern day Northern Lincolnshire.|$|E
500|$|An obvious {{distinction}} can be {{made between}} imitations meant to stand as independent works within the elegiac genre, not all of which followed Gray’s wording closely, and those with a humorous or satirical purpose. The latter filled the columns in newspapers and comic magazines {{for the next century}} and a half. In 1884 some eighty of them were quoted in full or in part in Walter Hamilton’s Parodies of the works of English and American authors (London 1884), more than those of any other work and further evidence of the poem’s abiding influence. One example uncollected there was the ingenious double parody of J. C. Squire,“If Gray had had to write his Elegy in the Cemetery of Spoon River instead of in that of Stoke Poges”. This was an example of how later parodies shifted their critical aim, in this case “explicitly calling attention to the formal and thematic ties which connected the 18th century work with its 20th century derivation” in Edgar Lee Masters’ work. Ambrose Bierce used parody of the poem for the same critical purpose <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>definition</b> of “Elegy” in The Devil's Dictionary, ending with the dismissive lines ...|$|E

500|$|Two {{stories with}} {{explicit}} pornographic content survive as samples of Creangă's erotic authorship: [...] "The Tale of Ionică the Fool" [...] and [...] "The Tale of All Tales" [...] (also known as Povestea pulei, [...] "Tale of the Dick" [...] or [...] "Tale of the Cock"). The former shows its cunning hero having intercourse with a priest's daughter, moving between prose and verse {{to describe the}} act. [...] "The Tale of All Tales", which makes ample use of vulgar speech, recounts how a peasant disrespectful of divinity has his entire maize harvest transformed into male genitalia, but is able to turn out a profit by catering to the sexual appetites of women. The final section, seen by Gârbea as a sample of anticlerical jeers recorded by [...] "the defrocked Creangă", depicts the rape of a priest by one such sexual object. Although explicit, literary historian Alex. Ștefănescu argued, the text [...] "is refined and full of charm". While acknowledging both [...] "corrosives" [...] for their [...] "popular charm" [...] {{in the line of}} Rabelais and Geoffrey Chaucer, and noting that they still display the author's place as a [...] "great stylist", Voinescu also signaled the texts' [...] "very obvious" [...] debt to folkloric sources. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>definition,</b> Ion Creangă is [...] "possibly the only writer" [...] to draw on the legacy of [...] "luscious popular jests" [...] found in local [...] "erotic folklore". Nevertheless, according to literary critic Mircea Iorgulescu, [...] "The Tale of All Tales" [...] may in fact be based on Parapilla, a pornographic leaflet circulating in Italian and French.|$|E

This paper's purpose is to delineate the Aristotelian persuasive model in one of recorded history’s greatest debates: the trials of Apostle Paul.

2500|$|Much debate {{surrounds}} {{the issue of}} Urmuz's connection to an absurdist streak in earlier Romanian literature and folklore.

He noted that Urmuz was one of [...] "the great grimacing sensitive" [...] Wallachians, a [...] "Balkan" [...] succession which also includes Hristache the Baker, Anton Pann, Ion Minulescu, Mateiu Caragiale, Ion Barbu and Arghezi. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>definition,</b> the source of Arghezi and Urmuz is in the folkloric tradition of self-parody, where the doina songs degenerate into spells or [...] "grotesque whines".

2500|$|The {{writer was}} already noted {{for being a}} man of refined tastes and for being {{interested}} by universal culture. Both Creţu and Cernat define him as [...] "a dandy of communism". The [...] "dandy" [...] trait had also been noted by Eugen Simion. Simion, who recorded his impression of Baconsky, spoke of his [...] "romantic beauty", [...] "sartorial elegance", and a form of [...] "melancholy" [...] which, he argued, recalled that displayed by 19th century author Gérard de Nerval.

2500|$|However, as {{the voice}} of elitism, Carp criticized {{collective}} and natural rights, and argued that careers in politics should only be opened to those who already had a major source of income ("starting at 40,000 lei").

Carp believed that: [...] "Since [...] the Pharaohs of Egypt, the demagogues have been inciting the passions of the plebs and preaching democracy and the redistribution of wealth. For millenniums now, the crowd and the rabble keep on working, and the elite keeps on governing". <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>definition,</b> the office holders needed to remain at all times separate from the passionate crowd.

He followed up with humorous, satirical prose volumes: Bacalaureatul lui Puiu ("Puiu's Baccalaureate", 1933), Dragoste cu termen redus ("Short-term Love", 1934); together with Al. С. Calotescu-Neicu, he published Antologia epigramei românești ("An Anthology of Romanian Epigrams", 1933).
