The plant had large costs freighting their products across the sound on the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry.

Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft plan for a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans.

The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75million alone for police, fire and medical services.

Nearly all of the strong German formations that had caused significant damage to the Canadian 1st Army throughout the Normandy campaign had been destroyed.
