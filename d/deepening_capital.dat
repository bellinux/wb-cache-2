40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{differences in}} legal origin, judicial efficiency, and investor protection affect firm leverage and earnings volatility across developing countries. Using {{a large number}} of developing countries, four main findings are highlighted. First, firms in civil legal origin countries rely more on debt financing compared to firms in common law countries, and they exhibit lower earnings volatility. Second, under weak judicial enforcement, firms tend to borrow more but they take less risk. Third, stronger creditor rights increase debt financing and reduce earnings volatility. Fourth, firm listing on a developed stock exchange shifts the capital structure towards more equity financing, and it increases the firm’s ability to borrow more when the judicial system is inefficient. The results reinforce the importance of strengthening laws and institutions as well as <b>deepening</b> <b>capital</b> markets in developing countries to improve financing conditions and investment outcomes...|$|E

50|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>deepening</b> is a {{situation}} where the capital per worker is increasing in the economy. This is also referred to as increase in the <b>capital</b> intensity. <b>Capital</b> <b>deepening</b> is often measured by the rate of change in capital stock per labour hour. Overall, the economy will expand, and productivity per worker will increase. However, according to some economic models, such as the Solow model, economic expansion will not continue indefinitely through <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> alone. This is partly due to diminishing returns and wear & tear (depreciation).

We exploit variation across German federal states in the period 1993 to 2013. State governments decide on hospital capacity planning (number of hospitals, departments and beds), ownership, medical students, and hospital investment funding. We show that TFP growth in German hospital care reflects quality improvements rather than increases in output volumes. Second-stage regression results indicate that reducing the length of stay is generally a proper way to foster TFP growth. The effects of other hospital policies depend on the reimbursement scheme: under activity-based (DRG) hospital funding, scope-related policies (privatization, specialization) come with TFP growth. Under fixed daily rate funding, scale matters to TFP (hospital size, occupancy rates). Differences in capitalization in East and West Germany allows to show that <b>deepening</b> <b>capital</b> may enhance TFP growth if capital is scarce.

40|$|The {{sources of}} "total factor {{productivity}} (TFP) growth" or the "Solow residual" typically remain unknown as a residual. This paper aims {{to identify the}} underlying sources of this residual growth, being explicit about micro underpinnings and transitional growth from occupation choices of heterogeneous agents and financial deepening in use of both macro and micro data. We develop a method of growth accounting that decomposes not only the overall growth but also the residual TFP growth into four components: occupational shifts, financial <b>deepening,</b> <b>capital</b> heterogeneity, and sectoral Solow residuals. Applying this method to Thailand, which experienced rapid growth with enormous structural changes for the two decades between 1976 and 1996, we find that 55 percent of TFP growth can be explained on average by occupational shifts and financial deepening, without presuming exogenous technical progress. Expansion of credit is {{a major part of}} this explained TFP growth. Decomposition of the simulation helps us to infer that for the remainder TFP growth, capital-heterogeneity effect is behind during the initial period (1976 - 1980) while sectoral Solow residuals, due to the surge of wage after 1986, is behind during the latter decade (1986 - 1996) TFP, Capital Heterogeneity, Occupation Choice, Financial Deepening...|$|E

40|$|Australia has {{historically}} been Canada's poorer cousin. But a pick-up in productivity growth in the 1990 s has raised Australian living standards to Canadian levels. In this article, Dean Parham of the Australian Productivity Commission {{provides an overview of}} Australian economic performance and the policy reforms that turned around Australia's laggard productivity growth. He first points out that {{during the first half of}} the 20 th century Australia enjoyed one of the highest levels of labour productivity in the world. But Australia never experienced productivity convergence in the postwar period up to the 1990 and saw its productivity and GDP per capita ranking decline over this period. Productivity growth then picked up in the 1990 s, with output per hour advancing 2. 3 per cent per year in 1990 - 2001 compared to 1. 5 per cent in 1973 - 1990. It was increased multifactor productivity growth, not capital deepening, that drove this acceleration. Parham makes the case that policy reforms explain much of Australia's improved productivity performance. He identifies three broad areas of policy reform as particularly important in fostering productivity growth: sharper competition; greater openness to trade, investment and technology; and greater flexibility for businesses to adjust production and distribution processes. These reforms spurred the Australian economy to to embark upon a much delayed productivity catch-up.

40|$|Chinese banks {{generate}} large {{profits and}} have relatively low nonperforming loans. However, good financial performance does not, in itself, guarantee that banks efficiently intermediate the economy''s financial resources. This paper first examines how efficient Chinese banks are in financial intermediation, using the stochastic production frontier approach. Quality of loans are controlled for {{by focusing on}} net loans and correcting for nonperforming loans; Hong Kong SAR banks {{are included in the}} sample to have a more universally representative production frontier. The results suggest that Chinese banks indeed became more efficient during 2001 - 07. Nevertheless, a majority of banks remain quite inefficient, including several large state owned banks and many city banks. Large banks tend to hoard deposits and operate beyond the point of diminishing returns to scale, while smaller banks operate at increasing returns to scale. This suggests that reallocating deposits from large to smaller banks would increase overall efficiency. The paper finds no significant correlation between bank efficiency and profitability. Possible factors leading to large profits in the banking system, despite wide-spread inefficiencies, are low deposit interest rates, large interest margins, and high market concentration. Moving to indirect monetary policy and <b>deepening</b> <b>capital</b> markets to channel some of the savings to productive investment would help improve the efficiency of financial intermediation.

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the effects}} on banking competition {{of the changes in}} banking delivery and information collection technologies and of the rivalry from outside the traditional banking sector. Key implications for monetary, regulatory and competition policies are also addressed. Evidence is provided that liberalization increased banking competition in Europe. In a mostly deregulated environment, technology is argued to be of major importance for competition. The study argues against the prevalent spatial modelling of banking competition due to the difficulty of representing remote access and nonbank activity. Instead, a novel two-stage model (delivery capacity, then loan and deposit pricing decisions) is developed based on multidimensional differentiation theory. According to the results, benefits that clients derive from branch or ATM proximity, additional outlets, or superior service quality can maintain pricing power for banks. Technological development reduces these benefits and generates a permanent increase in competition. The optimal sizes of branch and ATM networks decline. Network cooperation reduces network sizes, but is not necessarily harmful, as price competition is stimulated. An empirical implementation of the model is presented for the Finnish loan and deposit markets. Banks’ pricing power is found to be entirely due to their branch network differentiation and size in the loan markets, and to exist mainly in household lending. In contrast, price coordination was found to likely characterize deposit pricing. The ability to distinguish differentiation from collusion is a new contribution. Banks’ pricing advantages were found to be diminishing in all lending and especially deposit-taking activities, following the technological development, which indicates reduced significance of branches for clients. Technological development, growing nonbank activity, <b>deepening</b> <b>capital</b> markets and weakening price coordination are found to enhance the efficiency of monetary policy transmission into lending (and deposit) rates. The results are relevant for the common euro area monetary policy, since they show the dependence of the transmission on particular structural and competitive conditions of the banking system. Finally, deregulation of deposit interest rates insulates loan rates from changes in deposit rates and, contrary to what is often argued, does not make loans more costly. banking competition; technological change; delivery networks; monetary policy efficiency; competition policy...|$|E
40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{study the}} {{efficiency}} properties of competitive search equilibria in economies with informational asymmetries. Employers and workers are both risk-neutral and ex-ante homogeneous. I characterize an equilibrium where employers post contracts and workers direct their search towards them. When a match is formed, the disutility of labor is drawn randomly and observed privately by the worker. An employment contract is an incentive-compatible mechanism that satisfies a participation constraint on the worker's side. I first {{show that in}} a static setting the competitive search equilibrium is constrained efficient, that is, it cannot be Pareto improved by a Social Planner {{subject to the same}} informational and participation constraints faced by the decentralized economy. I then show that in a dynamic setting, on the contrary, the equilibrium can be constrained inefficient. The crucial difference between the static and the dynamic environment is that the worker's outside option is exogenously given in the former, while in the latter it is endogenously determined as the equilibrium continuation utility of unemployed workers. Inefficiency arises because the worker's outside option affects the ex-ante cost of information revelation, generating a novel externality which is not internalized by competitive search. (cont.) In Chapter 2, I explore whether match-specific heterogeneity, with or without full information, can amplify the responsiveness of unemployment rate and market tightness to productivity shocks. On the contrary, I show that heterogeneity can dampen the response of market tightness to productivity, once one calibrates the model to match two main facts: the finding rate and the finding rate elasticity to market tightness. First, I show a theoretical result for the steady state analysis in the extreme case of no aggegate shock. Then, I report the calibration exercise for alternative specification of the idiosyncratic shocks distribution. Chapter 3 is the product of joint work with Daron Acemoglu and constructs a model of non-balanced economic growth.

In this class of models, non-balanced growth is shown to be consistent with an asymptotic equilibrium with constant interest rate and capital share in national income. We investigate whether for realistic parameter values, the model generates transitional dynamics that are consistent with both the more rapid growth of some sectors in the economy and aggregate balanced growth facts. Finally, we construct and analyze a model of "non-balanced endogenous growth," which extends the main results of the paper to an economy with endogenous and directed technical change.

40|$|Our aim is {{to address}} the problem of {{measuring}} how much of the convergence that we observe is due to convergence in technology versus convergence in capital-labour ratios, in the absence of data on the level of technology. To this aim, we first develop a growth model where technology accumulation in lagging economies depends on their propensity to innovate and on technological spillovers, and convergence is due both to <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> and to catch-up. We study the transitional dynamics of the model to show how to discriminate empirically among the following three hypotheses - (i) convergence due to <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> with technology levels uniform across economies, as in Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992); (ii) convergence due to <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> with stationary differences in individual technologies, as in Islam (1995); (iii) convergence due to both catch-up and <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> (non-stationary differences in individual technologies. We show that, in the absence of TFP data, hypotheses (ii) and (iii) may be difficult to distinguish in cross-section or panel data. We suggest that discrimination can be nevertheless obtained by exploiting the fact that if heterogeneity is the source of catch-up, technology growth is not uniform across countries and the initial differences in technology levels may tend to decrease over time. Given this implication, one way to discriminate between (ii) and (iii) would be to test whether estimates of fixed-effects in sub-periods show the pattern implied by either hypothesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Main {{point in}} the current European policy debate is to find {{instruments}} that stimulate {{the growth rate of}} labour productivity. The reason for this is a persistent slowdown in labour productivity growth in European countries and an increasing gap in growth rates between the USA and Europe starting {{in the second half of}} the 1990 ’s. Labour productivity in the US is nowadays at a much steeper growth path than in Europe. What is the reason for this increasing gap between Europe and the USA? This is an important question in order to assess the measures proposed in the Lisbon Agreement by the European Union (EU) to become the world’s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in 2010. With increasing globalisation and deregulation of international markets, productivity growth is the tool to enhance competitiveness. Therefore instruments are sought that will get the productivity growth rate in European countries back on track. One of the main explanatory factors for productivity growth is the production, use and diffusion of information and communication technology (ICT). Inklaar et al. (2003) show, however, that the main source for the European slowdown in productivity growth is not so much lagging IT use, but a deceleration of non-ICT <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> (i. e. lagging increase of non-ICT capital per hour worked) and, in contrast to the US, a lack of acceleration of TFP growth. TFP growth is the part of productivity growth that cannot be attributed to an increase in the capital stock per hour worked, where capital is usually subdivided in ICT capital and non-ICT capital. Daveri (2004), who applies a more rigorous definition of ICT using and ICT producing industries, by and large corroborates these results. The deceleration of non-ICT <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> of the nineties in Europe has coincided with a sharp rise in employment. Non-ICT <b>capital</b> <b>deepening,</b> or the growth of non-IT capital per hour worked, is clearly related to the growth rates of the price of both inputs. Faster wage growth increases non-ICT <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> because <b>capital</b> will substitute labour. An increase in the ‘price’ of non-ICT-capital, on the other hand, makes capital more expensive and leads to deceleration of non-ICT <b>capital</b> <b>deepening.</b> Inklaar et al. (2003), however, show that the impact of growth rates of wage and rental prices on non-ICT <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> is much stronger for the US than Europe. The small effect of wage growth in European countries implies that wage moderation might be an important reason for the slowdown of non-ICT <b>capital</b> <b>deepening.</b> Labour productivity growth in The Netherlands is at a persistently lower growth path than the European average. Since The Netherlands has been champion in wage moderation in the past decades, a natural question is whether this has led to an even slower non-ICT <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> than Europe or that other mechanisms have instead caused the Dutch slowdown of productivity growth. This issue will be addressed at a low spatial level: what is the reason for the Dutch slowdown, are there regions that have contributed more to the lagging productivity growth rate than others and which industries are responsible. This question will be answered using the growth accounting approach, which is also used to explain the widening of the productivity growth gap between Europe and the USA. Distinction can be made at the provincial level of The Netherlands between growth rates of value added in constant prices, number of hours worked, ICT and non-ICT capital services for eight aggregate industries. There is therefore sufficient detail to determine which industry in which province contributes positively or negatively to the lagging Dutch growth performance of the late 1990 ’s. This issue is useful from both an academic and a policy perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>deepening</b> {{may affect}} the {{evolution}} of the wage differential between skilled and unskilled workers differently in countries with different labor market institutions. If labor market institutions raise the relative wage of unskilled workers in Germany, firms have incentives to invest relatively more into capital equipment complementary to unskilled workers. Instead in the US, where wage-compressing institutions are weaker, firms invest more in high-skilled workers. We provide evidence consistent with this view based on an industry panel for West Germany and the US between the 1970 s and 1990 s. We show that capital equipment per worker is less positively associated with the wage differential in West Germany than in the US. This descriptive evidence is robust to many alternative measures for capital and skills. Our estimates imply that <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> in Germany in the 1980 s is associated with a reduction in the wage differential of about 10 - 20 % in most industries. In the US instead, <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> is associated with an increase of the wage differential between 5 and 15 % in most industries...|$|R
40|$|Employment {{protection}} {{may affect}} both productivity and capital investment because higher adjustments costs hamper allocative efficiency and may therefore affect both the optimal capital-labor input mix and total factor productivity. To estimate {{the impact of}} dismissal costs on <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> and productivity we exploit a reform that introduced unjust-dismissal costs in Italy for firms below 15 employees, leaving firing costs unchanged for bigger firms. We provide evidence {{that the increase in}} firing costs induced <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> and a decline in total factor productivity in small firms relative to larger firms after the reform. We also find that <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> is more pronounced at the low-end of the capital distribution – where the reform arguably hit harder – and among firms endowed with a larger amount of liquid resources, that have more room to react thanks to an easier access to the credit market. Our results also indicate that the EPL reform reduced the probability to access the credit market, possbily because stricter EPL reduces both the value of the firm and the amount of internal resources that the firm can pledge as collatera...|$|R
40|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to its fabulous postwar growth, the Japanese economy stagnated {{for a long time}} before World War II: perwar Japanese real GNP per worker remained about 40 % of that of the leader country, the U. S., at least since 1885, with no <b>capital</b> <b>deepening.</b> This paper identifies as the main cause of the prewar stagnation a barrier that forced the number of persons employed in agriculture to be constant at about 14 million throughout the prewar period. Our two-sector growth model shows that the barrier-induced sectoral misallocation of labor accounts well for a virtual lack of <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> and the depressed output level. Were it not for the barrier, the model predicts that Japan’s prewar GNP per worker would have been about 50 % to 60 % of the U. S. level, roughly where prewar Western Europe was. This higher output level comes about because an efficient use of labor otherwise locked up in agriculture raises the economy’s overall production efficiency and sparks a rapid <b>capital</b> <b>deepening.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) {{essentially}} halved the {{tax rate}} on dividends and reduced the top tax rate on capital gains. This paper explores the likely effect of JGTRRA on the composition of returns on corporations' common stock. Both larger corporations' past behavior and theory suggest that the recent tax cuts {{are not likely to}} increase dividend payouts significantly. Instead, in the short run, dividends will continue to rise in the customary way in response to the recovery in earnings. In the longer run, the tax cuts will principally reduce companies' cost of <b>capital,</b> fostering <b>capital</b> <b>deepening,</b> when the economy is at full employment. With constant returns to scale prevailing at full employment, <b>capital</b> <b>deepening</b> reduces corporations' average gross return on assets and equity. Because the tax cuts increase the value of each dollar of earnings for shareholders, they could raise price-earnings ratios by more than 10 percent and stock prices by more than 6 percent. By fostering <b>capital</b> <b>deepening,</b> the tax cuts also tend to increase the real compensation of labor at full employment...|$|R
