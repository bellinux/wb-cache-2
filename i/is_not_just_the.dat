Rose is opposed to the idea that through reading and hearing about Indian culture anyone can simply claim to be a spokesperson for the Native American experience.|$|E
25|$|Peirce {{agreed with}} Auguste Comte in {{regarding}} mathematics as more basic than philosophy {{and the special}} sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science about drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Civil celebrants {{also serve}} {{people who have}} {{religious}} beliefs but {{do not wish to}} be married in a church, temple or mosque. In contrast to the established ceremonies of religious or registry office authorities, in celebrant ceremonies many decisions about the content are chosen by the couple. Therefore, the civil celebrant has come to be defined as a professionally trained ceremony-provider who works in accordance with the wishes of the client couple. The task may be like an architect who is charged with designing a dream home for a couple who need expert help. In this sense the celebrant <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> one who performs the ceremony according to law, but its facilitator, the couple's adviser, the resource person, the co-creator of the ceremony, and the rehearsal-director.|$|E

25|$|The {{interests}} objection {{claims that}} what makes murder wrong <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation {{of a future}} that one has an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest {{in his or her}} future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can have an interest in one's future without taking an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does in fact desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.|$|E

There is little mention of the war in Eliot's writing except in a few pieces, like [...] "Defence of the Islands". The war became central to Little Gidding as Eliot added in aspects of his own experience while serving as a watchman at the Faber building during the London blitz. The Four Quartets were favoured as giving hope during the war and also for a later religious revival movement. By Little Gidding, WWII <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> present time but connected also to the English Civil War.|$|E

On 26 August, Croatia organised the Freedom Traina railroad tour taking Tuđman and the bulk of Croatia's government officials, public personalities, journalists and the diplomatic corps in Croatia from Zagreb to Karlovac, Gospić, Knin and Split. Tuđman gave a speech at each of the stops. In Knin, he declared: [...] " [...] didn't even have time to collect their dirty [...] and their dirty underwear. On this day, we can say that Croatia stopped bearing its historical cross. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> liberation of land, but the creation of a foundation for a free and independent Croatia for centuries to come."

500|$|Ideologically, Varg Vikernes's one-man project Burzum helped {{inspire the}} Viking metal scene through his {{strongly}} held racist, nationalistic, and anti-Judeo-Christian beliefs, and his {{longing for a}} return to paganism. In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, [...] "His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'." [...] They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes [...] "cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with [...] "an eye on Mein Kampf". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, [...] "proving both that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator".|$|E

500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> {{women in}} his life that Lex has a {{difficult}} time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel {{as a form of}} tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over. For Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will {{no longer be able to}} come back from. In [...] "Vortex", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was—evil. As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the [...] "monster" [...] that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma—he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not—and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions—using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.|$|E
500|$|The Lone Gunmen come to Mulder's {{apartment}} in disguise {{and tell him}} that they cannot find Scully. They reveal that they have found e-mails between Scully and a man called Cobra, who is apparently working on a shadow project at the Department of Defense. [...] Meanwhile, Scully wakes up in a cabin in Pennsylvania in pajamas instead of her clothes, and accuses The Smoking Man of drugging her. He claims she was merely exhausted and he was trying to make her comfortable. [...] She attempts to leave but decides to continue when The Smoking Man tells her she's free to go and that the choice of whether to accept his help or not is hers. Mulder and The Lone Gunmen go to Skinner to figure out why Scully was communicating with Cobra. They find that an anonymous person has hacked into Scully's computer and has been sending Cobra messages calling for a meeting. The group believe that it is the work of The Smoking Man, but Skinner still does not know how {{to get a hold of}} him. At dinner, The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> cure for cancer, but for all human disease, and that it is extraterrestrial. The Smoking Man goes outside and tells the man who has been following them that Cobra has not shown. Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn. She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra, who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper. The sniper also attempts to kill Scully, but is killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E
