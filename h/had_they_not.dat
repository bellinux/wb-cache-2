5|$|The {{authors of}} Kepler-14b's {{discovery}} paper noted that, <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> discovered that Kepler-14 {{was indeed a}} binary system, the parameters for Kepler-14b would have been extremely inaccurate. They noted that other planets discovered using radial velocity measurements might not have accounted {{for the possibility that}} their host stars were binary systems; the only way that this was definitely known in the case of Kepler-14 was through the use of high-resolution imaging. If the less prominent portion of the Kepler-14 binary system had not been detected, Kepler-14b's mass would have been incorrect by nearly 60%, and its radius too small by about 10%.|$|E
5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} {{irregularity}} in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress had set the date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> done so, Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E
5|$|As title holders, Manchester City were {{entitled}} to defend the Cup Winners' Cup in the 1970–71 season. <b>Had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> won the trophy, they would still have been qualified for European competition, as City's victory in the 1970 League Cup granted {{a place in the}} Fairs Cup. As a UEFA-organised competition, the Cup Winners' Cup took precedence over the Fairs Cup, and so the club took a place in the former. In the first round Manchester City almost suffered an upset at the hands of Linfield, from Belfast. City held a one-goal lead after the first leg, but Linfield twice took the lead in the second leg. The match finished 2–1 to Linfield, and Manchester City progressed on the away goals rule. Honvéd were the opposition in the second round. Manchester City won both legs, the score 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E
5|$|The quick {{collapse}} of the Liao led to more negotiations between the Song and the Jin. Jurchen military success and their effective control over the Sixteen Prefectures gave them more leverage. Aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the Song still intended to seize most of the prefectures. In the spring of 1123 the two sides finally set {{the terms of the}} first Song–Jin treaty. Only seven prefectures (including Yanjing) would be returned to the Song, and the Song would pay an annual indemnity of 300,000 packs of silk and 200,000 taels of silver to the Jin, as well as a one-time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the Jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> returned the prefectures. In May 1123 Tong Guan and the Song armies entered the looted Yanjing.|$|E
5|$|The singers of {{the second}} era of the concerto delle donne were officially ladies-in-waiting of Duchess Margherita Gonzaga d'Este, but were hired {{primarily}} as singers. Peverara's musical abilities prompted the Duke to specifically ask his wife Margherita to bring Peverara from Mantua {{as part of her}} retinue. The new singers played instruments, including the lute, harp, and viol, but focused their energies on developing vocal virtuosity. This skill became highly prized in the mid-sixteenth century, beginning with basses like Brancaccio, {{but by the end of}} the century virtuosic bass singing went out of style, and higher voices came into vogue. The ladies' musical duties included performing with the duchess' balletto delle donne, a group of female dancers who frequently crossdressed. Despite their upper-class background, the singers would not have been welcomed into the court's inner circle <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> been such skilled performers. D'Arco belonged to the nobility, but a minor family only. Peverara was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Molza came from a prominent family of artists.|$|E

5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E

25|$|In 1945, the Supreme Court {{issued its}} first {{decision}} on strikebreakers since Mackay Radio. In Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 793 (1945), the Court held that an employer committed a ULP when it hired strikebreakers because the employer had treated employees differently from {{how it would}} have treated them <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> been engaged in union solicitation.|$|E
25|$|However, not all {{restoration}} {{work was}} purely negative: {{a side effect}} of a number of restorations was the rediscovery of long-lost features, for instance Anglo-Saxon carving that had been incorporated into Norman foundations, or wall-paintings that had been whitewashed over, at St Albans Cathedral. It is also true to say that <b>had</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> been restored many churches would have fallen into disrepair.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, Mallory's snow goggles were in {{his pocket}} when the body was found, {{indicating}} that he died at night.

25|$|In the FA Cup, Everton {{reached their}} second {{successive}} FA Cup Final.

25|$|Another {{criticism}} is that IMF programs are only {{designed to address}} poor governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention in markets, and too much state ownership. This assumes that this narrow range of issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised and differing contexts are ignored.

25|$|The Heavenly Waters {{draws from}} the Mesopotamian {{tradition}} associating the dim area between Sagittarius and Orion with the god Ea and the Waters of the Abyss.

Instead, Menzel expanded the area and included several disparate constellations, most associated with water in some form: Delphinus, Equuleus, Eridanus, Piscis Austrinus, Carina, Puppis, Vela, Pyxis, and Columba. Carina, Puppis, and Vela historically formed part of the former constellation Argo Navis, which in Greek tradition represented the ship of Jason.|$|E
60|$|With due {{submission}} to the profound sagacity of this prelate, who can smell Popery at 500 miles distance, better than fanaticism just under his nose; I {{take leave to}} tell him, that this reproof to his friends, for want of zeal and clamour against Popery, slavery, and the Pretender, is what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> deserved. Are the pamphlets and papers, daily published by the sublime authors of his party full of any thing else?
