5|$|Constantine's {{monetary}} {{policies were}} {{closely associated with}} his religious ones, in that increased minting was associated with measures of confiscation—taken since 331 and closed in 336—of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting hold of the statues and having them melted for immediate minting—with the <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|During {{their early}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{had played in}} {{whatever}} coloured kit was available locally. However, at a committee meeting held in September 1885, the club decreed that blue and white striped jerseys should be adopted on a permanent basis.

5|$|His {{resting place}} {{is at the}} Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang. Today, Cho is {{regarded}} as the founding father of North Korean socialist realist poetry, or indeed poetry in general, or even North Korean literature as a whole. In the mid-1950s many Soviet Koreans, including Cho's close friends, were discredited in purges. According to Gabroussenko, Cho's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence.

With the <b>exception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
