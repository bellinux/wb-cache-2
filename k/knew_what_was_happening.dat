25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to be in on the action, also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R. Smith and the {{youngest}} Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he got too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{version of}} Livy and Polybius is {{supported}} by other ancient historians, such as Florus and Frontinus. In “The Punic Wars”, {{a part of his}} “Roman History”, Appian relates another story of the events. According to Appian, Scipio detached only Massinissa and his horsemen to prevent Syphax from rendering help to Hasdrubal. With the bulk of his legionaries the Roman commander attacked suddenly the camp of Hasdrubal and slaughtered almost all of his soldiers, because those who initially made their escape were rounded up by the Roman cavalry. When Syphax <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> he sent a cavalry detachment to assist Hasdrubal, but these horsemen were met and routed by Massinissa. Fearing that Scipio would turn on him after dealing with Hasdrubal’s army, Syphax abandoned his camp and retreated to safety with his army.|$|E
25|$|To {{support the}} Irish Rebellion of 1798 the French sent a naval {{expedition}} to Ireland that landed 1,099 soldiers under Jean Joseph Amable Humbert in August 1798. Unaware that Humbert {{was forced to}} surrender on 8 September, a second force of 2,844 troops under Hardy left for Ireland on 16 September. The naval squadron led by Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart was intercepted in the Battle of Tory Island {{and almost all of}} its ships captured, Hardy and most of his men becoming prisoners. He was exchanged in time to join the Army of the Danube in March 1799, but he was ill at the time and did not stay with the army long. Hardy assumed the rank of general of division on 30 July 1799. He was a friend of André Masséna and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> at his headquarters even though Hardy was not there. During the summer, the French Directory planned to replace Masséna as leader of the Army of the Danube but later decided to confirm him as commander. On 9 September Hardy wrote that Masséna was surprised at the decision.|$|E

In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E

The IMTFE delivered the following verdict on November 12, 1948.The Tribunal is satisfied that Matsui <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> He did nothing, or nothing effective to abate these horrors. He did issue orders before the capture of the city enjoining propriety of conduct upon his troops and later he issued further orders to the same purport. These orders were of no effect as is now known, and as he must have known... He was in command of the Army responsible for these happenings. He knew of them. He had the power, as he had the duty, to control his troops and to protect the unfortunate citizens of Nanking. He must be held criminally responsible for his failure to discharge this duty.Historian Yuma Totani notes that this verdict represents [...] "one of the earliest precedents for command responsibility in the history of international law." ...|$|E

2500|$|Karaza bey, {{another of}} the sultan's commanders, was lured into Albania for hope of {{attaining}} glory, despite his old age. Karaza had served with Skanderbeg in Anatolia where they subdued the sultan's rebellious subjects. Karaza was a consummate commander, having fulfilled many important tasks for the sultan. The sultan yielded 30,000 cavalry to Karaza who soon marched to Albania. Unlike his two compatriots before him, Karaza chose to march through Lower Dibra and not Upper Dibra, passing by Ohrid. In the meantime, a scouting force of 4,000 was drawn out ahead of the main army to gather information on the Albanian positions. But the majority of this force was destroyed. The pasha, upon hearing of the disaster, threw a fit of anger less due to his troops being killed than his plans being foiled. Karaza devised a stratagem by which to trick Skanderbeg: he sent several envoys to Skanderbeg condemning his [...] "pusillanimity" [...] and calling on him to fight on the open field instead of hiding in the woods. Skanderbeg knew that Karaza would not respect this promise if he accepted it and sent the envoys back. Karaza then began to conciliate with the native people but Skanderbeg—always being well-informed—immediately ordered {{an attack on the}} Ottoman camp. The attack was so fierce that few <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> and chaos ensued. However, Skanderbeg was not able to achieve his goal of annihilation (due to the heavy winds and pouring rain) but he was still able to do much damage to the Ottoman forces. Karaza immediately escaped with much of his army and traveled to Istanbul, where he was pardoned by the sultan for succeeding in preventing the annihilation of his force which the previous commanders fell victim to.|$|E
