Conversely, {{if any of the}} key determinants are not present no collective behavior will occur unless and until the missing determinants <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>place.</b> These are primarily social, although physical factors such as location and weather may also contribute to or hinder the development of collective behavior.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{departure}} from other popular titles such as Square Enix's Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series. Both the graphical presentation and the soundtrack were very well received. Reviews also commented that, initially, the character designs were too similar to previous Square Enix titles {{and may be}} off-putting to some though in the Shibuya setting they were [...] "absolutely in their element." [...] Some reviewers also complained that the Stride Cross Battle System was too complex for new players; Eurogamer's review felt the [...] "sink or swim" [...] reliance on learning the complex battle system was a significant stumbling block for the game. GamePro noted that the stylus input was imprecise, often mistaking movement and attack actions. On the other hand, the system was praised for its approach, and for the ability to alter {{the difficulty of the}} system within the game. Neku Sakuraba's character arc was praised by several reviewers, such as G4TV editor Jonathan Hunt, who praised his growth from a [...] "mute teenager" [...] to a [...] "civil human". 1UP.com's review summarized that the game is much {{more than the sum of}} its parts: [...] "By all rights, The World Ends With You should be an annoying disaster, a bundle of tired gimmicks and trite clichés.

500|$|On {{the day of}} the accident, Slotin's {{screwdriver}} slipped outward {{a fraction}} of an inch while he was lowering the top reflector, allowing the reflector to <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> around the core. Instantly there was a flash of blue light and a wave of heat across Slotin's skin; the core had become supercritical, releasing an intense burst of neutron radiation estimated to have lasted about a half second. Slotin quickly twisted his wrist, flipping the top shell to the floor. The heating of the core and shells stopped the criticality within seconds of its initiation, while Slotin's reaction prevented a recurrence and ended the accident. The position of Slotin's body over the apparatus also shielded the others from much of the neutron radiation, but he received a lethal dose of [...] neutron and [...] gamma radiation in under a second and died nine days later from acute radiation poisoning. The nearest person to Slotin, Graves, who was watching over Slotin's shoulder and was thus partially shielded by him, received a high but non-lethal radiation dose. Graves was hospitalized for several weeks with severe radiation poisoning and developed chronic neurological and vision problems {{as a result of the}} exposure. He died 20 years later of a heart attack. This heart attack may have been caused by hidden complications from radiation exposure, but its cause could also have been genetic, as his father had died from the same cause.|$|E
500|$|The {{other major}} problem Ralph Budd faced in {{developing}} a practical high speed lightweight train {{was to find a}} powerplant adequate to drive a trainset at a speed competitive with the faster steam trains. The existing powerplants for motorized railcars were completely inadequate. [...] Contemporary four-stroke Diesel motors had unacceptably low power-to-weight ratios and were only efficient under an unacceptably narrow range of operating conditions. [...] Spark-ignited petroleum distillate motors also suffered from low power-to-weight ratios along with being maintenance-intensive and smokey, and gasoline motors showed limited potential for higher power hauling applications. [...] The solution to Budd's problem presented itself in the new two-stroke Diesel motors developed by the partnership of the Winton Engine Company and General Motors, which represented a factor-of-four improvement in power-to-weight ratio over the previous generation of Diesel motors. [...] Their efficient operating range was also improved, owing largely to improvements in fuel injection developed by GM and Winton. [...] A Diesel-electric system driven by the new motor was used to power General Motors' automotive assembly exhibit at the 1933 Century of Progress Chicago World's Fair. [...] Budd saw the compact, efficient system in action, saw a major piece of his lightweight train puzzle <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>place,</b> then approached GM about developing it into a system for rail propulsion. [...] The result was a Diesel-electric drive system powered by an eight-cylinder, 600hp Winton 201A Diesel motor installed in a new three car stainless steel streamliner within a year. [...] In 1933 a Century of Progress exhibit inspired the Zephyr streamliner; the following year the new Zephyr streamliner inspired the Century of Progress fair {{and the rest of the}} country.|$|E

[...] The works offer retrospective arguments against Iorga's adversaries and sketch portraits of people who crossed Iorga's path—attributes which, Iova suggests, fully exploit Iorga's talents as a [...] "polemicist" [...] and [...] "portraitist"; according to Alexandru Zub, they also <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>place</b> within the Romanian ego-history vogue, between Xenopol's and Pârvan's.|$|E

[...] The reviewer compared Dark City to the director's preceding film The Crow in style but found Dark City to introduce new themes and to be a [...] "more thoroughly consistent" [...] film. Biodrowski concluded, [...] "Dark City may not provide profound answers, but it deals seriously with a profound idea, and does {{it in a way that}} is cathartic and even uplifting, without being contrived or condescending.
