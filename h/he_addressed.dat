5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major concern was human {{development}} in a technological era. <b>He</b> <b>addressed</b> employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve “full employment.” So, he kept himself grounded in economic principles, as understood and debated during that era.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. <b>He</b> <b>addressed</b> distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy.

In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.|$|E
5|$|The biography, Lindbergh, {{was highly}} anticipated; {{prior to its}} publication, the book's film rights were bought, sight unseen, by Steven Spielberg, who planned to direct a movie of it. Published in 1998, Lindbergh sold about 250,000 copies in hardcover, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Berg was noted for his {{exhaustive}} research, {{as well as his}} sympathetic, but by no means uncritical, approach to Lindbergh, whose alleged anti-Semitism <b>he</b> <b>addressed</b> in a straightforward, unblinking manner.|$|E
5|$|A keen geographer, Towner {{would often}} {{disappear}} into the bush for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of the}} Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government to issue a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. <b>He</b> <b>addressed</b> the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E

5|$|A new Belarusian {{constitution}} {{enacted in}} early 1994 {{paved the way}} for the first democratic presidential election on 23 June and 10 July. Six candidates stood in the first round, including Lukashenko, who campaigned as an independent on a populist platform. Shushkevich and Kebich also ran, with the latter regarded as the clear favorite. Lukashenko won 45.1% of the vote while Kebich received 17.4%, Zyanon Paznyak received 12.9% and Shushkevich, along with two other candidates, received less than 10% of votes. Lukashenko won the second round of the election on 10 July with 80.1% of the vote. Shortly after his election, <b>he</b> <b>addressed</b> the State Duma of the Russian Federation in Moscow proposing a new Union of Slavic states, which would culminate in the creation of the Union State in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Sherman {{began to take}} {{a larger role in}} politics. In 1844, <b>he</b> <b>addressed</b> a {{political}} rally on behalf of the Whig candidate for president that year, Henry Clay. Four years later, Sherman was a delegate to the Whig National Convention where the eventual winner Zachary Taylor was nominated. As with most conservative Whigs, Sherman supported the Compromise of 1850 as the best solution to the growing sectional divide. In 1852, Sherman was again a delegate to the Whig National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Winfield Scott, against rivals Daniel Webster and incumbent Millard Fillmore, who had become president following Taylor's death.|$|E
5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people <b>he</b> <b>addressed.</b> Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|During 1936 the {{experimental}} system at Bawdsey was tested against {{a variety of}} simulated attacks, along with extensive development of interception theory carried out at RAF Biggin Hill. One observer was Hugh Dowding, initially {{as the director of}} research for the RAF, and later as the commander of RAF Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the CH stations provided so much information that operators had problems relaying it to the pilots, and the pilots had problems understanding it. <b>He</b> <b>addressed</b> this through the creation of what is today known as the Dowding system.|$|E
5|$|He succeeded Balthasar for {{the second}} time as JG 2 commander, who had died in combat with Spitfires over {{northern}} France when he pulled the tail off his Bf 109F in a dive. The Bf 109F-2 proved an excellent match to the Spitfire V, but Oesau disliked its reduced armament compared to the 'Emil', and continued to fly an E-4 model in preference to the Bf 109F, until lack of spares forced him to switch to the newer variant. Upon his appointment on 4 July 1941, <b>he</b> <b>addressed</b> JG 2 with the following words.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, when Bakili Muluzi became president, <b>he</b> <b>addressed</b> the nation's {{need for}} a coordinated {{response}} to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2000, Muluzi introduced another five-year policy known as the National Strategic Framework, but, like Banda's five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan, this plan was largely ineffective. In 2001, in response to problems within the National AIDS Control Programme established by Banda, Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission. Unlike Banda, who prevented the public from accessing information about the epidemic, Muluzi ensured that information about HIV/AIDS was available {{on the radio and}} television, in newspapers, and on billboards. However, despite Muluzi's efforts, HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period, and Malawi experienced an AIDS-related nationwide famine in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In 2012 Tharoor was re-inducted {{into the}} Union Council of Ministers by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with the {{portfolio}} of {{minister of state}} for HRD. In this role he took special interest in the problems and challenges of adult education, distance education and enhancing high-quality research by academic institutions. He {{was responsible for the}} ministry's written answers to Parliament's questions and responded to oral questions on education during the Lok Sabha's Question Hour. <b>He</b> <b>addressed</b> forums and conferences on education, explained a vision of India's educational challenges {{in the context of the}} country's demographic opportunities, and stressed that education was not only a socioeconomic issue, but also a national security issue.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1969, Biden ran as a Democrat for the New Castle County Council on {{a liberal}} {{platform}} that included support for public {{housing in the}} suburban area. He won by a solid, two-thousand vote margin in the usually Republican district and in a bad year for Democrats in the state. Even before taking his seat, he was already talking about running for the U.S. Senate {{in a couple of}} years. He served on the County Council from 1970 to 1972 while continuing his private law practice. Among issues <b>he</b> <b>addressed</b> on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods, including those related to Interstate 95.|$|E
5|$|The war, lasting under a fortnight, {{saw more}} than 90,000 Pakistani {{soldiers}} taken as {{prisoners of war}} (POWs), and it ended with the unconditional surrender of Pakistan's eastern half, resulting in the birth of Bangladesh as a new nation. Apart from the POWs, Pakistan lost six thousand men, while India lost two thousand. After the war, Manekshaw {{was known for his}} compassion towards the POWs. Singh recounts that in some cases <b>he</b> <b>addressed</b> POWs personally, talking to them privately with just his aide-de-camp in his company while they shared a cup of tea. He ensured that POWs were well treated by the Indian Army, making provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowing them to celebrate festivals, and to receive letters and parcels from their loved ones.|$|E
