5|$|The {{favorite}} for qualification {{in both the}} 100m and 200m at the US Olympic Trials, Gay put in a strong performance in the heats.

Breaking Maurice Greene's nine-year-old record, this made Gay the third fastest 100m sprinter ever, after rivals Bolt and Powell. In the final the following day, Gay finished first in a wind-aided 9.68s (+4.1m/s). This was the fastest ever 100m time under any conditions, bettering the 9.69s record which Obadele Thompson had set 12 years earlier. The 200m event was a significant setback for Gay as he suffered a hamstring injury in the qualifiers and was subsequently ruled out of the event <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics.</b> The injury persisted for several weeks and he dropped out of track meetings in order to recover in time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Olympics.</b>|$|E
