5|$|Perovskia atriplicifolia has a {{long history}} of use in {{traditional}} medicine, especially as an antipyretic. It has also been employed as an antiparasitic and analgesic in Tibet, and smoked elsewhere as a <b>euphoriant.</b> In Balochistan, Pakistan, a decoction of the plant's leaves and flowers has been considered an anti-diabetic medication and a treatment for dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{recreational}} drug with <b>euphoriant</b> and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP {{are comparable to}} those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, {{although there have been}} at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania and other parts of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Some NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists, such as ketamine, dextromethorphan (DXM), phencyclidine (PCP), methoxetamine (MXE), and {{nitrous oxide}} (N2O), are popular recreational drugs used for their dissociative, hallucinogenic, and <b>euphoriant</b> properties. When used recreationally, they {{are classified as}} dissociative drugs.|$|E
50|$|Cannabinoid {{receptor}} 1 agonists are a {{group of}} <b>euphoriants</b> that includes certain plant-based cannabinoids (e.g., THC from the cannabis plant), endogenous cannabinoids (e.g., anandamide), and synthetic cannabinoids.|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} this observation, the {{original}} paper and both reviews suggest that phenethylamine plays {{a prominent role in}} mediating the mood-enhancing euphoric effects of a runner's high, as both phenethylamine and amphetamine are potent <b>euphoriants.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Euphoriants</b> like amphetamines and opioids produce rapid-acting antidepressant-like {{effects and}} were {{formerly}} {{used in the}} treatment of depression in the early 20th century. However, unlike the case of drugs like conventional antidepressants and ketamine, the antidepressant effects of <b>euphoriants</b> quickly disappear with chronic administration due to tachyphylaxis. Moreover, these drugs show long-lasting depressive effects with long-term use. Benzodiazepines have also presented a potential as a rapid strategy as an antidepressant although worsening moods has also been reported. In the year 2000, it is found that subanesthetic doses of the drug ketamine reduces depressive symptoms within 4 hours of administration in patients with severely treatment-resistant symptoms.|$|R
25|$|Diazepam {{increases}} the central depressive effects of alcohol, other hypnotics/sedatives (e.g., barbiturates), other muscle relaxants, certain antidepressants, sedative antihistamines, opioids, and antipsychotics, {{as well as}} anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. The <b>euphoriant</b> effects of opioids may be increased, leading to increased risk of psychological dependence.|$|E
25|$|GHB {{was widely}} used in France, Italy, and other European {{countries}} for several decades as a sleeping agent and an anesthetic in childbirth but problems with its abuse potential and development of newer drugs {{have led to a}} decrease in legitimate medical use of GHB in recent times. In the Netherlands, GHB could be bought as aphrodisiac and <b>euphoriant</b> in a smartshop for several years, until several incidents caused it to become regulated. The only common medical applications for GHB today are in the treatment of narcolepsy and more rarely alcoholism. In the typical scenario, GHB has been synthesized from γ-butyrolactone (GBL) by adding sodium hydroxide (lye) in ethanol or water.|$|E
25|$|The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a {{biological}} system composed of endocannabinoids, which are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the mammalian {{central nervous system}} (including the brain) and peripheral nervous system. The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and cognitive processes including fertility, pregnancy, during pre- and postnatal development, appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the pharmacological effects of cannabis. The ECS is also involved in mediating some of the physiological and cognitive effects of voluntary physical exercise in humans and other animals, such as contributing to exercise-induced euphoria as well as modulating locomotor activity and motivational salience for rewards. In humans, the plasma concentration of certain endocannabinoids (i.e., anandamide) {{have been found to}} rise during physical activity; since endocannabinoids can effectively penetrate the blood–brain barrier, {{it has been suggested that}} anandamide, along with other <b>euphoriant</b> neurochemicals, contributes to the development of exercise-induced euphoria in humans, a state colloquially referred to as a runner's high.|$|E

500|$|Amphetamine (contracted from [...] ) is {{a potent}} central nervous system (CNS) {{stimulant}} that {{is used in the}} treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity. Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and <b>euphoriant.</b> It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use.|$|E

50|$|Pharmacological {{manipulation}} using various drugs which alter neural {{activity by}} interfering with neurotransmission, resulting in alterations in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, and behavior. Psychoactive drugs {{are divided into}} different groups according to their pharmacological effects; <b>euphoriants</b> which tend to induce feelings of euphoria, stimulants that induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions, depressants that depress or reduce arousal or stimulation and hallucinogens which can cause hallucinations, perception anomalies, and other substantial subjective changes in thoughts, emotion, and consciousness.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{amphetamine}} and methamphetamine {{are used}} recreationally as <b>euphoriants</b> and aphrodisiacs, with methamphetamine being {{the more common}} recreational drug due to precursor availability and relative ease to manufacture. According to a National Geographic TV documentary on methamphetamine, [...] "an entire subculture known as party and play is based around methamphetamine use." [...] Members of this San Francisco sub-culture, which consists almost entirely of homosexual male methamphetamine users, will typically meet up through internet dating sites and have sex. [...] Due to its strong stimulant and aphrodisiac effects and inhibitory effect on ejaculation, with repeated use, these sexual encounters will sometimes occur continuously for several days. The crash following the use of methamphetamine in this manner is very often severe, with marked hypersomnia.|$|R
50|$|Thirty {{minutes of}} {{moderate}} to high intensity physical exercise {{has been shown}} to induce an enormous increase in urinary phenylacetic acid, the primary metabolite of phenethylamine. Two reviews noted a study where the mean 24 hour urinary phenylacetic acid concentration following just 30 minutes of intense exercise rose 77% above its base level; the reviews suggest that phenethylamine synthesis sharply increases during physical exercise during which it is rapidly metabolized due to its short half-life of roughly 30 seconds. In a resting state, phenethylamine is synthesized in catecholamine neurons from -phenylalanine by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase at approximately the same rate as dopamine is produced. Because of the pharmacological relationship between phenethylamine and amphetamine, the original paper and both reviews suggest that phenethylamine plays a prominent role in mediating the mood-enhancing euphoric effects of a runner's high, as both phenethylamine and amphetamine are potent <b>euphoriants.</b>|$|R
