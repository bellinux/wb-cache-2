40|$|International audienceDry <b>Dilution</b> <b>Refrigerators</b> (DDR) {{based on}} pulse tube cryo-coolers {{have started to}} replace Wet <b>Dilution</b> <b>Refrigerators</b> (WDR) due to the ease and low cost of operation. However these {{advantages}} come {{at the cost of}} increased vibrations, induced by the pulse tube. In this work, we present the vibration measurements performed on three different commercial DDRs. We describe in detail the vibration measurement system we assembled, based on commercial accelerometers, conditioner and DAQ, and examined the effects of the various damping solutions utilized on three different DDRs, both in the low and high frequency regions. Finally, we ran low temperature, pseudo-massive (30 and 250 g) germanium bolometers in the best vibration-performing system under study and report on the results...|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>dilution</b> <b>refrigerators</b> can precool the 3He with a {{cryocooler}} {{in place}} of liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, and a 1 K bath. No external supply of cryogenic liquids is needed in these [...] "dry cryostats" [...] and operation can be highly automated. However, dry cryostats have high energy requirements and are subject to mechanical vibrations, such as those produced by pulse tube refrigerators. The first experimental machines {{were built in the}} 1990s, when (commercial) cryocoolers became available, capable of reaching a temperature lower than that of liquid helium and having sufficient cooling power (on the order of 1 watt at 4.2 K). Pulse tube coolers are commonly used cryocoolers in dry <b>dilution</b> <b>refrigerators.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{temperature}} lower than liquid helium additional cooler stages may {{be added to the}} cryostat. Temperatures down to 1K can be reached by attaching the coldplate to a 1-K pot, which is a container of He-4 isotope which is connected to vacuum pump.

40|$|He- 3 /He- 4 <b>dilution</b> <b>refrigerators</b> {{are widely}} used for {{applications}} requiring continuous cooling at temperatures below approximately 300 mK. Despite of the popularity of these devices in low temperature physics, the thermodynamic relations underlying the cooling mechanism of He- 3 /He- 4 refrigerators are very often incorrectly used. Several thermodynamic models of dilution refrigeration {{have been published in}} the past, sometimes contradicting each other. These models are reviewed and compared with each other over a range of different He- 3 flow rates. In addition, a new numerical method for the calculation of a <b>dilution</b> <b>refrigerator's</b> cooling power at arbitrary flow rates is presented. This method has been developed at CERN's Central Cryogenic Laboratory. It can be extended to include many effects that cannot easily be accounted for by any of the other models, including the degradation of heat exchanger performance due to the limited number of step heat exchanger elements, which can be considerable for some designs. Finally, the limitations of applying the results obtained with idealized thermodynamic models to actual dilution refrigeration systems are discussed...|$|R

The use of laser cooling has produced temperatures less than a billionth of a kelvin. At very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero, matter exhibits many unusual properties, including superconductivity, superfluidity, and Bose–Einstein condensation. To study such phenomena, scientists have worked to obtain even lower temperatures.|$|R
