5000|$|Setting {{tools are}} used to set {{downhole}} completion elements such as production packers or bridge plugs. Setting tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow burning explosive charge to drive a <b>hydraulic</b> piston <b>assembly.</b> The assembly {{is attached to the}} plug or packer by means of a setting mandrel and a sliding sleeve, which when [...] "stroked" [...] by the piston assembly, effectively squeezes the elastomer elements of the packing element, deforming it sufficiently to wedge it into place in the tubing or casing string. Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.|$|R
40|$|The {{lubricants}} {{tested in}} this project were chosen {{based on the results}} of liquid/liquid miscibility tests. EMKARATE RL 32 S and Emery 2968 A were selected. The Vapor Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) viscosity reduction and gas fractionation of each was measured with three different refrigerant blends: (1) R- 404 A; (2) R- 507; and (3) R- 407 C. In addition, the four single refrigerants that make up the blends, HFC- 32, HFC- 125, HFC- 134 a, and HFC- 143 a, were also measured. Lubricants found to have the lowest liquid/liquid miscibilities had nearly equal viscosity reduction profiles as did the more miscible lubricants. Analytical methodology consisted of maintaining equally both the composition of the head space vapor above the lubricant/refrigerant mixture, and the composition of the liquid blend refrigerant. Blends with large temperature glides were re-evaluated in order to test the concept of head space quality and a vented piston <b>hydraulic</b> cylinder <b>assembly</b> was developed to perform this task. Fluid property data, above critical temperature and pressure conditions, is presented for the two lubricants with HFC- 32, HFC- 125, HFC- 143 a refrigerants. This research shows that the lubricant EMKARATE RL 32 S, which had the lowest (poorest) liquid/liquid miscibilities with the selected refrigerants, also had nearly equal viscosity reduction profiles to the more miscible Emery 2968 A lubricant. The analytical methodology consisted of maintaining the composition of the refrigerant gas above the lubricant to be equal in composition to that of the pure liquid refrigerant blend being introduced into the lubricant. Refrigerant blends with large temperature glides were re-evaluated in order to validate the concept of the importance of the composition of the gas over the lubricant. To do perform this task, a special vented piston <b>hydraulic</b> cylinder <b>assembly</b> was developed.

40|$|One {{of the key}} success {{factors in}} today’s global and highly {{competitive}} markets is to develop new products. On the other hand, new product developments have exponentially increasing as the development project proceeds. Thus, more and more the need for evaluating ideas inexpensively and rapidly is rising. The problem with current prototyping methods is that they come late in the development stages. This problem becomes more important in lean companies which have strong relationships with their strategic allies. The current development tools and methods suggested from scholars for development of physical products do not offer flexibility and iterative development. However, this approach limits developers from testing and comparing several ideas. The objective of this report is firstly to challenge the common categorization and application of prototypes by introducing mid-fidelity prototypes to merge the two main product development models, agile and stage wise, and secondly to demonstrate {{the impact of these}} prototypes on cost estimations and how the information generated from studying them helps to facilitate open book accounting. Mid-fidelity prototypes can reduce costs of development projects by testing functionality of ideas cheaply. They are also an effective communication tool internally and also with supply network firms. The purpose of this approach is to complement the current existing literature on product development models and prototyping. To provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} implications of what such a model could offer, it was implemented and analyzed in a case of developing cleanliness of <b>hydraulic</b> hose <b>assemblies.</b> The project was done with a <b>hydraulic</b> hose <b>assembly</b> manufacturer in Finland. This research shows that first, fully functional mock-ups are effective communication tools among the development team and externally with customers or suppliers. Second, they provide hands on experience of the product for the project stakeholders. Third, they can be used to estimate associated cost impacts of the product. Fourth, the generated data could be used as factual information to be shared with strategic allies and facilitating open book accounting. However, it is noteworthy that this method is not effective applicable in high-tech and complex products due to nature of them...|$|R

Beyond that, {{it had a}} stockpile of 23 1960s and 1970s era engines. Kuznetsov no longer manufactures the engines, so Orbital sought to buy RD-180 engines. Because NPO Energomash's contract with United Launch Alliance prevented this, Orbital sued ULA alleging anti-trust violations. Aerojet offered to work with Kuznetsov to restart production of new NK-33 engines, to assure Orbital of an ongoing supply. However, manufacturing defects in the engine's liquid oxygen turbopump and design flaws in the <b>hydraulic</b> balance <b>assembly</b> and thrust bearings were proposed as two possible causes of the 2014 Antares launch failure. As announced on 5 November 2014, Orbital decided to drop the AJ-26 first stage from the Antares and source an alternative engine.

40|$|Supplier Oy (names {{will be kept}} confidential) is a Finnish {{joint venture}} {{established}} recently {{in the area of}} <b>hydraulic</b> hose <b>assembly</b> manufacturing for big Finnish OEMs. The company is considered to revolutionize the traditional methods of <b>hydraulic</b> hose <b>assembly</b> manufacturing by a majority of the industry experts. With the usage of extensive IT software and software driven machinery, it has now become the most effective <b>hydraulic</b> hose <b>assembly</b> manufacturing company, not only in Europe but in the whole world. The idea was developed by a small team of people that combined creativity and experience. However, precise designing of every detail took a considerable amount of time. It is now believed that each detail that was considered during the design process, contributed to the implementation phase in a big portion. Author himself not only witnessed the design process, but also contributed to it in a deeper extent. Some tasks such as 3 D design of the cells as well as whole factory layout and optimization of flows were led by the author primarily. After the design process was finalized, ramp-up phase started. Planning things on paper was one aspect, but actually building the whole factory from the scratch was a challenging task. After the ramp-up was completed successfully, development phase began. It was then necessary to make the small improvements in various areas, to improve processes and products, providing high level of customer satisfaction without sacrificing from the initial effectiveness of the whole idea. In winter of 2012, this thesis was initiated with the aim of analyzing cost effectiveness of the case company. However soon after the initiation, the topic shifted to the area of supplying the customer not only products, but also own performance measurements. The reason for this shift was a recent turn of events during that time. Customer and the case company found a mismatch in their metrics. It was realized that on-time-delivery ratio was drastically different according to two sides. Since both supplier and customer were in collaborative manner, they decided to investigate this mismatch and tried to solve {{it in a way that}} would be beneficial for both parties. After the investigation, some reasons for this mismatch were understood. Interestingly, supplier’s metrics were yielding more accurate results than the metrics of customer. This raised the question from customer side whether they should use the supplier’s metrics and hence the topic of the thesis shifted towards this more recent topic. The concept of supplying metrics as well as products is found out to be a rather novel area in the literature. The literature review resulted in only few small sentences of such concept in different articles. Therefore, it became more interesting to research this topic and write the thesis in a way that also case company and its customer can benefit from it to a greater extent. The framework was built based on multiple smaller frameworks. Eventually, it combined three dimensions: (1) Lean manufacturing, (2) Customer-supplier relationships, (3) Performance measurement systems. It was revealed that supplying metrics was not a far away concept in lean partnerships considering the previous attempts already done under the concept of open book accounting (OBA). In other words, companies which were collaborative partners were already familiar to the sharing of internal information with each other. Only difference this time was the information was based on non-financial data whereas in OBA it was financial data only. The findings of the thesis includes that sharing of vital information requires a certain level of trust and collaborative manner between parties. Lean manufacturing is proven to be an important driver in this trend of moving towards collaboration and close customer-supplier relationships. Based on the framework and logical deduction, shared metrics are in fact aligned with the complete philosophy of lean manufacturing. Since excessive performance measurement can also be considered as a waste (muda) in lean philosophy, sharing performance measures can easily yield to a reduction of total number of metrics between parties. Thus, both sides can benefit from this information sharing activity. Also, in case of a mismatch it is expected for collaborative parties to move towards troubleshooting to resolve any conflicts, which results in a more accurate performance measuring from the holistic viewpoint of the relationship. Finally, it is forecasted that sharing metrics can also initiate an improvement in other areas such as customer satisfaction or higher visibility of production...|$|R

The two independent hydraulic systems were connected to the rock and tilt servoactuators.|$|R
25|$|At the Australian Grand Prix, {{the cars}} again {{occupied}} {{the back row}} of the grid, with Senna ahead of Chandhok. The F110s were both 6.6 seconds off the polesitter's time, but only 0.34 seconds behind the Virgin of Lucas di Grassi. Senna's car only lasted four laps of the race before retiring with a hydraulic failure, but Chandhok finished 14th and last for the car's first classified finish, albeit five laps adrift of the winner and three laps behind Heikki Kovalainen's 13th-placed Lotus. This was partly due to a damaged floor caused by Chandhok coming off the track twice during the race. In Malaysia, Chandhok achieved the F110's best qualifying position without grid rearrangement in 22nd position. In the race both cars ran efficiently and achieved the F110's first double-finish, with Chandhok and Senna finishing in 15th and 16th positions respectively, ahead of the two delayed Lotus drivers. Chandhok finished three laps down, while Senna was another lap behind the leader. At the Chinese Grand Prix, Chandhok received a five-place grid penalty as the team broke the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) seal on his car's gearbox without {{a representative of the}} governing body being present; he was then further penalised for his mechanics changing a <b>hydraulic</b> pump <b>assembly</b> with parts of a different specification to the originals, and was made to start from the pit lane. In the race, the F110 achieved another double finish, with Senna leading Chandhok home in 16th and 17th positions respectively.|$|R
40|$|As {{interest}} in product recovery, reuse, and recycling rises, planning and evaluating disassembly sequences {{are becoming increasingly}} important. The manner in which a product can be taken apart strongly influences end-of-life (EOL) operations and costs. Early disassembly planning can also inform non-EOL processes including repair and routine maintenance. Recently, research has concentrated on creating optimization algorithms which automatically generate disassembly sequences. These algorithms often require data that are unavailable or estimated with high uncertainty. Furthermore, industries often employ CAD modeling software to evaluate disassembly sequences during the design stage. The combination of these methods result in mathematically generated solutions, however, the solutions may not account for attributes {{that are difficult to}} quantify (human interaction). To help designers better explore and understand disassembly sequence opportunities, the research presented in this paper combines the value of mathematical modeling with the benefits of immersive computing technologies (ICT) to aid in early design decision making. For the purposes of this research, an ICT application was developed. The application displays both 3 D geometry of a product and an interactive graph visualization of existing disassembly sequences. The user can naturally interact with the geometric models and explore sequences outlined in the graph visualization. The calculated optimal path can be highlighted allowing the user to quickly compare the optimal sequence against alternatives. The application has been implemented in a three wall immersive projection environment. A user study involving a <b>hydraulic</b> pump <b>assembly</b> was conducted. The results suggest that this approach may be a viable method of evaluating disassembly sequences early in design...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the Robust Design Optimization (RDO) of an Electric Pump for Dishwashers. The {{aim of this}} work is to apply RDO techniques {{to the design of}} a large scale product and, in particular, the optimization target is to improve the efficiency and lower the cost of the whole system, as well as to fulfil requirements on the overall dimensions and head. Once an optimized geometry which meets all the requirements is obtained it will become a standard pump listed in the company catalogue. The authors gave a particular attention to the numerical model validations and to the theoretical study of the hydraulic and electromechanical coupling. The parametric model representing the main geometrical features of the water pump was created using the commercial CAD tool, Catia v 5 and it had some simplifications, compared with the model used for the production water pump but it was considered to be accurate enough to provide a good analysis of the hydraulic performance of the pump. A numerical model of the hydraulic part of the water pump was created using the commercial mesh generator, ICEM CFD and CFX 5 was used as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used for the Robust Design Optimization of the electric water pump and the best configuration was selected using a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool over Pareto frontier designs. In spite of the complexity of the operation necessary for the optimization of the electric motor and <b>hydraulic</b> pump <b>assembly,</b> the optimized electric water pump is more efficient than optimizing just the electric motor, and coupling it with an existing pump. The optimized electric water pump will be validated by experimental tests in the near future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDigital {{hydraulic}} valve {{system is a}} new kind of <b>hydraulic</b> control valve <b>assembly,</b> which has potential to save energy and improve performance of valve controlled actuators. The typical digital valve system has 4 - 6 parallel connected on/off valves per control edge totaling 16 - 24 valves in the four-way valve configuration. The flow capacities of the parallel connected valves are set according to the powers of two such {{that it is possible to}} achieve 2 N different flow rates with N valves. An alternative approach is to use equally sized valves, which means that N parallel connected valves give only N+ 1 different flow rates. This approach has several benefits, but the number of valves becomes very large. This paper shows that it is possible to implement valve assembly having 128 miniaturized valves, such that it can be installed instead of traditional CETOP 3 servo or proportional valve. Careful electromagnetic optimization and mechatronic design are used together with novel manufacturing methods and new type of power electronics. The prototype is build and experimentally studied and results show that the performance of this kind of digital valve system is superior to traditional four-way control valves in terms of response time and fault tolerance...|$|R
