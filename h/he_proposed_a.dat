5|$|A June 1965 {{ruling by}} the Kentucky Court of Appeals that {{property}} must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for a special session from Kentucky taxpayers. Breathitt obliged, calling the session in July. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> reduction in property tax rates to offset {{the increase in the}} assessed value of property, and also advocated small increased in other tax rates to benefit public schools. The plan passed despite opposition from Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{became one}} of the {{founding}} Fellows of the Royal Society in 1661, but he was not very active in the society. His most significant appointment was to the College of Arms as Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary in June 1660. In this position he devoted himself {{to the study of the}} history of the Order of the Garter, which had been a special interest of his since the 1650s, and <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> design for the Royal Society's coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 it {{appointed}} the architect Percy Thomas to produce designs. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> new American-inspired station that would involve removing or re-siting the arch, and included office frontages along Euston Road and a helicopter pad on the roof. The redevelopment work began on 12 July 1938, when 100,000 tons of limestone was extracted {{for the new}} building and some new flats constructed to rehouse people displaced by the works. The project was then shelved indefinitely because of World War II.|$|E

50|$|In {{neutrino}} physics, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>an</b> experiment using gallium/germanium detectors {{to detect}} solar neutrinos. In 1970, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> neutron/antineutron oscillations {{as a possibility}} for observing violation of baryon number.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, Corzine coauthored (with Bob Graham) a tax-cut {{proposal}} {{aimed at}} lowering the marginal tax bracket from 15% to 10% {{on the first}} $19,000 of taxable income. In 2002, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> tax cut that exempted the first $10,000 of income from the $765 of Social Security taxes for both employers and employees. Corzine also proposed making dividend payments tax deductible to companies {{as a form of}} economic stimulus.|$|E
5|$|Long's time as {{governor}} {{was described by}} historian P.A.M. Tayler as relatively uneventful. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> number of modest reforms, including a measured expansion of women's voting rights (then restricted to voting for school committees), and allowing women to sit on state boards. Most of these reforms were not implemented during his tenure, although some were later enacted into law by his successors. He kept a busy schedule, attending all manner of civic events across the state.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev came {{to power}} in the Soviet Union on March 11, 1985, and the next day {{negotiations}} on nuclear and space-based weapons began in Geneva. A few weeks later, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> moratorium on the development of nuclear and space weapons during the period of negotiations, and in July, he proposed to ban nuclear testing. Reagan rejected the proposals.|$|E
50|$|Co-wrote the 2011 platform. <b>He</b> <b>proposes</b> <b>a</b> {{new federal}} income tax bracket of 35% for anyone who earns above $250,000 per year.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} UN fact-finding commission. The allegations was {{met with}} a walkout by the US, Canada, Israel and the 27-member EU bloc.|$|R
50|$|An Essay {{towards a}} Real Character and a Philosophical Language (1668), in which <b>he</b> <b>proposes</b> <b>a</b> new {{universal}} language {{for the use}} of natural philosophers.|$|R
5|$|Newton's {{contribution}} to gravitational theory was {{to unify the}} motions of heavenly bodies, which Aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> law of gravity that {{could account for the}} celestial motions that had been described earlier using Kepler's laws of planetary motion.|$|E
5|$|The Law of Prairial was the {{breaking}} point for opponents of Robespierre. Resistance to the Terror spread throughout the Convention, and Saint-Just was compelled to address the division. Bertrand Barère and other Thermidorians have claimed that <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> dictatorship for Robespierre, but nonetheless some of them considered him to be redeemable, or at least useful – until he delivered his uncompromising public defence of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794).|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} {{to build a}} fortification on Dragut Point {{was made by the}} Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> fortified city known as Borgo della Città Piccola, with a design similar to Fort Ricasoli. The proposal never materialized, probably {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{proposal for a}} connection between Bømlo and Stord {{was made in the}} 1960s by sheriff, and later mayor of Fitjar, Finn Havnerås. Christened the Island Road, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> series of eleven bridges and causeways which would run from Kalveid in Fitjar via Brandasund to Rolfsnes in Bømlo. While local politicians were not opposed to the plan, the recent municipal merger between Bømlo, Bremnes and Moster made them prioritize other sectors and the project was abandoned without any official investigations.|$|E
5|$|The next {{proposal}} {{to build a}} fortification on the island {{was made by the}} Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> roughly hexagonal fort with a hornwork, in the Dutch style of fortification. The proposal was criticized by the Order's engineers, and a third proposal was drawn up by the Flemish military engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh in 1687. Grunenburgh's proposal consisted of a fort with four bastions and a ravelin, surrounded by a ditch, covertway and faussebraye.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol were {{regularly}} travelling to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated {{that this would be}} shorter and quicker than Columbus' southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E
50|$|O’Keefe gave a TEDx Talk in October 2016, on {{the natural}} origin of homosexuality. In this talk, <b>he</b> <b>proposes</b> <b>a</b> theory about the {{evolutionary}} basis of homosexuality mediated by epigenetics.|$|R

5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to do justice to the detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the recent}} grant of an Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} {{the building of the}} Glamorganshire Canal, it was resolved at a meeting at the Ship & Castle public house in Neath on 12 July 1790 to build a canal from Pontneddfechan to Neath, and another from Neath to Giant's Grave. Among those attending was Lord Vernon, who had already built a short canal near Giant's Grave to connect the River Neath to furnaces at Penrhiwtyn. Thomas Dadford was asked to survey a course, and he was assisted by his father and brother. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> route which required 22 locks, part of which was a conventional canal, while other parts used the River Neath. Dadford costed the project at £25,716, but in early 1791 Lord Vernon's agent, Lewis Thomas, proposed two new cuts, and the idea of using the river was dropped soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Ferrara has {{proposed}} a number of redevelopments for the orphanage itself, and its surroundings. In 2004, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> plan to redevelop the lot and building into 63 residential units. The proposed redevelopment was known as Glebe Gardens. Ferrara planned the construction of gardens and pools on the vacant grounds, but {{the front of the}} complex would face no development. Although the development application was approved by the city council, the plans were dropped because the costs to redevelop the lot were too great. In 2009, work began to revamp the orphanage and convert it into a retirement village, with trees being cleared to construct a retaining wall. Two metre high walls were going to be built to keep vandals out and to prevent further damage. He also stated {{that he was going to}} the fix up the orphanage once the proposed townhouses were under construction.|$|E

50|$|In 1917, Mehmet Nadir {{published}} {{a book on the}} Number theory. In this book, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>an</b> alternative algorithm on divisibility. Well-known German mathematics professor Felix Klein congratulated him for the algorithm.|$|R
5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} {{toll on the}} Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>a</b> statewide gas tax increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E
