40|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of proteomics is {{to fully}} identify and quantify the entire complement of proteins and post-translational modifications in biological samples of interest. For the last 15 years, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode {{has been the}} standard for proteomics when sampling breadth and discovery were the main objectives; multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) LC-MS/MS has been the standard for targeted proteomics when precise quantification, reproducibility, and validation were the main objectives. Recently, improvements in mass spectrometer design and bioinformatics algorithms {{have resulted in the}} rediscovery and development of another sampling method: data-independent acquisition (DIA). DIA comprehensively and repeatedly samples every peptide in a protein digest, producing a complex set of mass spectra that is difficult to interpret without external spectral libraries. Currently, DIA approaches the <b>identification</b> <b>breadth</b> of DDA while achieving the reproducible quantification characteristic of MRM or its newest version, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). In comparative de novo identification and quantification studies in human cell lysates, DIA identified up to 89 % of the proteins detected in a comparable DDA experiment while providing reproducible quantification of over 85 % of them. DIA analysis aided by spectral libraries derived from prior DIA experiments or auxiliary DDA data produces identification and quantification as reproducible and precise as that achieved by MRM/PRM, except on low‑abundance peptides that are obscured by stronger signals. DIA is still a work in progress toward the goal of sensitive, reproducible, and precise quantification without external spectral libraries. New software tools applied to DIA analysis have to deal with deconvolution of complex spectra as well as proper filtering of false positives and false negatives. However, the future outlook is positive, and various researchers are working on novel bioinformatics techniques to address these issues and increase the reproducibility, fidelity, and <b>identification</b> <b>breadth</b> of DIA...|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal {{data were}} used to {{evaluate}} whether parental psychological control would {{have a negative impact}} on identity formation. Perceived psychological control and 4 identity dimensions (i. e., commitment making, exploration in <b>breadth,</b> <b>identification</b> with commitment, and exploration in depth) were assessed 5 times in a college sample. Associations between psychological control and identity (i. e., negative associations with both commitment dimensions and a positive association with exploration in breadth) were stable across time. Further, the developmental pathways of these constructs appeared to be correlated: Increases in psychological control were associated with simultaneous decreases in both commitment dimensions. Finally, reciprocal effects were found: Psychological control inhibited progress in both commitment dimensions, whereas exploration in breadth led to increased psychological control. The authors have provided suggestions for helping emerging adults to approach the task of identity formation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Neutralizing {{antibodies}} (Nabs) {{are thought}} {{to play an important}} role in prevention and control of HIV- 1 infection and should be targeted by an AIDS vaccine. It is critical to understand how HIV- 1 induces Nabs by analyzing viral sequences in both tested viruses and sera. Neutralization susceptibility to antibodies in autologous and heterologous plasma was determined for multiple Envs (3 â�� 6) from each of 15 subtype-C- infected individuals. Heterologous neutralization was divided into two distinct groups: plasma with strong, cross-reactive neutralization (n = 9) and plasma with weak neutralization (n = 6). Plasma with cross-reactive heterologous Nabs also more potently neutralized contemporaneous autologous viruses. Analysis of Env sequences in plasma from both groups revealed a three-amino-acid substitution pattern in the V 4 region that was associated with greater neutralization potency and <b>breadth.</b> <b>Identification</b> of such potential neutralization signatures may have important implications for the development of HIV- 1 vaccines capable of inducing Nabs to subtype C HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, discussions {{regarding}} adolescent health, {{particularly in}} the political and legal arenas, frequently focus on one of two issues: abortion and medical decision making. These are important issues that merit considered attention, but there is much more to adolescent health. Many other issues — ranging from violence to substance use to obesity — {{have a significant impact on}} the health and well-being of adolescents. This symposium essay aims to shed light on the breadth of health issues confronting adolescents and explore the utility of human rights law in understanding and responding to key health issues confronting adolescents today. Employing a human rights framework, this essay seeks to forge a more holistic understanding of and approach to adolescent health. The essay begins by discussing the range of issues affecting adolescent well-being, focusing in particular on violence, substance use, and obesity. It then briefly addresses the limits of a medical model and related concerns with over-relying on the health care sector to address all adolescent health issues. Access to health care is crucial, but successfully addressing adolescent health issues will require law, policies, and programs that contemplate adolescent well-being beyond health care facilities. This essay then discusses the value of using human rights law as a starting point for developing a comprehensive response to adolescent health issues. Human rights law can facilitate <b>identification</b> of the <b>breadth</b> of issues affecting adolescents while simultaneously providing a legal framework for developing appropriate responses to the various harms that adolescents experience...|$|R
40|$|Planning theory {{identifies}} a step-wise {{process for}} making decisions which typically {{include the following}} steps: define the problem, develop alternatives, evaluate alternatives, and make the decision. We are seeing the growth of multi-criteria decision making frameworks that can score different factors and weight different criteria to provide overall scores for alternatives to indicate a preferred decision. Legal processes have been developed with complex submission and submission-on-submissions procedures to inform independent commissioners {{of the variety of}} viewpoints that need to be considered in their deliberations on the merits of proposals. However these technical and legal processes {{may not be the most}} effective decision making processes for the sustainable management of scarce resources involving multiple users. Ostrom has identified “collective choice arrangements” as one of the design principles for the management of common pool resources, such as water or fisheries. This paper describes the decision making process for developing the Canterbury Water Management Strategy. This process was designed to be dynamic and collaborative with stakeholder and community engagement. The steps in the community engagement process defined the decision making process. This is not to say that the technical and legal processes were not followed, rather, they were subsidiary to the community engagement process. The paper describes the activities associated with the seven milestones of the community engagement process: (1) Release and announcement (2) Definition of the process (3) <b>Identification</b> of the <b>breadth</b> of uses and benefits (4) Public reporting of uses and benefits (5) Achievement of depth and sophistication of strategies and substrategies (6) Public engagement on strategy options (7) Implementation and update. The community engagement process was successful in achieving widespread acceptance of the proposed strategy which is now being implemented...|$|R
