40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of a complex exercise program for elderly people who had experienced a fall on their balance, gait, vestibular senses, and proprioceptive senses when their visual sense was blocked. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 30 healthy elderly people aged 65 or older. They were equally and randomly divided into a visual block (VB) group (those whose eyes were covered) and a visual permission (VP) group. The subjects performed the complex exercise program for 30 minutes, twice <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>five</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for 4 <b>weeks</b> <b>a</b> total of 20 times. Outcome measures were the 10 meter walking test (10 MWT), stair up/down test (SUDT), Berg balance scale (BBS), vestibular stepping test (VST), proprioception test (PT). [Results] After the intervention, the VB group showed improvements in 10 MWT, VST, and PT. The VP group showed im-provements in 10 MWT and PT. The significant improvement in VST observed in the VB group was significantly greater than that in the VP group.

40|$|Abstract: Installation {{of mobile}} phone base {{stations}} in residential areas has initiated public debate about {{possible adverse effects}} on human health. This study aimed to determine the association of exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic field radiation (RF-EMFR) generated by mobile phone base stations with glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. For this study, two different elementary schools (school- 1 and school- 2) were selected. We recruited 159 students in total; 96 male students from school- 1, with age range 12 – 16 years, and 63 male students with age range 12 – 17 years from school- 2. Mobile phone base stations with towers existed about 200 m away from the school buildings. RF-EMFR was measured inside both schools. In school- 1, RF-EMFR was 9. 601 nW/cm 2 at frequency of 925 MHz, and students {{had been exposed to}} RF-EMFR for a duration of 6 h daily, <b>five</b> <b>days</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> In school- 2, RF-EMFR was 1. 909 nW/cm 2 at frequency of 925 MHz and students had been exposed for 6 h daily, <b>five</b> <b>days</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> 5 – 6 mL blood was collected from all the students and HbA 1 c was OPEN ACCES...|$|R
