50|$|Geranium columbinum reaches {{on average}} 15 - 30 cm in height, {{with a maximum}} of 60 cm. The stem {{is more or less}} erect, hairy and quite branched. The leaves are opposite, {{approximately}} pentagonal and palmate and the leaf lobes have two to three deep cuts making it similar in shape to a pigeon's foot (hence the Latin epithet columbinus). The flowers are pink to purple, 15 - 20 mm in size, with five obovate-heart-shaped petals as long as the sepals. The petals are 7-9 mm long, with distinctive veining. The flowering period extends from March to September. The flowers are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects (<b>entomogamy).</b>|$|E
50|$|Epilobium parviflorum reaches {{on average}} 30 - 80 cm in height. The stem is erect and densely covered with hairs, {{especially}} in the lower part. The leaves are opposite, unstalked but not amplexicaul, lanceolate and toothed, rounded at the base, 4 - 10 cm long. The tiny flowers are pale pink or pale purple, 6 - 7 mm in diameter, with four petals, eight stamens and a 4-lobed stigma. Flowering occurs from June to August. The hermaphroditic flowers are either self-fertilized (autogamy) or pollinated by insects (<b>entomogamy).</b> Fruit is a three-to seven-centimeter long capsule containing very small black seeds (about 1 mm long), with white fibres that allow the dispersal by wind. This species is quite similar to Epilobium hirsutum, but the flowers are much smaller.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 The {{pollination}} {{biology of}} lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea subsp. minus L.) was researched to determine possible modes of pollination and methods to enhance pollination for increased fruit set. A viability experiment showed that pollen germinates {{best in a}} nutrient solution with 10. 5 g sucrose per 100 ml. Exposing lingonberry flowers to wind speeds up to 22 km per hr resulted in little pollen release and negligible fruit set. Vibration of flowers at 170 - 730 Hz showed ample pollen release at all frequencies but negligible fruit set by self pollination. Although honeybees and bumblebees frequently visited lingonberry flowers, addition of hives to wild stands did not influence fruit set. Insect visitors were examined for lingonberry pollen; those with more than 1000 tetrads per insect included: Apis millifera, Bombus terrestris, B. sylvicola, B. flavifrons flavifrons, Andrena sp. and Dialictus? (Halictidae). <b>Entomogamy</b> is the primary method of pollination for lingonberries...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{grassland}} complex of communities which may {{be found on the}} limestones in the southeastern Alps; these communities show in fact a particular interest for their high biodiversity degree and for their importance for the traditional land-use economy of the south-European mountain regions. Phytosociological releveÂ´s corresponding to well-defined plant associations have been used in order to get information on the relationships among plant species diversity, biomass, chorotypes, pollination types, functional strategies and soil characteristics. The analysis was carried out both along an altitudinal and a soil evolution gradient. The analysis of the correlations among the variables and the application of the principal component analysis shows a positive correlation between soil parameters and biomass, eurichory, anemogamy and C- and R-strategies; on the contrary, a negative correlation among stenochory, <b>entomogamy</b> and S-strategy with the soil evolution seems to be present. This article shows how the phytosociological approach can be used to get information and knowledge on the correlations between several variables useful to understand the complex nature of the plant communities in order to support management plans...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the flowers of Galanthus nivalis shows adaptations to early spring flowering conditions as well as adaptations to <b>entomogamy.</b> The tepals produce colour marks and odorous substances. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the micromorphology and anatomy of tepals, in particular in the regions comprising colour marks which, in accordance with the literature data, emit essential oils. Examination was performed using light, fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. Large protrusions, corresponding to the location of the green stripes, were found to occur on the adaxial surface of the inner tepals. The epidermal cells in this part of the tepals produce a cuticle with characteristic ornamentation as well as numerous stomata with well-developed outer cuticular ledges. The wide opening of many stomata is evidence of high activity in this area. The fluorescence microscopy images confirm the high activity of the epidermis (scent emission), on both sides of the tepals, as well as of the chloroplast- containing mesophyll. In the abaxial epidermis, there were observed different-sized papillae that also participated in essential oil secretion. The polarization of the epidermal cell protoplasts, large cell nuclei, and the presence of large vacuoles with heterogeneous contents in the peripheral part of the cells correspond to the structural features of the tissues emitting odorous compounds in flowers - osmophores. In freshly opened flowers, the mesophyll of the central part of the perianth segments was composed of several cell layers, whereas in older flowers large air ducts formed, which are adaptations to environmental thermal conditions...|$|E
