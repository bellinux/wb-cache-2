She had no objection whatever to his use of one of the rooms of the flat for the purposes of a non-explosive chemistry that, so far as she was concerned, came to nothing; she let him have a gas furnace and a sink and a <b>dust-tight</b> cupboard of refuge from the weekly storm of cleaning she would not forego. And having known people addicted to drink, she regarded his solicitude for distinction in learned societies as an excellent substitute for the coarser form of depravity. But any sort of living things in quantity, [...] "wriggly" [...] as they were bound to be alive and [...] "smelly" [...] dead, she could not and would not abide. She said these things were certain to be unhealthy, and Bensington was notoriously a delicate man--it was nonsense to say he wasn't. And when Bensington tried to make the enormous importance of this possible discovery clear, she said that it was all very well, but if she consented to his making everything nasty and unwholesome in the place (and that was what it all came to) then she was certain he {{would be the first to}} complain.|$|E

50|$|Enclosures - <b>Dust-tight</b> {{barriers}} such as sheetrock or plywood are erected {{to protect}} against the release of the hazardous material into the environment. When the enclosure is eventually removed, the hazardous material is once again exposed and it usually has become more friable and prone to being released into the atmosphere. Care must be taken to insure that untrained or uninformed workers do not re-expose the hazardous surfaces unknowingly and endanger themselves and/or the inhabitants by causing arelease into the environment.|$|E
50|$|German {{standard}} DIN 40050-9 {{extended the}} older IEC 60529 rating system with an IP69K rating for high-pressure, high-temperature wash-down applications. DIN 40050-9 {{has been replaced}} by ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code). Such enclosures must not only be <b>dust-tight</b> (IP6X), but it must also be able to withstand high-pressure and steam cleaning. By 2013 IEC 60529 added level 9 water ingress testing, with IPx9 being essentially the same spray test as IP69K, also adding a drawing of a fixture to verify the water pressure.|$|E
40|$|First Aid is the {{immediate}} care {{given to the}} horse {{in the event of}} an accident or sudden illness, horses by nature are somewhat accident prone and suffer frequent injury. For " reason it is important for the horseowner to have certain medical supply items readily available {{in the event of an}} emergency. These supplies should be kept together in an appropriate <b>dust-tight</b> container located in convenient locations. All items should be checked periodically to insure that they are in a usable condition. Most of the recommended first-aide kit items can be obtained through a veterinarian or purchased at a drug store, feed store, or tack supply shop...|$|E
