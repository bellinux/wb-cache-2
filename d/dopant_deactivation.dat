40|$|An {{improved}} {{charge separation}} technique for metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) capacitors is presented {{which accounts for}} the deactivation of substrate dopants by hydrogen at elevated irradiation temperatures or small irradiation biases. Using high-frequency capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, radiation-induced inversion voltage shifts are separated into components due to oxide trapped charge, interface traps and deactivated dopants, where the latter is computed from a reduction in Si capacitance. In the limit of no radiation-induced <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation,</b> this approach reduces to the standard midgap charge separation technique used widely {{for the analysis of}} room-temperature irradiations. The technique is demonstrated on a p-type MOS capacitor irradiated with {sup 60 }Co {gamma}-rays at 100 C and zero bias, where the <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> is significant...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the room temperature diffusion and trapping phenomena of ion beam generated point defects in crystalline Si by monitoring their interaction with dopants, native contaminants such as C and O, and other defects. Spreading resistance measurements show that a small fraction (similar to 10 (- 7) - 10 (- 6)) of the defects generated at the surface by a 40 keV Si implant is injected into the bulk. These defects undergo trap-limited diffusion and produce <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> and/or partial annihilation of preexisting deep (several micron) defect markers, produced by MeV He implants. It is found that in highly pure, epitaxial Si layers, these effects extend to several microns from the surface, demonstrating a long range migration of point defects at room temperature. A {{detailed analysis of the}} experimental evidences allows us to identify the Si self-interstitials injected into the bulk as the major responsible of both <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> and partial annealing of vacancy-type defects (divacancies, phosphorus-vacancy and oxygen-vacancy) generated by the implants. Finally, a lower limit of similar to 6 x 10 (- 11) cm(2) /s is obtained for the room temperature diffusivity of Si self-interstitials...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} {{dopant activation}} of high-dose 49 BF 2 ion implanted layers was investigated {{as a function}} of annealing time and temperature using rapid thermal annealing (RTA) and furnace annealing (FA). Fast recrystallization using RTA produces low sheet resistance, and prolonged annealing at low temperatures causes electrical <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation.</b> The deactivation was controlled by a diffusion limited process with an activation energy (Ea) value of 3. 46 eV, wh ich is equal to the Ea value of boron diffusion in the amorphous region that regrows to a single crystal. RTA yields low sheet resistances compared with FA, because RTA minimizes not only the redistribution of fluorine atoms in the amorphous region during the recrystallization, but also the electrical <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> during the time the wafer is cooling. H igh dose 49 BF 2 ion implantation 1 ' 2 is generally used in the manufactur ing of very large scale integration (VLSI) to form the p+-source/drain junctions of metal oxide semicon-ductor field effect transistors (MOSFET's).

40|$|This work {{provides}} {{direct evidence}} for {{a significant reduction in}} the dopant concentration (P, B, As) at the polysilicon/oxide surface due to postsilicide formation annealing at typical process temperatures (e. g., BPSG deposition/densification). The combined effects of dopant loss into the suicide layer and <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> by con-ventional furnace annealing result in electrical activity of {{only a small fraction of}} the initial chemical dose. The results presented in this work help to better our under-standing of polysilicon depletion effects in MOSFETs, dopant activation and redistribution effects in silicided polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors, and contact resist-ance effects at the polysilicon/silicide interface.

40|$|We {{report on}} a physically-based Fermi-level {{modeling}} approach designed to be accurate and yet amenable to be implemented in a device-size process simulator. We use an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo method {{in conjunction with a}} continuum treatment for carrier densities. The model includes (i) charge reactions and electric bias according to the local Fermi-level, (ii) pairing and break-up reactions involving charged particles, (iii) clustering-related <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> and (iv) Fermi level-dependent solubility. Degenerated statistics, band-gap narrowing, and damage-induced electrical compensation are also included. The parameters used for charged particles are in agreement with ab-initio calculations and experimental results. This modeling scheme has proved to be very computationally efficient for realistic device-dimension process simulations. We present an illustrative set of simulation results for two common dopants, Boron and Arsenic, and discuss the potential of this approach for accurate process simulation of decanano CMOS devices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} ion {{irradiation}} on the Ti/ 4 H-SiC Schottky barrier are discussed. The Ti/SiC interfacial region of test Schottky diodes was irradiated with 8 MeV Si+ 4 ions at fluences between 1 × 109 and 1 × 1012 ions/cm 2. By increasing ion fluence, {{an increase of}} the Schottky barrier ΦB was observed, from ΦB= 1. 05 eV in the non-irradiated sample to ΦB = 1. 21 eV after irradiation at the highest fluence, accompanied by a decrease of the leakage current. Using different experimental analytical techniques enabled us to correlate the modification of the interfacial region with the contacts electrical behaviour. In particular, the structural and electrical modifications in the near-interface region (different orientation of the Ti film, defects in the epilayer, <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation)</b> {{were responsible for the}} change of the Ti barrier after irradiation...|$|E
40|$|P -type ultrashallow {{junctions}} {{are widely}} fabricated using Ge preamorphization prior to ultralow-energy boron implantation. However, for future technology nodes, issues arise when bulk silicon is supplanted by silicon-on-insulator (SOI). An {{understanding of the}} effect of the buried Si SiO 2 interface on defect evolution, electrical activation, and diffusion is needed in order to optimize the preamorphization technique. In the present study, boron has been implanted in germanium preamorphized silicon and SOI wafers with different preamorphizing implant conditions. Subsequent to implantation an isothermal annealing study of the samples was carried out. Electrical and structural properties were measured by Hall-effect and secondary-ion-mass spectroscopy techniques. The results show a variety of interesting effects. For the case where the Ge preamorphization end-of-range defects are close to the buried oxide interface, there is less <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> and less transient-enhanced diffusion, due to a lower interstitial gradient towards the surface. © 2006 American Vacuum Society...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> in pure Si {{and pure}} Ge {{nanowires}} (NWs) can compromise {{the efficiency of}} the doping process at nanoscale. Quantum confinement, surface segregation and dielectric mismatch, in different ways, strongly reduce the carrier generation induced by intentional addition of dopants. This issue seems to be critical for the fabrication of high-quality electrical devices for various future applications, such as photovoltaics and nanoelectronics. By means of Density Functional Theory simulations, we show how this limit can be rode out in core-shell silicon/germanium NWs (SiGe NWs), playing on the particular energy band alignment that comes out at the Si/Ge interface. We demonstrate how, by choosing the appropriate doping configurations, it is possible to obtain a 1 -D electron or hole gas, which has not to be thermally activated and which can furnish carriers also at very low temperatures. Our findings suggest core-shell NWs as possible building blocks for highspeed electronic device and new generation solar cells...|$|E
40|$|We present {{electrical}} {{characterization of}} nickel monosilicide (NiSi) contacts formed on strained and unstrained silicon nanowires (NWs), which were fabricated by top-down processing of initially As(+) implanted and activated strained and unstrained silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. The resistivity of doped Si NWs and the contact resistivity of the NiSi to Si NW contacts are studied as {{functions of the}} As(+) ion implantation dose and the cross-sectional area of the wires. Strained silicon NWs show lower resistivity for all doping concentrations due to their enhanced electron mobility compared to the unstrained case. An increase in resistivity with decreasing {{cross section of the}} NWs was observed for all implantation doses. This is ascribed to the occurrence of <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation.</b> Comparing the silicidation of uniaxially tensile strained and unstrained Si NWs shows no difference in silicidation speed and in contact resistivity between NiSi/Si NW. Contact resistivities as low as 1. 2 x 10 (- 8) Omega cm(- 2) were obtained for NiSi contacts to both strained and unstrained Si NWs. Compared to planar contacts, the NiSi/Si NW contact resistivity is two orders of magnitude lower...|$|E
40|$|Microwave {{annealing}} of dopants in Si {{has been}} reported to produce highly activated junctions at temperatures far below those needed for comparable results using conventional thermal processes. However, the details of the kinetics and mechanisms for microwave annealing are far from well understood. In this paper, 20 -keV arsenic (As) and 15 -keV phosphorus (P) implants, in a dose range from 1 to 5 x 10 (15) ion/cm(2), were annealed by microwave methods at temperatures below 500 degrees. C. These junctions were characterized by profile studies with secondary ion mass spectrometry and spreading resistance profiling, sheet resistance with four-point probe, and extensive use of cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy to follow the regrowth of the as-implanted amorphous layers created by the implantation. The amorphous-layer regrowth was observed to be uneven in time, with relatively little amorphous/crystalline interface motion for less than 50 s, followed by rapid regrowth for longer times. Sheet resistance values continued to drop for anneal times after the regrowth process was complete, with some evidence of <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> for anneal times of 600 s...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{hydrogenation}} is {{an efficient}} method to passivate intergrain and intragrain defects of polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) solar cells. The hydrogenation experiments {{were carried out}} in hydrogen plasma generated in an electron cyclotron resonance system controlling different operating parameters such as microwave power (P (MW)), process time (t (H)) and hydrogenation temperature (T (H)) for a fixed hydrogen flux of 30 sccm. The hydrogenation of n(+) pp(+) pc-Si solar cells resulted in an improvement in the open-circuit voltage. The improvement was correlated with the <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> due {{to the formation of}} boron-hydrogen bonding. This was demonstrated from the changes in the doping level after hydrogenation of n(+) p diode structures made using single crystalline silicon as a reference material. It was found that deactivation of boron was more pronounced at high microwave plasma power, in good agreement with the high open-circuit voltage values obtained on pc-Si mesa cells. On the other hand, the effect of longer hydrogenation time and higher temperature resulted in a decrease of boron deactivation, while an increase in V (oc) with a tendency of saturation at high T (H) was observed. Reasons for such behavior were thoroughly explained. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the texture, morphology, {{diffusion}} and electrical (de-) activation of dopants in polycrystalline GeSi 1 and Si {{have been studied}} in detail. For gate doping B, BF, and As were used and thermal budgets were chosen to be com-patible with deep submicron CMOS processes. Diffusion of dopants is different for GeSi alloys, B diffuses significantly more slowly and As has a much faster diffusion in GeSi. For B doped samples both electrical activation and mobility are higher compared to poly-Si. Also for the first time, data of BF doped layers are presented, these show the same trend as the B doped samples but with an overall higher sheet resistance. For arsenic doping, activation and mobility are lower compared to poly-Si, resulting in a higher sheet resistance. The <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> due to long low temperature steps after the final activation anneal is also found to be quite different. Boron-doped GeSi samples show considerable reduced deactivation whereas arsenic shows a higher deactivation rate. The electrical properties are interpreted in terms of dif-ferent grain size, quality and properties of the grain boundaries, defects, dopant clustering, and segregation, and the solid solubility of the dopants...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{advances}} {{in the field of}} sensor design and improved base materials have pushed the radiation hardness of the current silicon detector technology to impressive performance. It should allow operation of the tracking systems of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments at nominal luminosity (1034 cm- 2 s- 1) for about 10 years. The current silicon detectors are unable to cope with such an environment. Silicon carbide (SiC), which has recently been recognized as potentially radiation hard, is now studied. In this work it was analyzed the effect of high energy neutron irradiation on 4 H-SiC particle detectors. Schottky and junction particle detectors were irradiated with 1 MeV neutrons up to fluence of 1016 cm- 2. It is well known that the degradation of the detectors with irradiation, independently of the structure used for their realization, is caused by lattice defects, like creation of point-like defect, <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation</b> and dead layer formation and that a crucial aspect for the understanding of the defect kinetics at a microscopic level is the correct identification of the crystal defects in terms of their electrical activity. In order to clarify the defect kinetic it were carried out a thermal transient spectroscopy (DLTS and PICTS) analysis of different samples irradiated at increasing fluences. The defect evolution was correlated with the transport properties of the irradiated detector, always comparing with the un-irradiated one. The charge collection efficiency degradation of Schottky detectors induced by neutron irradiation was related to the increasing concentration of defects as function of the neutron fluence...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} summarises {{my research}} {{activities in the}} field of Ion Implantation-Induced extended defects and of their impact on the properties of Ultra-Shallow source/drain junctions (USJs) in miniaturized MOS transistors. The most common method for the fabrication of source/drain regions consists in the localized doping of the substrate material by ion implantation, followed by thermal annealing to achieve electrical activation. The major problem related to the use of ion implantation is the formation of various defect types resulting from the precipitation of the large amounts of interstitials and vacancies generated during the implantation process and their interaction with dopant atoms during annealing. The various complex interactions between the defects and the implanted dopants are at the origin of the diffusion and activation anomalies that represent the major obstacles to the fabrication of USJs satisfying the ITRS requirements. The main results of my work will be presented in three parts. The first part is dedicated to the fundamental studies on the formation and evolution of implant-induced defects and on their impact on transient enhanced diffusion (TED). These studies contributed (i) to provide a unified description of implantation-induced defect evolution, explaining why, depending on the implant and annealing conditions, a given defect type is formed, dissolves during annealing or transforms into a larger defect with different crystallographic characteristics and (ii) to improve the existing models by extending them to all defect families, including a correct TED dependence on the defects' size distributions. In the second part, I will focus on the defect-dopant interactions causing dopant activation anomalies, due to their impact on the active dose and is some cases, also on the carrier mobility. In the case of p+-n junctions formed by Boron implantation, these anomalies are due to the formation of small Boron-Interstitial Clusters (BICs), which will be at the centre of all the studies presented in this part. Other investigated defect-dopant interactions include the formation of Fluorine-related Si interstitial traps, used to reduce both B Transient Enhanced Diffusion and <b>dopant</b> <b>deactivation,</b> and the dopant trapping by implantation-induced defects. The progressive introduction of advanced processes and materials in the semiconductor industry during the last decade raised some specific questions related to the fabrication of USJs, including the formation of implant-induced defects during ultra-fast annealing, their evolution {{in the presence of the}} buried Si-SIO 2 interface in SOI materials or the Boron activation stability in Germanium. We will address these issues in the third part of this presentation. Due to the increased difficulties to maintain the MOS miniaturization pace (as well as to the approaching of its physical limits), the general context of the MOS-related research domain has largely evolved over the last years. On the one hand, the continuous optimisation of advanced doping and annealing schemes for the fabrication of USJs will therefore have to deal with the increasingly important requirement of reducing power consumption in future device generations. On the other hand, the years 2000 s have seen the emergence of the so-called "More-than-More" domain, consisting in the addition of novel functionalities to electronic devices based on (or derived from) Silicon MOS technology. The perspectives of my research activity within this "extended-CMOS" context will finally be presented at the end of the presentation...|$|E
