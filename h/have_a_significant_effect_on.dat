5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{may involve}} exploiting {{opportunities to make}} accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.|$|E
5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, {{the size and shape of}} their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E

Experiment occurred during two lactation periods and 35 ewes were included in experiment in 2009 and 45 ewes in 2010. Milk records and samplings were carried out five times during milking period from May to September. Individual milk samples were analyzed for: total solids (TS), fat (F), protein (P), casein (CN), whey protein (WP), lactose (L). In addition the samples from 20 ewes were analyzed for: pH, titratable acidity (TA), rennet clotting time (RCT), rennet curd quality (RCQ), somatic cell count (SCC) and urea (U). In the study the effects of lactation stage, parity, litter size and month of lambing on chosen parameters were evaluated, as well as their interactions with LS. In 2009 the lactation stage <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> on daily milk yield (DMY), milk composition, pH and titratable acidity.

25|$|Any chord can be denoted using staff notation, showing {{not only}} its {{harmonic}} characteristics {{but also its}} exact voicing.
