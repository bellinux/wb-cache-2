5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While <b>indometacin</b> has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indometacin</b> is {{a potent}} drug with many serious side effects {{and should not be}} {{considered}} an analgesic for minor aches and pains or fever. The medication is better described as an anti-inflammatory, rather than an analgesic. <b>Indometacin</b> can also affect warfarin and subsequently raise INR.|$|E
25|$|Many NSAIDs, but {{particularly}} <b>indometacin,</b> cause lithium retention by reducing its excretion by the kidneys. Thus <b>indometacin</b> users have an elevated risk of lithium toxicity. For patients taking lithium (e.g. {{for treatment of}} depression or bipolar disorder), less toxic NSAIDs such as sulindac or aspirin are preferred.|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of peptic ulcers, <b>indometacin</b> should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of <b>indometacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Indometacin</b> {{has also}} been used {{clinically}} to delay premature labor, reduce amniotic fluid in polyhydramnios, and to close patent ductus arteriosus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indometacin</b> {{has a high}} acute {{toxicity}} both for animals (in rats, 12mg/kg) and for humans. Exact human data does not exist, but some fatal human cases, particularly in children and adolescents, have been seen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indometacin</b> readily {{crosses the}} {{placenta}} and can reduce fetal urine production to treat polyhydramnios. It does so by reducing {{renal blood flow}} and increasing renal vascular resistance, possibly by enhancing the effects of vasopressin on the fetal kidneys.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandins {{also cause}} uterine contractions in {{pregnant}} women. <b>Indometacin</b> {{is an effective}} tocolytic agent, able to delay premature labor by reducing uterine contractions through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the uterus and possibly through calcium channel blockade.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indometacin</b> {{was created}} in 1963 and it was first {{approved}} {{for use in the}} U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965. Its mechanism of action, along with several other NSAIDs that inhibit COX, was described in 1971.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indometacin</b> is a nonselective {{inhibitor}} of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, {{enzymes that}} participate in prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins are hormone-like molecules normally {{found in the}} body, {{where they have a}} wide variety of effects, some of which lead to pain, fever, and inflammation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indometacin,</b> or indomethacin, is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{commonly used}} as a prescription medication to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling from inflammation. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, endogenous signaling molecules known to cause these symptoms. It does this by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of prostaglandins.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequency}} {{and severity of}} side effects {{and the availability of}} better tolerated alternatives make <b>indometacin</b> today a drug of second choice. Its use in acute gout attacks and in dysmenorrhea is well-established because in these indications the duration of treatment is limited to a few days only, therefore serious side effects are not likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|Paradoxically yet uncommonly, <b>indometacin</b> {{can cause}} {{headache}} (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including angioedema, sweating, severe hypotension and tachycardia {{as well as}} acute bronchospasm), severe or lethal hepatitis and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and photosensitivity are also possible side effects.|$|E
25|$|People should undergo regular {{physical}} examination to detect edema {{and signs of}} central nervous side effects. Blood pressure checks will reveal development of hypertension. Periodic serum electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) measurements, complete blood cell counts and assessment of liver enzymes {{as well as of}} creatinine (renal function) should be performed. This is particularly important if <b>Indometacin</b> is given together with an ACE inhibitor or with potassium-sparing diuretics, because these combinations can lead to hyperkalemia and/or serious kidney failure. No examinations are necessary if only the topical preparations (spray or gel) are applied.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{adverse effects}} seen with <b>indometacin</b> {{are similar to}} all other NSAIDs. For instance, [...] <b>indometacin</b> {{inhibits}} both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, which then inhibits the production of prostaglandins in the stomach and intestines responsible for maintaining the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Indometacin,</b> therefore, like other non-selective COX inhibitors can cause peptic ulcers. These ulcers can result in serious bleeding and/or perforation requiring hospitalization of the patient.|$|E

2500|$|Indometacin's role in {{treating}} certain headaches is unique {{compared to other}} NSAIDs. In addition to the class effect of COX inhibition, {{there is evidence that}} <b>indometacin</b> has the ability to alter cerebral blood flow not only through modulation of nitric oxide pathways but also via intracranial precapillary vasoconstriction. This may be responsible for the remarkable efficacy in a group of headaches that is referred to as [...] "indometacin-responsive headaches", such as idiopathic stabbing headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicranial, and exertional headaches.|$|E
2500|$|Building {{on those}} results, {{scientists}} started focusing on selective COX-2 inhibitors. Enormous effort {{was spent on}} the development of NSAIDs between the 1960s and 1980 so there were numerous pharmacophores to test when COX-2 was discovered. Early efforts focused on modification on two lead compounds, DuP-697 and NS-398. These compounds differ greatly from NSAIDs that are arylalkonic acid analogs. Encouraged by the [...] "concept testing" [...] experiments with selective inhibitors, and armed with several solid leads and clear idea {{of the nature of the}} binding site, development of this field was rapid. In vitro recombinant enzyme assays provided powerful means for assessing COX selectivity and potency and led to the discovery and clinical development of the first rationally designed COX-2 selective inhibitor, celecoxib. Efforts have been made to convert NSAIDs into selective COX-2 inhibitors such as <b>indometacin</b> by lengthening of the alkylcarboxylic acid side-chain, but none have been marketed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indometacin</b> {{farnesil}} (INN) is a prodrug of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) <b>indometacin,</b> {{designed to}} reduce the occurrence of side-effects by esterification of the carboxyl group on <b>indometacin</b> with farnesol. <b>Indometacin</b> farnesil was first approved in Japan in 1991, and is available in Japan and Indonesia, under the trade names Infree and Dialon, respectively.|$|E
