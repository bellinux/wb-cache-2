This framework is employed to guide the burn-in planning for an electronic device subject to both a degradation- threshold failure, which is an infant mortality mode and can be modeled by a gamma process with random effect, and a catastrophic mode, which is normal and can be represented with a conventional reliability model. Three degradation-based burn-in models are built and the optimal cutoff degradation levels are derived. Their validity is demonstrated by an electronic device example.

Premature equipment failures greatly increase risk getting to space and working in space, slowing down the growth of commercial space tourism.

Accelerated aging was documented preceding GPS satellite atomic clock failures during the 10 years of the GPS Block I test and evaluation phase. Prognostic technology leverages the presence of accelerated aging to identify equipment that will fail.

Flip chip assemblies {{with the use}} of bump interconnections are frequently used, especially in high density, three-dimensional electronic devices. Currently there are many methods for interconnect bumping, all of which require UBM. The UBM is required for interconnection, diffusion resistance and quality electrical contact between substrate and device. Bonded silicon test vehicles were comprised of Indium bumps and three UBM compositions: Ti/Ni/Au (200 Å/ 1000 Å/ 500 Å), Ti/Ni (200 Å/ 1000 Å), Ni (1000 Å). UBM and indium were deposited by evaporation and exposed to unbiased accelerated temperature cycling(- 55 °C to 125 °C, 15 °C/min ramp rate). Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations were used to gain understanding of non-linear strain behavior of indium interconnects during temperature cycling. Experimental testing coupled with FEA simulations facilitated cycle-to-failure calculations. FEA results show plastic strain concentrations within indium bump below failure limits. It has been demonstrated that fabrication of Ti/Ni/Au, Ti/Ni, and Ni UBM stacks performed reliably within <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>failure</b> region.

The same analog telemetry generated and analyzed during ATP {{used to measure}} and confirm equipment performance per the procurement contract can serve both purposes. Since the NGRSB payload lift requirement {{is the same as}} the EELV, the need for exotic combinations of reusable and throwaway components is unnecessary unless they yield new level of reliability, maintainability and supportability. A prognostics and health management (PHM) program exploits the presence of non-repeatable transient events (NRTE) (a. k. a. accelerated aging) that is missed during any engineering analysis in equipment analog telemetry to calculate equipment remaining usable life/mission life. Without an invasive physical measurement of equipment usable life, satellite and launch vehicle equipment reliability is dominated by premature equipment failures. If the Air Force continues to calculate NGRSB equipment mission life on paper, the NGRSB equipment reliability will also be dominated by infant mortality failures just as all expendable launch vehicle equipment is. The Air Force's, Markov-based reliability paradigm used to procure Air Force satellites and launch vehicles, results in space mission <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>failure</b> rate as high as 25 %/year. According to the Aerospace Corporation, Air Force space vehicle equipment that passes both equipment level and vehicle level ATP has a 70 % likelihood of failing prematurely within 45 days after arriving in space.

40|$|Burn-in is a {{manufacturing}} process applied to products to eliminate early {{failures in the}} factory before the products reach the customers. Various methods have been proposed for determining an optimal burn-in time of a non-repairable system or a repairable series system, assuming that system burn-in improves all components in the system. In this paper, we establish the trade-off between the component reliabilities during system burn-in and develop an optimal burn-in time for repairable non-series systems to maximize reliability. One impediment to expressing the reliability of a non-series system is in that successive failures during system burn-in cannot be described precisely because a failed component is not detected until the whole system fails. For approximating the successive failures of a non-series system during system burn-in, we considered two types of repair: minimal repair {{at the time of}} system failure, and repair at the time of component or connection failure. The two types of repair provide bounds on the optimal system burn-in time of non-series systems. <b>Failure</b> rate <b>Infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>failures</b> Minimal repair...|$|R

40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} {{made from}} highly-elastic intermetallic materials (HIM) s, such as 60 NiTi, are under development for applications that require superior corrosion and shock resistance. Compared to steel, intermetallics {{have been shown}} to have much lower rolling contact fatigue (RCF) stress capability in simplified 3 -ball on rod (ASTM STP 771) fatigue tests. In the 3 -ball tests, poor material quality and microstructural flaws negatively affect fatigue life but such relationships have not been established for full-scale 60 NiTi bearings. In this paper, 3 -ball-on-rod fatigue behavior of two quality grades of 60 NiTi are compared to the fatigue life of full-scale 50 mm bore ball bearings made from the same materials. 60 NiTi RCF rods with material or microstructural flaws suffered from <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>failures</b> at all tested stress levels while high quality 60 NiTi rods exhibited no failures at lower stress levels. Similarly, tests of full-scale bearings made from flawed materials exhibited early surface fatigue and through crack type failures while bearings made from high quality material did not fail even in long-term tests. Though the full-scale bearing test data is yet preliminary, the results suggest that the simplified RCF test is a good qualitative predictor of bearing performance.

The modern wind turbine system has a complex and repairable components due to sophistication and centralized control. The failure characteristics of the onshore wind turbines depend on the terrain conditions. In the main mountain pass and hill area, there is a heavy uncertainty in the wind that is due to the frequent change in the direction of wind and the change in the velocity. It causes a rapid failure in the individual sub assemblies. There is a substantial need for improving the reliability in the stages of design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance. Normally the <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>failures</b> are more in the onshore wind turbine and the failure rate is constant during normal operating period. It is a surprise that the failure rate has rapidly increased during normal operating period of the wind turbines placed exactly in the mountain pass and hilly area due to the high uncertainty in the wind. This paper deals with reliability analysis of major components of wind turbine system and its sub system such as rotor system, gear box, brake system, generator, hydraulic system and yaw system. This paper also investigates the reliability of wind turbines and its sub assemblies placed at Aramboly pass in India by using Weibull software as reliability tool for a grid connected 250 kW wind turbine.

Printed circuit boards were selected from these components for microstructural analysis of their solder joints. The analysis included a qualitative examination of the solder joints and quantitative assessments of (1) the thickness of the intermetallic compound layer that formed between the solder and circuit board Cu features, and (2) the Pb-rich phase particle distribution within the solder joint microstructure. The MC 2839 solder joints had very good workmanship qualities. The intermetallic compound layer stoichiometry was determined to be that of Cu 6 Sn 5. The mean intermetallic compound layer thickness for all solder joints was 0. 885 mm. The magnitude of these values did not indicate significant growth over the weapon lifetime. The size distribution of the Pb-rich phase particles for each of the joints were represented by the mean of 9. 85 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 6 } mm{sup 2 }. Assuming a spherical geometry, the mean particle diameter would be 3. 54 mm. The joint-to-joint difference of intermetallic compound layer thickness and Pb-rich particle size distribution was not caused by varying thermal environments, but rather, was a result of natural variations in the joint microstructure that probably existed at the time of manufacture. The microstructural evaluation of the through-hole solder joints form the MC 2839 and MC 1814 components indicated that the environmental conditions to which these electronic units were exposed in the stockpile, were benign regarding solder joint aging.

Early breastfeeding was one of suitable intervention that can significantly reduce <b>infant</b> <b>mortality.</b> The <b>failure</b> of early breastfeeding were caused by several factors such as {{lack of knowledge of}} mothers about the importance of early breastfeeding. Therefore, It required a good exposure of information about early breastfeeding to increase the mother's knowledge so it would be adequate and early breastfeeding could also be implemented. Objective Comparing the performance of early breastfeeding in pregnant women with high levels of knowledge about early breastfeeding and pregnant women with low levels of knowledge about early breastfeeding. Methods This was a prospective cohort study. A total of 56 samples of pregnant women with gestational age> 28 weeks of pregnancy that check on the health center Ngesrep and health center Halmahera during March-June 2012 and met the inclusion criteria and became sample in this study. Samples were divided into high-knowledge group (n = 28) and low-knowledge group (n = 28). All samples were filled out questionnaires and were interviewed after delivery. Data analysis was performed with the chi-square test for bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Result The level of knowledge has a significant relation with the implementation of the early breastfeeding with a significance of p= 0. 029 and an RR of 1. 615, which means that the rate of implementation of the early breastfeeding in the group with high knowledge levels 1. 6 times higher than those with low levels of knowledge.

Unfortunately, the very large size of these repositories renders them vulnerable to previously rare failure modes such as multiple, unrelated disk failures leading to data loss.

Our failure models incorporate the well-known “bathtub curve, ” which reflects the higher failure rates of new disk drives, a lower, constant failure rate during the remainder of the design life span, and increased failure rates as components wear out. Large systems are vulnerable to the “cohort effect” that occurs when many disks are simultaneously replaced by new disks. Our more accurate disk models and simulations have yielded predictions of system lifetimes that are more pessimistic than existing models that assume a constant disk failure rate. Thus, larger system scale requires designers to take disk <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> into account. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{trends in}} cohort <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> rates and adult heights in 39 developing countries since 1961. In most {{regions of the}} world improved nutrition, and reduced childhood exposure to disease, have lead to improvements in both <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> and adult stature. In Sub-Saharan Africa, however, despite declining <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> rates, adult heights have not increased. We argue that in Sub-Saharan Africa the decline in <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> may have been due to interventions that prevent infant deaths rather than improved nutrition and childhood morbidity. Despite declining <b>infant</b> <b>mortality,</b> Sub-Saharan Africa may not be experiencing increases in health human capital.

40|$|Social epidemiologists {{have found}} a {{relationship}} between poverty and <b>infant</b> <b>mortality.</b> Welfare policy experts have found that welfare benefits affect work effort, family structure, migration, {{and the rate of}} intergenerational transmission of welfare receipt. Social epidemiologists have paid little attention to the effects of poverty policies on <b>infant</b> <b>mortality.</b> Welfare policy experts have paid little attention to the effect of welfare on <b>infant</b> <b>mortality.</b> This paper merges the concerns of social epidemiologists and welfare policy experts by examining the relationship between welfare and <b>infant</b> <b>mortality.</b> The key finding is that welfare directly and indirectly affects <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> rates. States with higher welfare benefit levels also have lower <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> rates. The policy implications of this finding are discussed...|$|R
