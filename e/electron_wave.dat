5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|Bloch {{waves are}} {{important}} because of Bloch's theorem, which states that the energy eigenstates for an electron in a crystal can be written as Bloch waves. (More precisely, it states that the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> functions in a crystal have a basis consisting entirely of Bloch wave energy eigenstates.) This fact underlies the concept of electronic band structures.|$|E
25|$|But now {{suppose that}} the {{electrons}} in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed {{on one side of}} the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −eV added to it, where −e is the charge of the electron and V the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.|$|E

Here we report the direct imaging of {{magnetic focusing}} of <b>electron</b> <b>waves,</b> specifically in a {{two-dimensional electron gas}} (2 DEG). We see the semicircular trajectories of electrons as they bounce along a boundary in the 2 DEG, as well as fringes showing the coherent nature of the <b>electron</b> <b>waves.</b> Imaging flow in open systems is {{made possible by a}} cooled scanning probe microscope. Remarkable agreement between experiment and theory demonstrates our ability to see these trajectories and to use this system as an interferometer. We image branched electron flow as well as the interference of <b>electron</b> <b>waves.</b> This technique can visualize the motion of <b>electron</b> <b>waves</b> between two points in an open system, providing a straightforward way to study systems that may be useful for quantum information processing and spintronics...|$|R
40|$|Scanning {{tunneling}} spectroscopy (STS) on {{the system}} of isolated oxygen atoms adsorbed on the double layer of Fe on W(110) shows highly anisotropic spatial oscillations in the local density of states {{in the vicinity of}} the adsorbates. We explain this in terms of a single-particle model as <b>electron</b> <b>waves</b> being scattered by the potential induced by the presence of the oxygen atoms. Analysis of the wavelength of the standing <b>electron</b> <b>waves</b> and comparison with ab initio spin-resolved electronic structure calculations reveal that minority-spin bands of d-like symmetry are involved in the scattering process. By applying spin-polarized STS, we observe this standing wave pattern on one particular type of magnetic domain of Fe on W(110) only, thereby proving that the standing <b>electron</b> <b>waves</b> are highly spin polarized...|$|R
25|$|Imaging {{methods in}} TEM use the {{information}} contained in the electron waves exiting from the sample to form an image. The projector lenses allow for the correct positioning of this <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> distribution onto the viewing system. The observed intensity, I, of the image, assuming sufficiently high quality of imaging device, can be approximated as proportional to the time-averaged amplitude of the electron wavefunctions, where the wave that forms the exit beam is denoted by Ψ.|$|E
25|$|Electron {{diffraction}} is {{a collective}} scattering phenomenon with electrons being scattered by atoms {{in a regular}} crystal array. This can be understood in analogy to the Huygens principle for the diffraction of light. The incoming plane <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> interacts with the atoms, and secondary waves are generated which interfere with each other. In 1927, two Americans named Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer had proven de Broglie's theory by discovering electron diffraction. This confirmation of the wavelike nature of an electron was discovered independently of Englishman George Paget Thomson.|$|E
25|$|In quantum {{mechanics}} a particle, {{such as an}} electron, is also described as a wave. For example, if the double-slit experiment is performed with electrons, then a wave-like interference pattern is observed. The electron has the highest probability of being detected at locations where {{the parts of the}} wave passing through the two slits are in phase with one another, resulting in constructive interference. The frequency of the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> is related to the kinetic energy of an individual electron particle via the quantum-mechanical relation E = hf. If there are no electric or magnetic fields present in this experiment, then the electron's energy is constant, and, for example, there will be a high probability of detecting the electron along the central axis of the experiment, where by symmetry the two parts of the wave are in phase.|$|E

25|$|Different imaging methods {{therefore}} {{attempt to}} modify the electron waves exiting the sample {{in a way that}} provides information about the sample, or the beam itself. From the previous equation, it can be deduced that the observed image depends not only on the amplitude of beam, but also on the phase of the electrons, although phase effects may often be ignored at lower magnifications. Higher resolution imaging requires thinner samples and higher energies of incident electrons, which means that the sample can no longer be considered to be absorbing electrons (i.e., via a Beer's law effect). Instead, the sample can be modeled as an object that does not change the amplitude of the incoming <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> function, but instead modifies the phase of the incoming wave; in this model, the sample is known as a pure phase object. For sufficiently thin specimens, phase effects dominate the image, complicating analysis of the observed intensities. To improve the contrast in the image, the TEM may be operated at a slight defocus to enhance contrast, owing to convolution by the contrast transfer function of the TEM, which would normally decrease contrast if the sample was not a weak phase object.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} superactinides, the {{oxidation}} states should become lower. By element 132, the predominant most stable oxidation state {{will be only}} +6; this is further reduced to +3 and +4 by element 144, {{and at the end}} of the superactinide series it will be only +2 (and possibly even 0) because the 6f shell, which is being filled at that point, is deep inside the electron cloud and the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are bound too strongly to be chemically active. The 5g shell should be filled at element 144 and the 6f shell at around element 154, and at this region of the superactinides the 8p1/2 electrons are bound so strongly that they are no longer active chemically, so that only a few electrons can participate in chemical reactions. Calculations by Fricke et al. predict that at element 154, the 6f shell is full and there are no d- or other <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> functions outside the chemically inactive 8s and 8p1/2 shells. This would cause element 154 to be very unreactive, so that it may exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases.|$|E

25|$|In summary, gauge {{symmetry}} attains {{its full}} {{importance in the}} context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., quantum electrodynamics, gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic <b>waves</b> and <b>electron</b> <b>waves.</b> These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation θ is applied to the <b>electron</b> <b>waves,</b> for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves. Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a renormalizable theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically measurable quantities are finite.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} laser light {{has been used}} to control the motion of <b>electron</b> <b>waves.</b> <b>Electrons</b> can now be diffracted by {{standing}} waves of light.

Optical control of dispersion of the emitted <b>electron</b> <b>waves,</b> and optically controlled femto-second switches for ultrafast electron detection are proposed. The first steps towards electron accelerators and matter optics on-a-chip are now being taken. New research fields are driven by these new technologies. One example is the optical generation of electron pulses on-demand and quantum degenerate pulses. Another is the emerging development of interaction free electron microscopy. This review will focus on the field of free electron quantum optics with technologies at the interplay of lasers, <b>electron</b> matter <b>waves,</b> and nanostructures.

2500|$|Note that {{in these}} experiments, the only {{quantity}} that affects {{the result is the}} difference in phase between the two parts of the <b>electron</b> <b>wave.</b> Suppose we imagine the two parts of the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here. If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a fixed amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a varying amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's [...] "clock" [...] would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{approach}} in LEED calculations {{is to describe}} the scattering potential of the crystal by a [...] "muffin tin" [...] model, where the crystal potential can be imagined being divided up by non-overlapping spheres centered at each atom such that the potential has a spherically symmetric form inside the spheres and is constant everywhere else.

In 1955 G. Möllenstedt and H. Düker invented an electron biprism. thus enabling the recording of electron holograms in off-axis scheme. There are many different possible configurations for electron holography, with more than 20 documented in 1992 by Cowley.

2500|$|Atomic orbitals may {{be defined}} more {{precisely}} in formal quantum mechanical language. Specifically, in quantum mechanics, the state of an atom, i.e., an eigenstate of the atomic Hamiltonian, is approximated by an expansion (see configuration interaction expansion and basis set) into linear combinations of anti-symmetrized products (Slater determinants) of one-electron functions. The spatial components of these one-electron functions are called atomic orbitals. (When one considers also their spin component, one speaks of atomic spin orbitals.) [...] A state is actually {{a function of the}} coordinates of all the electrons, so that their motion is correlated, but this is often approximated by this independent-particle model of products of single <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> functions.
