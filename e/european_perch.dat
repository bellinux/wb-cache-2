5|$|The direct {{environmental}} and economic impacts of introduced C. mutica populations remain unknown. They provide valuable food sources for larger predators, particularly fish. In New Zealand, for example, they {{have become part of}} the diet of the native big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis). In Europe, wild and farmed fish like the common dab (Limanda limanda), <b>European</b> <b>perch</b> (Perca fluviatilis), and the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), consume large amounts of non-native C. mutica.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{species of fish}} in the park: Northern pike and <b>European</b> <b>perch</b> are the most common, others include grayling, common minnow, burbot, three-spined stickleback and the least common, brown trout. The trout came up Pasvikelven about 8000 BC. The other species arrived after the last glacial period from Lake Inari and {{ultimately}} from the ten fresh-water Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is quite}} {{popular in the}} lake. The most common species caught is the {{illegally}} introduced carp. Annual monitoring is carried out to determine fish populations. Almost equally as common are the introduced redfin <b>European</b> <b>perch,</b> with these being a regular by catch when fishing for golden perch. However, a number of less common species also inhabit the lake, including native Murray cod, western carp gudgeon and golden perch, as well as introduced goldfish, Gambusia, rainbow trout and brown trout.|$|E
50|$|Romanichthys valsanicola is a small, greyish-brown fish {{growing to}} about 10 - 12 cm long, covered with small, rough scales. It can be {{distinguished}} from other <b>European</b> <b>perches</b> by the two clearly separate dorsal fins, the first with eight or nine spines, the anal fin having 7½ branched rays and there being 58-68 scales along the lateral line.|$|R
50|$|Las Ovejas is {{a growing}} touristic spot, the major {{attraction}} to the area is based in Fishing in the lagoons few kilometers away from the town.The local fish species in the lagoon are silversides, <b>European</b> <b>perchs,</b> Rainbow Trouts, and Trouts.The Mirador de la Puntilla is a located 6 kilometers from the town, a 120 m gateway were tourists can see the Neuquén river, the Cordillera del Viento (Wind Mountain range) and the Domuyo volcano.|$|R
50|$|The {{river was}} an open sewer in the late 1990s. It now houses fish species such as brown trout, minnow, gudgeon, sculpin, stone loach, <b>European</b> chub and <b>perch.</b> It is again a first class stream.|$|R
5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, <b>European</b> <b>perch,</b> brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham {{is located}} where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing {{rights for the}} Millground and Chewton {{sections}} of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to Chub, Roach, <b>European</b> <b>perch</b> and Rudd, along with good numbers of Gudgeon, Dace and Trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir {{side of the island}} is also the mouth of the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-nine {{species of}} fresh water fish are {{recognized}} on the territory of peninsula, including trout, stickleback, northern pike, and <b>European</b> <b>perch.</b> The rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon, which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water. As a result of this, a recreational fishery has been developed, {{with a number of}} remote lodges and camps available to host sport-fishermen. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established in 1932 to protect the population of common eider, is organized in thirteen clusters located in the Kandalaksha Gulf of the Kola Peninsula and along the coasts of the Barents Sea.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major and}} {{historical}} {{activity in the}} gulf is fishing, especially on the northern coast near Vyborg, Primorsk and on the southern coast near Ust-Luga. Commercial fish species are herring, sprats, European smelt, whitefishes, carp bream, roaches, <b>perch,</b> <b>European</b> eel, lamprey and others. In 2005, the catchment was 2000 tons by the ships of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast alone.|$|R
40|$|Lactobacilli are Gram-positive and {{catalase}} negative rods {{commonly found}} in lactic acid fermented foods and in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. Few studies have described lactobacilli in freshwater fish. We analysed the presence of lactobacilli in the intestines of young and adult freshwater fish inhabiting a river environment and from fish reared in an aquaculture unit with a water recirculation system. Various species of lactobacilli were present in relatively high number in the intestines of edible fresh water fish from the river, especially in the warm season but in low numbers in the cold season. Lactobacilli were scarcely found in the intestines of edible farmed fish reared in a recirculation system in warm water. Lactobacilli are reported {{for the first time}} from the intestines of wild <b>European</b> eel, <b>perch,</b> rudd, ruffe, bleak, silver bream, chub, somnul and farmed African catfish. The two first fishes, and the last one are highly valuable species for fisheries and aquaculture. Additionally, improved methods for storage and bacteriological analysis of fish intestinal content are described. The natural presence of lactic acid bacteria in fish may be of great interest in producing fermented fish products worldwid...|$|R
5|$|The {{river was}} {{formerly}} a food source with yabbies, mussels and small fish, however {{the reduction in}} water quality, changing of the river's habitat, and introduction of European fish species {{has led to a}} reduction in fauna quantity and diversity. Exotic pest species such as the <b>European</b> carp, redfin <b>perch</b> and trout have greatly reduced native fish populations like the big headed gudgeon (Philypnodon grandiceps) but native waterfowl are common along the river with Pacific black ducks, Australian wood ducks, black swans, ibis, egrets and herons amongst the more than 100 species seen. The number of exotic waterfowl species such as mallards has reduced in recent years. In places the steep banks of the river are an ideal habitat for long-necked tortoises.|$|R
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like <b>European</b> <b>perch</b> and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} dish is the Risotto con Filetti di Pesce Persico {{or simply}} Risotto al Pesce Persico (<b>European</b> <b>Perch</b> filet Risotto), a fish grown in Lake Como, prepared with white wine, onion, butter and wheat.|$|E
25|$|The Donets hosts 44 {{species of}} fish, {{predominantly}} small fishes such as <b>European</b> <b>perch,</b> rutilus and common rudd. Medium and large species include bream, perch, catfish and pike and {{are becoming increasingly}} rare. Near Pechenga Reservoir a large hatchery of carp has successfully operated since 1967.|$|E
40|$|Finnish fish {{markets have}} {{traditionally}} been supplied by domestic wild fish species: Baltic herring, salmon and several freshwater species. Nowadays, farmed salmon and rainbow trout dominate the market and wild-caught species are moving to niche product segment. In this paper we examine the market integration of Finnish fish markets. We apply multivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) model to study interactions between farmed rainbow trout and wild caught <b>European</b> whitefish, pikeperch, <b>perch</b> and salmon. We found two cointegrated relations in the system. Firstly, European whitefish, pikeperch, and perch are close substitutes to each other. Secondly, we observed co-integration between wild-caught species and farmed rainbow trout. We also modelled the system in moving average form and identified three common stochastic trends, which drive the system. Two of these originate from wild fish species and one comes from farmed rainbow trout. This implies that in the Finnish market wild fish species {{compete with each other}} and the prices of these species are affected by farmed fish...|$|R
60|$|From {{the foot}} of the hill we rode for some {{distance}} along a wide valley, with water in several places, and a good deal of cultivated ground. Then, after three or four miles of undulating plain we arrived at our camping-ground at a little after three o’clock. The natives here must be either a more warlike people than those whose villages we have passed since entering the country, or they must have much more warlike neighbours. For the villages are almost always surrounded by strong walls, and one or two were perched on eminences, and defended by walls and towers. One very curious castle we passed strongly resembling the old baronial castles one meets with in southern Scotland and the north of England. This was situated upon the edge of a precipice, and the rocks went sheer down from three sides of its walls for fifty or sixty feet. It must be impregnable in a country like this, where cannon are all but unknown. Another fort, which certainly looked of European construction, and if not must unquestionably have been built from a picture of a <b>European</b> fort, was <b>perched</b> upon {{the top of the mountain}} near where we descended into the valley. The precipice at its foot was at least a thousand feet down, but curiously enough the fort was in a sort of hollow, higher rocks at the distance of only a hundred yards on either side commanding it. If a European designed it, he certainly did not choose its position. It was a round fort, of perhaps fifty feet high, but it was difficult to judge its height from our position on the plain so much below it. Its diameter was about equal to its height. It had regular lines of loopholes, and appeared to have been built by some robber-chief to enable him to swoop down upon the caravans of traders journeying up and down the road we had just come. This camp is at about the same elevation as that at Mai Wahiz, and the climate is even more charming than that of Attegrat, for the heat is less during the day, and the cold last night was not at all equal to that which we experienced there. The on dit is that the King cannot arrive to-day, but will come to-morrow, and that we shall move out early and pitch our camp upon a plain six miles from here, and there receive him properly.|$|R
40|$|This update {{considers}} the wider European region comprising the 43 countries {{that were the}} object of the more detailed 2010 review of aquaculture in Europe (Váradi et al., 2011) and in particular notes significant changes related to aquaculture in that region since 2010. Aquaculture production data have been obtained from FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, Fishery Information, Data and Statistics Unit. The most notable development in the period has been the continuing increase in the production of Atlantic salmon (by 43 percent for the period 2009 – 2014), mainly in the Kingdom of Norway but with significant increases also in the Faroe Islands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Russian Federation. Production technologies have undergone significant changes in this period with increasing use of very large scale Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) for the production of large smolts and in some cases for ongrowing fish to up to 1 kg in fresh water before transfer to sea cages. Despite the continuing increase in production, technical challenges remain, in particular the problem of sea lice infestation; the last five years have seen substantial commercial investment in the production and use of “cleaner fish” as biological controllers of lice numbers and in technology for other non-chemical treatment methods. The next five years are likely to see pilot trials of radical new production systems which are designed to minimise environmental impacts. The production of European seabass and gilthead seabream in cages in the Mediterranean Sea has increased, but the ongoing consequences of the global financial crisis of 2007 – 2009; and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis from the end of 2009 have to some extent limited growth in these sectors, particularly in the Hellenic Republic. However the Republic of Turkey, with its relatively fast-growing economy and non-EU status has been less constrained by the economic factors and has seen substantial increases in the production of both species. Throughout Europe there has been continued interest, innovation and investment in small-scale RAS for a variety of species for which strong local markets are perceived to exist (examples include sturgeon, shrimp, barramundi, zander, <b>European</b> sea bass, <b>perch</b> and tilapia). Detailed information is difficult to obtain but the scale of this activity may best be described as “pilot”. There has been a high failure rate in such projects, making short-term significant production growth from this sector unlikely. The prescribed length and remit for this update do not allow for a complete summary of the status of all aquaculture sectors throughout Europe; the terms of reference require a focus on areas of significant change in the last 5 years. So, whilst sectors such as the extensive and semi-extensive production of carp represents the finfish species with the third highest production in the region (238 thousand tonnes in 2014, mainly in the Russian Federation), on the basis of information available to the authors there do not appear to have been significant developments in that sector in the last five years. Consequently, the culture of these species does not feature prominently in this review...|$|R
25|$|The provincial fish is {{the brown}} trout which is found {{together}} with common whitefish, grayling, <b>European</b> <b>perch,</b> Arctic char, burbot, salmon and the carnivorous northern pike. Roughly 250 types of birds {{have been observed}} in Jämtland. The species presence greatly varies, in the fells bluethroat, long-tailed skua, Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, Lapland and snow bunting are found. The forested region is inhabited by species such as hazel hen, black grouse, capercaillie, Siberian jay, three-toed woodpecker and rustic bunting. Several different types of owls dwells in the province and the provincial owl is the northern hawk owl.|$|E
25|$|There are {{typically}} {{two types of}} vegetables in okroshka. The first must have a neutral taste, such as boiled potatoes, turnips, rutabagas, carrots, or fresh cucumbers. The second must be spicy, consisting of mainly green onion {{as well as other}} herbs—greens of dill, parsley, chervil, celery, or tarragon. Different meat and poultry can be used in the same soup. The most common ingredient is beef alone or with poultry. If it is made with fish, the best choice would be tench, <b>European</b> <b>perch,</b> pike-perch, cod, or other neutral-tasting fish.|$|E
25|$|Dozens {{of species}} of fish {{have been found in}} the middens. Some of the most common are pike, whitefish, cod and ling at Østenkaer, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and eel at Krabbesholm. The oldest site, Yderhede, {{featured}} remains of flatfish and sharks: porbeagle, topeshark, smoothhound and at Lystrup Enge spurdog. At Egsminde herring, cyprinids and <b>European</b> <b>perch</b> were found. The presence of deep-sea fish and sharks probably indicates the Ertebølle fishermen often ventured out on deep water. Whether they did so in their marshland dugouts or also owned larger, ocean-going ones is an answer that waits for more evidence.|$|E
25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, <b>European</b> <b>perch</b> and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. Less commons species include burbot, grayling and brown trout. Five thousand trouts are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a large trout population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommon fish species include European river lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow. Vendace is an introduced species in Lake Inari and has spread to the reserve.|$|E
25|$|The Karelian Isthmus is {{a popular}} place for hiking, cycling, skiing (Korobitsyno and Kavgolovo), {{climbing}} (near Kuznechnoye), canoeing (Losevo), fishing for consumption (of carp bream, northern pike, roach, <b>European</b> <b>perch,</b> ruffe, burbot and others), mushroom hunting (for porcini, red-capped scaber stalk, birch bolete, velvet bolete, slippery Jack, golden chanterelle, Lactarius resimus, woolly milk-cap, ugly milk-cap, saffron milk-cap, Lactarius rufus, various Russulas and others), berry picking (of bilberry, raspberry, woodland strawberry, cowberry, cranberry, cloudberry, bog bilberry and stone bramble). It {{is a popular}} summer resort for Saint Petersburg citizens since the late 19th century, served by trains of Finlyandsky Rail Terminal. The isthmus, especially the land along Saint Petersburg–Vyborg and Saint Petersburg–Priozersk railroads, hosts numerous dachas.|$|E
25|$|The {{waters of}} the park are among Sweden's richest, which can be {{explained}} by a great number of factors, such as their optimal acidity, a great richness of nutrients, or even, among other things, the zones of rapids alternating with calmer zones. These waters permit the park have not only a great number of species, but also a great number of individual fish and certain fish of enormous size. Among the species present, one can name several species of cyprinids (the family of carp, minnows, barbs, barbels, and others), of which in particular the asp, rare in Sweden. The waters abound also with northern pike, with specimens weighing sometimes , with <b>European</b> <b>perch,</b> with zander, and with grayling — which species is classified as endangered in Sweden, much like the brown trout. The Atlantic salmon was also present in the park's waters, but the dams downstream have considerably reduced its possibilities of rejoining the park. The noble crayfish, a species endangered worldwide, was relatively common in the {{waters of the}} Dalälven, but has now almost disappeared; some catches in the park are however reported from time to time.|$|E
