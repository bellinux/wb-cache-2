25|$|Rabbi Henoch, as {{he became}} affectionately known, was {{released}} {{just in time}} to escape WWII Europe by catching the very last ship bound for the British Mandate of Palestine. Accompanied by his wife and children he arrived at the port after its departure and was forced to chase the vessel with a small craft to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The potential dangers of staying in Vienna had been so acute that he was advised by the Rabbi of Altstadt that he should even desecrate the Shabbat if necessary to help him leave, as remaining in Europe would be classed as pikuach nefesh.|$|E

25|$|As {{a kind of}} benefit, {{overseas}} {{civil servants}} in Hong Kong were entitled to a free exclusive sea passage when they retired. Norman-Walker was eligible and chose to enjoy the benefit when he left Hong Kong on 30 September 1973. He was supposed to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> an ocean liner like his counterparts, {{but it turned out}} that there was no ocean liner calling at Hong Kong {{at the time of his}} departure. As a result, he was forced to enjoy the entitlement on a cargo ship. On his departure, in the presence of the members of the Executive and Legislative Councils and senior government officials, Norman-Walker boarded Lady Maurine from HMS Tamar and travelled across the Victoria Harbour to the Kowloon side. From there he travelled to Kwai Chung Container Port and boarded the cargo ship, which sailed for Britain.|$|E

The bulk of Cao Cao's troops had already crossed the river, leaving Cao and his Tiger Warriors to bring up the rear. Just then, Ma Chao and his 10,000 horsemen caught up with them. As the enemies were approaching fast, Cao Cao's soldiers rushed to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the ferry, which was on the verge of sinking under the weight. Xu Chu held up a saddle with his left hand to shield Cao Cao from arrows and carried a sword in his right hand, using it to slash enemy soldiers trying to clamber onto the vessel. By then, the boatman had been killed by arrows, so Xu Chu, still holding up the saddle with his left hand, used his other hand to grab a bargepole and push the ferry away from the ford to safety.|$|E
500|$|... "Fresh Blood" [...] {{featured}} the final guest appearance by Sterling K. Brown as the vampire hunter Gordon Walker. The character's story arc {{for the season}} {{was intended to be}} longer, but Brown's commitments to the Lifetime Television series Army Wives limited his return to only two appearances. The episode was [...] "really hard" [...] for the actor; though he was fine with the character dying, the idea of Gordon turning an innocent girl into a vampire was [...] "horrific" [...] to him. Although Gordon's actions in previous episodes were questionable, Brown had always believed the character to be [...] "ultimately good". On this change, Brown commented, [...] "His endgame is to kill Sam, and anyone else who has to experience detrimental effects because of that is not a concern of his. That was tough for me to process and <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> with." [...] However, series creator Eric Kripke reasoned that the character was now a monster and should follow his instincts instead of logic. The writer of [...] "Fresh Blood", Sera Gamble, also penned Gordon's initial episode and helped Kripke conceptualize the character. She felt that she [...] "lucked out" [...] in being able to write the character's final appearance, and found there to be [...] "something so satisfying about turning him into a vampire and chopping his head off with a razor wire".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the months}} before the {{resumption}} of war with France, the Navy started preparations that included impressing seamen. The crews of outbound Indiamen were an attractive target. Woodford and [...] {{were sitting in the}} Thames in March 1803, taking their crews on board just prior to sailing. At sunset, a press gang from HMS Immortalite rowed up to Woodford, while boats from [...] and [...] approached Ganges. As the press gangs approached they were noticed, and the crews of both Indiamen were piped to quarters. That is, they assembled on the decks armed with pikes and cutlasses, and anything they could throw. The officers in charge of the press gangs thought this mere bravado and pulled alongside the Indiamen, only to meet a severe resistance from the crewmen, who had absolutely no desire to serve in the Royal Navy. The men from Immortalite suffered several injuries from shot and pike that were thrown at them, and eventually the marines opened fire with muskets, killing two sailors on Woodford. Even so, the press gangs were not able to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> either Indiaman, and eventually withdrew some distance. When Woodfords officers finally permitted the press gang from Immortalite to board, all they found on board were a few sickly sailors.|$|E

2500|$|The fourth {{volume of}} the handbook: Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area (known as BMP4) is the current {{authoritative}} guide for merchant ships on self-defense against pirates. The guide is issued and updated by Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF), a consortium of interested international shipping and trading organizations including the EU, NATO and the International Maritime Bureau. It is distributed primarily by the Maritime Security Centre – Horn of Africa (MSCHOA), the planning and coordination authority for EU naval forces (EUNAVFOR). BMP4 encourages vessels to register their voyages through the region with MSCHOA as this registration is {{a key component of}} the operation of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC, the navy-patrolled route through the Gulf of Aden). BMP4 contains a chapter entitled [...] "Self-Protective Measures" [...] which lays out a list of steps a merchant vessel can take on its own to make itself less of a target to pirates and make it better able to repel an attack if one occurs. This list includes [...] rigging the deck of the ship with razor wire, rigging fire-hoses to spray sea-water {{over the side of the}} ship (to hinder boardings), having a distinctive pirate alarm, hardening the bridge against gunfire and creating a [...] "citadel" [...] where the crew can retreat in the event pirates <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> Other unofficial self-defense measures that can be found on merchant vessels include the setting up of mannequins posing as armed guards or firing flares at the pirates.|$|E
