40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of neural control of human balance, {{and in particular}} upright stance, are still not fully understood. Most authors understand balance to be controlled through relatively simple reflex mechanisms, but some groups propose balance is dominated by <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>control.</b> I develop new semi-automatic techniques which can follow very small changes in muscle length via ultrasonography. I use this technique to uncover a high sensitivity control mechanism in human standing that is more consistent with reflex than <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>control.</b> Further experiments suggest reflex control is present, albeit at a low gain, in a balance control task {{that is similar to}} standing, but that <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms dominate. A final investigation into visuo-manual balance suggests that control alternates between actions and sensation which facilitates higher quality sensory feedback. I hypothesise that balance is maintained by parallel neural pathways. Reflex control operates at low gain to increase the time constant of the human inverted pendulum. This facilitates the operation of a <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> controller that is subject to longer time delays. I speculate that <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> serial ballistic <b>control</b> may enable higher quality feedback than would be possible otherwise. ...|$|R

The condition of the system is monitored and controlled by connecting specialised GUIs to the specified database entries.

About 35,000 of these are permanently archived at intervals ranging from milliseconds to minutes. Some <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>control</b> of the physics-related parameters of the beam is provided through MATLAB which also provides data analysis tools and an interface with a computerised model of the accelerator.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical controller that carries out the angular velocity trajectory tracking task for a DC motor {{driven by a}} DC/DC Buck converter. The <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>control</b> {{is related to the}} DC motor and the low level control is dedicated to the DC/DC Buck converter; both controls are designed via differential flatness. The <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>control</b> provides a desired voltage profile for the DC motor to achieve the tracking of a desired angular velocity trajectory. Then, a low level control is designed to ensure that the output voltage of the DC/DC Buck converter tracks the voltage profile imposed by the <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>control.</b> In order to experimentally verify the hierarchical controller performance, a DS 1104 electronic board from dSPACE and Matlab-Simulink are used. The switched implementation of the hierarchical average controller is accomplished by means of pulse width modulation. Experimental results of the hierarchical controller for the velocity trajectory tracking task show good performance and robustness against the uncertainties associated with different system parameters...|$|E

40|$|The oculomotor {{control system}} is usually modeled, in {{fixation}} and tracking tasks, as a unity {{negative feedback loop}} (Fig. 1); we call this internal loop "the primary visual feedback loop". This model does not explain however some eye tracking characteristics such as prediction phenomena in tracking a periodic target (2], step-ramp responses [3] or adaptive performance exhibited in large negative feedback experiments [4]. Furthermore, this simple automatic servo cannot account,for eye tracking of non-visual stimuli and, clearly, analysis of more complicated tasks calls for models with <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>control</b> (3]. EXperiments implementing secondary visual feedback (2 VFB) suggest [5, 6] that the human controller can select one of two distinct strategies in executing a tracking or fixation task; in the first, there is a sensory dependent control aiming at error elimination, whereas in the second there is a switchover to <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>control.</b> 'In the latter there is not necessarily elimination of an error, although here too the sensory signal can be utilized by the observer.

Contrary to hypothesis 1, no difference in workaholism was found across the three career stages: establishment, advancement, and maintenance. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were not supported, as workaholism levels did not differ between the Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y. However, additional results revealed differences on the control measure of the WART, as those in the establishment and advancement career stages had <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>control</b> than the maintenance stage and Generation Y had <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>control</b> compared to the Baby Boomer generation.

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) {{will be the}} world's most {{powerful}} accelerator when it is commissioned during 2008. To operate the LHC, injection of very high intensity beams from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) pre-accelerator is required. With intensities of more than 3 _ 1013 p=cycle, {{it is essential that}} there is virtually no beam halo present. Such particles can hit the LHC beam pipe, and may cause magnet quenches due to heating. Fast scrapers have been installed in the SPS to measure and remove any halo before the beam is extracted towards the LHC. Fast scrapers have been chosen because there is too little time available for beam cleaning with large collimators. The scraper hardware has been in place in the SPS ring for several years. A low level computer for controlling the scrapers is also in place. A <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>control</b> application was, however, not written at the time. The development of the missing <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>control</b> application {{is the subject of this}} work.
