25|$|Michael Waltrip {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Bill Davis Racing in 2006 as Davis was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> to Toyota in 2007, which was the selected manufacturer for Waltrip's new team as well. This enabled Waltrip to have a car to drive as he built his team. NAPA Auto Parts, Waltrip's sponsor, followed him to his new team and Waltrip ran a Dodge Charger for 2006. The team bought points from Penske Racing's No. 77 team, which shut down after it lost sponsorship. Since the listed owner of the No. 77 was Doug Bawel, whose Jasper Motorsports team was absorbed by Penske a few years earlier, his name was registered as owner and the No. 55 ran under the Waltrip-Jasper Racing banner for 2006. The arrangement called for the points {{to be transferred to}} Waltrip's new ride at MWR for 2007, which they were, however Waltrip failed to make the top-35 in points, which meant Waltrip would have to qualify on time in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Holtz's {{first job}} at {{his alma mater}} was to serve as wide {{receivers}} coach, and he filled the position for two years. In 1992, the team began {{a search for a}} new offensive coordinator. Lou's first choice, Joe Moore, declined. Lou then asked Skip for recommendations to fill the position. Skip initially said he wanted the position but said of Lou, [...] "he couldn't do it at that time with me [...] being his son." [...] Skip then mentioned Mark Richt, who was then the offensive coordinator at Florida State. Lou Holtz called Coach Bowden to ask permission to speak to Mark Richt. Coach Bowden said Holtz could hire Richt {{as long as he could}} hire Skip. Coach Holtz said, [...] "Well, if I'm just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> coaches, I might as well hire Skip." [...] Skip became Notre Dame's offensive coordinator in 1992. Between 1992 and 1994, Skip and his father recorded 40 wins, eight losses, and one tie, an 82.7% winning percentage. Together, they coached Notre Dame to the Cotton Bowl Classic twice, beating Texas A both times. Skip had the third-best total offense in the NCAA during the 1992 football season.|$|E

He nearly merged his team with the Oklahoma Outlaws. However, talks collapsed when Outlaws owner William Tatham demanded that his son, Bill Jr., be given control over the merged team's football operations.|$|R

The switching techniques specify that when and hold internal switches are regulated until they connect routers input to their outputs and {{which one of the}} packets must be transferred along the route during a special time. The switching techniques are placed next to flow control mechanisms till information units sending among the routers become simultaneous and harmonic and finally these information units can be forwarded along the network. The flow control mechanisms should be also placed next to the buffer management algorithms to define how the buffer request and become free and then it is revealed that how the packets should be managed the are blocked in the network.

50|$|The {{switches}} have {{an integrated}} time-domain reflectometer (TDR) built into every copper port, providing {{the ability to}} accomplish diagnostic monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities of the connected cables. This allows the equipment manager the ability to test and troubleshoot the cables for defects (crimped, cut, shorted or damaged cables) without <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> the <b>switch</b> room <b>to</b> test the cables from the <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> the end equipment. The tests can be accomplished on a single port or on multiple ports at the same time. The test can be accomplished through the command line or through one of several Graphical user interfaces called Device Manager (DM), Java Device Manager (JDM) or Enterprise Device Manager (EDM).|$|R
2500|$|Ai, who {{described}} herself as half 1/2 Japanese, 1/8 Choctaw-Chickasaw,1/4 Black,1/16 Irish, and Southern Cheyenne, and Comanche, {{was born in}} Albany, Texas in 1947, and {{she grew up in}} Tucson, Arizona. She was also raised in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, with her mother and second stepfather, Sutton Haynes. In 1959, a couple of years after her mother's divorce from Hayes, they moved back to Tucson, Arizona where she completed high school and attended college at the University of Arizona, where she majored in English and Oriental Studies with a concentration in Japanese and a minor in Creative Writing, to which she would fully commit toward the end of her degree. Before starting college, one night during dinner with her mother and third stepfather, Ai learned her biological father was Japanese. Known as Florence Hayes throughout her childhood and undergrad years, it was not until graduate school, when Ai was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> her last name back to Anthony that her mother finally told her more details about her past, learning that she had an affair with a Japanese man, Michael Ogawa, after meeting him at a streetcar stop. Learning of the affair had led Ai's first stepfather, whose last name was [...] "Anthony," [...] to beat her mother until family intervened and she was taken to Texas, where her stepfather eventually followed after Ai's birth. Because her mother was still legally married to Anthony at the time, his last name was put on Ai's birth certificate.|$|E

In September 2016, Greg Berlanti, creator and executive producer on all four series, clarified that the crossover event would only officially involve The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow, though the event starts {{at the very end of}} the Supergirl episode [...] "Medusa", with Barry and Cisco Ramon arriving on Supergirl's Earth to recruit her. Andrew Kreisberg, executive producer on Arrow, The Flash and Supergirl, spoke more on why the crossover did not include Supergirl, saying that since [...] "Medusa" [...] also served as the mid-season finale for Supergirl, and the other three series have theirs in a subsequent episode after the crossover, [...] "We wanted to make sure that [...] spoke to what had been happening on the first seven episodes of Supergirl and not just as a tie in." [...] He added that, logistically, it would have been very difficult to incorporate the four series, also noting that finding the time for Melissa Benoist to shoot material for the other three series had its own complications, noting, [...] "Hopefully people didn't realize it, but Kara was not in a lot of episode 7 of Supergirl... specifically to free her up for five days so that she could appear in all these other episodes." [...] He expanded on these difficulties stating, [...] "The thing that we didn’t really plan on — because we weren’t aware that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> Supergirl from CBS to CW and it was really going to be part of it — that was the one show that didn't have built-in shut-down days, so all the other ones did...

40|$|On the {{assumption}} that allowable stress design method is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> over <b>to</b> limit state design method for port and offshore structures in Japan, two of the authors have already studied the load factors of seismic loads based on reliability theory. However, since base rock accelerations were reconsidered because of the accumulation of earthquake records and the seismic zoning in Japan for design horizontal seismic coefficients was also changed, it has been required to newly recalculate the load factors of seismic loads. Accordingly, the authors reexamined the load factors of seismic loads in this study as follows: Firstly, the probability distributions of maximum values of horizontal seismic coefficients within the service life of structures were calculated by using the most up-to-date maximum base rock accelerations. Secondly, the probabilities of failure of gravity-type quay walls to obtain the accurate target safety indices for port structures were estimated based on the material on the damaged gravity-type quay walls in ports. Finally, the load factors of seismic loads were obtained for the revised new seismic zoning in Japan by using the target safety indices and probability distributions of the maximum horizontal seismic coefficients...|$|R

A crucial Russian mistake was sending too few troops initially; the Danube was crossed in June by an expeditionary force of about 185,000, which was slightly less than the combined Turkish forces in the Balkans (about 200,000). After setbacks in July (at Pleven and Stara Zagora), the Russian military command realized {{it did not have}} the reserves to keep the offensive <b>going</b> and <b>switched</b> <b>to</b> a defensive posture.
