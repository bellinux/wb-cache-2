5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> it precisely.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Foreign Ministry {{said that}} a team {{including}} Attorney-General Lucien Wong, and Chan Sek Keong, S. Jayakumar and Tommy Koh (who had represented Singapore at the original ICJ hearing), had been appointed to study {{and respond to the}} claim. On 5 February 2017, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam commented that on a cursory examination of the documents without detailed legal advice, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> how the documents would make any difference to the ICJ's judgment.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} {{joining the}} Western Interprovincial Football Union (now Canadian Football League), Pollard reported {{being given a}} good deal of propaganda to turn him away. He was picked up by the British Columbia Lions of the WIFU, with whom he played for until 1956. Pollard then played a single season for the Calgary Stampeders in 1957. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> much action with the Stampeders and ended his career due to health problems.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt altered {{his story}} later on, telling John H. Flood that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Brocius's pistol {{on the ground}} in the dark until afterward. The pistol {{contained}} one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. Virgil and Wyatt escorted Brocius to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting.|$|E
5|$|After he was honorably {{discharged}} in 1946, O'Neill {{studied for}} an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics at Swarthmore College. As a child he had discussed {{the possibilities of}} humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> space science as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics. In 1950 he graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at Cornell University {{with the help of}} an Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics in 1954.|$|E
5|$|British Army Captain Walker goes missing {{during an}} {{expedition}} and is believed dead ("Overture"). His widow, Mrs. Walker, {{gives birth to}} their son, Tommy ("It's a Boy"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> or hear the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind {{to the outside world}} ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E

5|$|Edward Robinson {{visited in}} 1838, {{and noted that}} the khan, which Maundrell commented on, was for the {{accommodation}} of the caravans passing on the great road between Egypt and Damascus which Lajjun comes over the hills from the western plain along the coast and enters that of Esdraelon. When the British consul James Finn visited {{the area in the}} mid-19th century, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> a village. The authors of the Survey of Western Palestine also noticed a khan, however, south of the ruins of Lajjun in the early 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{days later}} Dundas claimed a {{probable}} victory against a Bf 110, after {{a battle with}} German aircraft six miles north of RAF Warmwell at 16:30. Despite firing a 12–14 second burst at the enemy fighter, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> it crash. During the battle Dundas {{was hit in the}} leg when a cannon round exploded in his cockpit, but flew again the next day. The Spitfire Dundas flew that day, R6915, still exists, having been preserved by the Imperial War Museum. By 9 October 1940, his score stood at 10 and he was award the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the appeal}} of the Polish Four-Year Sejm to all Poles serving abroad to join the Polish army, and not seeing much {{opportunity}} to advance in his military career in the now-peaceful Saxony, on 28 June 1792 he joined the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a rank of podpułkownik and on 14 July he was promoted to the rank of vice-brigadier. Joining in the final weeks of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> combat in it. Unfamiliar with the intricasies of Polish politics, like many of Poniatowski's supporters, he joined the Targowica Confederation in late 1792.|$|E

5|$|He married Julia Stanley in 1938. John {{was their}} only child together, but as Alf was often away at sea during World War II, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> much of his child during his infancy. During this period, Julia became {{pregnant}} with another man's child. He offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia rejected the idea. He had very little contact with his son until Beatlemania, when they met again, but later had only intermittent contact with each other. He died in Brighton, where {{he had gone to}} live after marrying 19-year-old Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Antoniu {{wrote that}} he thought Gibbs-Smith speculated {{on the basis of}} the {{evidence}} of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight. Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank, and that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Kate {{return to}} camp, {{and when she}} goes to tell Jack about Locke, Jack sees {{a man in a}} suit walk into the jungle. Jack chases after him and Kate follows, but instead of the mysterious figure, they find Locke, who brings with him a dead boar. That night, the {{fuselage}} is burned while Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) holds a memorial service for the dead passengers using information she found in their passports, wallets, and luggage. Michael thanks Locke for hunting the boar and then asks Locke about the Monster, but Locke says that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> anything.

Reyes was one of the agents on the case. They never found the killer, and when they {{discovered}} Luke’s body, both Reyes and Doggett saw it transform into ashes instantly. Reyes says that Doggett has spent the last few years convincing himself <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> it. Reyes believes it was a psychic clue, and now with the other crime scene, she has seen it again.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He {{returned}} to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> education as a field that would realize his full potential. At Williams, he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career. In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that Tom had a revolver {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the {{government}} was spending NOK 1.4 billion annually on purchasing passenger transport from NSB. By introducing PSO, Skogsholm stated that she hoped the costs would be reduced, and that quality and safety levels would remain, or even improve. The counties {{have been allowed to}} issue PSO contracts on bus transport since 1994; and Skogsholm saw the competition in rail transport as a continuation of this. Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means to rationalize costs. In November 2002, NSB laid off 100 employees, and reduced its administration by a third. The administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to Oslo. Skogsholm stated that {{the government}} had no plans to sell NSB.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of the painting, and that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Michel Jarre {{was born}} in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to France Pejot, a French Resistance member and {{concentration}} camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. When Jarre was five, his parents split up and his father moved to America, leaving him with his mother. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> his father again until reaching the age of 18. For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first record player. From his vantage point high above the pavement, the young French boy was able to watch street performers at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.|$|E
50|$|Reeves {{has stopped}} paying the annual fee to the Massachusetts Bar in 1998, and {{therefore}} is suspended from practicing law. He stated that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the logic in paying the Bar {{while he is}} not actively practicing law.|$|R
