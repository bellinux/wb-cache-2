40|$|The {{mobility}} of Americans {{has long been}} a sub-ject of interest for demographers, scholars, and the media. Just a few decades ago, the ultimate success story in this country was home ownership and staying in one neighborhood for all of adulthood. Cur-rently, people and families move many times during their adult lives, with the peak moving years being between 20 - 24 years of age. 1 To where are these people mov-ing, and from where did they originate? One of the few accurate sources of area-to-area migration data in the United States comes from the Statistics of Income Division (SOI) of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which maintains records of all individual income tax forms filed in each year. This paper will highlight the data IRS has on taxpay-er migration, particularly the county-to-county migration data created by U. S. Bureau of the Census analysts using IRS data. First, the paper will discuss the IRS <b>Individual</b> <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> from which these datasets are derived. Then, it will cover how the Census Bureau reviews the file and runs it through a geocoding program.

40|$|ObjectivesThe Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database {{has been}} linked to the Social Security Death <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> to verify “life status” and {{evaluate}} long-term surgical outcomes. The objective of this study is explore practical applications of the linkage of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database to Social Securtiy Death <b>Master</b> <b>File,</b> including the use of the Social Securtiy Death <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> to examine the accuracy of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 30 -day mortality data. MethodsOn January 1, 2008, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database began collecting Social Security numbers in its new version 2. 61. This study includes all Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database records for operations with nonmissing Social Security numbers between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010, inclusive. To match records between the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database and the Social Security Death <b>Master</b> <b>File,</b> we used a combined probabilistic and deterministic matching rule with reported high sensitivity and nearly perfect specificity. ResultsBetween January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database collected data for 870, 406 operations. Social Security numbers were available for 541, 953 operations and unavailable for 328, 453 operations. According to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database, the 30 -day mortality rate was 17, 757 / 541, 953  =  3. 3 %. Linkage to the Social Security Death <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> identified 16, 565 cases of suspected 30 -day deaths (3. 1 %). Of these, 14, 983 were recorded as 30 -day deaths in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database (relative sensitivity =  90. 4 %). Relative sensitivity was 98. 8 % (12, 863 / 13, 014) for suspected 30 -day deaths occurring before discharge and 59. 7 % (2120 / 3551) for suspected 30 -day deaths occurring after discharge. ConclusionsLinkage to the Social Security Death <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> confirms the accuracy of data describing “mortality within 30 days of surgery” in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and Social Security Death <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> link reveals that capture of 30 -day deaths occurring before discharge is highly accurate, and that these in-hospital deaths represent the majority (79 % [13, 014 / 16, 565]) of all 30 -day deaths. Capture of the remaining 30 -day deaths occurring after discharge is less complete and needs improvement. Efforts continue to encourage Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database participants to submit Social Security numbers to the Database, thereby enhancing accurate determination of 30 -day life status. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and Social Security Death <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> linkage can facilitate ongoing refinement of mortality reporting...|$|R

The Enlisted <b>Master</b> <b>File</b> is generated by the Navy Enlisted System, one of many applications which process data for the Manpower, Personnel, and Training community. To clarify what technologies, policies, and procedures can contribute to improved data quality, a framework for classifying these initiatives is developed. The data quality control environment of the Navy Enlisted system is then evaluated with respect to that framework. Two deficiencies in the data quality control environment are identified. One {{is the lack of}} techniques to measure the quality of data in the Enlisted <b>Master</b> <b>File,</b> and the other is the lack of comprehensive plans for data quality control for the data base which will be a successor to the <b>master</b> <b>file.</b> A technique for assessing data quality is then tested, but its application to the Navy Enlisted System was not successful in this limited study. Technologies which could contribute to enhanced data quality in the environment of the future are discussed, and a plan for actively managing data quality is proposed.
