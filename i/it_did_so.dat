5|$|The {{artillery}} {{underwent a}} significant expansion during the war. When the 1st Division embarked in November 1914 <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> with its 18-pounder field guns, but Australia {{had not been}} able to provide the division with the howitzer batteries or the heavy guns that would otherwise have been included on its establishment, due to a lack of equipment. These shortages were unable to be rectified prior to the landing at Gallipoli where the howitzers would have provided the plunging and high-angled fire that was required due to the rough terrain at Anzac Cove. When the 2nd Division was formed in July 1915 <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> without its complement of artillery. Meanwhile, in December 1915 when the government offered to form another division <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> on the basis that its artillery would be provided by Britain. In time though these shortfalls were overcome, with the Australian field artillery expanding from just three field brigades in 1914 to twenty at the end of 1917. The majority of the heavy artillery units supporting the Australian divisions were British, although two Australian heavy batteries were raised from the regular Australian Garrison Artillery. These were the 54th Siege Battery, which was equipped with 8-inch howtizers, and the 55th with 9.2-inch howitzers.|$|E

5|$|On December6 the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} south and southwest. As <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> Epsilon passed beneath a mid-level trough that sheltered it from the wind shear. After weakening during the evening, the convection redeveloped around the large and distinct eye in the daytime, a process Epsilon had done repeatedly in its duration. However, late on December7, an approaching trough began increasing wind shear over the system, displacing the convection from the center and causing the eye to dissipate. After maintaining hurricane status for five days, Epsilon weakened to tropical storm status about 920mi (1480km) southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Philippe moved {{farther north}} {{skirting}} the low {{and continued to}} weaken gradually.

Philippe began to loop around the center of the non-tropical system, weakening as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> As Philippe turned towards Bermuda it weakened into a tropical depression on September 22.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at the National Hurricane Center, in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17mph (28km/h), intensifying as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

In April, the battalion pressed on to Pearl Ridge where they took over from the 31st/51st Battalion and began to carry out patrols in front of the ridge. Over the course of six weeks, the battalion carried out a number of minor attacks and in the process captured several key features before moving to the northern sector of the island on the Bonis Peninsula around Ratsua where they continued to harass Japanese forces through active patrolling and ambushing. This continued until the end of the war in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Late on October23, Alpha made {{landfall}} in Hispaniola, quickly decreasing {{in intensity}} as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> After making landfall, the storm weakened, leaving it just between tropical storm and tropical depression status. Because of the weakening, {{and the strong}} southerly flow from nearby Hurricane Wilma, {{it was hard to}} determine whether a low-level circulation was present. However, satellite imagery suggested that a new center had developed over open waters to the north of Hispaniola. It was downgraded to a tropical depression early the next day, now re-emerging over open waters. The storm soon developed an elongated center of circulation which indicated that the system was weakening. On October24 the low-level center had completely dissolved, and only a small area of convective activity persisted. Thus the system had dissipated, and was a remnant low pressure system when the National Hurricane Center issued their last advisories of Alpha. Shortly thereafter, the remnant low was absorbed into the circulation of Hurricane Wilma on October25.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the strongest}} {{recorded}} tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual landfall or demise. However, three of the storms remained intense enough at landfall to be considered some {{of the strongest}} landfalling hurricanes– three of the eleven hurricanes on the list constitute the three most intense Atlantic landfalls in recorded history. The 1935Labor Day hurricane made landfall at peak intensity, making it the most intense Atlantic landfall. Though it weakened slightly before its eventual landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Gilbert maintained a pressure of 900mbar (hPa; 26.58inHg) at landfall, making its landfall the second strongest. Similarly, Hurricane Dean made landfall on the peninsula, though <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> at peak intensity and with a higher barometric pressure; its landfall marked the third strongest in Atlantic hurricane history.|$|E
