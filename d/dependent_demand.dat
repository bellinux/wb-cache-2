We first establish several fundamental {{properties of the}} model regarding the convexity of the problem, the symmetry of the solution {{and the impact of}} risk aversion. Specifically, we show that for identical products with independent demands, increased risk aversion leads to decreased orders. For a large but finite number of heterogenous products with independent demands, we derive closed-form approximations for the optimal order quantities. The approximations are as simple to compute as the classical risk-neutral solutions. We also show that the risk-neutral solution is asymptotically optimal as the number of products tends to be infinity, and thus risk aversion has no impact in the limit. For a risk-averse newsvendor with <b>dependent</b> <b>demands,</b> we show that positively (negatively) <b>dependent</b> <b>demands</b> lead to a lower (higher) optimal order quantities than independent demands.

40|$|Introduction In {{practice}} we {{are very}} often confronted with dynamic inventory problems of <b>dependent</b> <b>demand.</b> However, until now not much {{work has been done}} on this subject. Usually, stochastic models assume that demand distributions of inventory in different periods are independent. Recently more attention has been given to <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> inventory models e. g. Blinder (1982), and Miller (1986). Usually the exponential smoothing forecasting model is considered. In this paper we consider a more general model for a <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> which is given by a time series. The time series will be given by a Stochastic Trend Component and a Seasonal Component. A Polynomial Trend Component and a Trading Day Effect will be neglected in the considered time series model. Consideration of <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> leads to addition of a second state variable pertaining to demand in the dynamic programming formulation. The first state is as usual the inventory level. Obviously, taking into account the <b>dependent</b> <b>demand.</b> greatly increases the computational complexity of dynamic programming algorithms. Therefore the main attempt is to reduce the two-state variable dynamic programming problem to a one-state variable problem under assumed demand and cost structure. The method of Scarf (1960) and Karlin (1960) which reduces a two-state variable Bayesian inventory model to a one-state variable model when demand is from exponential and range families can be used to solve the problem. Auzory (1985) has extended this result to the cases where demand is uniform and Weibull. Miller (1986) uses the same concept for the demand described by the exponential smoothing formula. The same approach will be used in this paper for the single item periodic review inventory problem with possible returns of a part of demand in the next period...|$|E

The optimal strategy {{chosen for}} the public utility is that of maximizing the social satisfaction derived from services provided. The notion of consumers' surplus is used, and period demands {{are assumed to be}} both independent and dependent. The case of <b>dependent</b> <b>demands,</b> a heretofore unsolved problem, is handled using the line-integral calculus. Several specific models are analyzed, with both capacity constraints and profit constraints being considered. In some models it is shown that prices should depend on marginal operating costs but not on marginal capacity costs. Trade-offs between these marginal costs are explored in the peak-load pricing context. In other models the relationships of price with both demand elasticities and marginal costs are developed. Several of the existing peak-load pricing models of the literature can be shown to be subcases of models developed herein. ...|$|R

The part classification structure enables the modelling of a multi-level <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> manufacturing between parts {{to be carried out}} effectively. The part classification structure was programmed using Visual Basic Application (VBA) and was integrated to the work-to-list generated from a simulated MRP model. This part classification structure was then implemented in the multi-level <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> manufacturing simulation model. Two stages of implementation, namely parameterisation and execution, of the part recognition and classification structure were carried out. A real case study was used and five detail steps of execution were processed. Simulation experiments and MRP were run to verify and validate the part recognition and classification structure. The results led to the conclusion that implementation of the recognition and classification structure has effectively verified the correct parts and sub-assemblies used for the correct product and order. No parts and sub-assemblies shortages were found, and the quantity required was produced. The scheduled release for some orders was delayed due to overload of the required resources. When the loading is normal, all scheduled release timing is adhered to. The recognition and classification structure has a robust design; hence it can be easily adapted to new systems parameter to study a different or more complex case...|$|E

The problem was considered as decreasing demand problem with <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> characteristic and followed exponential distribution. The problem could be solved with Material Requirements Planning. One of the tools in Material Requirements Planning was Lot Sizing Technique. Lot Sizing Technique {{was used to determine}} the order quantity based on minimum Total Cost (Ordering and Holding Cost). There were only few researches conducting Lot Sizing Technique to solve inventory policy with decreasing demand. A research from Pujawan and Kingsman (1994) tried to solve Lumpy Demand problem using lot sizing technique. Their research was adapted to solve the decreasing demand problem with <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> characteristic. There were 5 lot sizing techniques applied in this research: Silver Meal 1, Silver Meal 2, Least Unit Cost, Part Period Balancing, and Incremental technique. There were 5 Suspensions analyzed in this research Considering the <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> characteristic, there were 2 solution models applied to check which lot sizing technique gave the minimum total cost. First solution model treated the parents and components in different way, parents demand were solved using Lot For Lot technique, while the components were solved using 5 different lot sizing techniques. The result represented Incremental technique provided the lowest total cost. The second solution model treated the same way for both parents and components.

Previous models incorporating stock-level <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> rate assume that the holding cost is constant for the entire inventory cycle. In this model we will discuss a stock-level <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> rate and a storage-time dependent holding cost and also the variable ordering cost. The holding cost per unit of the item per unit time is assumed to be an increasing function of the time spent in storage. Two time-dependent holding cost step functions are considered: Retroactive holding cost increase, and incremental holding cost increase. Procedures are developed for determining the optimal order quantity and the optimal cycle time for both cost structures...|$|E

In this article, we have proposed an economic order quantity model for deteriorating items having stock <b>dependent</b> <b>demand</b> (whose demand varies with the stock) under the effect of inflation. Approach: Firstly, problem is framed {{in the form of}} linear differential equation model and then this model has been solved with general solution technique of linear differential equations. Using the solution the expression for total cost of inventory has been obtained. Results: Using total cost equation an optimal order quantity is obtained and convexity of various costs is also studied. This model helps retailer to decide his economic order quantity for deteriorating items having stock <b>dependent</b> <b>demand.</b> The consideration of effect of inflation makes this model more relevant for present business environment. Conclusion: The convexity of various costs proves the validity of this model. The effect of inflation with two different rates is also studied in tables below considering both constant as well as stock <b>dependent</b> <b>demand.</b> The graph of these tables shows that the optimal inventory cost increases with increase in number of cycles it increases rapidly in starting but becomes stable for large number of cycles. The proposed model can be extended in several ways. For instance, we may generalize the model to allow for shortages, quantity discounts, time value of money, finite replenishment rate, permissible delay in payments and others...|$|E
