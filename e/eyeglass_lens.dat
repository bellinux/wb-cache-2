25|$|Lenses {{are used}} as {{prosthetics}} for the correction of visual impairments such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism. (See corrective <b>lens,</b> contact <b>lens,</b> <b>eyeglasses.)</b> Most <b>lenses</b> used for other purposes have strict axial symmetry; <b>eyeglass</b> <b>lenses</b> are only approximately symmetric. They are usually shaped to fit in a roughly oval, not circular, frame; the optical centres are placed over the eyeballs; their curvature may not be axially symmetric to correct for astigmatism. Sunglasses' lenses are designed to attenuate light; sunglass lenses that also correct visual impairments can be custom made.|$|R

50|$|In science textbooks, {{positive}} lenses {{are usually}} diagrammed as convex on both sides; negative lenses are usually diagrammed as concave on both sides. In a real optical system, the best optical quality is usually achieved where most rays of light are roughly normal (i.e., at a right angle) to the lens surface. In {{the case of}} an <b>eyeglass</b> <b>lens,</b> this means that the lens should be roughly shaped like a cup with the hollow side toward the eye, so most eyeglass lenses are menisci in shape.|$|E

25|$|Toric or sphero-cylindrical lenses have {{surfaces}} {{with two}} different radii of curvature in two orthogonal planes. They {{have a different}} focal power in different meridians.

5000|$|Lenticular eyeglass lenses {{have been}} {{employed}} to correct extreme hyperopia (farsightedness), a condition often created by cataract surgery when lens implants are not possible. To limit the great thickness and weight that such high-power lenses would otherwise require, {{all the power}} of the lens is concentrated in a small area in the center. In appearance, such a lens is often described as resembling a fried egg: a hemisphere atop a flat surface. The flat surface or [...] "carrier lens" [...] has little or no power and is there merely to fill {{up the rest of the}} eyeglass frame and to hold or [...] "carry" [...] the lenticular portion of the lens. This portion is typically 40 mm in diameter but may be smaller, as little as 20 mm, in sufficiently high powers. These lenses are generally used for plus (hyperopic) corrections at about 12 diopters or higher. A similar sort of <b>eyeglass</b> <b>lens</b> is the myodisc, sometimes termed a minus lenticular lens, used for very high negative (myopic) corrections. More aesthetic aspheric lens designs are sometimes fitted. A film made of cylindrical lenses molded in a plastic substrate as shown in above picture, can be applied to the inside of standard glasses to correct for diplopia. The film is typically applied to the eye with the good muscle control of direction. Diplopia (also known as double vision) is typically caused by a sixth cranial nerve palsy that prevents full control of the muscles that control the direction the eye is pointed in. These films are defined in the number of degrees of correction that is needed where the higher the degree, the higher the directive correction that is needed.|$|E
