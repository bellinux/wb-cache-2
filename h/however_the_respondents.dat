In June 2012, 106 of the 110 caregivers employed by TerraNova were women. No party in the case contended that the four male caregivers were paid more than their female colleagues for doing the same work. <b>However,</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> argued that this did not mean equal pay exists, rather that the male caregivers’ wages were reduced because care giving was seen as “women’s work”.

A GPS mobile phone-based activity diary survey system is developed in this study. The software programmed in Java works on mobile phone devices for entering information on activity diary. Positional data are automatically collected at regular intervals by GPS-equipped mobile phones. Two pilot surveys are conducted for a total about 50 participants to examine {{the advantages of the}} survey system. By comparing activity data collected by the software with the data collected by conventional paper-based activity diary surveys, it is found that the system developed in this study is useful in terms of reducing “time lag ” in data entry and mitigation of spatial constraints for data entry. <b>However,</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondent’s</b> burden depends on the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>respondents...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{a model of}} interviewer–respondent {{interaction}} in survey interviews. Our model is primarily focused on the occurrence of problems within this interaction that seem likely to affect data quality. Both conversational principles and cognitive processes, especially where they do not match the requirements of <b>the</b> <b>respondent’s</b> task, are assumed to affect the course of interactions. The cognitive processes involved in answering a survey question are usually described by means of four steps: interpretation, retrieval, judgement and formatting. Each of these steps {{may be responsible for}} different overt problems, such as requests for clarification or inadequate answers. Such problems are likely to affect the course of the interaction through conversational principles which may cause, for example, suggestive behaviour {{on the part of the}} interviewer, which may in turn yield new problematic behaviours. <b>However,</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> may not be the only one who experiences cognitive problems; the interviewer may also have such problems, for example with respect to explaining question meaning to <b>the</b> <b>respondent.</b> Thus <b>the</b> model proposed here, unlike most of the other models which concentrate on <b>the</b> <b>respondent,</b> tries to incorporate cognitive processes and conversational principles with respect to both interviewer and <b>respondent.</b> In particular, <b>the</b> model looks at how cognitive processes and conversational principles affect both th...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the leading}} {{paradigms}} in modern travel behaviour research is the activity based approach, which considers travel as a derivative from the activities that individuals and households need or wish to perform. Longitudinal designs provide the required framework for {{a better understanding of}} the dynamics of travel behaviour. Longitudinal data can be used to analyze behavioural adjustments some time before (response leads) or after (response lags) the occurrence of an event, or for instance to analyze routine behaviour. The questionnaire used to collect the data will be an activity diary. <b>The</b> <b>respondents</b> are asked to fill in all their activities performed that day. The diaries have to be filled in at least twice a week. These moments are randomly selected, but in weeks when a special event occurs, the days around this special event are questioned as well. Performing a longitudinal study has certain drawbacks <b>however.</b> <b>The</b> <b>respondent</b> burden can cause different side-effects, such as panel attrition, decreasing representativeness and, reporting errors. Thus, next to refreshing the sample regularly, trying to keep <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> motivated is essential. A first step in lowering <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> burden is to make the activity diaries user-friendly. An internetbased questionnaire makes interaction with <b>respondents</b> possible. <b>The</b> <b>respondent’s</b> current results can be graphically displayed (e. g. geographical map of activity-pattern), potentially awakening or strengthening the interest in the study. Logical rules (e. g. two activities on two different locations require a trip in between) can be formulated, and the interaction with <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> allows <b>the</b> researcher to get feedback on “strange” answers, or on missing values, thus improving the data quality.
