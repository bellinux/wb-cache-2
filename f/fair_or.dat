25|$|Justice or {{fairness}} {{refers to}} the idea that an action or decision is morally right, which may be defined according to ethics, religion, fairness, equity, or law. People are naturally attentive to the justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety of contexts (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Individuals react to actions and decisions made by organizations every day. An individual's perceptions of these decisions as <b>fair</b> <b>or</b> unfair can influence the individual's subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Fairness is often of central interest to organizations because the implications of perceptions of injustice can impact job attitudes and behaviors at work. Justice in organizations can include issues related to perceptions of fair pay, equal opportunities for promotion, and personnel selection procedures.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 a major {{trade fair}} was {{established}} in Lwów right {{after the end of}} hostilities there; designed to facilitate new business partnerships from within Poland but also from Greater Romania, Hungary and the Soviet Union among other places. The annual Eastern Trade <b>Fair</b> <b>or</b> the Targi Wschodnie (as it was known in Polish) by 1928 could boast some 1,600 exhibitors, 400 of them being foreign firms. The fair attracted 150,000 visitors that year, with tram connections to the city, customs office and telephone exchange on site. Also in 1928, a similar trade fair was launched in Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania) to drum up business in northeastern Poland, reaching out to Lithuania and Latvia. The Northern Trade Fair (Targi Północne) was visited by the staggering 180,000 guests in the first year. It was the biggest annual event locally showcasting textiles, furniture, farm animals, furs, tourist equipment, production machinery and many other commercial products.|$|E
25|$|It {{had been}} hoped that an East African Single Tourist Visa {{may have been}} ready for November 2006, if it was {{approved}} by the relevant sectoral authorities under the EAC's integration programme. Had it been approved, the visa would have been valid for all three current member states of the EAC (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda). Under the proposal for the visa, any new EAC single visa could be issued by any member state's embassy. The visa proposal followed an appeal by the tourist boards of the partner states for a common visa to accelerate promotion of the region as a single tourist destination and the EAC Secretariat wanted it approved before November's World Travel <b>Fair</b> (<b>or</b> World Travel Market) in London. When approved by the EAC's council of ministers, tourists could apply for one country's entry visa which would then be applicable in all regional member states as a single entry requirement initiative.|$|E

25|$|In January 2014, Vanity Fair was {{the latest}} {{magazine}} under fire for allegedly altering {{the appearance of a}} celebrity featured in its pages for its February issue. The celebrities under speculation were Lupita Nyong’o, an actress from 12 Years A Slave, who had her photo lightened during publication, and Lena Dunham, an actress from the HBO series Girls. For Lupita’s case, the magazine tweeted the photo and it began with fans accusing the company of altering her complexion. However some believe that the Vanity Fair images are simply a product of bright set lighting, rather than deliberate skin lightening. The magazine still took some heat and guilt from the whole ordeal. Lupita herself was pleased with the work, and saw no harm done to herself or to hold Vanity <b>Fair</b> <b>or</b> the photographer liable of anything. In weeks prior to Lupita's case, Vogue magazine, a partner and buyer of Vanity Fair in 1936, was accused of altering Lena Dunham's photos. Dunham considered the modified photos to be offensive.

25|$|Afonso I granted Lisbon a Foral in 1179, {{and tried}} to restore the city's {{commercial}} connections by inaugurating a major new <b>fair</b> <b>or</b> market. Consequently, the Portuguese merchants, Christian and Jewish, not only reestablished {{some of the old}} trade links of al-Us̲h̲būna with Seville and Cádiz, and in the Mediterranean with Constantinople, but also opened up new trade routes to the ports of northern Europe that the Muslims rarely visited because of religious differences. Lisbon became a conduit for maritime trade between the North Sea and the Mediterranean, and thanks to advances in navigation, the volume of ocean shipping increased. Portuguese merchants opened trade houses in Seville, Southampton, Bruges, and in the cities of the Hansa, which later joined to form the Hanseatic League. Meanwhile, the Portuguese Jews continued to trade with their relatives in North Africa. They exchanged Portuguese olive oil, salt, wine, cork, honey and wax as well as wool and fine linen textiles, tin, iron, dyes, amber, guns, furs and artisanal works of the north for the spices, silks and herbal remedies of the Mediterranean countries, in addition to the gold, ivory, rice, alum, almonds and sugar bought from the Arabs and Moors. Shipyards were founded to build more commercial and military vessels for the naval fleet (armada) essential to protect this trade from Saracen pirates. Increasing demand for goods by the growing populations of Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries stimulated innovations in the construction of boats, the sturdy but clumsy barge (barca) becoming obsolete when a gradual synthesis of Christian, Viking and Arabic sea-going knowledge {{led to the development of}} the caravel (first mentioned in the early 13th century), the first truly seaworthy Atlantic sailing ship. Professions in the maritime industry, such as those of ships-carpenters and sailors, were allowed certain privileges and protections, including the creation in 1242 of a maritime judicial office in Lisbon called the Alcaide do Mar (Alcaide of the Sea).|$|E
