40|$|Grammar is an {{essential}} requirement toward a successful result in learning any language, including English. <b>The</b> grammatical <b>error</b> <b>in</b> speaking is tolerable since people {{focus more on the}} message. On the contrary, people have to pay more attention both to what they want to say (substance) and also how they are going to express their ideas (medium) <b>in</b> writing. <b>The</b> grammatical <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> writing may/will distort and disturb the coherence of the piece of writing By using correct grammatical rules, it will ensure good writing. It is for this reason that, I am eager to analyze <b>the</b> grammatical <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writing assignment of the basic I level students at KELT (Key English Language Learning). I use qualitative method since I will identify and classify the type of grammar errors and find the frequency of the occurrence of the errors made by the students of KELT. While doing this, I will also provide the correct forms for <b>the</b> <b>errors.</b> <b>In</b> this research, I am not concerned with the reasons why they produce grammatical those errors. As soon as a grammar rules is broken, an error has been committed. <b>In</b> conducting <b>the</b> thesis, I use the theory of Jack. C. Richards based on his book, ?Error analysis Perspectives on Second Language Acquisition?. He classifies the grammatical errors into 6 categories. They are <b>Errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Production of Verb Groups, <b>Errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Distribution of Verb Groups, Miscellaneous <b>Errors,</b> <b>Errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Use of Prepositions, <b>Errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Use of Articles, and <b>Errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Use of Questions.

Most students tend to make <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of verb group, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> agreement of verb with subject and tenses. Finally, l recommend that the teacher and students pay more attention on the internalization of grammatical rules.

5|$|Despite Brueys hopes, Nelson was {{determined}} to press home his attack at once and ordered his ships to advance, only pausing to fit springs on their anchor cables, which {{would allow them to}} easily direct their broadsides in cramped, shallow coastal waters. Without an accurate chart of the bay, Nelson was forced to be cautious in his advance, and ordered Captain Samuel Hood in Zealous to take soundings as he advanced to establish the depth of the bay. At 18:20, as the British ships HMS Goliath and Zealous rounded the northern shoal, the leading French ships Guerrier and Conquérant opened fire. As he approached the French line, Captain Thomas Foley in Goliath noticed that Brueys had made a serious <b>error</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution of his forces. Rather than place his lead ship Guerrier close to the northern shoal, the French admiral had left a gap, widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly, between Guerrier and the shoals. Sailing directly through this gap, Foley raked Guerrier and engaged the second ship of the French line, Conquérant. Zealous also passed through the gap and attacked Guerrier, and was followed by HMS Orion, HMS Theseus and HMS Audacious, all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared port sides.|$|E
