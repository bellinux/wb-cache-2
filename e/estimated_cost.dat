5|$|Delays and {{engineering}} issues plagued the VH-71's development.

5|$|In 1945, a B-29 bomber cost $782,000. It cost $32,000 {{to upgrade}} an {{aircraft}} to Silverplate configuration, so {{the total cost}} of a Silverplate bomber was $814,000. The total cost of the 65 wartime Silverplate B-29s was therefore $53 million.

In 1994, proposals were made to remodel and update the structure to meet modern building codes, with an <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> of $16million. Work was to include replacing the concrete floors, structural upgrades, and restoring the original light corridors that penetrated all four floors of the building. In March 1995, plans were made to renovate the then-100-year-old structure. The estimated $22-million project was proposed due to the building failing to comply with the city codes for earthquakes and fires.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water.

50|$|A <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> is the {{approximation}} {{of the cost}} of a program, project, or operation. The <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> is the product of the <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process. The <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> has a single total value and may have identifiable component values. A problem with a cost overrun can be avoided with a credible, reliable, and accurate <b>cost</b> <b>estimate.</b> A <b>cost</b> estimator is the professional who prepares <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> There are different types of cost estimators, whose title may be preceded by a modifier, such as building estimator, or electrical estimator, or chief estimator. Other professional titles may also prepare <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> or contribute to <b>cost</b> <b>estimates,</b> such as quantity surveyors, cost engineers, etc. In the US, there were 185,400 cost estimators in 2010. There are around 75,000 professional quantity surveyors working in the UK.|$|R
