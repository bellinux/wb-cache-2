5|$|The threats {{faced by}} seabirds <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> unnoticed by {{scientists}} or the conservation movement. As early as 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was {{convinced of the}} need to declare Pelican Island in Florida a National Wildlife Refuge to protect the bird colonies (including the nesting brown pelicans), and in 1909 he protected the Farallon Islands. Today many important seabird colonies are given some measure of protection, from Heron Island in Australia to Triangle Island in British Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Archie Ledbrooke, {{a sports}} {{reporter}} for the Daily Mirror and the first treasurer of the Cricket Writers' Club, {{came up with the}} idea for the award. It was first presented in 1950, when Roy Tattersall of Lancashire was the recipient. In 1986, the vote was tied, and the award was made jointly to Ashley Metcalfe of Nottinghamshire and James Whitaker of Leicestershire. The 1995 winner, Andrew Symonds, went on to make over 200 international appearances for Australia, but at the time of his award was eligible to play for England, as he was born in Birmingham. , representatives of seventeen of the eighteen first-class cricket counties have won the award; no player from Worcestershire has ever won. Yorkshire players have collected the award most frequently, doing so on eleven occasions. Only eight winners <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> on to play international cricket.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E

25|$|The 1986 Hvalur sinkings {{occurred}} in Iceland's Reykjavík harbour in November 1986, when anti-whaling activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society sank the unoccupied whaling vessels, Hvalur 6 and Hvalur 7, and sabotaged a whale processing station in Hvalfjörður.

500|$|Wenger has {{directed}} his anger towards referees when decisions <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> his team's way. In August 2000, {{he was charged}} with [...] "alleged threatening behaviour and physical intimidation" [...] towards fourth official Paul Taylor, after Arsenal's 1–0 defeat at Sunderland on the opening day of the 2000–01 season. An FA disciplinary commission found Wenger guilty; he received a 12-match touchline ban and a fine of four weeks' salary. He successfully appealed the ban, but was reprimanded and fined £10,000 for his actions. Following the 2007 Football League Cup Final, he called a linesman a liar, for stating Emmanuel Adebayor aimed a punch at Chelsea's Frank Lampard. This led to an investigation by the FA, a fine of £2,500 and a warning.|$|E
500|$|On mixed review, Andy Gill of The Independent, while {{describing}} Mars' [...] "impassioned shame" [...] on {{the lyrics}} called the track [...] "enjoyable". The lyrics <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> undecided for PopMatters Matt Cibula who named them a [...] "classic lament" [...] and added [...] "is as widescreen and wide-open as things get these days". The {{same could be}} said for Jason Lipshut who, while writing for Billboard, found Mars' [...] "recognizing sin while indulging in it" [...] on the [...] "sleek" [...] lyrics and composition. However, a [...] "throwback vibe (established from the backing vocals) remain from Doo-Wops", while prospecting the earnest from [...] "It Will Rain". On the other hand, Pastes Ryan Reed criticized Mars' for playing safe on [...] "Young Girls", unlike most of the other tracks on the album. He explained that the singer [...] "steps sideways" [...] and the record [...] "is a 'shout-out-to-the-honeys' belter" [...] for various reasons. In 2013, [...] "Young Girls" [...] received an award at the MelOn Music Awards for the category [...] "Best Pop".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, McCain {{continued}} {{questioning the}} progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: [...] "Things <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers." [...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Rainbow, Carey left Sony and signed an $80 million, four-album {{contract}} with EMI's Virgin Records, wishing to severe all ties with Sony and its chairman, her former husband Tommy Mottola. Halperin and Hampp believe that following a prolonged period of absence from Sony and re-signing with them is a positive situation for Carey: [...] "Doug Morris, current chairman/CEO of Sony Music, brought Carey to Island Def Jam in 2003 {{when he was running}} Universal Music Group. Reid, then head of Island Def Jam, oversaw her Mimi-powered 2005 comeback. Joey Arbagey, a collaborator of Carey's during the making of the six-times platinum The Emancipation of Mimi, is now executive vp A at Epic." [...] Furthermore, Carey released seven studio albums, a live EP and four compilation/greatest hits albums with Sony, which have sold a total of 54 million units in the US combined. Although Halperin and Hampp note that [...] "Carey's legacy is undisputed, her recent stumbles <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> unnoticed," [...] with regard to her divorce from Nick Cannon, the low sales of Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse and its failure to garner a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 and hiring and firing three managers: Dupri, Randy Jackson and Kevin Giles (the last of whom Carey has kept as a consultant). As a result, several record labels were reluctant to offer Carey a contract. According to Billboard, many other critics felt that reuniting with Reid is Carey's best chance of re-establishing herself on the charts.|$|E
500|$|In July 1991, Creation {{agreed to}} {{relocate}} the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records {{was unable to}} pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment. Dutt recalled, [...] "I don't know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving. He had to raise the money himself to get the gear out." [...] Shields' unexpected and random behaviour, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a material effect both on Creation's finances and the health of their staff. Dutt later admitted being desperate to leave the project, while Creation's second-in-command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown around this time. Green later recalled, [...] "It was two years into the album, and I phoned Shields up in tears. I was going 'You have to deliver me this record'." [...] During this time, both Shields and Butcher became affected with tinnitus, and had to delay recording for a further number of weeks while they recovered. Concerned friends and band members suggested this was a result of the unusually loud volumes the group played at their shows. Shields dismissed these concerns as [...] "Ill-informed hysteria." [...] Although Alan McGee was still upbeat and positive about his investment, the 29-year-old Green, who by this time was opening the label's morning post [...] "shaking with fear," [...] became a concern to his co-workers. Publicist Laurence Verfaillie, aware of the label's inability to cover further studio bills, recalled Green's hair turning grey overnight. [...] "He would <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> grey if it was not for that album," [...] Verfaillie said.|$|E
