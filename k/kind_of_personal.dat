5|$|After Christie's {{return from}} his second combat patrol, Admiral Chester Nimitz {{recommended}} he and Lockwood meet in Brisbane and discuss joint submarine operations. During the visit, Lockwood and Christie discussed technical issues, {{as well as}} the establishment of advanced bases in Mios Woendi and Saipan. However, the meeting also resulted in some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> rift between the two men. They had already clashed over the Mark 6 exploder and the Mark 14 torpedo, and some of Lockwood's staff believed Christie's ride in Harder was a risky and unnecessary stunt. After meeting with Lockwood, Christie met with MacArthur and related the events of Dealey's fifth war patrol to the general. MacArthur then decided to award Dealey a Distinguished Service Cross, and Christie the Silver Star. Additionally at this meeting, Christie found out his earlier recommendation for an army decoration to Griffith had apparently been blocked by Kinkaid. Despite Kinkaid's order regarding army decorations, MacArthur insisted on granting medals to the two men. Although Christie did not request the decorations, he was put on the spot and felt compelled to report the entire affair to Kinkaid. In the end, the general awarded the medals, displeasing Kinkaid.|$|E

[...] The band’s early lyrics were [...] "primarily Satanic or [...] influenced by the Occult in some way"; in Walkyier’s interpretation, Satanism [...] "doesn’t say ‘let’s go out and kill people’ or anything like that", referring to The Satanic Bible which has [...] "nothing to do with sacrifice" [...] but with a selfish outlook. Walkyier sees Satanism as a rebellion against orthodox Christianity.

[...] When Delano notices that the shaving cloth covering Don Benito is the Spanish flag, he finds this use an indignity that for a moment gives him occasion to see in Babo a [...] "headsman" [...] and in Don Benito [...] "a man at the block", but quickly reassures himself that blacks are like children and therefore fond of bright colors, so that nothing is wrong with scene.

2500|$|Thus, a {{few years}} later, Hazltt saw fit to {{conclude}} his assessment of the [...] "spirit of the age" [...] with a nod to Knowles. Acknowledging his long friendship with the dramatist, he puts forth his belief that Knowles's Virginius is [...] "the best acting tragedy that has been produced on the modern stage." [...] Knowles himself is [...] "the first tragic writer of the age" [...] because he keeps his ego out of his plays; following no rules and having read few plays, he has observed closely what little of life he has experienced, and then, aided by the practice of having been an actor himself, he focuses intensely on his subject and pours into his plays the [...] "impulses of [...] natural feeling, and produces a perfect work of art." [...] On a personal basis, Hazlitt concludes, the man is so self-effacing that you {{would never be able}} to connect his plays with his personality without knowing the fact that he is their author. In a brief version of the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> focus he adds to most of the essays in The Spirit of the Age, Hazlitt reflects that, when not focused on his drama, Knowles lives a retired life: he modestly [...] "divides his time and affections between his plots and his fishing tackle, between the Muses' spring, and those mountain-streams which sparkle like his own eye, that gush out like his own voice at the sight of an old friend." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cokayne was {{involved}} in a series of disorders over the succeeding years. In August 1410 he gathered an armed force of 200 around his home at Ashbourne. He claimed later, when obtaining a pardon the cover the events, that he had received reports of a plot against his life and that Roger Leche was on his way with an armed band to kill him. The precise reasons for the distrust between the two men are obscure. Leche had been chamberlain to Bolingbroke as Earl of Derby and had succeeded another Derbyshire man, John Curzon of Kedleston, as steward of the main Lancastrian stronghold in the region, Tutbury Castle. He had become particularly close to the Prince of Wales, acting as steward of his household. He had a history of turning up with armed supporters when involved in what were supposed to be peaceful occasions. It is likely that some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> enmity had developed between him and Cokayne. However, his loyalty to the Prince of Wales placed him {{on the opposite side of}} a political divide that had opened up within the House of Lancaster and among its supporters. It had become apparent in the parliament of 1410, which insisted on the king appointing to his council [...] "the most valiant, wise and discreet lords of the realm." [...] This was coded support for the active policies favoured by the Prince, frustrated by his experiences as captain of Calais, and his closest confidants, his uncles Sir Thomas Beaufort, the Chancellor and Henry Beaufort, the Bishop of Winchester. This contrasted with a more cautious approach in the council, associated with Archbishop Thomas Arundel and the Prince's brother, Thomas of Lancaster. Cokayne had apparently chosen several times to serve under Thomas and was to do so again. The quarrel between Leche and Cokayne seems to have been prolonged and dangerous to the peace.|$|E
2500|$|Doctorate in Religion {{recipient}} Sandra Kahn {{notes the}} parallel between early Christians [...] "going out {{to spread the}} 'good new.' heedless of personal danger, and the early converts [...] taking the message to their hearts as fulfillment of their most cherished hopes.… providing {{a glimpse into the}} actual scenario of the mass teaching/conversion experience which is so similar to early Christianity" [...] even though [...] "a significant number of Southern fundamentalist Christians who religion orientation is primarily 'other-worldly,' convert to a religion which denies the literal beliefs which they have always held, replacing them with sophisticated symbolic interpretations in a 'this-world' setting." [...] Reviewing a small selection of converts Kahn found [...] "Concrete behavioral change take place. These are changes in habits such as fighting, drinking, [...] "partying", cursing, gambling, gossiping, and promiscuous sexual behavior…. Family relationships become more stable. Racially mixed relationships and marriages occur. There is a tendency to increase one's education, nutritional habits and medical practices. And the convert finds ways to use his own talents to contribute to the religion and personally help others, as well as accepting help." [...] Finding additional parallels with a study of mass conversion in Buddhism she finds [...] "Most of them are poor, illiterate, with centuries of oppression behind them" [...] akin to the Untouchables of India, and represents a stage in escaping the system of oppression, using a popular understanding of the religion's ideas rather than an intellectual one. While many who were initially enthusiastic about conversion fell away, none in Kahn's study formally converted back to Christianity. She found the tendency to convert to the Baha'i Faith transcended other options for those she studied - on the one hand it filled a need for a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> salvation over that of a [...] "civil religion" [...] in the American mythos of civil rights and its [...] "sacred" [...] documents like the Declaration of Independence, and on the other it was more appealing that the Civil Rights Movement with its charismatic preachers and ideals because it was less personal and more a [...] "restatement of the old myth for the purpose of social action". She found that [...] "the two (southern Christian experience and the Baha'i Faith) are compatible for a fruitful encounter. In a sense they are complementary. The Baha'i [...] provides philosophical explanations, a broader world view, a sense of history, a sense of world unity, explanations of catastrophes and corruption, and in general gives a wider experience of purpose and meaning suitable to the new cultural environment of the South." ...|$|E

I felt that, là-bas--by which I mean in the immediate house--a certain expectation rested on me, but I looked it straight in the face and cynically budged not. I dislike, more and more, the terrific organized exploitation, in Paris, on the occasion of death and burial, of every <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> privacy and every <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>personal</b> hysterics. It is newspaperism and professionalism gone mad--in a way all its own; and I felt as if I should go mad if I even once more, let alone twenty times more, heard Daudet personally compared (more especially facially compared, eyeglass and all) to Jesus Christ. Not a French notice of him that I have seen but has plumped it coquettishly out. I had not seen him, thanks to my extreme recalcitrance, since the month he spent {{more than two years ago}} in London. His death was not unhappy--was indeed too long delayed, for all his later time has been sadly (by disease, borne with wonderful patience and subtlety) blighted and sterilized. Yet it is a wonderful proof of what a success his life had been that it had remained a success in spite of that. It was the most worked thing that ever was--I mean his whole career. His talent was so great that I feel, as to his work, that the best of it will quite intensely remain. But he was a queer combination of a great talent with an absence of the greater mind, as it were--the greater feeling.|$|E

William Willshire seemed to them almost the best man who ever lived; though my boy had secretly a greater fondness for the Arab, Sidi Hamet, who was kind to Captain Riley and kept his brother Seid from ill-treating him whenever he could. Probably the boy liked him better because the Arab was more picturesque than the Englishman. The whole narrative was very interesting; it had a vein of sincere and earnest piety in it which was not its least charm, and it was written in a style of old-fashioned stateliness which was not without its effect with the boys.|$|E

Their vain fears only substitute other and worse evils for those which they are idly apprehensive of: while every restraint on the freedom of conduct of any of their human fellow creatures, (otherwise than by making them responsible for any evil actually caused by it), dries up pro tanto the principal fountain of human happiness, and leaves the species less rich, to an inappreciable degree, in all that makes life valuable to the individual human being.|$|E
