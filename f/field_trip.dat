5|$|During their <b>field</b> <b>trip,</b> the {{bus from}} Springfield Elementary {{arrives at the}} Fort Springfield civil war site and skids into a cannon, {{knocking}} one of its wheels off. The cannon then points at the tower leg of a lookout, giving the impression that it will fire at the lookout and destroy it, which is {{a reference to the}} opening sequence of the television sitcom F Troop. The lookout was also modeled after the lookout in the show. The scene in which Üter is left behind {{at the end of the}} <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> is based on a scene from the 1965 film Von Ryan's Express.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to obtain insight into what {{students}} and teachers think about <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> in ecology and whether they think that fieldtrips result in increase of students’ learning. Open questionnaires and half structured interviews were used to investigate this. Persons who answered the questionnaires and participated in the interviews were senior high school teachers in biology or science and high school science students. All the teachers and most of the students thought that <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> in ecology resulted in increased learning. Those students who had spent more time on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> found it more learning and fun than students which had spent less time on <b>field</b> <b>trips,</b> which can indicate that if students spend more time on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> they think it is more fun and that they learn more. The teachers realized some difficulties with taking students out on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> such as lack of money, lack of time, large groups and fitting the <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> into the school schedule. Earlier studies confirm to a large extent my results regarding teachers’ views upon <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> and they also show that <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> result in an increase of students’ knowledge. My study is unique because I investigate the students’ views on <b>field</b> <b>trips,</b> if they experience that they learn on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> and if <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> make them motivated to learn more about ecology...|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E

Meanwhile, Bart's class goes on a <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> to the Springfield Police Department, where Bart finds a room with several megaphones. After placing them end to end and increasing their amplification, he inadvertently creates a sonic shockwave that shatters all the glass in Springfield. Chief Wiggum suggests sending Bart to military school to correct his behavior. When the family visit the school, Lisa is impressed by the challenging curriculum and decides to attend with Bart.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt at a}} school <b>field</b> <b>trip,</b> Edna Krabappel calls an {{emergency}} strike {{on behalf of the}} Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly spending on the school. The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the strike is over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the two sides are forced into talking and think of a resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLaboratory exercises, field {{observations}} and <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> are fundamental parts of many earth science and environmental science courses. Field {{observations and}} <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> can be constrained because of distance, time, expense, scale, safety, or complexity of real-world environments.

40|$|The growing {{distance}} of consumers {{from the source}} of their food increases the necessity of developing agricultural literacy. A farm is an effective venue for the development of agricultural literacy; educational farms can provide authentic learning experiences and help people make connections to the land, to {{the source of their}} food, to one another, and between classroom learning and real life. <b>Field</b> <b>trips</b> provide a way to introduce young people from nonagricultural backgrounds to farms and offer a variety of cognitive, social, and affective benefits. Grounded in experiential learning, informal education, and place-based education, and supported by an understanding of learning in museums and on <b>field</b> <b>trips,</b> this study investigated the benefits of educational farm <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> as perceived by farm educators, classroom teachers, and students. To explore goals and expectations surrounding school <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> to educational farms, interviews were conducted at each of three educational farms with the farm-based educator and with classroom teachers visiting the farms with their classes. Students participating in <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> to the farms responded to questions about their experience and learning. Inductive analysis of the data identified emergent themes and patterns; goals of each educator were identified and considered in relation to one another. Findings indicate that the farm experience, interconnectivity, local food, agricultural literacy, and curriculum connections are important factors in <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> to educational farms. Classroom teachers and farm educators tended to have similar goals for the <b>field</b> <b>trips,</b> but some differences were found. Students reported both cognitive and affective learning from their <b>field</b> <b>trips.</b> Logistical elements of <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> and approaches to overcoming barriers are considered. Implications for <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> and future research are discussed. i...|$|R

Whorf published several articles on that topic in this period, some of them with G. L. Trager, who had become his close friend. Whorf took a special interest in the Hopi language and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village living in Manhattan, New York. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> to the village of Mishongnovi, on the Second Mesa of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.|$|E
