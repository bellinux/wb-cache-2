40|$|The Discounted Cash Flow {{method is}} a long since {{well-known}} tool to assess the feasibility of investment projects, as the background which shapes {{a broad range of}} techniques, from the Cost-Benefit Analysis up to the Life-Cycle Cost Analysis. Its rationale lies in the comparison of deferred values, only once they have been discounted back to the present. The DCF variant proposed here fits into a specific application field. It is well-suited to the evaluations required in order to structure equitable transactions under the umbrella of Public-Private Partnership. •The discount rate relies upon the concept of expected return on equity, <b>instead</b> <b>than</b> on <b>those</b> of weighted average cost of capital, although the latter is the most common reference within the scope of real estate investment valuation. •Given a feasible project, whose Net Present Value is more than satisfactory, we aim to identify the amount of the additional burdens that could be charged to the project, under the condition of keeping the same economically viable. •The DCF variant essentially deals with an optimization problem, which can be solved by means of simple one-shot equations, derived from financial mathematics, or through iterative calculations if additional constraints must be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{crystallinity}} of freeze/thaw poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels, either {{fresh or}} aged or obtained by dipping dried freeze/thaw gel samples in water immediately after their preparation, was investigated by using different techniques. Free induction decays obtained from 1 H NMR experiments {{provide the most}} accurate measurement {{of the degree of}} crystallinity of these systems. Values thus obtained are in a good agreement with data obtained by X-ray diffraction for all the samples under study. The degrees of crystallinity, determined by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), <b>instead,</b> are lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> obtained by the other two methods, for all the gel samples, but the aged gels. This result is due to the occurrence of the gel-sol transition during the heating scan which is characterized by the endothermic melting of the crystallites and the exothermic solubilization and solvation of PVA chains in water. In as-prepared and rehydrated gels, the endothermic and exothermic effects overlap, which leads to an underestimated value of the degree of crystallinity. For aged samples, the crystallites are larger and more perfect; the corresponding melting endotherms are narrower and shifted toward higher temperatures, which permits the separation of the endothermic and exothermic effects and leads to a more accurate measurement of the degree of crystallinity. Thus, the comparative analysis of the degree of crystallinity in PVA hydrogels measured by different techniques provides indirect information concerning their complex structure...|$|R
