5|$|Massachusetts <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> {{many forms}} of racial strife seen {{elsewhere}} in the US, but examples such as the successful electoral showings of the nativist (mainly anti-Catholic) Know Nothings in the 1850s, the controversial Sacco and Vanzetti executions in the 1920s, and Boston's opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s show that the ethnic history of Massachusetts was not completely harmonious.|$|E
5|$|The {{company has}} aimed {{to present the}} {{standard}} operatic repertoire, sung in English, and has staged all the major operas of Mozart, Wagner and Puccini, and {{a wide range of}} Verdi's operas. Under Mackerras and his successors the Czech repertoire has featured strongly, and a broad range of French and Russian operas has been presented. The company has for decades laid stress on opera as drama, and <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> operas where vocal display takes precedence over musical and dramatic content. In addition to the operatic staples, ENO has a history of presenting new works, and latterly of commissioning them.|$|E

25|$|In February 2016, {{amidst the}} Peruvian Presidential Race, {{a report from}} the Brazilian Federal Police implicated Humala as {{recipient}} of bribes from Odebrecht in exchange of assigned public works.

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} serious {{allegation}} against the Post {{is that it is}} willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> reporting anything that is unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspection}} of railway equipment {{is essential for}} the safe movement of trains. Many types of defect detectors are in use on the world's railroads. These devices utilize technologies that vary from a simplistic paddle and switch to infrared and laser scanning, and even ultrasonic audio analysis. Their use <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> many rail accidents over the 70 years they have been used.|$|E
25|$|The United States Marine Corps <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> the Super Hornet program over {{fears that}} any Super Hornet buys {{will be at}} the cost of the F-35B STOVL fighters that they intend to operate from amphibious ships. Resistance is so high that they would rather fly former Navy F/A-18Cs. As a concession, the Marine Corps has agreed to {{eventually}} equip five Marine fighter-attack squadrons (VMFA) with the F-35C carrier variant to continue to augment Navy carrier air wings as they currently do with the F/A-18C.|$|E

25|$|The new {{delineation}} of seas being subdivisions of oceans <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> {{the need}} to interrupt the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean where intersected by Drake Passage which includes all of the waters from South America to the Antarctic coast, nor interrupt it for the Scotia Sea, which also extends below the 60th parallel south. The new delineation of seas has also meant that the long-time named seas around Antarctica, excluded from the 1953 edition (the 1953 map did not even extend that far south), are 'automatically' part of the Southern Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{acceptance}} of miscegenation, Brazil <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> the binary polarization of society into black and white. In addition, it abolished slavery without a civil war. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were racially mixed, up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the increases to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities.|$|E
25|$|During the Persian Gulf War, Iran-Oman {{relations}} were damaged after Iran began running attacks on tanker {{movements in the}} Persian Gulf and placed anti-ship missile launchers along the Strait of Hormuz. The Gulf neighbors have since restored their ties and have conducted joint military exercises as recently as February 2011. Oman’s leader Sultan Qaboos traveled to Iran in 2009 {{for the first time}} since Iran’s 1979 revolution. Though on two occasions the U.S. has dispatched high-level officials to discuss Iran with Oman, the fact that Oman <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> publicly expressing any concerns regarding Iran’s nuclear program is likely a reason why the two states have managed to maintain strong ties.|$|E

50|$|The Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles <b>have</b> <b>avoided</b> {{the wooden}} spoon in their seventy {{completed}} seasons since entering {{the competition in}} 1947 (this period includes the three-year merger period with the North Sydney Bears when the club {{was part of the}} Northern Eagles). The closest the club came was in its first year of 1947 and in 2003 with second last placings. They are the only current pre-1982 club to <b>have</b> <b>avoided</b> the wooden spoon.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{some early}} press predictions, in general Clinton's {{departmental}} staff <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> {{the kind of}} leaks and infighting that troubled her 2008 presidential campaign. One possibly lingering line of internal tension was resolved in early 2011 when State Department spokesperson P. J. Crowley resigned after making personal comments about in-captivity leaker Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley Manning) and her treatment by the Department of Defense. In other changes, Jacob Lew left in late 2010 to join the White House as Office of Management and Budget and was replaced as Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources by Thomas R. Nides (Lew would eventually become White House Chief of Staff and then the pick for U.S. Treasury Secretary for Obama's second term), and Steinberg left in mid-2011 and was replaced as Deputy Secretary by career diplomat William J. Burns.|$|E
25|$|Like many {{southern}} Afghan provinces, Ghazni has {{a precarious}} security situation. The Taliban insurgents {{are found in}} the rural areas outside of the capital, and are involved in attacks on provincial schools and government infrastructure. The province <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> the outright warfare seen in other provinces of Afghanistan such as Helmand and Kandahar, but that is due more to political expediency and the tactical plans of the NATO-led ISAF force than the existence of a stable security situation in the province. Ex-Governor Taj Mohammad was killed by insurgents in 2006 after being appointed police chief of the province with a mandate to quell the power of the Taliban. On the same day there was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the governor at the time, Sher Alam Ibrahimi. There is a Polish and American Provincial Reconstruction Team base located in Ghazni.|$|E
25|$|Billings {{is located}} in the south-central portion of the state and is the seat of Yellowstone County, which had a 2015 {{population}} of 157,048. The 2015 Census estimates put the Billings population at 110,263, making it the only city in Montana with over 100,000 people. The city is experiencing rapid growth and a strong economy; it has had and is continuing to have the largest growth of any city in Montana. Parts of the metro area are seeing hyper growth. From 2000 to 2010 Lockwood, an eastern suburb of the city, saw growth of 57.8%, the largest growth rate of any community in Montana. Billings <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> the economic downturn that affected most of the nation 2008–2012 as well as avoiding the housing bust. With the Bakken oil development in eastern Montana and western North Dakota, the largest oil discovery in U.S. history, as well as the Heath shale oil discovery just north of Billings, the city's already rapid growth rate is escalating.|$|E

The album was delayed for over a year by conflicts at American, both internal and over its production, and was ultimately released in late 1998 by SpinArt Records in the US. Since leaving American, Black <b>has</b> <b>avoided</b> long-term contracts with labels, and has maintained ownership of his album masters, licensing each album individually for release.|$|E
