50|$|Interpersonal {{relationships}} {{are seen as}} inherently transformative in CMT, and the therapeutic relationship {{is seen as a}} context where the patient <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>and</b> change is likely to occur under the right conditions. It is held that the therapeutic relationship in itself may help patients overcome pathogenic beliefs, through what is called treatment by attitude. Therapists are assumed to consciously and unconsciously convey attitudes about the patient through their actions, words, silences, mannerisms, and affective responses or the lack of them. Similarly, the patient is assumed to be especially attentive, both consciously and unconsciously, toward therapist attitudes that relate to their own goals and pathogenic beliefs. It is believed that the therapeutic relationship may be transformative when the patient feels safe in the relationship, and perceives the therapist's attitudes toward them as disconfirming a pathogenic belief. Treatment by attitude may be planned according to the therapist's understanding of the patient's history and psychology, or happen spontaneously and outside the conscious awareness of either participant. The concept of treatment by attitudes can be likened to the concept of the corrective emotional experience described by Alexander and French in 1946, but there are some differences. In CMT, the therapeutic work is viewed more as a collaborative effort. CMT underlines that patients play an active role in seeking out experiences that will lead to progress, and coach the therapists in how to help them.|$|E

50|$|Age, {{proficiency}} level, {{and social}} factors {{play a role}} in the way attrition occurs. Most often younger children are quicker than adults to lose their L2 when it is left unused. However, if a child has established a high level of proficiency, it may take him or her several years to lose the language. Proficiency level seems to play the largest role in the extent of attrition. For very proficient individuals, there is a period of time where very little, if any, attrition is observed. For some, residual learning might even occur, which is the apparent improvement within the L2. Within the first five years of language disuse, the total percentage of language knowledge lost is less for a proficient individual than for someone less proficient. A cognitive psychological explanation for this suggests that a higher level of proficiency involves the use of schemas, or mental representations for linguistic structures. Schemas involve deeper mental processes for mental retrieval that are resistant to attrition. As a result, information that is tied to this system is less likely to experience less extreme attrition than information that is not. Finally, social factors may play an indirect role in attrition. In particular, motivation and attitude influence the process. Higher levels of motivation, and a positive attitude toward the language and the corresponding community may lessen attrition. This is likely due to the higher level of competence achieved in L2 when the learner <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>and</b> has a positive attitude.|$|E
5000|$|Marine {{biologist}} Wesley R. Elsberry {{and critic}} of creationism reviewed {{the book in}} 1999. Elsberry described the book as [...] "...a slim and scholarly volume, as one expects from a distinguished academic press with clear writing, illustrative examples, and cogent argumentation. The work, though, <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>and</b> informed by an anti-evolutionary impulse, and its flaws appear to follow from the need to achieve an anti-evolutionary aim. The anti-evolutionary bent is not as overt here, though, {{as it is in}} other works by Dembski". Elsberry criticizes the book for using a definition of [...] "design" [...] as what is left over after chance and regularity have been eliminated, and for using an argument that excludes natural selection a priori in order to conclude the existence of a designer when in fact natural selection fits Dembski's argument just as easily. Elsberry concludes: The Design Inference is a work with great significance for the group of anti-evolutionists who have embraced [...] "intelligent design" [...] as their organizing principle. TDI is supposed to establish the theoretical foundation for {{all the rest of the}} movement. My judgment is that it fails to lay a solid foundation. There are flaws and cracks that can admit the entry of naturalistic causes into the pool of [...] "designed" [...] events. It is unfortunate that Dembski's focus is the establishment of [...] "intelligent design" [...] as an anti-evolutionary alternative, for his insights into elimination of chance hypotheses would appear to have legitimate application to various outstanding research questions, such as resolving certain issues in animal cognition and intelligence. Despite Dembski's commentary in his First Things article, there appears to be no justification for the claim that biologists must now admit design (in its old, agency-laden sense) into biological explanation to any greater degree than it is already used.

Conclusions: <b>Motivating,</b> recognizing <b>and</b> rewarding IT-professionals is a severely complicated issue of great importance to both employers and employees. IT-professionals {{does not appear to}} <b>be</b> fully <b>motivated</b> <b>and</b> recognized and they would do a better work if they where, according to them self.
