60|$|These things {{gave them}} a rough and disagreeable {{appearance}} with the generality; who thought them turners of the world upside down, as, indeed, in some sense they were: but in no other than that wherein Paul was so charged, viz. To bring things back into their primitive and right order again. For these and such like practices of theirs were {{not the result of}} humour, or for civil distinction, as some have fancied; but a fruit of inward sense, which God through his holy fear, had begotten in them. They did not consider how to contradict the world, or distinguish themselves as a party from others; it being none of their business, as it was not their interest; no, it was not the result of consultation, or a <b>framed</b> <b>design,</b> by which to declare or recommend schism or novelty. But God having given them a sight of themselves, they saw the whole world in the same glass of truth; and sensibly discerned the affections and passions of men, and the rise and tendency of things; what it was that gratified the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, which are not of the Father, but of the world. And from thence sprang, in the night of darkness and apostacy, which hath been over people through their degeneration from the light and Spirit of God, these and many other vain customs, which are seen, by the heavenly day of Christ that dawns in the soul, to be either wrong in their original, or, by time and abuse, hurtful in their practice. And though these things seemed trivial to some, and rendered these people stingy and conceited in such persons' opinion; there was and is more in them, than they were, or are, aware of.|$|E

It was exhibited - but not flown - at the Paris Air Show in 1919. Official interest in metal frame designs led to an order of a single Boulton & Paul Bolton, a twin-engine bomber design. In the same period Boulton & Paul produced another metal <b>framed</b> <b>design,</b> the Bodmin, with its engines in the fuselage. North believed that a metal frame could be 10% lighter than an equivalent wooden frame.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} design {{gradually}} diverges from its conceptualization as <b>framed</b> <b>design</b> projects {{that focus on}} the production of objects. It shifts to open-ended processes that are oriented toward the creation of services and the congregation of organizations. In the participatory design (PD) scene the emerging future-oriented design-after-design approach is understood as a process of ‘infrastructuring’. The co-design process of Recup’Kitchen is described as an example of an infrastructuring design practice within the Brussels urban living lab of the Incubators of Public Spaces research. The empirical findings of the related action-research bring up the importance of ‘wandering’ in the design process. The design journey unfolds as an explorative endeavor without a clearly outlined direction. The paper argues that this wandering contributed to a process of infrastructuring. Three factors of the wandering in the Recup’Kitchen design are discussed: multi-layered openness, future-oriented incompleteness and strategic dialogue. This framework is based on a combination of a theoretical framework and the empirical findings within the Recup’Kitchen case. Together these factors of wandering illustrate how such a design approach can benefit infrastructuring activities. Recognizing the benefits of a loss of control and an entanglement in the messiness, the article suggests implementing this spontaneous wandering practice as a design strategy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Exploring the Effects of Problem Framing on Solution Shifts: A Case Analysis Both {{students}} in engineering and practicing engineers are continually challenged with new problems to solve. We {{propose that the}} way the problem is presented will influence the engineer’s ideation processes, and eventually, the design outcomes. In our previous research, we developed three categories of framings for design problem statements based on Kirton’s Adaption-Innovation theory: (1) neutral framing, (2) adaptive framing, and (3) innovative framing. The neutral framing is intended to leave designers uninfluenced {{with respect to their}} natural ideation processes. The adaptive framing offers additional constraints to the problem,encouraging designers to generate practical solutions based on pre-existing designs. The innovative framing is constructed to push designers towards radical solutions that are not based on pre-existing designs. In this paper, we aimed to test to what extent and in what ways students shift their design ideas based on how the design problems were framed. A study was conducted with 36 prospective engineering students participating in a high school summer outreach program at a large Midwestern university. Students were first given a neutrally framed problem statement and asked to generate solutions to the problem using visual and verbal depictions. After this ideation session, they were given either an adaptively or innovatively framed problem statement for a different design problem. Following each ideation session,students were asked to complete a reflection survey to provide some insight into how they perceived their own ideation during the session. We used the concept of paradigm relatedness as our primary lens to explore how students’ ideas were influenced by different problem framings. Paradigm relatedness was defined as the extent to which an idea preserves the focus, assumptions, elements, and relationships associated with the problem definition. Based on these four facets of paradigm relatedness, ideas from the study were coded into one of two general types of paradigm relatedness: paradigm preserving and paradigm modifying. Using the coded results, we analyzed the effect of problem framing on the paradigm relatedness of individual solutions. We identified students whose ideas shifted between paradigm modifying and paradigm preserving when framing changed, as well as students whose ideas remained consistent within one type of paradigm relatedness despite framing changes. We analyzed cases of students of each type, using their generated idea sets and reflection surveys to describe the influence of the <b>framed</b> <b>design</b> problem statements on their ideation approaches...|$|E
