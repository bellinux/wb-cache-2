40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{adhesive}} wear {{characterization of}} MoS 2, PTFE and mixture of MoS 2 and PTFE films coated on stainless steel substrate, i. e. SUS 440 C, have been studied. The films were deposited by <b>dry</b> <b>spray</b> techniquecommercially available domestically. The films properties which are surface hardness, film thickness, surface roughness and adhesion strength were investigated. The thickness {{and the surface}} hardness of the films were approx. 7, 6. 8 and 6. 2 µm and 0. 1, 0, 8 and 0. 4 GPa for MoS 2, PTFE and the mixture of MoS 2 and PTFE, respectively. The surface roughness of MoS 2, PTFEwerefound to be similar with the value of Ra of approx. 0. 302 - 0. 303 µm. The mixture of MoS 2 and PTFE showed smoother surface with the surface roughness (Ra) of approx. 0. 260 µm. The PTFE film has shown better adhesion strength with higher critical load for first failure and full delamination. However, the failure pattern observed suggested lower severity of surface damage. Theresults fromtribologicaltests between the coated SUS 440 C ball and the SUS 304 discshowedstrong effect of the coating on adhesive wear behavior of the contacting systems. For MoS 2 coated surface, the coatingsurface peeled offgraduallyuntil the surface ofthe substrate was revealed. Whereas, the PTFEcoated surface had delaminated immediately once in contact resulting in plate liked wear debris. The mixture ofMoS 2 andPTFE haslower thefriction coefficient compared to the individual coating. Thewearbehavior found on the mixture of MoS 2 and PTFE coated surface had similar characteristic to those found on surfacecoatingwithMoS 2. It also showed lower wear occurrences with better appearance due to tearing wearat {{the edges of the}} worn suggesting better load capacity of the mixed film than the individual PTFE coating...|$|E

Dissolution and triboelectric charging was also conducted. The {{results showed that the}} <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM alone, without GLU produced some PXM form II (DSC results) with no enhancement in solubility relative to that of the parent PXM. XRPD results also showed the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process to decrease the crystallinity of GLU and solid dispersions produced. The presence of GLU improved the dissolution rate of PXM. <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM: GLU at a ratio of 2 : 1 had the most improved dissolution. The <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process generally yielded PXM-GLU spherical particles of around 2. 5 µm which {{may have contributed to the}} improved dissolution. PXM showed a higher tendency for charging in comparison to the carrier GLU (- 3. 8 versus 0. 5 nC/g for untreated material and - 7. 5 versus 3. 1 nC/g for <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> materials). <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> PXM and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> GLU demonstrated higher charge densities than untreated PXM and untreated GLU, respectively.

Seven commercially available pre-packaged repair mortars were pumped and sprayed through a worm pump, three through a piston pump and two through a <b>dry</b> <b>spray</b> machine. A laboratory designed mortar was also worm and piston pumped. The properties measured included compressive and flexural strength, tensile bond strength, hardened density, modulus of elasticity, air permeability, sorptivity and drying and restrained shrinkage. In-situ test specimens were extracted from 500 mmx 500 mmx 100 mm deep sprayed panels. Tests were also conducted on corresponding cast specimens and, where possible, on specimens that had been sprayed directly into a cube or beam mould. A new test to quantify the degree of reinforcement encasement has been developed and an initial investigation into the measurement of the restrained shrinkage of in-situ repairs is presented. The compressive and flexural strengths of the laboratory mix were comparable with the best of the commercially available preblended mortars. The values for modulus of elasticity, when compared with the compressive strength, were lower than published formulas for this relationship would suggest, especially at lower strengths. The air permeability of most of the mortars was lower than that for normal wet-cured concrete and decreased with an increase in compressive strength. The sorptivity values showed no clear relationship with the compressive strength. The type of wet-process pump was found to have little effect on the insitu compressive and flexural strengths, but did affect the bond strength, although mainly due to the stream velocity and w/c ratio rather than the pumping process. The pump type also effected the reinforcement encasement with higher stream velocities producing better encasement. The mixes exhibited a wide range of drying shrinkage, but the data from the restrained specimens suggest an actual repair is influenced as much by ambient conditions as it is by the mix proportions...|$|E

Methods: The sCT-CS-NPs were prepared by the ionic gelation method using sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking polyion. Inhalable dry powders were obtained by co-spray drying aqueous dispersion of sCT-CS-NPs and mannitol. sCT-CS-NPs co-spray dried powders were characterized with respect to morphology, particle size, powder density, aerodynamic diameter, protein integrity, in vitro release of sCT, and aerosolization. The plasmatic sCT levels following intratracheal administration of sCT-CS-NPs <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> powders to the rats was also determined. Results: sCT-CS-NPs were able to be incorporated into mannitol forming inhalable microparticles by the <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process. The sCT-CS-NPs/mannitol ratios and <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process affected the properties of the microparticles obtained.

As such, they can realize {{a much higher}} production per square meter than traditional agricultural plants. Furthermore, they are poor in structural polysaccharides and richer in proteins and lipids.

In order to use microalgal biomass in food or feed, processing and storage is required. However, these steps can alter the chemical composition of the microalgae. Lipids can be oxidized, lipolysis can occur, carotenoids can be broken down. Therefore, short-term storage of fresh algae was compared to direct lyophilization and <b>spray</b> <b>drying.</b> Furthermore, the influence of different storage times (14 and 35 days) at different temperatures (- 20 °C, 4 °C, 20 °C) was investigated on the vacuum packed lyophilized and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae. The same tests were performed on not vacuum packed lyophilized and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microalgae stored at 4 °C.

However, there have been concerns about its biosafety, particularly during periods of emergence or re-emergence of swine diseases in different regions of the world, such as the recent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus outbreak in North America. The objectives of this paper are to review recent publications about the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma as an alternative to antibiotics in weaned pig diets, the possible mechanisms of action of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, and the existing evidence related to the biosafety of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> animal plasma. Particular attention is given to studies in which <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma has been directly compared to antibiotics or other alternative antimicrobial products. Several studies on the possible modes of action for <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma, such as preservation of gut barrier function or modulation of the immune response, are also reviewed. Finally, the paper focuses on the review of the existing studies on the risks of disease transmission with the use of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma from porcine origin. Overall, <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> plasma is a promising alternative to in-feed antimicrobials for piglets, particularly during the early stages of the post-weaning phase. Additionally, there is enough evidence to support that commercial <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> porcine plasma is a safe product for pigs...|$|R
40|$|The main {{goals of}} this thesis are to {{understand}} the supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> mechanisms and parameters that influence the stability of proteins, to evaluate the excipients to stabilize protein formulations during scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying,</b> and to study the scalability of the scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process. For this study, lysozyme and myoglobin were used as model proteins. More specifically, the detailed aims are as follows: 1) to study the scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> parameters (i. e., pressure, protein solution and CO 2 flow rate, feed volume) {{without the use of}} organic solvents, in order to produce dried protein formulations with minimal residual water content in a single drying step, 2) to evaluate the scalability of the scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> process, 3) To gain fundamental insight into the effect of the CO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> parameters at sub- and supercritical conditions (65 - 130 bar and 25 - 50 °C) on the stability of myoglobin, 4) {{to understand the}} effect of the CO 2 /water interface and pH shift on heme destabilization and aggregation in myoglobin solutions using a gas bubbling method at atmospheric conditions, 5) to evaluate the influence of pharmaceutical excipients on the stability of myoglobin in terms of heme binding and aggregation during scCO 2 <b>spray</b> <b>drying...</b>|$|R
40|$|Carbamazepine, an {{antiepileptic}} drug, exhibits poor {{water solubility}} and flow properties, poor dissolution and poor wetting. Consequently, {{the aim of}} this study was to improve the dissolution of Carbamazepine. Microparticle containing Carbamazepine was produced by <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> using Isopropyl alcohol and water in the ratio of 40 : 60 (v/v) as solvent system to enhance dissolution rate. The prepared formulations were evaluated for in vitro dissolution and solubility. The prepared drug particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Dissolution profile of the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> microparticle was compared with pure sample and recrystallized sample. <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> microparticle exhibited decreased crystallinity and improved micromeritic properties. The dissolution of the <b>Spray</b> <b>dried</b> microparticle was improved compared with recrystallized and pure sample of Carbamazepine. Consequently, it was believed that <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> of Carbamazepine is a useful tool to improve dissolution. Hence this <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> technique can be used for formulation of tablets of Carbamazepine by direct compression with directly compressible tablet excipients...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of suspensions containing vacuum freeze <b>dried</b> and <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> starch nanoparticles was investigated {{to explore the}} effect of these two drying methods in producing starch nanoparticles which were synthesized using high pressure homogenization and mini-emulsion cross-linking technique. Suspensions containing 10 % (w/w) <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> and vacuum freeze dried nanoparticles were prepared. The continuous shear viscosity tests, temperature sweep tests, the frequency sweep and creep-recovery tests were carried out, respectively. The suspensions containing vacuum freeze dried nanoparticles showed higher apparent viscosity within shear rate range (0. 1 - 100 s(- 1)) and temperature range (25 - 90 degrees C). The suspensions containing vacuum freeze dried nanoparticles were found to have more shear thinning and less thixotropic behavior compared to those containing <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> nanoparticles. In addition, the suspensions containing vacuum freeze dried particles had stronger elastic structure. However, the suspensions containing <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> nanoparticles had more stiffness and greater tendency to recover from the deformation...|$|R
40|$|Survival of Lactobacillus bulgaricus during <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> was {{studied at}} various outlet air temperatures. During <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> the {{logarithmic}} survival ratio decreased with increased outlet air temperature with first-order kinetics; the pseudo-z value for Lactobacillus bulgaricus was 17. 3 °C. Plots of the death-rate constant for Lactobacillus bulgaricus versus reciprocal outlet temperature during <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> in skim milk show a curve with two different activation energies (Ea). The calculated Ea values were 33. 47 kJ/mol above 70 °C and 85. 77 kJ/mol below 70 °C. Thermodynamic quantities for <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> of Lactobacillus bulgaricus are also presented. Results {{show that the}} relationship between the entropy of activation and the enthalpy of activation for both <b>spray</b> <b>drying</b> and heating in liquid medium is linear, with all the data for drying falling in the range of a negative entropy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> lactose as carrier for dry powder inhalation (DPI). The lactose particles were prepared by <b>spray</b> <b>drying,</b> then the particle size, shape and crystal form were characterized by laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> lactose particles were spherical and amorphous, but would transfer to crystal form when storage humidity was above 32 %. Thus, the humidity of the storage environment should be controlled below 30 % strictly in order to maintain the amorphous nature of <b>spray</b> <b>dried</b> lactose which is a great benefit to DPI development...|$|R
