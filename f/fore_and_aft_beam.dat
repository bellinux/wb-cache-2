ERS- 1 AMI scatterometer mode data sets from several study regions dispersed in the Antarctic seasonal sea ice pack are evaluated for azimuthal modulation. When appropriate, the incidence angle dependence is estimated and removed in a study region before determining whether azimuthal modulation is present in the data. Other comparisons are made using the <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> <b>beam</b> measurement difference. Our results show that over the ice pack, azimuthal modulation is less than 1 dB at the scale of observation of the ERS- 1 C-band scatterometer. I...|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} wood deck would {{consist of}} planks laid <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> over <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> along carlins, the seams of which are caulked and paid with tar. A yacht or other fancy boat might then have the deck canvased, with the fabric laid down in {{a thick layer of}} paint or sealant, and additional coats painted over. The wash or apron boards form the joint between the deck planking and that of the topsides, and are caulked similarly.|$|R
500|$|The {{armament}} of the Minotaur-class ships {{was intended}} to be 40 rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns on the main deck and 10 more on the upper deck on pivot mounts. The gun was a new design from Armstrong, but proved a failure a few years after its introduction. The gun was withdrawn before any were received by any of the Minotaur-class ships. They were armed, instead, with a mix of [...] and [...] rifled muzzle-loading guns. All 4 nine-inch and 20 seven-inch guns were mounted on the main deck while 4 seven-inch guns were fitted on the upper deck as chase guns. The ship also received eight brass howitzers for use as [...] The gun ports were [...] wide which allowed each gun to fire 30° <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> of the <b>beam.</b>|$|R

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar {{with multiple}} channels separated in along-track direction allows for GMTI such as detection of road traffic. With TerraSAR-X two receive channels separated in along-track direction {{can either be}} realized through switching between the <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> antenna halves on a pulse to pulse basis, or with the dual receive antenna (DRA) mode. While the switching in the single channel switched aperture mode is implemented by alternately applying attenuation to the <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> antenna halves, in the DRA mode the signals of the <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> antenna halves are combined by a hybrid coupler generating the sum and difference channel data. By use of the redundant receiver unit both channels are sampled separately. <b>Fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> channel signals have to be reconstructed in the signal processing step. In this paper the <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> channel reconstruction in the TerraSAR-X dual receive antenna mode is described. Then, the residual imbalances are modeled into the transfer function in order to analyze the quality of signal reconstruction and draw conclusions on the ground moving target indication (GMTI) performance of this two-channel mode. The theoretical results derived are validated with experimental data and GMTI results are shown...|$|R
