5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement, now known as base units. Derived units were built up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based and identified by a standard set of prefixes.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{announced}} that they would support the game with downloadable content for at least 2 years. The DLC packs are both story-based and content-based, and added in elements that were cut <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> game, such as Shale, a stone-based companion who always gets stuck in doors and causes trouble with the camera system. A crossover with Mass Effect 2, an item called the Blood Dragon Armor, is also available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|Flights are {{generally}} of short duration, rapid, low-leveled, and wavelike. The wings during flight are flapped rapidly, and are frequently used during foraging. They are also capable of flying vertically <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> {{of a tree}} to the top in a single wing assisted bound.|$|E

50|$|The museum {{contains}} an AGM-28 Hound Dog missile, various mementos <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base's</b> history, and other displays. The missile {{also has been}} painted in authentic markings which it would have carried when it was stationed at Loring. Additionally, the center contains mementos <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base's</b> former Central Heat Plant, which was demolished in 2011. According to the center, this was done because many people were interested in seeing the plant's history preserved.|$|R

5|$|In early December, the US {{military}} personnel occupying the base, {{along with all}} military equipment, were shifted to the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan via US military aircraft. On 10 December, Pakistani troops from the Frontier Corps took full control of the airfield as scheduled, and by 11 December all remaining American staff were evacuated. Upon establishing control of the airfield, the United States flag was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> and replaced with the flag of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|In the announcement, McHugh {{denied that}} the move was made in {{response}} to several high-profile misconduct allegations leveled against soldiers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> in the Afghanistan War such as the Maywand District murders and the Kandahar massacre. Major General Stephen R. Lanza, the Army's chief of public affairs, was tapped to lead the division. It activated on the base on 10 October 2012. Lanza became Commanding General of I Corps in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Meso{{cyclones}}, tornadoes {{and dust}} devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without {{the presence of}} a surface low, and can pinch off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune.|$|E

5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the pedestal.|$|E
5|$|The derived {{units in}} the SI are formed by powers, {{products}} or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number. Derived units are associated with derived quantities, for example velocity is a quantity that is derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> quantities of time and length, so in SI the derived unit is metres per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units can be {{expressed in terms of}} the dimensions of the base units.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{of an individual}} scleractinian polyp {{is known as a}} corallite. It is secreted by the epidermis of {{the lower part of the}} body, and initially forms a cup surrounding this part of the polyp. The interior of the cup contains radially aligned plates, or septa, projecting upwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> Each of these plates is flanked by a pair of mesenteries.|$|E

5|$|Tintin {{sets out}} to locate the spies, telling Haddock to follow <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> as he {{suspects}} a mole is on the inside. Wolff follows Haddock out of suspicion. When Tintin spots the paratroopers, he is shot before {{he is able to}} do anything. Simultaneously, the base experiences a power outage, and confusion ensues, with neither Haddock nor Wolff capable of explaining clearly what happened.|$|E
5|$|All {{communication}} from mobile terminals {{to the base}} stations is encrypted with a key known only to the base station and the terminal. For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted {{all the way through}} the network from the one user to the other.|$|E
5|$|As a multirole aircraft, the Tornado {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type– the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out– either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the Tornado ECR. The most extensive modification <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> Tornado design was the Tornado ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles {{to serve in the}} interceptor role.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{artillery}} bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of Huong Hoa District. The village, three kilometers south of the base, was defended by 160 local troops, plus 15 American advisers and heavy artillery provided <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> At dawn of 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong NVA battalion. Reinforcements were dispatched aboard nine UH-1 helicopters, but were wiped out after landing near the NVA, along with one helicopter. A small ground rescue force from the nearby combat base was repulsed, while the survivors from the village assault evacuated themselves to the combat base. The NVA fought throughout the day, into the next night, and finally completed the capture of Khe Sanh village at 09:30 on 22 January.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, the {{sanctuary}} was extended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the podium across the valley. To the east {{base of the}} podium stands a large chapel, , dating to the 4thcentury BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone throne carved of a single block of granite in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th century BC chapel—centered on a bull protome topped capital—that remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the Little Ice Age, which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the Little Ice Age, the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of leaf spot of mustard (cv. BARI sharisha 13) grown in different orientations and distances under around {{twelve years old}} Akashmoni (Acacia auriculiformis) tree was studied in the field laboratory of the Department of Agroforestry, BAU, Mymensingh during 2004 - 05. The assessment result showed that the disease incidence was higher near <b>the</b> tree <b>base</b> in every side (1 m <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>base)</b> and higher in North side in all distances at different date of sowing. The lowest disease incidences were found in South orientations 3 m <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>base</b> and highest in North 1 m <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>base.</b> <b>The</b> siliqua infection significantly influenced on crop yield. The highest seed yield was observed in South orientation 3 m <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>base</b> and lowest in North 1 m <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>base</b> plot. <b>The</b> distance and orientation showed marked effect in disease development at different date after sowing. In open field condition (control) disease incidence also affect on yield and statistically different from tree-crop combination...|$|R
5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of one statue in particular {{as part of his}} damnatio memoriae. Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Company C, 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment was {{deployed}} to the Horn of Africa and stationed at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, after completing a 14-month deployment at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Company C carried the crew-served weapons {{to protect the}} camp. It also operated the entry control checkpoints, protected U.S. and allied ships at the massive Djibouti Port, and guarded the U.S. Embassy there. By mid-2009, {{the rest of the}} battalion deployed there in case a larger combat maneuver element was needed to operate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> The area is considered to be the most unstable part of Africa, and the Somali border is less than 10 miles from Camp Lemonnier.|$|E
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a limited range of depths. As the parameters move away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
