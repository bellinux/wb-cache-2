30|$|Akari [4] {{adopted an}} ID/Loc {{splitting}} solution to support mobility and multihoming of real world equipment. It {{creates a new}} namespace between network and transport layers: the ID layer. Host identification can be performed in two ways: by a readable, unique local name; or by an identifier obtained {{as the result of}} a hash function. The names can be local or global. Local names are unique on the local network and are used for host identification and network management. Local names are generated by the combination of representative host-related words, i.e. their function in context, owner, serial number or date and time of installation. Global names include the local names, as well as additional hierarchical topology information. The overall solution is based on three mapping systems: identity management server (<b>IMS),</b> <b>name</b> mapping server (NMS), and location management server (LMS). The IMS holds the local dynamic mapping among names, IDs, and locators. The NMS deals with global static information mapping, like in the current DNS. More specifically, the NMS provides the mapping between the global part of the nodes names to the locators of domain specific identity management servers (IMSs). The LMS maps IDs to global locators.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{two most}} popular text-messaging systems {{nowadays}} are Instant Messaging (IM) and Short Messaging System (SMS). IM runs in computers, where SMS runs through mobile phones. Nowadays, there are numerous efforts done to merge the functionalities of IM into mobile phone. This {{is due to the}} fact that IM can provide “presence ” of users and less costly. In order to provide the best satisfaction to its users, the mobile IM should be able to communicate to multiple IM service providers. In relation to that, this paper presents the research conducted to develop a mobile <b>IM</b> <b>named</b> Message Conveying System (MCS) that allows it to enable communication with other IM service providers. This was made possible through the implementation of Jabber protocol in MCS, which results in its interoperability with other Jabber-based IM service providers. The MCS was tested to be successfully run on the mobile phone and communicate with the other two Jabberbased IM service providers; Psi and Spark. Key-Words:- Mobile instant messaging, IM, Jabber. ...|$|R

50|$|Eforward {{was created}} in 1992 and in 1999 was {{assigned}} the IP port number 2181 by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The protocol continues to be used under the Secure Easy <b>IM</b> (Seim) <b>name.</b> Originally the protocol was peer to peer but was changed to client server with peer to peer features.

EForward uses one port, 2181, in either TCP or UDP mode to transfer files between a client and the server. The major objective of the protocol {{is to provide a}} known level of service: The documents sent from one client to another should never be in an unknown state, at any time.

40|$|Influence {{maximization}} (IM), which {{selects a}} set of k users (called seeds) to maximize the influence spread over a social network, is a fundamental problem {{in a wide range}} of applications such as viral marketing and network monitoring. Existing IM solutions fail to consider the highly dynamic nature of social influence, which results in either poor seed qualities or long processing time when the network evolves. To address this problem, we define a novel <b>IM</b> query <b>named</b> Stream Influence Maximization (SIM) on social streams. Technically, SIM adopts the sliding window model and maintains {{a set of}} k seeds with the largest influence value over the most recent social actions. Next, we propose the Influential Checkpoints (IC) framework to facilitate continuous SIM query processing. The IC framework creates a checkpoint for each window slide and ensures an ε-approximate solution. To improve its efficiency, we further devise a Sparse Influential Checkpoints (SIC) framework which selectively keeps O(N/β) checkpoints for a sliding window of size N and maintains an ε(1 -β) / 2 -approximate solution. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed frameworks against the state-of-the-art IM approaches.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a {{hardware and software}} solution for a speed-sensorless control of an induction motor. (<b>IM).</b> Despite the <b>name,</b> sensorless AC drives actually rely on current and voltage sensor circuits {{to make up for}} the lack of motor-shaft feedback used in closed-loop control. Sophisticated motor models and math-intensive algorithms transform the sensor inputs via ever-faster processors to derive the flux and torque components needed for IM control. Sensorless AC drives fill the middle ground between high-performance closed-loop control and simpler open-loop (or V/Hz) control of Ims. Sensorless control achieves near-closed-loop performance without a motor feedback device, and lower life-cycle cost. The thesis describes advanced, fully digital speed-sensorless IM drives, which employ Natural Field Orientation (NFO).

Wiskoski played the role to the hilt, growing out his facial hair, donning red robes and a stocking cap, much like the Bhagwan himself. During this time he managed Kendo Nagasaki.|$|R
