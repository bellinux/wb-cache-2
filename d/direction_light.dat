5000|$|The {{earliest}} predecessors {{of the eye}} were photoreceptor {{proteins that}} sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called [...] "eyespots". Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They are insufficient for vision, as they cannot distinguish shapes or determine the <b>direction</b> <b>light</b> is coming from. Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups, and are common among unicellular organisms, including euglena. The euglena's eyespot, called a stigma, is located at its anterior end. It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals. Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light, often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis, and to predict day and night, the primary function of circadian rhythms. Visual pigments {{are located in the}} brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{academics}} {{have proposed that}} the Vikings also developed more advanced aids to navigation, {{such as the use}} of a sun compass. A wooden half-disc found on the shores of Narsarsuaq, Greenland initially seemed to support this hypothesis. However, further investigation of the object revealed that the slits inscribed in the disc are disproportionately spaced, and so the object could not in fact function as an accurate compass. Rather it has been suggested that the instrument is instead a “confession disc” used by priests to count the number of confessions in their parish. Similarly, researchers and historians continually debate the use of the sunstone in Viking navigation. Because a sunstone is able to polarize light, it is a plausible method for determining direction. By showing which <b>direction</b> <b>light</b> waves are oscillating, the sunstone has the potential to show the sun’s position even when the sun is obscured by clouds. The stone changes to a certain color, based on the direction of the waves, but only when the object is held in an area with direct sunlight. Thus, most scholars debate the reliability and the plausibility of using a navigational tool that can only determine direction in such limited conditions.|$|E

40|$|The retina {{processes}} {{visual images}} to compute {{features such as}} the direction of image motion. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs), axonless feed-forward interneurons, are essential components of the retinal direction-selective circuitry. Recent work has highlighted that SAC-mediated dendro-dendritic inhibition controls the action potential output of direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) by vetoing dendritic spike initiation. However, SACs co-release GABA and the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine at dendritic sites. Here we use direct dendritic recordings to show that preferred <b>direction</b> <b>light</b> stimuli evoke SAC-mediated acetylcholine release, which powerfully controls the stimulus sensitivity, receptive field size and action potential output of ON-DSGCs by acting as an excitatory drive for the initiation of dendritic spikes. Consistent with this, paired recordings reveal that the activation of single ON-SACs drove dendritic spike generation, because of predominate cholinergic excitation received on the preferred side of ON-DSGCs. Thus, dendro-dendritic release of neurotransmitters from SACs bi-directionally gate dendritic spike initiation to control the directionally selective action potential output of retinal ganglion cells...|$|E
40|$|Stimulated Brillouin {{scattering}} (SBS) {{is a very}} fundamental {{interaction between}} light and travelling acoustic waves, which is mainly attributed to the electrostriction and photoelastic effects with the interaction strength being orders of magnitude larger than other nonlinearities. Although various photonic applications for all-optical light controlling based on SBS have been achieved in optical fiber and waveguides, the coherent light-acoustic interaction remains a challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrated the Brillouin scattering induced transparency (BSIT) in a high quality optical microresonantor. Benefited from the triple-resonance in the whispering gallery cavity, the photon-phonon interaction is enhanced, and enables the light storage to the phonon, which has lifetime up to 10 us. In addition, due to the phase matching condition, the stored circulating acoustic phonon can only interact with certain <b>direction</b> <b>light,</b> which leads to non-reciprocal light storage and retrieval. Our work paves the way towards the low power consumption integrated all-optical switching, isolator and circulator, as well as quantum memory. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new type of}} optical isolator based on breaking time reversal symmetry in dissipative finite Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) waveguide arrays that support topological edge states {{at one end of the}} structure. In the forward propagation <b>direction,</b> <b>light</b> is launched into the edge waveguide to excite the localized topological midgap state. As a result, most of the input optical power is trans-mitted to the output port. On the other hand, backward reflected light encounters a propagation constant mismatch in that same channel which shifts the otherwise midgap state into one of the bands and hence becomes delocalized over the whole array. We show that under these conditions, a judicious spatial distribution of the optical dissipation across the structure can produce an isolation ratio of − 50 dB. The required nonreciprocal phase shift is intro-duced by depositing a magnetic garnet film only on the edge waveguide and, thus, the required magnetic field can be generated by an integrated micromagnet. Similar concepts can also be applied to SSH arrays made from optica...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A unique technique, the Doppler Picture Velocimetry (DPV), for {{measuring}} and visualizing velocities especially in hypersonic gas flows is presented. By {{means of a}} Michelson interferometer (MI) the Doppler shifted light scattered by tracers is transformed into an image showing Fizeau fringes. The image fringe distribution provides information on the Doppler frequency shift that {{is related to the}} velocity of the particles crossing the light sheet plane. To overcome former DPV disadvantages, the optical set-up and the processing scheme were significantly improved. Two schemes for fringe processing are presented: 1) a semi-automated interactive processing software and 2) a new algorithm based on a technique using Fast Fourier Transformations (FFT) to examine the DPV images in the frequency domain. This last DPV algorithm now allows an automated calculation of the velocity profiles from the Doppler pictures without manual fringe tracing as had {{to be done in the}} past. Both methods are compared by means of Mach 6 flows around a wedge and a sphere inside the ISL shock tunnel STA. The flow is seeded with TiO 2 particles. These particles are illuminated by a laser light sheet perpendicular to the main flow <b>direction.</b> <b>Light</b> observation via the MI from the side informs on the vertically oriented velocity through the DPV images...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} of light in a three-dimensional double-periodic Ag/TiO 2 multilayer metamaterial composed of coupled plasmonic waveguides operating in the visible and UV spectral range. For these frequencies, light propagation in {{the plane of the}} waveguides is described by a negative phase velocity, while for the orthogonal <b>direction</b> <b>light</b> propagation is described by a Bloch wave composed {{of a large number of}} harmonics. As a result, the material cannot generally be described by a single phase index: decomposing the Bloch wave into different harmonics we show that for the wavelength range of interest the positive index m= 1 harmonic dominates {{the propagation of}} light in the orthogonal direction. These results are corroborated by numerical simulations and optical refraction experiments on a double-periodic Ag/TiO 2 multilayer metamaterial prism in the 380 - 600 nm spectral range, which show that positive refraction associated with right-handed harmonics dominates. Studying the isofrequency contours we find that despite the occurrence of multiple harmonics the double-periodic structure can act as a flat lens: for a slab consisting of an integer number of unit cells all harmonics are degenerate and constructively interfere at the image plane. This work identifies important considerations relevant to the design of many three dimensional periodic metamaterials. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{sponsored}} by the Washington State Department of Transportation and conducted in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. This study used both standardized surveys and innovative fish tagging and tracking technologies to address whether WSF terminals alter the behavior of migrating juvenile salmon, and if so, which attributes mediate abundance patterns or behavioral changes. Results showed that juvenile salmon were observed most frequently adjacent to ferry terminals, but were also observed far from and underneath the terminals. In some situations, juvenile salmon aggregated {{near the edge of the}} ferry terminal OWS. Variations in habitat, as mediated by tidal stage (affecting current magnitude and <b>direction,</b> <b>light</b> under structures, water level) and time of day (light level, sun angle, cloud cover), likely affect salmonid movement. Juvenile chum were observed to remain on the light side of a relatively sharp light-dark “edge” over a short horizontal distance (e. g., five meters). These observations demonstrate that the shading caused by ferry terminals and other OWS characteristics can deter or delay juvenile salmonid movement, and that this effect may be decreased at low tides when ambient light can better filter beneath the terminal structure. Recommendations are made concerning the design and operation of WSF terminals with regard to minimizing the undesirable impacts of OWS on juvenile salmonid movement as well as additional research.

40|$|The Great Barrier Reef Lagoon (GBRL) {{is an area}} {{of great}} {{biodiversity}} containing 350 species of corals, 10 of which are endemic to the region. In recent years many threats to this ecosystem have been revealed, such as crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching as well as excess concentrations of nutrients and sediments. Information on the effects of water quality and also the amounts of nutrients and sediments that reefs are subjected to is limited. This is especially true for inshore reefs where issues of water quality are most important. This work focuses on the Rockingham Bay and Family Islands region. In this region a reef in Lugger Bay near Mission Beach was selected for a detailed study. It is a highly marginal reef (a reef occurring close to perceived environmental thresholds for coral survival) with high levels of sediments and organic matter and close to the mouths of two rivers: the Tully and the Hull.

The synthesized ZrS 3 layers possess a pseudo one-dimensional nature where each layer consists of ZrS 3 chains extending along the b-lattice direction. Our results show that the optical properties of few-layered ZrS 3 are highly anisotropic as evidenced by large PL intensity variation with the polarization <b>direction.</b> <b>Light</b> is efficiently absorbed when the E-field is polarized along the chain (b-axis), but the field is greatly attenuated and absorption is reduced when it is polarized vertical to the 1 D-like chains as the wavelength of the exciting light is much longer than the width of each 1 D chain. The observed PL variation with polarization {{is similar to that of}} conventional 1 D materials, i. e., nanowires, and nanotubes, except for the fact that here the 1 D chains interact with each other giving rise to a unique linear dichroism response that falls between the 2 D (planar) and 1 D (chain) limit. These results not only mark the very first demonstration of PL polarization anisotropy in 2 D systems, but also provide novel insight into how the interaction between adjacent 1 D-like chains and the 2 D nature of each layer influences the overall optical anisotropy of pseudo- 1 D materials.
