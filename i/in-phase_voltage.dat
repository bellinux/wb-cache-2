40|$|The {{capability}} of regulating power flow in Nigerian Grid System using UPFC {{is the main}} focus in this paper. Consequently, three control methods, namely, voltage control through shunt compensation, real power flow control through quadrature voltage injection and reactive power flow control through <b>in-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> injection for the UPFC were examined {{in order to improve}} the transient stability of the power system. The quadrature voltage control was found to be effective in reducing the transient swings whereas <b>in-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> control was effective in improving the transient stability margin. Finally, the overall performance of the UPFC was evaluated in a single-machine infinite bus system by nonlinear simulations, and results obtained showed the effectiveness of the controller in improving the dynamic stability of the system and provide better damping to electromechanical oscillations...|$|E
40|$|VSC (Voltage Source Converter) {{feed-forward}} {{control strategy}} of DVR (Dynamic Voltage Restorer) for an <b>in-phase</b> <b>voltage</b> injection scheme is proposed {{in this paper}} to tackle not only voltage sags and swells in the utility supply but also phase jumps as well. The proposed strategy utilizes a time based ramp at a clock rate of 50 Hz to obtain a 3 -phase reference signal that is compared with actual 3 -phase utility voltage to obtain an error signal. If the error in each phase of the utility voltage is greater than zero then appropriate control signals are generated. The switching devices in VSC are switched accordingly to compensate voltage sags, swells and phase jumps in the utility voltage that propagates to load. For the mitigation of voltage sags, swells and phase jumps, the unipolar SPWM control is used. The proposed control system response time to compensate voltage sag, swell and phase jump through switching of VSC devices is less than 10 ms whereas ITIC curve and SEMI-F- 47 standard suggest a target of 20 ms.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a pair of {{identical}} emitters (e. g. wire dipole antennas) in the focal points of a disc, made of left-handed metamaterial (a "perfect" lens), form a non-radiating electromagnetic configuration. The emitters are fed with voltages of equal magnitude and pi-out-of-phase. Detailed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling shows that there are non-propagating electromagnetic fields generated - fields that remain confined within the region between the emitters and the lens. The energy balance of the system shows that the radiation resistance {{of the system is}} very low. This means that the input power is converted to heat in the volume of the lens and {{only a small fraction of}} it is radiated. The system performance shows that disturbing the configuration of the non-propagating electromagnetic fields with the presence of an externally introduced object stimulates radiation. This suggests possible detector applications. <b>In-phase</b> feeding <b>voltages</b> are also studied with the consequence that the radiation resistance of the antennae is increased.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{dominance of}} renewable energy resources and DC household appliances, the novelty of DC micro grid is attracting significant attention. The key interface between the main supply grid and DC micro grid is AC to DC converter. The conventional AC to DC converter with large output capacitor introduces undesirable power quality problems in the main supply current. It reduces system efficiency due to low power factor and high harmonic distortion. Power Factor Correction (PFC) circuits are used to make supply currents sinusoidal and <b>in-phase</b> with supply <b>voltages.</b> This paper presents different PFC topologies for single phase AC to DC converters which are analyzed for power factor (PF), total harmonic distortion (THD) and system efficiency by varying output power. Two-quadrant shunt active filter topology attains a power factor of 0. 999, 3. 03 % THD and 98 % system efficiency. Output voltage regulation of the presented active PFC topologies is simulated by applying a step load. Two-quadrant shunt active filter achieves better output voltage regulation compared to other topologies {{and can be used}} as grid interface...|$|R

40|$|Voltage {{modulated}} electroluminescence spectra and {{low frequency}} (≤ 100 kHz) impedance characteristics of electroluminescent diodes are studied. Voltage modulated light emission tracks {{the onset of}} observed negative capacitance at a forward bias level for each modulation frequency. Active participation of sub-bandgap defect states in minority carrier recombination dynamics is sought to explain the results. Negative capacitance is understood as a necessary dielectric response to compensate any irreversible transient changes in the minority carrier reservoir due to radiative recombinations mediated by slowly responding sub-bandgap defects. Experimentally measured variations of the in-phase component of modulated electroluminescence spectra with forward bias levels and modulation frequencies support the dynamic influence of these states in the radiative recombination process. Predominant negative sign of the <b>in-phase</b> component of <b>voltage</b> modulated electroluminescence signal further confirms the bi-molecular nature of light emission. We also discuss how these states can actually affect the net density of minority carriers available for radiative recombination. Results indicate that these sub-bandgap states can suppress external quantum efficiency of such devices under high frequency operation commonly used in optical communication.

The changes in war fighting tactics and advancement of technology shape {{the ways to}} implement and design multifunction phased array radars. This thesis investigated whether the commercial modulation boards used in the 3 -D 2. 4 - GHz phased array transmit antenna is capable of wideband performance. The phase of the transmitted signal out of the modulator board was adjusted to provide a phase shift from 0 to 2,Ì§ and the insertion phases at these phase settings were measured using a Vector Network Analyzer, sweeping the frequency from 0. 8 to 2. 5 GHz. The measured insertion phases are used to simulate the radiation pattern of a linear phased array, and {{the results show that}} modulator does not have instantaneous wideband characteristics. This thesis also looked at the design of the complementary phased array receiver architecture using commercially available demodulator boards. The demodulator board was successfully configured to operate as a phase shifter. Phase shifted transmit signals were injected into the demodulator, and corresponding phase shifts were measured via the <b>In-Phase</b> and Quadrature <b>voltages.</b> Civilian, Ministry of Defense, Singapor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{vertically}} pointing C-band (5. 8 -GHz) frequencymodulated (FM) continuous-wave Doppler radar {{was developed}} for less than U. S. $ 6000, which can estimate the Doppler velocity power spectra from 20 to 300 m above {{the ground with a}} 5 -m resolution. Three key design elements kept the costs low. First, the data acquisition system (DAS) commanded a direct digital synthesizer to start the FM sweep and then collected all voltage samples. This architecture insured phase coherence between the transmit FM sweep and the sampled voltages, which is critical for the Doppler processing that detects target phase changes over several successive FM sweeps. Second, a 5 -m range resolution was achieved by increasing the FM bandwidth to over 36 MHz and decreasing the DAS sample rate to 500 kHz, enabling the use of an inexpensive DAS. Third, the Doppler processing at each range was achieved using two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), i. e., a range FFT converted FM sweep <b>voltages</b> into <b>in-phase</b> and quadrature <b>voltages</b> I and Q at each range, and a Doppler FFT converted I and Q voltages from consecutive sweeps into the Doppler velocity power spectra. Observations show precipitation variability at 1 -s and 5 -m resolutions in the lowest 300 m of the atmosphere.

40|$|The central pattern {{generator}} can generate locomotor-like rhythmic activity in the spinal cord {{in the absence of}} descending and peripheral inputs, but the motor pattern is regulated by feedback from peripheral sensory inputs that adjust motor outputs to external stimuli. To elucidate the possible role of Hb 9 -expressing interneurons (Hb 9 INs) in the locomotor circuitry, we investigated whether their induced oscillatory activity is modulated by low-threshold afferents in the isolated spinal cords of neonatal Hb 9 :eGFP transgenic mice. Low-intensity stimulation of segmental afferents generated short-latency, monosynaptic excitatory responses in 62 % of Hb 9 INs. These were associated with longer-latency (∼ 13 ms) excitatory postsynaptic currents that were evoked in all Hb 9 INs, probably by slow conducting afferents that synapse directly onto them. Concomitant morphological analysis confirmed that afferent axons with immunoreactive expression of vesicular glutamate transporter- 1 and parvalbumin, presumably from primary afferents, contacted somata and dendrites of all Hb 9 INs. Most of the putative synaptic contacts were on distal dendrites that extended to an area with profuse afferent projections. We next examined whether low-threshold afferents in upper (flexor-related) and lower (extensor-related) lumbar segments altered the timing of neurochemically induced locomotor-like rhythms in Hb 9 INs and motoneurons. Excitation of flexor-related afferents during the flexor phase delayed the onset of subsequent cycles in both Hb 9 INs and segmental motoneurons while maintaining the phase relationship between them. The <b>in-phase</b> correlation between <b>voltage</b> oscillations in Hb 9 INs and motor bursts also persisted during the two- to threefold increase in cycle period triggered by extensor-related afferents. Our findings that low-threshold, presumably muscle afferents, synapse directly onto these interneurons and perturb their induced locomotor-like membrane oscillations in a pattern that remains phase-locked with motor bursts support the hypothesis that Hb 9 INs are part of the sensorimotor circuitry that regulates the pattern of locomotor rhythms in the isolated cord...|$|R
