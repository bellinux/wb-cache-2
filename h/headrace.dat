2500|$|George Washington {{inherited}} Mount Vernon in 1754. In 1771 he {{erected a}} large stone gristmill on the plantation {{to replace a}} mill his father had built in the 1730s. The new mill was located three miles (5km) west of Mount Vernon on Dogue Run Creek. It was used to produce flour and cornmeal for the plantation as well as high-quality flour for export to the West Indies, England, and continental Europe. Washington also built a house for the miller and a cooperage to supply barrels for the mill, and later, the distillery operation. [...] The mill was powered by a large water wheel. To ensure a steady power supply, water was diverted from Piney Branch into Dogue Run Creek above the mill's <b>headrace.</b> The additional waterflow significantly increased the mill’s production capacity. In 1791 Washington automated his mill using technology developed and patented by Oliver Evans of Delaware. Evans was personally acquainted with the mill and had repaired some of its works.|$|E

40|$|Two {{freshwater}} anguillid eel species, Anguilla australis and A. dieffenbachia, {{form the}} basis of important traditional, recreational, and commercial fisheries in New Zealand. These fisheries have been affected by the damming of many of the major water-ways for hydroelectric generation. To create fisheries in reservoirs that would be otherwise inaccessible, elvers have been transferred from the base of dams into habitats upstream. Operations in three catchments: the Patea River (Lake Rotorangi), Waikato River (eight reservoirs notably the two lowermost, lakes Karapiro and Arapuni), and Rangitaiki River (lakes Matahina and Aniwhenua) are discussed. In all reservoirs, the transfers have successfully established fishable populations within six years of the first transfers and, in Lake Arapuni eels have reached the marketable size of 220 g in less than four years. In comparison, it typically takes from 13 to 17 years before eel populations are fishable in the lower Waikato River where direct access to the sea is available. Telemetry and monitoring at the screens and tailraces of several power stations have been used to determine migration timing, triggers, and pathways of mature eels. Successful downstream transfer of mature migrating adults has been achieved by spillway opening and netting in <b>headraces</b> during rain events in autumn, but means of preventing eels from impinging and entraining at the intakes are still required. An integrated, catchment-wide management system will be required to ensure sustainability of the fisheries...|$|R

50|$|Part of the KingYolande {{scheme that}} {{comprises}} three hydroelectric power stations, the John Butters Power Station is fed by water from Lake Burbury which is dammed by the Crotty Dam {{in the gap}} in the West Coast Range between Mount Jukes and Mount Huxley, and to the south by Darwin Dam. Water flow to the station is via a long <b>headrace</b> tunnel from the Crotty Dam via a 6.5 km-long <b>headrace</b> tunnel and a 500 m-long steel lined power tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The intake {{leads to}} the {{rectangular}} profiled <b>headrace</b> channel of 1,800 m length which was made of reinforced concrete. The <b>headrace</b> channel lies on the right bank of the stream and it has 4.4m inner width and 2.2m of wall height while the design flow is 27m3/s. This bank has moderately steep slopes, and the bedrock is marginally weathered. Reinforced concrete channel sections were placed on screed concrete and expansion joints were provided at every 17m with 250mm wide rubber water bars.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{each of the}} <b>headrace</b> tunnels {{from the}} Hálslón {{reservoir}} or Ufsarlón pond reach the underground power station, they both join to form a single combined <b>headrace</b> tunnel. The single <b>headrace</b> tunnel later splits into two 0.8 km long, 4 m diameter steel-lined penstocks (tunnels) and the water makes a rapid descent down a final 420 m vertical penstock into the power station. The underground Fljótsdalur Power Station contains six vertical-axis Francis turbine generators rated at 115 MW each. The power station has a combined capacity of 690 MW and discharge of [...] (averages [...] ) into the Jökulsá í Fljótsdal River via tailrace tunnels and canals. The power production corresponds to a capacity factor of 76%, which is relatively high for a hydroelectric facility.

50|$|Preparatory work on {{the project}} began in August 2002 and {{construction}} on the Kárahnjúkastífla Dam and <b>headrace</b> tunnels for the Hálslón reservoir began in April 2003. In September of the same year, construction began on the underground power station. Construction on both the Desjarárstífla Dam and the Sauðárdalsstífla Dam began in April 2004. In June 2006, construction of the Kelduárstífla Dam and Ufsarstífla Dam began and in September, the Hálslón Reservoir began to fill. In mid-2008, the Kelduárstífla and Ufsarstífla Dams were complete and the Ufsarlón pond <b>headrace</b> tunnel was ready.|$|E
5000|$|About {{ten days}} after the project was completed, about 15 m of the 26 km <b>headrace</b> tunnel {{collapse}}d.

[...] The tunnel was repaired and the station operational again on December 26, 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{power plant}} will be located {{underground}} near the lower reservoir. Connecting the upper reservoir {{and the power}} plant will first be two <b>headrace</b> tunnels, one 1220 m long and the other 1160 m in length. Surge tanks on each <b>headrace</b> tunnel help prevent water hammer. Each <b>headrace</b> tunnel connects to a steel-lined penstock, each of which later bifurcates into two penstocks. Each of these four penstocks will supply water to the turbines during power generation. After power generation the water will be discharged into the lower reservoir via four tailrace tunnels. When pumping water moves through the same conduits back to the upper reservoir. The power plant will contain four Francis pump-turbines which are rated at 260 MW each for power generation and 275 MW for pumping. The upper reservoir will lie at maximum elevation of 796 m and the lower at 499 m. This difference in elevation will afford the power plant a rated hydraulic head of 276 m.|$|E
50|$|Water flow of 47.0 m/sec will be {{transferred}} through a 15.1 km long and 4.5 m wide <b>headrace</b> tunnel to the turbines. In the close proximity with the HPP powerhouse, the <b>headrace</b> tunnel will branch into three separate penstocks {{to connect to}} the turbines. Water is transferred to a tunnel through a water intake located on the left bank of the reservoir creating a 130 m high asphalt faced-rockfill dam. The dam will be raised about 5 km off the village of Tita up the narrow gorge of the Nenskra river creating a live storage of 3,176 million m3. From the reservoir, water is to be supplied into the <b>headrace</b> tunnel. To improve the energy scheme, three low-pressure dams will be constructed in the Nakra river valley. Out of the created reservoir, 45.5 m/sec additional water is to be discharged into the Nenskra reservoir through a transfer tunnel allowing the Nenskra HPP to produce 1,219 GWh yearly.|$|E
