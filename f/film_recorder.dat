5000|$|Because of the {{universal}} desirability of an immediate playback capability, even studios using sound-on-film systems employed a wax disc [...] "playback machine" [...] in tandem with their <b>film</b> <b>recorders,</b> as {{it was impossible to}} play an optical recording until it had made the round trip to the film processing laboratory.|$|R
5000|$|Bert Whyte was the {{producer}} and engineer. Ruth, his wife, was the assistant engineer. Belock and Whyte decided to record music on 35 mm magnetic film, which they believed was {{an improvement over}} half-inch tape. Westrex built this equipment to their specifications, at a cost then of about $20,000 for each recorder. Neumann U 47 microphones were purchased {{to go with the}} <b>film</b> <b>recorders.</b> Everest’s recording philosophy was to make minimally-miked three-channel recordings using the same 35 mm <b>film</b> <b>recorders</b> everywhere. In May 1959, Edward Wallerstein (formerly president of Columbia Records) was appointed as {{a vice president of the}} company. Bert Whyte looked for performers in a market loaded with exclusive contract artists. Everest engaged the services of several major conductors, including Adrian Boult, Josef Krips, Eugène Aynsley Goossens, Malcolm Sargent, William Steinberg, Walter Susskind and Leopold Stokowski.|$|R
50|$|After the United/Western merger, and at {{the request}} of several film music {{producers}} in Hollywood who were looking for a more modern sound for their films, the studios began to record film scores utilizing multi-track <b>film</b> <b>recorders.</b> Playing video cues and sync recording mono audio for quick playback in the studio was also a very popular time saver.|$|R
