500|$|With Rolling Stone, Clemons {{described}} how he recorded the saxophone solo with Gaga. In January 2011, Clemons was putting together an <b>exercise</b> <b>machine</b> in his Florida house {{when his wife}} told him that Gaga's representatives were on the phone, and {{they wanted him to}} play on her upcoming album. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that {{he would be able to}} record it on the coming week, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. After accepting her request, Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "Hair". Before Clemons started work on the song, she explained the lyrics to him. [...] "It made so much sense," [...] he said. [...] "It's a story about growing up." [...] She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song, saying [...] "'We'll put the tape on and you just play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.'". The recording was finished by 3:00 am, after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised for [...] "getting paid for this. I would have done it for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." [...] According to the sheet music [...] published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time. It is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals span from F3 to F5, and the song follows a basic sequence of F–C–Dm–B as its chord progression.|$|E

40|$|Cal Poly’s ongoing Energy Harvesting From <b>Exercise</b> <b>Machines</b> (EHFEM) project proposes {{sustainability}} {{and energy}} saving costs through modifying <b>exercise</b> <b>machines</b> generating DC power, providing a {{renewable energy resource}} through physical exercise. The EHFEM project contains multiple sub-projects involving modifying several different <b>exercise</b> <b>machines.</b> Each machine generates DC power and an inverter converts this power to AC. This AC power returns to the grid. This project addresses an issue involving a previously installed DC-DC converter not returning power properly. When generating DC power, the grid demands a specific AC voltage, but the generated power through the previous DC-DC converter and power inverter encountered several problems. One previous converter outputted the desired DC output, but {{at the cost of}} low efficiency...|$|R
