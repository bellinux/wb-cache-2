Extruder separates faeces from other solids by using a ram to pressurise the mixed solids stream, causing faeces to be extruded through holes in the external casing and tramp material to accumulate against the endplate (see Figures 3 and 4). Extruder forms faeces into a geometry which allows for more energy-efficient drying and combustion (see Figure 4 c). The pellets formed must have sufficient structural integrity to remain intact through the downstream processes. Segregated faeces has more predictable rheological and thermal properties than the mixed solids stream – allows for better design of downstream unit operations.

40|$|A flow {{calorimeter}} {{for determining}} the combustion efficiency of turbojet and ram-jet combustors from measurement of the residual enthalpy of combustion of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> is described. Briefly, the calorimeter catalytically oxidizes the combustible constituents of exhaust-gas samples, and the resultant temperature rise is measured. This temperature rise {{is related to the}} residual enthalpy of combustion of the sample by previous calibration of the calorimeter. Combustion efficiency can be calculated from a knowledge of the residual enthalpy of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> and the <b>combustor</b> input enthalpy. An accuracy of +- 0. 2 Btu per cubic foot was obtained with prepared fuel-air mixtures, and the combustion efficiencies of single turbojet combustors measured by both the flow-calorimeter and heat-balance methods compared within 3 percentage units. Flow calorimetry appears to be a suitable method for determining combustion efficiencies at high combustor temperatures where ordinary thermocouples cannot be used. The method is fundamentally more accurate than heat-balance methods at high combustion efficiencies and can be used to verify near- 100 -percent efficiency data...|$|R

The heart {{of the system is}} a reactor which is directly or indirectly heated to approximately 500 °C by <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from a <b>combustor</b> that burns pyrolysis gas and some of the by-product char. In most of the cases, external biomass heater is used as heating source of the system while internal electrical heating is recently implemented as source of reactor heating. However, this heating system causes biomass or other conventional forms of fuel consumption to produce renewable energy and contributes to environmental pollution. In order to overcome these, the feasibility of incorporating solar energy with fast pyrolysis has been investigated.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} arising {{from the use of}} gasified products from biomass in small gas turbines is the development of stable secondary combustors which can efficiently utilise the variable quality medium to low calorific value gases so produced whilst still be capable of efficiently utilising fuels such as heating oil or natural gas for start-up/shutdown operations or as a pilot fuel during certain operational periods. A further requirement in direct-fired gas turbine applications is the removal of as many particles as possible down to 5 microns or less to minimise damage to the turbine. A cyclone type combustor was designed for such a process and will run on multiple fuels, primarily oil and low to medium CV wood <b>gas.</b> The <b>combustor</b> was designed with three tangential inlets, an oil inlet, a wood gas inlet and an air inlet. CFD modelling of the combustor was performed using the package Fluent. The model was initially run on LCV gas. The flow characteristics and temperature patterns in the combustor were investigated and the behaviour of the fuels combustion patterns studied. The LCV <b>gas</b> entering the <b>combustor</b> contained particles of varying size. The combustor was designed with a conical bottom section to collect the large particles, however finer particles are still carried with the flow to the <b>combustor</b> exit. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> from the <b>combustor</b> must contain particles with a diameter below 5 microns, otherwise damage to the turbine would occur. The combustor was designed with a vortex collector pocket (VCP) positioned just before the tangential off take to collect the finer particles before they exit the combustor. Results showed the combustor produced a stable swirling flame, with good mixing patterns for the LCV gas. Areas of high temperature in the combustor were identified, where refractory material would be needed. The VCP performance was good, collecting most particles below 5 microns...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{addition}} of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> to a <b>combustor</b> may cause liftoff of a diffusion flame due to several possible mechanisms. Understanding the relative influence of these mechanisms is {{of importance for}} the further development of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation combustion technology. The authors present a numerical study {{on the effects of}} CO 2, N 2 (two of primary <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> components) and Ar addition on the liftoff of a laminar CH 4 /air diffusion flame. A gradual switch-off approach was used to identify the relative importance of the different mechanisms. A detailed reaction scheme and complex thermal and transport properties were employed. The simulation results were validated by comparing the calculated and previously measured critical ratios of the 3 additives for liftoff. The results show that the numerical simulation successfully reproduced the previously measured critical ratios of liftoff for all 3 studied additives. Detailed analysis of the numerical results suggests that the {{addition of}} N 2 affects flame liftoff due to the sole effect of dilution. On the other hand, the addition of CO 2 causes flame liftoff due to the dilution, thermal and chemical effects, with the dilution effect being the most significant one, followed by the thermal and chemical effects. All 3 effects tend to reduce combustion intensity and cause flame liftoff, leading to the smaller critical ratio of CO 2 than that of N 2. The radiation and transport property effects are negligible for CO 2 addition. Ar addition affects flame liftoff due to dilution, thermal, and transport property effects. However, whereas the dilution effect tends to reduce combustion intensity and cause flame liftoff, the thermal and transport property effects tend to increase combustion intensity and resist flame liftoff for Ar addition, which results in the greater critical ratio of Ar than that of N 2. Therefore, for the 3 studied additives in this paper, CO 2 has the minimum critical ratio, whereas Ar has the maximum for liftoff...|$|R
