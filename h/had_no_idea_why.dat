The owner of a Westside printing shop became suspicious when Kimberlin, dressed in a DOD security uniform, asked him to reproduce military driver’s licenses with Kimberlin’s picture and called the Army and police. Police arrested Kimberlin {{when he came back}} to the printer to pick up the documents.|$|E

Casanova moved in with the priest and his family and lived there through most of his teenage years. It was also in the Gozzi household that Casanova first came into contact with the opposite sex, when Gozzi's younger sister Bettina fondled him at the age of eleven. Bettina was [...] "pretty, lighthearted, and a great reader of romances. ... The girl pleased me at once, though I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why.</b> It was she who little by little kindled in my heart the first sparks of a feeling which later became my ruling passion."

2500|$|Legends of Bikini Bottom {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media critics. Nancy Basile of About.com positively {{reacted to the}} series {{and gave it a}} 4 out of 5 rating.

She said [...] "Firstly, you know an episode will be funny when it's titled 'Bikini Bottom Triangle'. My children <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> I was laughing at the title frame." [...] her favorite scenes from the episode were [...] "Gary's booty, watching the old sea dog spit his story and figuring out why Patrick wears cuff links." [...] In another episode called [...] "The Main Drain", she said [...] "I won't ruin the set up because it's just so funny, but my favorite line is, 'It's now or never.' You have to see it to know why." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{violation}} of the Posse Comitatus Act prohibiting {{the use of the}} military in domestic policing, members of the U.S. Army and Navy based in Aberdeen, Maryland joined with a 50-man team consisting of FBI agents, six members of the Hostage Rescue Team and the local sheriff Fred Black in storming the stone cottage Lavy owned in Onia, Arkansas on December 20. The team sneaked up on the residence through a neighboring cemetery. The fifty men encircled Lavy's house dressed in military and camoflouge fatigues and when Lavy noticed one staking out his house, he took his shotgun outside and approached agent Mark Jessie {{on the edge of his}} yard. Upon being informed that they were police officers, despite their lack of identification, Lavy placed his gun on the ground and allowed them to handcuff him. [...] One FBI officer present later remarked that it was clear Lavy <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why</b> he was the subject of a raid, and that his failed border crossing two years earlier likely never occurred to him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of the first HLA {{was very much a}} mystery. In 1958 Jean Dausset noticed that blood serum from one person could react with the white blood cells of another. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>why,</b> but he named the causative agent MAC. Around the same time other researchers were making similar discoveries. Rose Payne and Jon van Rood made an identical conclusion from observations of interactions between the blood of women who had been pregnant multiple times and the white blood cells of others. They hypothesized that this was because they had been [...] "sensitized" [...] (an immunological term meaning previously exposed to and thus more reactive towards) to the non-self proteins of the father through tissue damage during birth. At this point the researchers all realized that the sheer quantity of data they were capable of obtaining was vastly greater than that of any previous study and so collaboration would be essential. The first international meeting, in 1964, highlighted the difficulties of such massive collaborative work. Different experimental methods and inconsistency in the execution of the same tests and a non-homogeneity of naming systems added together to make collaboration incredibly difficult.|$|E

Stranger even than these {{emotions}} were the swelling and aching of her heart, the glow and quiver of her flesh, thrill on thrill, deep, like bursting pages of joy never before experienced, the physical sense of a touch, inexplicable in its power.|$|E

The Duke knew, of course, and Lady Cantrip. Lady Cantrip had whispered to her daughter that such a marriage would be suitable, and the daughter had hinted it to her husband. Lord Cantrip of course {{was not in the}} dark. Lady Mabel had expressed a hint on the matter to Miss Cass, who had not repudiated it. Even Silverbridge had suggested to himself that something of the kind might be in the wind, thinking that, if so, none of them knew much about his sister Mary. But Popplecourt himself was divinely innocent. His ideas of marriage had as yet gone no farther than a conviction that girls generally were things which would be pressed on him, and against which he must arm himself with some shield. Marriage would have to come, no doubt; but not the less was it his duty to live {{as though it were a}} pit towards which he would be tempted by female allurements. But that a net should be spread over him here he was much too humble-minded to imagine.|$|E

At first I was astonished, but very soon I became awfully curious to see what he would find out from me. I couldn't possibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth his while. It was very pretty to see how he baffled himself, for in truth my body was full of chills, and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat business. It was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless prevaricator. At last he got angry, and to conceal a movement of furious annoyance, he yawned. I rose. Then I noticed a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying a lighted torch. The background was somber--almost black. The movement of the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister.|$|E

His peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look, and her ready words; turning Joseph's religious curses into ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most--showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do her bidding in anything, and his only when it suited his own inclination. After behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night. 'Nay, Cathy,' the old man would say, 'I cannot love thee, thou'rt worse than thy brother. Go, say thy prayers, child, and ask God's pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared thee!' That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.|$|E

6000|$|Some of my fellow-passengers, as I now moved {{among them}} in a {{relation}} of equality, seemed to me excellent gentlemen. They were not rough, nor hasty, nor disputatious; debated pleasantly, differed kindly; were helpful, gentle, patient, and placid. The type of manners was plain, and even heavy; {{there was little to}} please the eye, but nothing to shock; and I thought gentleness lay more nearly at the spring of behaviour than in many more ornate and delicate societies. I say delicate, where I cannot say refined; a thing may be fine, like ironwork, without being delicate, like lace. There was here less delicacy; the skin supported more callously the natural surface of events, the mind received more bravely the crude facts of human existence; but I do not think that there was less effective refinement, less consideration for others, less polite suppression of self. I speak of the best among my fellow-passengers; for in the steerage, {{as well as in the}} saloon, there is a mixture. Those, then, with whom I found myself in sympathy, and of whom I may therefore hope to write with a greater measure of truth, were not only as good in their manners, but endowed with very much the same natural capacities, and about as wise in deduction, as the bankers and barristers of what is called society. One and all were too much interested in disconnected facts, and loved information for its own sake with too rash a devotion; but people in all classes display the same appetite as they gorge themselves daily with the miscellaneous gossip of the newspaper. Newspaper-reading, as far as I can make out, is often rather a sort of brown study than an act of culture. I have myself palmed off yesterday’s issue on a friend, and seen him re-peruse it for a continuance of minutes with an air at once refreshed and solemn. Workmen, perhaps, pay more attention; but though they may be eager listeners, they have rarely seemed to me either willing or careful thinkers. Culture is not measured by the greatness of the field which is covered by our knowledge, but by the nicety with which we can perceive relations in that field, whether great or small. Workmen, certainly those who were on board with me, I found wanting in this quality or habit of the mind. They did not perceive relations, but leaped to a so-called cause, and thought the problem settled. Thus the cause of everything in England was the form of government, and the cure for all evils was, by consequence, a revolution. It is surprising how many of them said this, and that none should have had a definite thought in his head as he said it. Some hated the Church because they disagreed with it; some hated Lord Beaconsfield because of war and taxes; all hated the masters, possibly with reason. But these failings were not at the root of the matter; the true reasoning of their souls ran thus—I have not got on; I ought to have got on; if there was a revolution I should get on. How? They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea.</b> <b>Why?</b> Because—because—well, look at America! ...|$|E
