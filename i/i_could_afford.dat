500|$|Scheduled for a January 2008 release, Popular was {{promoted}} with {{five months of}} concert performances by Hunt, press coverage, {{and the release of}} promotional copies, including the four-song EP The Popular Machine (2007) and advance CDs for the media and radio people. However, weeks before its scheduled release, the album was shelved by Blue Note, with whom Hunt had been experiencing differences, and they subsequently parted ways. Blue Note had felt that the album was not profitable enough to release. Hunt could not release Popular himself without repaying the project's costs back to EMI and obtaining rights to the album's master recordings. According to him, EMI requested twice the original costs, and in his opinion, the money for promoting Popular was not [...] "strategically spent well" [...] by the label. Hunt discussed the situation in an interview for Creative Loafing, saying that [...] "They opted to not sell it to me at a price that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford.</b> They've got it and I'm sure they'll come out with it when they deem it necessary and profitable." [...] Of his decision to relocate to Los Angeles, he later quipped, [...] "Here I am, and the relationship has done much better than the career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd {{has been}} a lifelong {{supporter}} of Accrington Stanley F.C., and played for them during the 1960s. Lloyd has maintained links with the club after his playing career ended, and in May 2009 he voiced his wishes {{to become involved in}} the club {{from the point of view}} of investment. He stated to the Accrington Observer that [...] "I love football and always have. I was talking to Eric Whalley about it the other day and he said he wanted to sell and I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to buy the club off him. I can’t do that but I would like some involvement and perhaps raise the profile of Accrington Stanley. The town needs a football club – and I want to help to make sure they have one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ameriie {{was born}} to a South Korean mother, artist Mi Suk and African American father, Charles. A few months after she was born, the Rogers family moved to South Korea, where Amerie lived for three years. Her father, Charles, was a chief warrant officer in the U.S. military, so the family lived in many {{different}} places, including Alaska, Texas, Virginia and Germany. She has a younger sister, Angela, who is now her lawyer. Amerie describes her parents as conservative, protective, traditional Christians. Growing up, {{she and her sister}} were forbidden to leave the house or use the phone on school days. The singer enrolled at Georgetown University to study literature, and was in Navy ROTC: [...] "My dad didn't force me into it or anything. I joined so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> an education." [...] She quit ROTC after her sophomore year, and graduated with a B.A. in English and a Fine Arts minor in design.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{looked at}} it from every angle, but insurmountable {{difficulties}} seemed to be blocking the way. One thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to do: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to be a coward".|$|R
60|$|THE MAN. I cant ride a bicycle. <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> one. I'm {{not even}} that much good.|$|R

2500|$|In 1999, Cameron {{was labeled}} selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author Orson Scott Card, {{who had been}} hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the novelization of The Abyss. Card said the {{experience}} was [...] "hell on wheels. He was very nice to me, because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people." [...] He later alluded to Cameron in his review of Me and Orson Welles, where he described witnessing a famous director chew out an assistant for his own error.|$|E
2500|$|Martha Wright {{replaced}} Martin in {{the role}} of Maria on Broadway in October 1961, followed by Karen Gantz in July 1962, Jeannie Carson in August 1962 and Nancy Dussault in September 1962. Jon Voight, who eventually married co-star Lauri Peters, was a replacement for Rolf. The national tour starred Florence Henderson as Maria and Beatrice Krebs as Mother Abbess. It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, because of the role's limited singing, [...] and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: [...] "I promised myself then that if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> it, I would never do a run as long as that again." [...] The original Broadway cast album sold three million copies.|$|E
2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. My brother's {{expenses}} {{have been}} higher, as well, and I {{was driven to}} the conclusion that since <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> both, I'd better let the mare go and keep the brother." ...|$|R

6000|$|The minute I was {{far enough}} above {{the town to}} see <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, {{and the first time}} the {{lightning}} showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out {{there in the middle of}} the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afforded</b> it. But <b>I</b> didn't. As I sprung aboard I sung out: ...|$|R
2500|$|Her self-hatred {{accelerated}} into raging {{cycles of}} bulimia and anorexia, repressing the issue until questioned. Jackson said, [...] "people say to me: `Okay, you've {{got to start}} eating more. You're too thin.' But when {{you look in the}} mirror, you see something totally different." [...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, I never thought I could swing so far in the other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{knew each}} other too early for that. And then she has not a shilling. I should think myself dishonest if I did not tell you that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to love any girl who hadn't money. A man must live,--and a woman too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, my thanks, I believe; for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{better have}} <b>afforded</b> {{to lose a}} better man. That is you, I suppose, Mr. Yorke, by your voice?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{believe the}} first thing a woman does in Paris is {{to buy a new}} bonnet. I did, or rather stood by and let 'my son' do it in the best of French, only {{whispering}} when he proposed gorgeous chapeaus full of flowers and feathers, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "If only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> another!" [...] {{she thought}} regretfully. [...] "I wonder why I am always hungry nowadays. It is so ridiculous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> it," [...] exclaimed Bastin {{with rising}} anger, [...] "I {{should like to}} go there and expose this vile traducer of my cloth." ...|$|E

5000|$|After the {{war ended}} on November 11, 1918, Shippey found his income so reduced [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to keep the hotel room Croy and I had shared unless <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get another roommate." [...] By that time, Georges Babin had died, so Mrs. Babin and Shippey agreed that the latter would rent {{a room in the}} Babin apartment.|$|R
6000|$|... "By your ignorance," [...] said he. [...] "Twice I have {{discovered}} serious flaws in your plans that a common-school education should have enabled you to avoid. And," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{have been put}} to expense that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ill <b>afford</b> in pursuing this swindling quest. I am done with it." ...|$|R
60|$|My friends {{regarded}} me in {{sorrow and}} wonder. I {{was not the}} same man. Where once I had furnished them entertainment and jollity, I now preyed upon them. No jests from me ever bid for their smiles now. They were too precious. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to dispense gratuitously the means of my livelihood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} rich man," [...] Hamel went on, [...] "but I am {{fairly well}} off. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to be married at once, and I should like--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] I {{said with}} a laugh, [...] "a good Radical shouldn't talk like that." [...] For me the {{bitterness}} was over, and, knowing the worst, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what if I could?" [...] he said, at length. [...] "Do {{you think}} that trade is so good <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> to keep two boys, when there isn't half work enough for one?" ...|$|E
60|$|I am, as I think I have said, a {{cautious}} man, indeed a timid one, and this suggestion frightened me. It {{seemed to me}} that to undertake such a journey would be to go to certain death, and putting other considerations aside, as I had a son to support, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to die just then.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have lived}} with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and paid me for it; which she {{certainly}} should never have done, you may take your affidavit, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>afforded</b> to keep either myself or her for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it's really very hard," [...] said Miss Pross.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{you did not}} observe {{its real}} size,--that it was fixed to a frame- work? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to buy an equatorial, and I have been obliged to rig up an {{apparatus}} of my own devising, {{so as to make}} it in some measure answer the purpose of an equatorial. It could be moved, but I would rather not touch it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{advertise}} {{as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> it," [...] suggested Frank. [...] "And I'd {{write to}} the secretaries of all these old soldiers' organizations, too, giving your father's full name and what he belonged to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe. He {{never went}} to school. The harbour school was too far away. I taught him {{to read and write}} and bought him all the books <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford.</b> But I can't do any more for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but {{you must}} have had {{something}} to complain of!" [...] said the big doctor. [...] "I would bet a hundred, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>afford</b> it, that the landlady tried to poison you with her sour French wine." ...|$|E
60|$|So I left him. His words gave me no {{loophole}} of hope. His {{silence was}} {{the silence of}} a strong man, and I had no weapons with which to assail it. I had wasted the money which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ill <b>afford</b> on this journey to London. Certainly Ray's advice was good. The sooner I was back in Braster the better.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{wonder why}} I {{am no longer}} a parishioner. The time came when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>afford</b> to be." [...] There was no hint of reproach in his voice, of bitterness. He spoke regretfully, indeed, but as one stating an incontrovertible fact. [...] "I lost my fortune, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not keep my pew, so I deeded {{it back to the}} church. My old friends, Mrs. Dimock and Asa Waring, and others, too, were very kind. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not accept their hospitality." ...|$|R
6000|$|She made a movement, drawing herself {{together}} as if, in a spasm of dread at having lost her treasure, she {{were going to}} attempt the immense effort of rising to snatch it from me. I instantly placed it in her hand again, saying as I did so, [...] "I should like to have it myself, but with your ideas <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>afford</b> it." ...|$|R
