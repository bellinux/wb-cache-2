40|$|OBJECTIVES: Surface {{chemical}} compositions, such as calcium/phosphorus {{ratio and}} phase content, {{have a strong}} influence on the bioactivity and biocompatibility of calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings as applied on orthopedic and dental implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hydroxylapatite (HA) and <b>dicalcium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (DCPP) coatings were prepared on titanium substrates by RF magnetron sputter deposition. The surfaces were left as-prepared (amorphous HA coating; A-HA, amorphous DCPP coating; A-DCPP) or heat treated with: infrared (IR) at 550 degrees C (I-HA) or at 650 degrees C (I-DCPP), and a water steam at 140 degrees C (S-HA and S-DCPP). The surface changes of these coatings were determined after incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF). Also, the growth of rat bone marrow cells (RBM) was studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Both IR and water steam heat treatment changed the sputter-deposited coatings from the amorphous into the crystalline phase. As-prepared amorphous coatings dissolved partially in SBF within 4 weeks of incubation, while heat-treated coatings supported the deposition of a precipitate, i. e., carbonated apatite on both I-HA and S-HA specimens, and tricalciumphosphate on the I-DCPP and S-DCPP specimens. The Ca/P ratio of the A-HA, I-HA, S-HA, A-DCPP, I-DCPP and S-DCPP coatings changed, respectively, from 1. 98 to 1. 12, 2. 01 to 1. 76, 1. 91 to 1. 68, 0. 76 to 1. 23, 0. 76 to 1. 26 and 1. 62 to 1. 55 after 4 weeks of incubation in SBF. Finally, the RBM cells grew well on all heat-treated coatings, but showed different mineralization morphology during cell culturing. CONCLUSION: The different heat-treatment procedures for the sputtered HA and DCPP coatings influenced the surface characteristics of these coatings, whereby a combination of crystallinity and specific phase composition (Ca/P ratio) strongly affected their in vitro bioactivity...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Treatment for {{osteoporosis}} commonly {{includes the}} use of bisphosphonates. Serious side effects of these drugs are caused by the inhibition of bone resorption {{as a result of}} osteoclast apoptosis. Treatment using calcitonin along with bisphosphonates overcomes these side-effects in some patients. Calcitonin is known to inhibit bone resorption without reducing the number of osteoclasts and is thought to prolong osteoclast survival through the inhibition of apoptosis. Further understanding of how calcitonin inhibits apoptosis could prove useful to the development of alternative treatment regimens for osteoporosis. This study aimed to analyze the mechanism by which calcitonin influences osteoclast apoptosis induced by a bisphosphate analog, sintered <b>dicalcium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (SDCP), and {{to determine the effects of}} co-treatment with calcitonin and SDCP on apoptotic signaling in osteoclasts. METHODS: Isolated osteoclasts were treated with CT, SDCP or both for 48 h. Osteoclast apoptosis assays, pit formation assays, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining were performed. Using an osteoporosis rat model, ovariectomized (OVX) rats received calcitonin, SDCP, or calcitonin + SDCP. The microarchitecture of the fifth lumbar trabecular bone was investigated, and histomorphometric and biochemical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Calcitonin inhibited SDCP-induced apoptosis in primary osteoclast cultures, increased Bcl- 2 and Erk activity, and decreased Mcl- 1 activity. Calcitonin prevented decreased osteoclast survival but not resorption induced by SDCP. Histomorphometric analysis of the tibia revealed increased bone formation, and microcomputed tomography of the fifth lumbar vertebrate showed an additive effect of calcitonin and SDCP on bone volume. Finally, analysis of the serum bone markers CTX-I and P 1 NP suggests that the increased bone volume induced by co-treatment with calcitonin and SDCP may be due to decreased bone resorption and increased bone formation. CONCLUSIONS: Calcitonin reduces SDCP-induced osteoclast apoptosis and increases its efficacy in an in vivo model of osteoporosis...|$|E
