25|$|Egg-free {{mayonnaise}} {{is expected}} to contain soya or pea protein instead of lecithin in egg yolk as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> to stabilize oil droplets in water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> (lecithin) used in {{mayonnaise}} {{are able}} to suspend oil droplets in water because it lowers the interfacial tension γ between oil and water. When <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent,</b> lecithin, {{is added to the}} oil and water emulsion, they form a layer between the two different liquids, with their hydrophobic tail point toward the non-polar oil droplet, and their hydrophilic end facing the polar water molecules. This reduces the interfacial tension γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules. Hence, a large increase of surface area (ΔA) is made possible because energy cost to arrive at the food state is now favorable.|$|E
25|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate, {{appearing}} as its synonym {{sodium lauryl sulfate}} (SLS), is considered as a {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) ingredient, for food use according to the guidelines published in 21 CFR 172.822. It is used as an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> and whipping aid. SLS is reported to temporarily diminish perception of sweetness.|$|E

50|$|Cocamide MEA {{and other}} cocamide ethanolamines such as cocamide DEA {{are used as}} foaming agents and {{nonionic}} surfactants in shampoos and bath products, and as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> in cosmetics.|$|R
25|$|Usually, an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent,</b> such as soy lecithin, is added, {{though a}} few {{manufacturers}} prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes {{at the cost of}} a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them {{to reduce the amount of}} cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.|$|E
25|$|Two {{unprotected}} oil droplets {{with small}} radii in water are favored thermodynamically to coalesce into one bigger droplet because the process yields a smaller surface area-to-volume ratio. The energetic {{contribution of the}} interfacial layer over that same volume of oil is minimized when the two droplets fuse together. Thus, the coalescence process puts the system in a lower energy state and the process would occur spontaneously. However, when the oil droplets are coated with <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent,</b> electrostatic repulsive force is introduced among the oil droplets which keeps the droplets from coming together.|$|E
2500|$|Citric acid can {{be added}} to ice cream as an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> to keep fats from separating, to caramel to prevent sucrose crystallization, or in recipes in place of fresh lemon juice. Citric acid is used with sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{in a wide range of}} effervescent formulae, both for ingestion (e.g., powders and tablets) and for personal care (e.g., bath salts, bath bombs, and cleaning of grease). Citric acid sold in a dry powdered form is commonly sold in markets and groceries as [...] "sour salt", due to its physical resemblance to table salt. It has use in culinary applications, as an alternative to vinegar or lemon juice, where a pure acid is needed.|$|E
5000|$|... 1,5-Pentanediol is {{the organic}} {{compound}} with the formula HOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2OH. Like other diols, this viscous colourless liquid {{is used as}} plasticizer and also forms polyesters that are used as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> and resin intermediates.|$|R
25|$|The texture is also heavily {{influenced}} by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> are added.|$|R
50|$|Diprobase {{contains}} no 'active ingredients'. It {{is made from}} a combination of liquid paraffin, white soft paraffin and water, as well as cetomacrogol and cetostearyl alcohol as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents,</b> chlorocresol as an antimicrobial preservative, phosphoric acid,sodium dihydrogenphosphate and sodium hydroxide.|$|R
2500|$|Traditional {{mayonnaise}} is {{a mixture}} of egg, vinegar, oil and spices (especially mustard). Mayonnaise made in this fashion typically contains 70–80% fat. Despite the high oil content relative to water, mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion. This emulsion is formed by first mixing the eggs, vinegar and mustard and then slowly blending in the oil. This results in an emulsion consisting of a closely packed [...] "foam" [...] of oil droplets. By contrast, if the oil and aqueous phases are mixed all at once the result is a water-in-oil emulsion similar in viscosity to the oil from which it is made. Without an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> oil floats on top of water forming separate layers.|$|E
5000|$|Docusate, an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent,</b> {{an active}} {{ingredient}} found in laxatives ...|$|E
50|$|While it is energetically {{favorable}} for individual particles to coalesce {{due to the}} subsequent reduction of interfacial area, the adsorbed emulsifier prevents this. This is {{because it is more}} {{favorable for}} the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> to be at an interface so reducing the interfacial area requires expending energy to return the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> to the bulk.|$|E
5000|$|Once ice {{crystals}} start {{to form in}} the continuous water phase, they begin to inhibit the lecithin and phospholipids from working. These two <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> lose their functionality due to dehydration: water is crystallizing with itself and is leaving these agents [...] "out to dry." [...] The oil droplets begin to flocculate without the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> keeping them separated. At water's freezing point, this is enough to destabilize the mayonnaise emulsion but at even lower temperatures, the fused oil droplets reach their freezing points and fat crystal nucleation begins. Mayonnaise therefore, should not be stored at frozen temperatures due to their thermodynamic instability. Freezing of the water phase in mayonnaise is catastrophic to the stability and shelf-life of the entire product.|$|R
2500|$|In oil-in-water {{emulsions}} such as mayonnaise, {{however, the}} continuous water phase freezes, allowing the oil droplets to flocculate. This process causes a phase {{separation between the}} water and the oil. Once ice crystals start to form in the continuous water phase, they begin to inhibit the lecithin and phospholipids from working. These two <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> lose their functionality due to dehydration: water is crystallizing out, leaving these agents [...] "out to dry." [...] The oil droplets begin to flocculate without the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> keeping them separated. At the freezing point of water, this is enough to destabilize the mayonnaise emulsion; at even lower temperatures the fused oil droplets reach their freezing points and fat crystal nucleation begins. These processes make mayonnaise degrade when frozen and thawed; freezing is not a suitable way to store it.|$|R
50|$|Sorbitan is {{a mixture}} of {{isomeric}} organic compounds derived from the dehydration of sorbitol and is an intermediate in the conversion of sorbitol to isosorbide.

40|$|Sodium phosphates, polyphosphates, and citrates are {{melting salts}} (<b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents)</b> most {{commonly}} used {{in the manufacture of}} process cheese either alone or in mixtures. Their role during processing is to sequester calcium in the natural cheese, to solubilize protein and increase its hydration and swelling, to facilitate emul sification of fat, and to adjust and stabilize pH. Changes taking place in natural cheese during processing can be studied by microscopy. Micrographs demonstrating the emulsification of fat, presence of salt crystals, and partial solubilization of protein in labo ratory- made and commercial process cheeses have been used to illustrate the various effects of the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents.</b> Optical, particularly polarizing and fluorescence microscopy provides rapid information. Electron microscopy reveals greater detai 1. In combination with energy dispersive spectrometry, electron microscopy can be used to analyze the chemical composition of salt crystals in the process cheese. However, detailed studies of the relationships existing among the microstructure of the process cheese, its composition, and physical properties such as consistency, spreadability, capability of remelting etc. have yet to be carried out...|$|R
40|$|Cacao beans (Theobroma cacao Linn) {{had been}} studied having {{antioxidant}} activity. This research aimed to formulate body scrub cream from cacao beans powder which is physically stable. Cacao beans powder was formulated using combined <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> polysorbate 60 and sorbitan 60 3 %, polysorbate 80 and sorbitan 80 3 %, and {{sodium lauryl sulphate}} 1, 5 %. The tests of cream stability include organoleptic test (odor and color), pH, creaming, viscosity test, globule size and phase inversion, were conducted {{before and after the}} cream treated in stress condition for 12 hours (10 cycles in temperature 5 ?? and 35 ??C). The statistical analysis with RAL showed that the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> had given a real influence to the viscosity of the scrub cream before and after the stress condition, but it didn???t give any influence to the measurement of dispersed size droplets before and after the stress condition. The result did not show creaming and inverse phase to the all scrub cream, so that all the scrub cream can be categorized as cream with good physical stability...|$|R

50|$|Sorbitan esters (also {{known as}} Spans) are {{nonionic}} surfactants {{that are used}} as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> {{in the preparation of}} emulsions, creams, and ointments for pharmaceutical and cosmetic use. When used alone they produce stable water-in-oil emulsions but they are frequently used with a polysorbate in varying proportions to produce water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions or creams with a variety of different textures and consistencies. Sorbitan esters are also used as emulsifiers and stabilisers in food.|$|R
50|$|Natural gums are polysaccharides {{of natural}} origin, capable of causing a large {{increase}} in a solution’s viscosity, even at small concentrations.

In other industries, they are also used as adhesives, binding agents, crystal inhibitors, clarifying agents, encapsulating agents, flocculating agents, swelling agents, foam stabilizers, etc. Most often these gums {{are found in the}} woody elements of plants or in seed coatings.|$|R
40|$|Process cheese {{food was}} made using sodium citrate (2. 7 %) or {{trisodium}} phosphate (TSP, 2. 7 %) as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents.</b> No precooked cheese (rework) {{was used in}} some samples whereas in others the rework (20 %) consisted of a cheese blend emulsified with sodium citrate (2. 7 %) and (a) briefly heated to 82 degrees C, (b) heated to 82 degrees C for 1 h, (c) heated to 82 degrees C for 5 h, and (d) heated to 82 degrees C for 5 h, frozen at - 10 degrees C for 24 h, and thawed at + 4 degrees C. Heating for {{extended periods of time}} produced so-called hot melt. When used as rework, hot melt considerably decreased the meltability of the product made. All samples under study were examined by light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transission electron microscopy (TEM). Gradual solubilization of the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> in the cheese blend and emulsification of fat were visualized by LM and SEM. TEM revealed considerable changes in the protein matrices of the hot melt and the process cheese food made with TSP. Small electron-dense areas having a high affinity for osmium developed in both products, but their shapes and degrees of affinity for osmium were different. It was possible to detect the presence of hot melt used as rework in the process of cheese food samples under study...|$|R

5000|$|Emulsion polymerization: {{similar to}} {{suspension}} polymerization {{except that the}} initiator is soluble in the aqueous phase {{rather than in the}} monomer droplets (the monomer is hydrophobic, and the initiator is hydrophilic). An <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> is also needed.|$|E
40|$|Oil-in-water (O/W) {{emulsions}} {{are among}} the main dispersed lipid systems in food. Antioxidants are often used {{in order to avoid}} or to reduce the rate of lipid oxidation reactions that, in this case, can be mainly considered as interfacial phenomena. Interaction might take place at this level between the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents,</b> antioxidant and the pro-oxidant compounds that affects the colloidal properties of the system and the oxidative stability. 2 -Objective i) to study how antioxidant molecules and the interactions between these compounds and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> at the interfacial level can modify the colloidal properties of a characterised emulsified system ii) to study the effect of the content and activity of antioxidants on lipid oxidation in emulsified systems over storage time 3 - Methods Emulsions were prepared using refined olive oil (20 % w/w) and PBS (50 mM, pH 7). Gallic acid, catechin and quercetin were chosen as antioxidant compounds while Tween 20 and β-lactoglobulin were used as surface active agents. Surface tension measurements, ξ-sizing and ξ-potential were carried out on model solutions containing the phenolic compounds both alone and in combination with the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents.</b> Particle size distribution, bulk rheology, lipid hydroperoxide content, TBAR’s and tryptophan fluorescence determinations were carried out on the emulsified systems over storage time (33 days at 40 °C). 4 -Results All the antioxidants proved to be slightly surface active with catechin being the most efficient among them. In emulsions, quercetin and catechin concentrations were negatively correlated against droplet size. The antioxidant concentration used to test the emulsions' oxidative stability was set to 10 - 4 M according to colloidal and rheological measurements in order to have the maximum amount of antioxidant solubilised in the system without altering their overall colloidal properties. Gallic acid, despite its partitioning in the water phase, due to its polarity proved to delay both the primary and secondary oxidations and to retard the formation of oxidation products. 5 - Significance of the research to the food engineering field This research could find obvious practical application in the development of innovative formulated multi-phased food and beverages as well as nutraceuticals...|$|R
50|$|<b>Emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> are {{effective}} at extinguishing fires on small, thin-layer spills of flammable liquids (Class B fires). Such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the flammable vapors {{in the water}} phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an aqueous surfactant solution to the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment {{is a function of}} the volume of the fuel, whereas other agents such as aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.|$|R
50|$|Lime and ash {{are highly}} alkaline: the {{alkalinity}} helps {{the dissolution of}} hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the corn. Some of the corn oil is broken down into <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the corn proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains. The soaked maize is washed, and then ground into masa. When fresh masa is dried and powdered, it becomes masa seca or masa harina.|$|R
