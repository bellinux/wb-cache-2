In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket,</b> suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness, and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro is a {{widespread}} hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and {{is thought to be}} composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges and hills, between which exist undulating valleys. Much of the <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> from the Imbrium impact is covered with debris from younger impacts and material churned up by possible moonquakes. Debris found in the formation may have originated from deep beneath the original crust, and samples collected there could give insight into the geologic history of the Moon. The petrology of the formation, based on data obtained on Apollo 14, indicates a history of impact and ejection possibly spanning over approximately 500 million years.|$|E
5|$|The Tycho impact, which {{occurred}} between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed secondary crater clusters in various {{locations of the}} Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest that the central crater cluster in the valley formed {{as a result of}} said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority of them have a downrange <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket,</b> or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central crater cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed {{as a result of an}} avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater. If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of extents of rampart ejecta {{deposits}} as {{a function}} of the size of the parent craters support models which, for craters larger than about 6 km diameter, constrain <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> to all have a similar maximum thickness regardless of the crater size. These volatile-rich <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> may have failed under their own weights, then flowed radially outward. Assuming this to be so, some of the physicomechanical properties of the ejecta deposits at the time of their emplacement can then be determined. Finite-element studies of the stress magnitudes, distributions, and directions in hypothetical Martian rampart <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> reveal that the material most likely failed when the shear stresses were less than 500 kPa and the angle of internal friction was between 26 and 36 deg. These figures imply that the ejecta has a water content between 16 and 72 %.

25|$|Overall about 15 impact basins {{have been}} {{identified}} on the imaged part of Mercury. Other notable basins include the 400km wide, multi-ring, Tolstoj Basin which has an <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> extending up to 500km from its rim, and its floor has been filled by smooth plains materials. Beethoven Basin also has a similar-sized <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> and a 625km diameter rim.|$|E
25|$|Despite Tolstoj’s great age and its embayment by {{the ancient}} inter- crater plains, it retains an {{extensive}} and remarkably well preserved, radially lineated <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> around two-thirds of its circumference. The ejecta tends to be blocky and only weakly lineated between {{the inner and outer}} rings. Radial lineations with a slight swirly pattern are best seen on the southwest side of Tolstoj. The unusual rectilinear map pattern of the ejecta suggests: (1) control of the ejecta pattern by prebasin structures, (2) preferential burial along structural trends of an originally symmetrical <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> by the intercrater plains material, or (3) formation of Tolstoj by an oblique impact from the northwest that produced an <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> with bilateral symmetry and little or no deposition uprange. Analysis of stereo- photography of Tolstoj ejecta northeast of the crater suggests that this deposit has been upwarped to a higher elevation relative to the surrounding plains.|$|E

40|$|The {{evidence}} {{of interaction between}} impact flow <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> and pre-existing landforms such as craters, scarps, and wrinkle ridges may yield important clues as {{to the nature of}} the ejecta emplacement process. The morphology of flow <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> and the interactions of these blankets with pre-emplacement impact craters were characterized. About 80 small satellite craters on or in 3 well-expressed low ejecta parent impact craters were recognized. Interaction of the blanket with pre-existing structures was studied, and several types were described. These are: (1) infilling; (2) encroachment; (3) overflow; and (4) breaching. Examination of the overall morphology of three <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> reveals a range of thickness, from depths sufficient to completely bury craters in the 5 km diameter range in distal areas of the blankets, to very thin blankets which allow subtle pre-existing topography to be visible within a half the diameter of the parent crater. Radial and azimuthal symmetries appear to exist within the blankets over a range of morphologies. It also appears that there is a weak linear correlation between the diameter of craters with nearly 100 % infilling and distance from the center of the parent crater...|$|R
50|$|The {{multiple}} impact {{hypothesis is}} supported by correlation of segments of the dichotomy with the rims of several large impact basins. But there are {{large parts of the}} Borealis Basin outside the rims of those impact basins. If the Martian lowlands were formed by the multiple basins then their inner ejecta and rims should stand above upland elevations. The rims and <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> of the lowland impact craters are still much below the upland areas. There are also areas in the lowlands that are outside any of the impact basins, these areas must be overlain by multiple <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> and should stand at elevations similar to the original planetary surface. That clearly is not the case either. One approach explaining the absence of <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> infers that no ejecta was ever present. Absence of ejecta could be caused by a large impactor scattering the ejecta into outer space. Another approach proposed the formation of the dichotomy by cooling at depth and crustal loading by later volcanism. The multiple-impact hypothesis is also statistically unfavorable, it is unlikely that multiple impacts basins occur and overlap primarily in the northern hemisphere.|$|R

Previous global observations and the criteria applied to assess the degree of fluidization of ejecta flows are discussed, and the present high-resolution images are characterized in detail. Although most of the craters are found to show no signs of ice/water action, there are notable exceptions, including two apparently ice-rich eroded <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> in Shiaparelli Basin and signs of surface flow in Cerulli Crater.

25|$|Coarsely lineated ejecta {{blankets}} from Beethoven and Raphael basins {{dominate the}} southern part of the map area. The crater wall of Beethoven is buried by its <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> and by plains materials. Although the ejecta blankets from both basins are extensive, they are highly asymmetrical and deeply embayed in places by intercrater plains and younger plains units. These embayment relations, together with the discontinuous and subdued appearance of the rim crests and interior walls of the basins, suggest that they are relatively old impact structures. Morphologic appearances may be misleading on Mercury, however, because of the planet’s high temperature and gravity field compared with, for example, those of the Moon. Both of these conditions may promote, particularly on large structures, more rapid isostatic adjustments that would be expressed by subdued topography and the premature “aging” of once-large topographic features. Crater counts, on the other hand, tend to support observed stratigraphic relations.|$|E
25|$|Materials of {{the smooth}} plains and very smooth plains are also {{concentrated}} {{mainly in the}} eastern part of the map area. The smooth plains unit has a lower density of small craters than does intermediate plains material and a somewhat hummocky surface with scattered small hills and knobs. The hummocks within fresh c5 craters may be mantled floor materials or incipient peak rings (see, for example, crater Callicrates at lat 66° S., long 32°; FDS 27402). The very smooth plains unit has virtually no visible small craters and displays smoother planar surfaces than those of the smooth plains unit. It occurs in the lowest areas within smooth plains material (including areas within buried crater depressions) and commonly within older craters. The areas of greatest concentration of smooth and very smooth plains materials also contain the most ridges, which suggests that ridges and the younger plains units are genetically related. Very smooth plains material for instance, commonly lies at the base of ridges or scarps. It occurs as small patches within the smooth plains unit that fills the crater Pushkin. Smooth plains material embays the <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> of a c3 crater on Pushkin’s rim at lat 66° S, long 28° (FDS 27402) and fills the interior and part of the outer-ring area of Bach. The distribution of these two youngest plains units may indicate that the smooth plains material as mapped is nothing more than a thin, discontinuous layer of very smooth plains material that mantles the older units. In this respect, it is similar to the lunar Cayley Formation, which is probably basin ejecta. However, unlike plains material of the lunar uplands, no source basin is evident for the mercurian smooth and very smooth plains units within the imaged part of the Bach region. Although such a source basin may lie within the part not imaged, intervening areas do not contain smooth or very smooth plains materials. For these reasons we tentatively ascribe a volcanic origin to most of the smooth and very smooth plains material. The ridges appear to be of volcano-tectonic origin; the fracturing may have provided the means by which lavas reached the surface to form these younger plains units. Some very smooth and smooth plains materials that form the floors of c5 and c4 craters may be impact melt.|$|E

25|$|The {{youngest}} rock units {{consist of}} rough terra and smooth plains materials. Rough terra occurs as overlapping and intermixed <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> around dusters of large young craters {{in the eastern}} part of the quadrangle. The relief here appears to be higher than elsewhere in the map area, and the occurrence of dense arrays of fresh secondary craters produces a coarsely textured, hummocky surface at a scale of about 10–20km. The effect of roughness is highlighted by the low sun illumination angle. Ordinarily, rough terra material would be subdivided and mapped as individual <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> around and belonging to particular craters. In this eastern region, however, the closely grouped craters have about the same age, and it has not been possible to distinguish the boundaries between their aprons in many places.|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo-based {{computer}} calculations, {{as well as}} analytical approaches utilizing probabilistic arguments, {{were applied}} to gain insight into the principal regolith impact processes and their resulting kinetics.

The west half of the mapped area (between long 100° and 190° W.) is dominated by older craters and by intercrater plains material that lies between and within them. Younger crater materials, intermediate plains material, and small patches of smooth plains material are superposed on all other units.

25|$|Crater {{morphology}} {{provides information}} about the physical structure and composition of the surface. Impact craters allow us to look deep below the surface and into Mars geological past. Lobate <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> (pictured left) and central pit craters are common on Mars but uncommon on the Moon, which may indicate the presence of near-surface volatiles (ice and water) on Mars.

25|$|No terra {{material}} {{similar to}} that in the Kuiper quadrangle (De Hon and others, 1981) was recognized in the Beethoven quadrangle. Its absence may be due, in part, to fewer clusters of large young craters whose coalesced <b>ejecta</b> <b>blankets</b> could have yielded the coarsely textured, rough surfaces that characterize the unit in the Kuiper area. Also, the visible effect of roughness is diminished by the higher sun angle at which the Beethoven images were acquired.|$|R
2500|$|Major {{divisions}} of rock {{units in the}} quadrangle are (1) plains materials and (2) crater and basin materials. Surfaces of the plains units range in morphology from relatively level but rough to nearly flat and smooth; the latter terrain has intermediate albedo {{like that of the}} Cayley Formation or older maria on the Moon. Plains materials are identified in part by surface texture and their relative ages determined by density of superposed craters. Intercrater plains material, one of the two oldest plains units, was originally described by Trask and Guest. It covers large areas in the western, central, and southeastern parts of the quadrangle. There, as in other regions of Mercury, its surface reveals the outlines of many buried crater rim crests and knobby remnants of an older resurfaced terra. This unit has been scoured by many secondary craters that have formed overlapping chains and troughs that contribute to its hummocky texture. The intercrater plains unit is inferred to consist of crater and basin ejecta deposits, volcanic flows, and possible pyroclastic deposits that have partly resurfaced and smoothed older, highly cratered, crustal rocks. The unit appears to be gradational laterally eastward with plains and terra material, undivided, and vertically with intermediate plains material. The intercrater plains material is probably {{about the same age as}} the <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> around Beethoven basin: both units have a high crater density. That the plains unit is younger than Beethoven may be indicated in some areas where the basin’s <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> appears to be partly obscured by the overlap or embayment of plains material. Spudis and Prosser (1984) have suggested that Beethoven may possibly be late c3 in age or as old as early c2.|$|E
2500|$|It {{contains}} {{the southern part}} of Caloris Planitia, which is the largest and best preserved basin seen by Mariner 10. This basin, about 1550km in diameter, is surrounded by a discontinuous annulus of ejecta deposits of the Caloris Group that are embayed and covered by broad expanses of smooth plains. The southeast half of the quadrangle is dominated by ancient crater deposits, by nondescript rolling to hummocky plains materials between individual craters, and by isolated patches of nondescript plains. The ancient and degraded Tolstoj multiring basin, about 350km in diameter, is in the south-central part of the quadrangle. The large, well-preserved crater Mozart (285km diameter) is a prominent feature {{in the western part of}} the area; its extensive <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> and secondary crater field are superposed on the smooth plains surrounding Caloris.|$|E
2500|$|An {{impact crater}} {{on the sea}} floor would be {{evidence}} of a possible cause of the P–Tr extinction, but such a crater would by now have disappeared. As 70% of the Earth's surface is currently sea, an asteroid or comet fragment is now perhaps {{more than twice as}} likely to hit ocean as it is to hit land. However, Earth has no ocean-floor crust more than 200 million years old because the [...] "conveyor belt" [...] process of seafloor spreading and subduction destroys it within that time. Craters produced by very large impacts may be masked by extensive flood basalting from below after the crust is punctured or weakened. Subduction should not, however, be entirely accepted as an explanation of why no firm evidence can be found: as with the K-T event, an <b>ejecta</b> <b>blanket</b> stratum rich in siderophilic elements (such as iridium) would be expected to be seen in formations from the time.|$|E

Undoubtedly, the ejecta also influences a large part of the as-yet-unseen terrain to the west. A stratigraphic and structural comparison between the Orientale and Caloris Basins has been made by McCauley. McCauley and others have proposed a formal rock stratigraphy for the Caloris Basin that we have adopted on the present map. This stratigraphy is patterned after that used in and around the Orientale Basin on the Moon and should aid in the future recognition of pre- and post-Caloris events over a broad expanse of the surface of Mercury. Crater degradation chronologies, such as the one modified from Trask, and correlations between plains units on the basis of crater frequency may aid in tying much of the remainder of the surface of Mercury to the Caloris event.|$|E
