5|$|Learned Hand {{remained}} in good {{physical and mental}} condition <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of judicial activism, a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring {{the fact that they}} might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as The Bill of Rights, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist the}} new government, since February 2000 the United Nations {{has had the}} United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (now called MONUSCO), which {{currently}} has a strength of over 16,000 peacekeepers in the country. Its principal tasks are to provide security in key areas, such as the South Kivu and North Kivu in the east, and to assist the government in reconstruction. Foreign rebel groups {{are also in the}} Congo, as they have been <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> half-century. The most important is the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), against which Laurent Nkunda's troops were fighting, but other smaller groups such as the anti-Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army are also present.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> century {{military}} {{service has been}} one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and {{military service}} have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity.|$|E

25|$|The Regia Marina {{performed}} well and bravely in its North African convoy duties, but remained at a technical disadvantage. The Italian ships relied on speed but {{could easily be}} damaged by shell or torpedo, due to their relatively thin armour. The fatal and final blow to the Italian Navy was a shortage of fuel, which forced its main units to remain at anchor <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year of the Italian alliance with Germany.|$|E

25|$|Much {{evidence}} suggests that <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> few centuries, nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations, and even among social classes in the same population. Recent worldwide increased consumption of animal protein, other changes in nutrition, and increases in childhood obesity have resulted in falling ages of puberty, mainly in those populations with the higher previous ages. In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking.|$|E
25|$|Successful cricketers {{often become}} lasting celebrities in Australia. Sir Donald Bradman, {{who made his}} Test debut in the 1928–29 series against England, is {{regarded}} as the game's greatest batsman and a byword for sporting excellence. Other Australian cricketers who remain household names include Richie Benaud, Dennis Lillee and Shane Warne. Internationally, Australia has <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> century sat at or {{near the top of the}} cricketing world. In the 1970s, Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer founded World Series Cricket from which many international forms of the game have evolved.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 450 years Anglicans {{worldwide}} {{have used}} the Book of Common Prayer framed by Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer in 1549, revised significantly in 1552 and modified slightly in 1662. They have also subscribed to, or otherwise acknowledged as foundational, the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion as listed in the Book of Common Prayer. While the Book of Common Prayer is no longer used in many Sydney churches, the diocese still fully affirms the doctrine and principles embodied within it as they interpret them. In keeping with the theologically reformed character of the 39 Articles, the diocese holds the view that all church doctrine and traditions {{are subject to the}} authority of Scripture.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} was proclaimed at <b>the</b> redistribution <b>of</b> 13 July 1906, and was first contested at the 1906 election. The {{division was}} named after the Maribyrnong River, which runs through it. A safe Labor seat <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, it became a marginal Liberal seat <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s, {{in part due to}} <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Labor Party.

25|$|From 2000 to 2010, the United States Census Bureau {{reported}} that Mississippi {{had the highest}} rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race, up 70 percent in the decade; it amounts to a total of 1.1 percent of the population. In addition, Mississippi led the nation <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population. The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of racial segregation. In the civil rights era, people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.|$|E

500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2008 World Championships in Östersund, Sweden, Neuner {{tried to}} lower expectations, stating a repeat of last year's {{performance}} would be impossible. She failed to defend her titles in the sprint and pursuit races, with shooting errors preventing better results; she finished 17th and sixth respectively. [...] On 12 February 2008, she won the mixed relay with Sabrina Buchholz, Andreas Birnbacher and Michael Greis to claim her first gold medal. Four days later, she won her second title in the mass start, beating Norway's Tora Berger by 3.0seconds. She had four shooting errors compared to Berger's one and skied {{side by side with}} the Norwegian <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> lap, in what she later described as her hardest fought victory ever. [...] Alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm, Neuner also claimed gold in the relay race on 17 February 2008. By winning three more titles, she became the youngest six-time world champion, solidifying her status as Germany's biggest biathlon star.|$|E

2500|$|Much {{like the}} Alabama-Auburn {{football}} rivalry, the Carolina–Duke rivalry {{is all the}} more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 60 years. [...] Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in NCAA men's basketball history; Carolina is #3 on the list of all-time s in Division I Men's Basketball and Duke is #4. Duke has won five NCAA championships and has appeared in sixteen Final Fours, while North Carolina has won six NCAA championships and appeared in a record twenty Final Fours.|$|E
2500|$|Though the {{two schools}} {{had always had}} the hatred born of {{familiarity}} and proximity, {{some of the earliest}} roots of the modern basketball rivalry occurred in the early 1960s when Duke star and eventual national player of the year Art Heyman got into a brawl on the court with Carolina's Larry Brown which resulted in suspensions for both players. The rivalry reached unprecedented heights in the mid-1980s under head coaches Dean Smith of Carolina and Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, thanks to the emergence of cable channels such as ESPN and the increasing coverage of the ACC in national broadcasts by the three major networks, giving a vast national audience more opportunities to witness the two teams and their coaches. [...] Indeed, the two teams have been fixtures on national television since the early 1980s, and their final regular season clash has been nationally televised <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 30 years.|$|E
