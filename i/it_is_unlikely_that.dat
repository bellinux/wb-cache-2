5|$|Due to Microsoft's current {{ownership}} of Rare, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> either {{game will be}} released for the Virtual Console. Snake Rattle 'n' Roll, along with Rare's other NES titles, appear in the Xbox One compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Ipswich's record home {{attendance}} is 38,010 for a sixth round FA Cup match against Leeds United on 8 March 1975. With {{the introduction of}} regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Maria Theresa ever {{completely}} {{recovered from}} the smallpox attack in 1767, as 18th-century writers asserted. She suffered from shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, distress, necrophobia and insomnia. She later developed edema.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> {{the saga}} writers had {{accurate}} information on {{details of the}} battle beyond the sparse accounts in the surviving poems. Nevertheless, starting with Oddr Snorrason, they present an elaborate literary account, depicting the main participants through their words and deeds.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{encounters}} {{his future}} wife, Sarah (Julie Bowen), who has arrived in his emergency room after a car crash. Jack saves Sarah's life, but {{goes on to}} tell her that due to spinal cord injury, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Sarah will regain the ability to walk.|$|E

5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant {{would be an}} individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{battle of}} Salamis {{is not well}} {{described}} by the ancient sources, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across {{the width of the}} straits. What follows is more of a discussion than a definitive account.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E

5000|$|By now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{apparent}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the Welfreighter {{would be}} needed in Europe, therefore consideration was given to its use in the Far East.|$|R

5|$|According to Tough, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the {{avoidance}} of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as radio waves {{could be used to}} communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} rose, and by the early 1960s this number had increased to highs of 12,000. Attendances began to fall {{towards the end of}} the 1960s; this trend continued through the 1970s, though the decade did give Tranmere its largest-ever crowd: 24,424 on 5 February 1972, for a fourth-round FA Cup match against Stoke City. With today's capacity of under 17,000, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> this record attendance will ever be broken.|$|E
5|$|Along with Charles Madigan, Keogh {{withdrew from}} playing Manchester on 11 March after tour manager James Scott refused to lend them money. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the players, {{including}} Keogh, {{would have had}} much recourse over disputes with the tour organisers; they would struggle to access the funds to necessary for passage back to New Zealand without them.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> many {{projects}} {{would have been}} affected by the measure, though it could have affected large-scale projects such as California High-Speed Rail and California Water Fix and Eco Restore.|$|R
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Aubame {{participated in}} the {{planning}} of the 1964 Gabon coup d'état. It appears that he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government. His nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, may have known of the plot beforehand and notified his uncle, although it is unknown whether or not Aubame established contact with the plotters.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{suggested}} <b>that</b> while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Lieberthal {{would choose}} to coach, enjoying golf and married life for the immediate future, he had {{expressed an interest in}} being a television analyst.|$|R
50|$|Following the March 2010 {{release of}} Blueberry/Best In The Class, the band {{concentrated}} {{on a number}} of side projects and personal work, and stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> new material would be forthcoming.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> Offa had {{significant}} {{influence in the}} early years of his reign outside the traditional Mercian heartland. The overlordship of the southern English which had been exerted by Æthelbald appears to have collapsed during the civil strife over the succession, and it is not until 764, when evidence emerges of Offa's influence in Kent, that Mercian power can be seen expanding again.|$|E
5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|The 1st-centuryAD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas {{second only}} to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' {{influence}} has been found or suspected {{in a wide range}} of ancient writing; Longus' 2nd centuryAD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him. Almost all that he wrote seems to have disappeared within two centuries, though, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> any writer later than the 2nd centuryBC read any but a few of his lines.|$|E
50|$|US 4 only {{runs through}} a small section of {{southern}} Dover (mostly along the Spaulding Turnpike) which is several miles from downtown, meaning <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> the two highways would be easily confused.|$|R

50|$|Others scoffed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>that</b> all of {{the injustices}} {{depicted}} {{could have happened to}} one woman. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a vivid and visually spectacular depiction of the struggles many women went through in that time period.|$|R
