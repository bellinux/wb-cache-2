5|$|Ithan Creek {{is within}} the Piedmont Uplands physiographic province. The creek was {{historically}} the site of several mills and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> numerous floods over the years. In 1902, a sewage company began dumping raw sewage into the creek, but this practice was stopped in 1905. The creek is in approved trout waters. It {{is the site of}} Ithan Valley Park, a small park with hiking and fishing opportunities and the Radnor Valley Country Club.|$|E
5|$|Recently the Canning Dam <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> {{considerable}} cracking of {{the upper}} parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E

5|$|The inscribed ring {{remains the}} subject of {{considerable}} academic interest, {{and a number of}} theories regarding its origin, the reason for its burial and its date have been proposed. The inscription, which sustained irreparable damage shortly after its discovery, can no longer be read with certainty, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> various attempts at reconstruction and interpretation. Recently, however, it has become possible to reconstruct the damaged portion with the aid of rediscovered depictions of the ring in its original state. Taken as a whole, the inscribed ring may offer insight into the nature of the pre-Christian pagan religion of the Goths.|$|E

In the resulting positions Black has found it difficult to generate any winning chances, and even finding equality has not been a simple task. The fact that one must know a lot of theory just to secure a draw has rendered the entire variation beginning with 9...b5 rather unattractive from Black's point of view, even though it appears to be objectively the best move.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during three}} flybys by Cassini on February 17, March 9, and July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} Enceladus' surface features in much greater detail than the Voyager 2 observations. The smooth plains, which Voyager 2 had observed, resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps. Numerous fractures were {{found within the}} older, cratered terrain, suggesting that the surface <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> extensive deformation since the craters were formed. Some areas contain no craters, indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past. There are fissures, plains, corrugated terrain and other crustal deformations. Several additional regions of young terrain were discovered in areas not well-imaged by either Voyager spacecraft, such as the bizarre terrain near the south pole. All of this indicates that Enceladus's interior may be liquid today, even though {{it should have been}} frozen long ago.|$|E

5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize {{what is meant by}} an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> human {{influence}} {{since the}} arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after {{the arrival of}} European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century. Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the small Asian mongoose, and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko, feral cats on Mona Island have been documented attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles, and have been associated with the reduction of Mona ground iguana juveniles, and mongooses have been documented preying on Puerto Rican parrot fledgings.|$|E

25|$|As an {{approach}} to philosophy and science, Naturphilosophie has had a difficult reception. In Germany, Neo-Kantians came to distrust its developments as speculative and overly metaphysical.
