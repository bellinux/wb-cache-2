5|$|The move to top team IFK Göteborg {{went well}} and Augustinsson played {{most of the}} games during the pre-season. When Svenska Cupen began in March, he was first-choice as left-back and played two games in the group stage. IFK Göteborg later won the cup against Djurgården in the final. Just {{a couple of weeks}} before the start of 2013 Allsvenskan, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> knee injury while playing for Sweden U21 which kept him out of action for five months.

5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley soon {{gave up his}} apprenticeship, {{and after}} a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a City firm of solicitors. Here <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> working {{knowledge}} of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E

5|$|He {{played his}} 50th match for England in the 2010 World Cup {{qualifier}} against Belarus on 15 October 2008, {{after which he}} was credited as helping Wayne Rooney's improved form in international matches, with the two forming an effective strike partnership and keeping Owen out of the team. He started in a friendly against Spain in February 2009, which drew an angry reaction by Villa manager Martin O'Neill, who {{wanted to know why}} Capello played Heskey after suffering from an injury. Heskey scored his first goal for England in six years against Slovakia, scoring England's first in a 4–0 victory at Wembley Stadium. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hamstring injury during this match, which forced him into withdrawing from the squad. He scored in a 4–0 victory over Kazakhstan in a 2010 World Cup qualifier in June 2009, which was his first competitive goal for England in seven years.|$|E
5|$|Pattle worked {{toward this}} goal for some time until, in late 1935, by chance, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> copy of the Johannesburg Star newspaper. The paper {{contained}} an advertisement by the Royal Air Force (RAF) which was offering five-year short service commissions for cadets throughout the British Empire. The RAF expansion schemes required a great influx of capable personnel into the organisation as rearmament {{and the need for}} fighting men heightened. Pattle decided that a career in the RAF offered better prospects than as an instructor in South Africa and applied. Early in 1936, he was invited to Britain as an applicant. He flew to London at his own expense to attend the selection processes and was offered a commission by the selection board. He immediately returned to South Africa to arrange his migration to Britain and left aboard SS Llandovery Castle on 30 April 1936.|$|E
25|$|During {{the tour}} <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury to his shins, which Edwards felt badly {{affected}} his bowling in South Africa. In four Tests against South Africa, he managed eight wickets while conceding 648runs.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2005–06 season, Sevilla were {{reported}} to be interested in Samaras as a replacement for Júlio Baptista. While Arsenal were also looking at him after they had missed out on signing Baptista, some news organisations had reported that Arsenal had already signed Samaras and that he would join {{at the end of the}} season. However, the player's father, Ioannis Samaras said that this was untrue and that his son wanted to stay at the club for another year. Samaras scored on the opening day of the season, on 20 August, when he helped Heerenveen to a 5–4 victory over Roda JC. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> minor leg injury in September, which ruled him out of Heerenveen's UEFA Cup tie against Baník Ostrava. But he returned to action on 23 September, and scored as Heerenveen beat NEC Nijmegen 2–1. On 14 December, Samaras scored as Heerenveen came back from behind to beat Levski Sofia 2–1 in the UEFA Cup. On 30 December, Samaras scored twice as Heerenveen beat Ajax 4–2. In January 2006, Arsenal and Manchester City showed interest in signing the striker. Samaras tried to get released from his contract after Heerenveen had rejected a bid from Manchester City. However, the Dutch arbitration commission ruled that he had no grounds to end his contract. Samaras scored 25 goals in 88 appearances for Heerenveen.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{signed for}} Ebbsfleet's Conference Premier rivals York City on a free {{transfer}} on 29 June 2009.

He scored the opening goal in a 3–1 defeat to Premier League team Stoke City in the FA Cup third round on 2 January 2010, with a header from an Alex Lawless free kick. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> hamstring injury during March 2010, missing one match before making his return in a 1–0 victory over Mansfield Town later that month. He played in both legs of York's play-off semi-final victory over Luton, which finished 2–0 on aggregate. He signed a new one-year contract with York on 13 May 2010. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May, being substituted on 81 minutes, with York losing 3–1 to Oxford. He finished 2009–10 with 51 appearances and five goals for York.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} {{professional}} in 1999 with Division Three side Torquay United. Torquay were aiming for promotion during Brandon's {{first season with}} the club, but they finished two places outside the Division Three play-offs. He only played two games the following season because of a stomach tear, and upon his return Torquay were instead battling against relegation from The Football League, and Brandon left after three seasons with the club. He moved up a division and played for two years with Chesterfield, where <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> number of individual awards but spent two seasons fighting against relegation. In 2004, he joined Huddersfield Town where he twice narrowly missed out on promotion. He had a short spell on loan with Blackpool, helping them to the promotion play-offs. However, after a permanent move failed to materialise he returned to Huddersfield for a fourth season. When he was released by new manager Stan Ternent after four years with the club, he rejoined Bradford City, but had two injury-hit seasons before being released early from his contract. At {{the start of the}} following year, he moved to Thailand to join BEC Tero Sasana.|$|E

5|$|He {{participated in}} the drive through France and was wounded in Aachen, Germany and was sent to England to recover. After he recovered, he rejoined the front lines reassigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and was given a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant. By April 18, 1945, he was a first lieutenant in command of Company A, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, 7th Army. On that day, he led his company in their advance through Nuremberg, Germany, and single-handedly engaged German forces several times. As his unit passed a city square, a German machine gun opened fire, causing several casualties. Daly rushed the position and killed the three gunners. Advancing ahead of his men, he came across a German patrol preparing to use rocket launchers to ambush American tanks. He again attacked alone and, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, killed all six patrol members. When a machine gun opened fire at close range, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> dead man's rifle and killed the two-man German crew. On April 19, he was shot through the head; a bullet entered at his ear and exited from the opposite cheek. He was sent to England and eventually the United States to recuperate. At about the same time, his father, who had been wounded in France, was also being evacuated to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Symes {{returned}} to Shrewsbury and started pre-season training {{ahead of the}} 2008–09 season, having been told by Simpson {{that he would be}} given the same chance as any other player at Shrewsbury to impress, and also personally vowing to force his way into the manager's first-team plans. However, Simpson signed new strikers during the summer including Grant Holt, who cost a club record £170,000, and Symes spent {{the start of the season}} out of the team. After scoring six goals in two consecutive reserve games, Symes earned his first game for the first team, when he came off the bench to score a late equaliser and earn Shrewsbury a 2–2 draw with Notts County on 30 August. After starting in a 2–1 Football League Trophy victory against Exeter City, he was again sidelined when <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> knee injury. He {{returned to}} action in mid-October, when he came on as substitute to give Shrewsbury a late equaliser against Port Vale, only for Vale to score another goal to give them victory.|$|E
5|$|Two Barcelona players {{missed the}} final through suspension: right back Dani Alves, who {{picked up his}} third yellow card of the tournament in Barcelona's semi-final second leg against Chelsea on 6 May 2009; and left back Éric Abidal, who was sent off in the same game for a {{professional}} foul on Nicolas Anelka. Defender Rafael Márquez also missed the match after <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> knee injury in {{the first leg of}} the semi-final, ruling him out {{for the rest of the}} season. Forward Thierry Henry and semi-final-winning midfielder Andrés Iniesta were also doubts for the final; Henry damaged his right posterior cruciate ligament in Barcelona's 6–2 league win over Real Madrid on 2 May 2009, while Iniesta was discovered to have suffered a tear in his right thigh following Barça's 3–3 draw with Villarreal on 10 May. Both Henry and Iniesta returned to light training on 22 May, but they had not yet resumed training with the main squad and remained doubts for the final. Carles Puyol, however, was available for selection after he served a one-match suspension in the semi-final second leg. In all, FC Barcelona started with seven players who had come up through the youth system, of whom five were Catalans.|$|E
50|$|In this season, Ashish Reddy {{has been}} picked by Sunrisers Hyderabad (which {{replaced}} Deccan Chargers) {{and played a}} few games and he was sidelined as <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> injury that put him out of action for rest of the IPL.|$|R
