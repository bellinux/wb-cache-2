40|$|Fruit remains such as cherries, plums, sloes and peaches are {{frequently}} recovered from archaeological waterlogged contexts. During an archaeological excavation {{in the city}} centre of Sassari (Italy), in 2007, a medieval well, dated at 1330 - 1360 AD, was discovered. The sediment appeared very rich in waterlogged plant remains and a consistent presence of Prunus <b>endocarps,</b> attributed to different species, was recorded. Thanks to the exceptional state of preservation of the remains, the morphological and morphometric analysis was performed. The discrimination among Prunus species is routinely based on visual evaluations of some traditional morphological characters of the <b>endocarps.</b> Currently, computer vision and image analysis techniques represent a more accurate, reliable and repeatable method to distinguish wild species from cultivated ones. Digital images, acquired with a flatbed scanner, were processed and analysed using the image analysis software KS- 400 (Carl Zeiss Vision, Germany). A macro, specifically developed to measure <b>endocarps</b> of the Prunus L. genus, allowed measuring 33 morpho-colorimetric features and 80 elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs). In this work, the results obtained from the comparison between archaeological <b>endocarps</b> and the modern samples of Prunus collected in Sardinia, are presented. A clear statistical discrimination among 17 P. domestica, 111 P. domestica subsp. insistitia and 130 P. spinosa archaeological <b>endocarps,</b> was achieved.

25|$|As the ovules {{develop into}} seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the pericarp, may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or form a hard outer {{covering}} (as in nuts). In some multiseeded fruits, {{the extent to}} which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the exocarp (outer layer, also called epicarp), mesocarp (middle layer), and <b>endocarp</b> (inner layer). In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary, other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals, sepals, and stamens), fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off. When such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit, it is called an accessory fruit. Since other parts of the flower may contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study flower structure to understand how a particular fruit forms.|$|E

Teak (Tectona grandis L. f) is a {{tropical}} tree of commercial value {{due to the}} high demand of its high-quality wood and rapid growth. Genetic improvement programs for this species have resulted in seeds of better quality and, at the same time, improvement {{in the quality of}} plantations.

40|$|The fate {{of seeds}} during {{secondary}} dispersal is largely unknown for most species in most ecosystems. This paper deals with sources of seed output of Prosopis flexuosa D. C.

In spite of occasional high fruit production, P. flexuosa seeds are not usually found in the soil, suggesting that this species does not form a persistent soil seed-bank. The magnitude of removal by animals and germination of P. flexuosa seeds was experimentally analysed during {{the first stage of}} secondary dispersal (early autumn). The proportion of seeds removed by granivores was assessed by offering different types of diaspores: free seeds, seeds inside intact <b>endocarps,</b> pod segments consisting of 2 [...] 3 seeds, and seeds from faeces of one herbivorous hystricognath rodent, the mara (Dolichotis patagonum). The proportion of seeds lost through germination was measured for seeds inside intact <b>endocarps,</b> seeds inside artificially broken <b>endocarps,</b> and free seeds. Removal by ants and mammals is the main factor limiting the formation of a persistent soil seed-bank of P. flexuosa: > 90 % of the offered seeds were removed within 24 h of exposure to granivores in three of four treatments. Seeds from the faeces of maras, on the other hand, were less vulnerable to granivory than were other types of diaspores. These results suggest that herbivory might be an indirect mechanism promoting seed longevity in the soil (and likely germination) by discouraging granivore attack. On the other hand, germination did not seem to have an important postdispersal impact on the persistence of P. flexuosa seeds in the soil.
