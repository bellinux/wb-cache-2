Although there was a higher soluble solids content in the final concentrate, this was due to the increase in pigment yield. Therefore, pectinase is a viable processing aid that can deliver higher quality product and increase efficiency of the extraction process...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the concentrations of}} lead and cadmium in edible parts of Colocasia esculenta, Amaranthus spp. and <b>Ipomoea</b> <b>batata</b> cultivated on farms in industrially polluted sections of Nyabugogo Marsh in Kigali, Rwanda. The concentrations in all three crops exceeded European Union (EU) standards for metal concentration in food crops. C. esculenta roots (Taro) contained the highest concentration of lead (1. 02 mg kg- 1) and cadmium (0. 56 mg kg- 1), approximately ten and six times over the EU limits, respectively. Even though I. batata (sweet potato) contained the lowest concentrations of lead (0. 75 mg kg- 1), this is almost eight times the upper limit. The highest bioaccumulation factors (the ratio of plant metal concentration {{to that of the}} soil in which it is found growing) for both metals were observed in amaranth plants. The concentrations of lead and cadmium in the farm soils were all acceptable based on EU standards (300 mg kg- 1 for lead and 3 mg kg- 1 respectively. The average daily consumption by an adult in the community living around the Marsh and where some of the produce is sold is 50 g of amaranth, 120 g of taro and 180 g of sweet potato. Based on the metal concentration and these rates of consumption, the daily dietary intake of lead by an adult in the community from amaranth, taro and sweet potato is 1 x 10 - 4, 3 x 10 - 4 and 4 x 10 - 4 mg kg- 1 respectively. The daily intake of cadmium is 4 x 10 - 4, 1. 7 x 10 - 4 and 1. 2 x 10 - 4 mg kg- 1 for amaranth, taro and sweet potato respectively. These metal intakes are well within the recommendations set forth by the World Health Organisation. The community also has access to multiple sources of dietary and non dietary zinc such as beans, milk and rain water collected from zinc coated roofing sheets, which serves to ameliorate the effects of cadmium. It is however worth noting that survey data may have yielded overestimates of these zinc sources, due to the conditions under which the surveys were conducted i. e. in the hearing of neighbors due to the cramped nature of housing, which may have prompted respondents to inflate consumption quantities of expensive food items. The calculated maximum recommended quantities for daily intake of the crops are very large and are unlikely to be consumed by the population i. e. > 2 kg of amaranth, > 2 kg of taro and 3 kg of sweet potato per day for an adult. Additionally, because this is a poor community, access to such quantities of food on a daily basis is not likely. The community is therefore not exposed to health risks from consuming metal contaminated crops, largely because of the small quantities consumed. The local population is therefore at no immediate risk to exceeding metal consumption limits by consuming vegetables grown in the Nyabugogo Marsh, but the threats will likely increase if the pollution of the Marsh is not addressed...|$|R
40|$|Sweet potato {{feathery}} mottle virus (SPFMV) (Potyvirus genus, Potyviridae family) causes important yield {{losses in}} sweet potato crops, {{in particular in}} co-infections with the unrelated crinivirus Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV). This thesis addresses the characterization of some novel aspects in the infectious cycle of SPFMV, such as the expression, production and function of a new gene product named P 1 N-PISPO. A better understanding of SPFMV genome organization and the functions of their gene products might be relevant to improve the control strategies against this virus and the associated diseases in sweet potato crops. The positive-sense RNA genome of SPFMV contains a large ORF, translatable as a polyprotein yielding a set of functional mature gene products (P 1, HCPro, P 3, 6 K 1, CI, 6 K 2, VPg-Nla, Nlb and CP), and a short ORF named PIPO in the - 1 frame, embedded within the P 3 region. In addition to this organization, common to {{all the members of}} the Potyvirus genus, another ORF named PISPO was predicted in the genome. PISPO is in the - 1 frame within the P 1 region of SPFMV and other related potyviruses, starting at a conserved G 1 _ 2 A 6 _ 7 motif, similar to the motif found upstream of PIPO. The expression of PISPO during SPFMV viral infection could result in the production of a putative new gene product P 1 N-PISPO. In the present work, the presence of the PISPO frame has been investigated in a Spanish isolate of SPFMV infecting <b>Ipomoea</b> <b>batata</b> plants. The genome sequence of this isolate has been assembled from NGS data, showing that the expected trans-framed PISPO sequences is present, preceded by a G 2 A 6 motif. A specific analysis of the NGS data has revealed a significant proportion of transcripts with an extra A in the motif at the beginning of PISPO, as well as a lower proportion of transcripts with an extra in the corresponding conserved motif preceding the PIPO region. These results have demonstrated that a polymerase slippage mechanism could generate transcripts containing extra A residues (G 2 A 7) to allow the translation of P 1 N-PISPO and P 3 N-PIPO gene products. Analysis of the viral gene products present in SPFMV infected plant tissues has been performed using LC-MS/MS after separation in SDS- PAGE, focusing in products > 50 KDa. Peptides corresponding to the P 1 protein have been detected from both the N-terminal portion (11 different peptides, 39 % coverage), before the frameshifting signal and therefore common for P 1 and P 1 N-PISPO, and in the C- terminal part (2 peptides exclusive for P 1, 10 % coverage). Interestingly, four peptides exclusive of PISPO, in its unique ORF (21. 3 % coverage), have been also found. These results have confirmed that both products P 1 and P 1 N-PISPO are expressed and coexisted during SPFMV infection. Furthermore, transient expression of SPFMV gene products coagroinfiltrated with a reporter gene in Nicotiana benthamiana have revealed that P 1 N-PISPO acts as an RNA silencing suppressor, a role normally associated with HCPro in other potyviruses. Moreover, mutation of WG/GW motifs present in P 1 N-PISPO abolished its silencing suppression activity, suggesting that the function might require interaction with Argonaute components of the silencing machinery, as was shown for other viral suppressors. Altogether, the results of this thesis have confirmed the expression of P 1 N-PISPO during SPFMV infection and they have revealed a polymerase slippage mechanism as the responsible of P 1 N-PISPO production. Our results also have demonstrated the role of P 1 N-PISPO as a RNA silencing suppressor. El virus Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) (Gènere Potyvirus, Família Potyviridae) presenta un genoma de cadena senzilla i positiva de ARN que conté una pauta de lectura oberta (ORF), traduïda com una poliproteïna que dóna lloc a un conjunt de productes gènics madurs, i una ORF curta anomenada PIPO que es troba en el marc de lectura - 1 de la regió P 3 de la poliproteïna. A més a més, en el seu genoma s'ha observat una ORF addicional anomenada PISPO. PISPO es troba en el marc de lectura - 1 dins de la regió gènica de la P 1 en SPFMV i els potyvirus més propers, començant en el motiu conservat G 1 _ 2 A 6 _ 7 i similar al motiu d'inici de PIPO. La expressió de PISPO durant la infecció del virus donaria lloc a la producció del hipotètic producte gènic P 1 N-PISPO. La presència de la pauta de lectura PISPO, precedida per un motiu G 2 A 6, ha estat confirmada en un aïllat Espanyol de SPFMV. L'anàlisi de dades obtingudes per seqüenciació massiva, ha permès identificar una proporció significativa de transcrits que contenen una A extra en el motiu al començament de PISPO, així com una proporció menor de transcrits amb aquesta A extra en el motiu de PIPO. Aquests resultats han demostrat que un mecanisme d'edició de la polimerasa podria generar transcrits amb residus A extra (G 2 A 7), els quals permetrien la traducció dels productes gènics P 1 N-PISPO i P 3 N-PIPO. L'anàlisi del productes gènics virals presents en teixits de plantes infectades amb SPFMV s'ha dut a terme mitjançant un experiment de LC-MS/MS. Pèptids corresponents a la part N-terminal de la proteïna P 1 (abans del motiu d'edició) han estat detectats, així com pèptids exclusius de la part C-terminal de la P 1 i de la pauta de lectura de PISPO. Aquests resultats han confirmat que tant P 1 com P 1 N-PISPO són expressats i co-existeixen durant la infecció de SPFMV. L'expressió transitòria de productes gènics de SPFMV coagroinfiltrats amb un gen reporter en Nicotiana benthamiana ha revelat que P 1 N-PISPO actua com a supressor de silenciament d'ARN, un rol associat normalment a HCPro en altres potyvirus. Per últim, la mutació de motius WG/GW presents en P 1 N-PISPO aboleix la seva activitat com a supressor, suggerint que la funció pot està lligada a la interacció amb les proteïnes Argonauta de la maquinària de silenciament, tal i com passa en altres supressors virals...|$|R
