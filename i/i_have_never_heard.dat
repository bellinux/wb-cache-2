In all my life, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E
500|$|Mezzrow {{described}} Beiderbecke's tone {{as being}} [...] "pickled in alcohol [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> a tone like he got before or since. He played mostly open horn, every note full, big, rich and round, standing {{out like a}} pearl, loud but never irritating or jangling, with a powerful drive that few white musicians had in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to the Netherlands, the {{harmonica}} band broke up and Geldray travelled alone to Brussels, where he found work playing with the dance orchestra at the club Le Boeuf sur le Toit, where he remained for a year. He then worked with a dance band in The Hague, before joining the house band at the Ostend Casino, the Johnny Fresno Band [...] He would meet a number of influential acts who were booked to play the casino on occasion, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, the English bandleader Ambrose and French bandleader Ray Ventura. Ventura soon offered Geldray a job and in 1937 Geldray moved to Paris. While in Paris, he went to the Hot Club de France and played with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, a musician about whom Geldray asserts, [...] "I can honestly say that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> anyone better". The two became close friends and played together often. With the invasion of France by German forces in early 1940, Geldray travelled to England, where he realised he would be safer. On 20 September 1940 he joined the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade, part of the Dutch army exiled in England. During the war he continued to play and appeared on BBC Radio; in 1942 {{he was part of the}} entertainment laid on for Princess Elizabeth's sixteenth birthday at Windsor Castle. During the course of 1942 Geldray also met Sarah Prentice, a 26-year-old Scottish variety artiste, whose professional name was Zaza Peters; the couple married on 18 January 1943.|$|E

2500|$|Once he {{repeated}} the whole finale of [...] Sonata in B minor, perhaps he had not succeeded in the short crescendo at the end {{as he would have}} wished. [...] One listened entranced, and could have heard the passage over and over again, so unique was the beauty of tone.... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> the virtuoso piece Islamey by Balakirev, as Rubinstein played it, and his interpretation of Schumann's little fantasy The Bird as Prophet was inimitable in poetic refinement: to describe the diminuendo of the pianissimo {{at the end of the}} [...] "fluttering away of the little bird" [...] would be hopelessly inadequate. [...] Inimitable, too, was the soul-stirring imagery in the Kreisleriana, the last (G minor) passage of which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> anyone play in the same manner. [...] One of Rubinstein's greatest secrets was his use of the pedal. [...] He himself very happily expressed his ideas on the subject when he said, [...] "The pedal is the soul of the piano." [...] No pianist should ever forget this.|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary {{opinions}} of Mussorgsky as a composer and person varied from positive to ambiguous to negative. Mussorgsky's eventual supporters, Stasov and Balakirev, initially registered strongly negative {{impressions of the}} composer. Stasov wrote Balakirev, in an 1863 letter, [...] "I have no use for Mussorgsky. His views may tally with mine, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> him express an intelligent idea. All in him is flabby, dull. He is, it seems to me, a thorough idiot", and Balakirev agreed: [...] "Yes, Mussorgsky is little short of an idiot." ...|$|E

2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E

"I {{think that}} the Towson, Maryland area that I am {{familiar}} with differs {{from other parts of}} Maryland because of the proximity to one of the largest slave plantations in the country.

Every African American school age child in Baltimore County had to attend school at some point at Carver in East Towson. ...I realize now that as a youngster the older African Americans avoided talking about slavery or the nearby Ridgely Plantation because they themselves were not too far removed from slavery itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|She and Robert {{first met}} violinist Joseph Joachim in November 1844, {{when he was}} just of age 14. A year later she wrote in her diary that in a concert on Nov. 11, 1845 [...] "little Joachim was very much liked. He played a new violin concerto of Mendelssohn's, which is said to be wonderful". In May 1853 they heard Joachim play the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto. Clara wrote that he played [...] "with a finish, a depth of poetic feeling, his whole soul in every note, so ideally, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> violin-playing like it, and I can truly say that I have never {{received}} so indelible an impression from any virtuoso." [...] From that time there was a friendship between Clara and Joachim, which [...] "for more than forty years never failed Clara in things great or small, never wavered in its loyalty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{and critics}} regard {{him as the}} greatest conductor in history. In his book on the symphonies of Johannes Brahms, musicologist Walter Frisch writes that Furtwängler's recordings show him to be [...] "the finest Brahms conductor of his generation, perhaps of all time", demonstrating [...] "at once a greater attention to detail and to Brahms' markings than his contemporaries {{and at the same}} time a larger sense of rhythmic-temporal flow that is never deflected by the individual nuances. He has an ability not only to respect, but to make musical sense of, dynamic markings and the indications of crescendo and diminuendo. What comes through amply... is the rare combination of a conductor who understands both sound and structure." [...] He notes Vladimir Ashkenazy who says that his sound [...] "is never rough. It's very weighty but at the same time is never heavy. In his fortissimo you always feel every voice.... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> so beautiful a fortissimo in an orchestra", and Daniel Barenboim says he [...] "had a subtlety of tone color that was extremely rare. His sound was always 'rounded,' and incomparably more interesting than that of the great German conductors of his generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{surrender}} of Takenaga's unit {{was seen as}} an extremely dishonourable act by the Japanese Army. Upon learning of it, Lieutenant General Adachi strongly reprimanded the commanders of the 41st Division, and prayed to the emperor, while shedding tears, apologising for his lack of virtue. Even after the war, Takenaga was mostly considered a disgrace, and {{it was a long time}} before any light was shone on the Takenaga incident. While Takenaga's surrender was recorded in Dai Yonjūichi Nyū Ginia Sakusenshi (History of the 41st Division's New Guinea Operation), compiled by people associated with the 41st Division, and in Senshi Sōsho, a military history of the Pacific War published by the Japanese Defense Agency, there were also histories that recorded the event as though Takenaga's unit had been wiped out. Awareness of the incident gradually increased after the publication of Fumio Takahashi's article in 1986, but even as of 2009 there were still military personnel who denied that the surrender occurred. For example, in an interview for NHK, Masao Horie, who was a staff officer for the 18th Army and a major at the time of the incident, said, [...] "Up until now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of anything like a surrender, and I believe that there were no soldiers who surrendered. If it's true that there was a commander who surrendered, then it is a shame." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2009, Steel {{auditioned for}} the third series of Britain's Got Talent. In her first {{televised}} appearance, she began her number ballet dancing to [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] from the musical My Fair Lady, then, as judge Simon Cowell started {{to reach for the}} red rejection buzzer, she began singing the song with an unexpectedly powerful voice. She received a standing ovation from the audience and the approval of all four judges. Piers Morgan told Steel, [...] "We have seen a lot of children on our show over the past three series and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> any of them sing as well as you do". [...] Kelly Brook was in tears and called her performance, [...] "beautiful and lovely". Media reports at the time claimed that Steel had referred to Cowell as a bully for critical comments he made after her first appearance on the show; however, a blog at a Lancashire newspaper's web site that was attributed to Steel and her mother denied that she had ever made such a comment. Commentators and mainstream media outlets speculated that she might defeat Susan Boyle, who had made an impression worldwide in the first show of the series. [...] Over thirteen million viewers watched Steel's performance and, within one day of a video of her performance being posted on YouTube, over a million viewers had seen her worldwide. She was interviewed on US television via satellite link during NBC's Today show.|$|E
