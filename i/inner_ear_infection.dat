25|$|On June 25, 2009, Hansbrough was {{selected}} by the Indiana Pacers with the 13th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. After missing all of training camp, the preseason and the first four games {{of the regular season}} with an injury to his shin, he made his NBA debut against the Washington Wizards on November 6, 2009. He tallied 13 points against Washington, including 7-of-10 from the foul line. At the time, he was just the second Indiana player to have attempted 10 or more free throws in a game. After averaging 3.8 rebounds per game in his first 14 appearances, he led the Pacers with 11 rebounds against the Portland Trail Blazers on December 9. In that game, he gathered a season-high seven offensive rebounds, tying Roy Hibbert for second most by any Indiana player in 2009–10. On December 11, he scored a season-high 21 points against the New Jersey Nets. On December 27, he made and attempted 10 free throws against the Miami Heat, becoming the first player in Pacers' history to record a double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) without making a field goal. His final game of the season came on January 16, 2010, as he sat out 49 of the season's final 53 games with an <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} for mice of 12 {{strains of}} Mycobacterium abscessus was {{compared with that}} for 8 strains of M. fortuitum.

Strain to strain variation was marked, especially with M. abscessus. For example, 1. 6 × 106 organisms of strain 11188 of M. abscessus produced death in four of five animals within 42 days, whereas strain 380 of M. abscessus failed to produce any deaths within 42 days. In the case of M. fortuitum, the greatest mortality observed was one of five animals, yet the incidence of spinning disease and kidney disease occurred earlier postinfection than in mice infected with M. abscessus. Histologically, abscess formation by a strain of M. abscessus was greater than by a strain of M. fortuitum, but this difference cannot {{be interpreted as a}} species difference...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} and identification of pathogenic bacteria {{has become more}} important than ever due to the increase of potential bioterrorism threats and the high mortality rate of bacterial infections worldwide. Raman spectroscopy has recently gained popularity as an attractive robust approach for the molecular characterization, rapid identification, and accurate classification {{of a wide range of}} bacteria. In this dissertation, Raman spectroscopy utilizing advanced statistical techniques was used to identify and discriminate between different pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial strains of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial species by probing the molecular compositions of the cells. The five-carbon sugar xylitol, which cannot be metabolized by the oral and nasopharyngeal bacteria, had been recognized by clinicians as a preventive agents for dental caries and many studies have demonstrated that xylitol causes a reduction in otitis media (chronic <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> <b>infections)</b> and other nasopharyngeal infections. Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the uptake and metabolic activity of xylitol in pathogenic (viridans group Streptococcus) and nonpathogenic (E. coli) bacteria by taking their Raman spectra before xylitol exposure and after growing with xylitol and quantifying the significant differences in the molecular vibrational modes due to this exposure. The results of this study showed significant stable spectral changes in the S. viridians bacteria induced by xylitol and those changes were not the same as in some E. coli strains. Finally, Raman spectroscopy experiments were conducted to provide important information about the function of a certain protein (wag 31) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using a relative non-pathogenic bacterium called Mycobacterium smegmatis. Raman spectra of conditional mutants of bacteria expressing three different phosphorylation forms of wag 31 were collected and analyzed. The results show that that the phosphorylation of wag 31 causes significant differences in the molecular structure, namely the quantity of amino acids associated with peptidoglycan precursor proteins and lipid II as observed in the Raman spectra of these cells. Raman spectra were also acquired from the isolated cell envelope fraction of the cells expressing different forms of wag 31 and the results showed that a significant number of the molecular vibrational differences observed in the cells was also observed in the cell envelope fraction, indicating that these differences are localized in the cell envelope...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundChronic otitis media(COM) is a {{significant}} clinical problem. Understanding the mechanisms of COM is critical for its control and treatment. However, little is known of the processes leading to COM {{as a result of}} lack of animal models of N–ethyl–N–nitrosourea(ENU) inducedmutations in otitis media with effusion (OME). MethodsOtoscopy and auditory brain response(ABR) evaluation were carried out under sedation in Nmf 391 mf/nmfmice of 2, 4, 6 and 8 months of age. The mice were killed for study of middle and <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> pathology. ResultsTympanic membrane visualization and ABR thresholds in 1 – to 8 –month–old Nmf 391 nmf/nmfmice showed spontaneous OME and <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> diseases in approximately 100 % of the animals. The significant elevation of ABR thresholds suggested a sensorineural component in hearing loss in addition to the conductive loss. Middle and <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> histology showed various degrees of outer hair cells loss and middle ear inflammation in all the mice, but no inflammation cells in the <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The ABR threshold at 32 kHz was significantly elevated. ConclusionsThis study shows histopathologic changes in the Nmf 391 nmf/nmfmouse model of COM with effusion that have not been reported in human COM. This ENU induced mutation model of COM will be valuable for the characterization of middle <b>ear</b> inflammation and <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> disease processes that are induced by middle <b>ear</b> <b>infections.</b> We propose that COM with effusion in this ENU induced mutation model is the cause of the cochlea hair cells damage...|$|R

50|$|By {{bypassing}} the outer or middle ear, BAHA can increase hearing in noisy situations and help localise sounds.
