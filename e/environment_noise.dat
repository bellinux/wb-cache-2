5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding <b>environment.</b> <b>Noise</b> levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E

Moreover, we demonstrate that changing the coupling bandwidth can lead to crossover between dissipative and non-dissipative entanglement dynamics, while varying the detuning controls the crossover between strong and weak coupling limits.

The negative effect caused by noise is as bad as the negative effect caused by other sources of damage.

The legislative regulation is the only possible way to provide effective protection to the human health and well-being as well as the environment.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} apply Run-to-Run (RtR) control or real time control in a semiconductor process, {{it is very}} important to estimate the process model. Traditional semiconductor process control methods neglect the importance of robustness due to the estimation methods they use. A new approach, namely the set-valued RtR controller with ellipsoid approximation, is proposed to estimate the process model from a completely di#erent point of view. Because the set-valued RtR controller identifies the process model in the feasible parameter set which is insensitive to noises, the controller is robust to the <b>environment</b> <b>noises.</b> Ellipsoid approximation can significantly reduce the computation load for the set-valued method. In this paper, the Modified Optimal Volume Ellipsoid (MOVE) algorithm is used to estimate the process model in each run.

The route bypasses Mandurah by taking traffic around the eastern side of the Peel-Harvey Estuary prior to joining the existing dual carriageway on Old Coast Road, reducing the journey time from Perth to Bunbury. The Kwinana Freeway extension and Forrest Highway were opened on 20 September 2009, with a ceremony held at the interchange between the freeway, highway, and Pinjarra Road. The roads were officially opened by Premier Colin Barnett, Senator Chris Evans, Transport Minister Simon O'Brien, Member for Canning Don Randall, and the previous Transport Minister Alannah MacTiernan.|$|E
