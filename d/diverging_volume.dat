40|$|AbstractTraffic {{incidents}} {{are a major}} source of congestion and travel time uncertainty. Traditionally, extensive attention has been given to accidents in the view of safety when studying occurrence frequency. The regularity of incident frequency, however, deserves equal attention by practitioners and researchers, especially on urban expressways with dense ramps and high traffic volume. The objective {{of this study was to}} have a thorough exploration of environmental and traffic-related causative factors of incident rate on three urban expressways in central Shanghai City, including disability incidents and crash incidents. Incident data obtained by CCTV-monitoring system were used, which contain large quantities of minor and short-duration incidents. The disaggregation of expressway sections and time intervals of this study was rare in its scope: disability frequency is analyzed on an hourly basis and segment-hour aggregation is applied for crash frequency. To account for temporal correlation among different time intervals, Generalized Estimation Equation procedure was used in this paper. In particular, the effects of traffic interaction features on incident occurrence were analyzed by considering segment length, merging and <b>diverging</b> <b>volume.</b> Results showed that temporal correlation of crash incident occurrence was larger than that of disability occurrence. There is a significant relationship of disability rate with rain and temperature, and there was more risk of vehicle disability in dense-traffic and low-speed condition. It also pointed out that the regularity of crash incident occurrence is quite different from that of accidents on highways or rural freeways: Environmental factors exert little impact on crash occurrence except from visibility; Short segment, high merging and <b>diverging</b> <b>volume</b> increased crash rate remarkably...|$|E

We study a recently proposed cartoon model of inflation in the landscape and find a reasonable chance (about ten percent) that the curvature in our universe is well above the value expected from cosmic variance. Anthropic selection does not strongly select for curvature as small as is observed (relative somewhat larger values), meaning the observational bound on curvature can be used to rule out landscape models that typically give too little inflation.

40|$|Particles {{suspended}} in a fluid {{are known to}} undergo variations in the local concentration in many flow situations; essentially a compression or expansion of the particle phase. The modeling of this behavior on a macroscopic scale requires knowledge of the effective bulk viscosity of the suspension, {{which has not been}} studied before. The bulk viscosity of a pure compressible fluid is defined as the constant of proportionality that relates the difference between the mechanical pressure and the thermodynamic pressure to the rate of compression. The bulk viscosity of a suspension is defined analogous to that for a pure fluid as the constant of proportionality relating the deviation of the trace of the macroscopic stress from its equilibrium value to the average rate of compression. The compression flow drives the suspension microstructure out of equilibrium and the thermal motion of the particles tries to restore equilibrium. The Peclet number (Pe), defined as the expansion rate made dimensionless with the Brownian time-scale, governs the departure of the microstructure from equilibrium. The microstructural forcing in compression is monopolar for small Pe resulting in a significantly slower spatial and temporal response of the microstructure compared to shearing or diffusive motion. We have determined the effective suspension bulk viscosity for all concentrations and all rates of compression, accounting for the full thermodynamic and hydrodynamic interactions that particles experience at the micro-scale. Current simulation techniques were enhanced to enable the dynamic simulation of compression flows in a suspension. A 'compression thinning' of the suspension is observed at small rates of compression and there is some 'compression thickening' at large compression rates. The bulk viscosity <b>diverges</b> as the <b>volume</b> fraction nears maximum packing and is in fact larger than the shear viscosity. Existing models for multiphase flows must therefore include the bulk viscosity term to properly simulate variations in particle concentration.

40|$|Shear {{flows of}} inelastic spheres in three {{dimensions}} in the Volume fraction range 0. 4 - 0. 64 are analysed using event-driven simulations. Particle interactions {{are considered to be}} due to instantaneous binary collisions, and the collision model has a normal coefficient of restitution e(n) (negative of the ratio of the post- and pre-collisional relative velocities of the particles along the line joining the centres) and a tangential coefficient of restitution e(t) (negative of the ratio of post- and pre-collisional velocities perpendicular to the line Joining the centres). Here, we have considered both e(t) = + 1 and e(t) = e(n) (rough particles) and e(t) =- 1 (smooth particles), and the normal coefficient of restitution e(n) was varied in the range 0. 6 - 0. 98. Care was taken to avoid inelastic collapse and ensure there are no particle overlaps during the simulation. First, we studied the ordering in the system by examining the icosahedral order parameter Q(6) {{in three dimensions}} and the planar order parameter q(6) in the plane perpendicular to the gradient direction. It was found that for shear flows of sufficiently large size, the system Continues to be in the random state, with Q(6) and q(6) close to 0, even for volume fractions between phi = 0. 5 and phi = 0. 6; in contrast, for a system of elastic particles in the absence of shear, the system orders (crystallizes) at phi = 0. 49. This indicates that the shear flow prevents ordering in a system of sufficiently large size. In a shear flow of inelastic particles, the strain rate and the temperature are related through the energy balance equation, and all time scales can be non-dimensionalized by the inverse of the strain rate. Therefore, the dynamics of the system are determined only by the volume fraction and the coefficients of restitution. The variation of the collision frequency with volume fraction and coefficient of estitution was examined. It was found, by plotting the inverse of the collision frequency as a function of volume fraction, that the collision frequency at constant strain rate <b>diverges</b> at a <b>volume</b> fraction phi(ad) (volume fraction for arrested dynamics) which is lower than the random close-packing Volume fraction 0. 64 in the absence of shear.

It is found that the dissipation rate and all components of the stress diverge proportional to the collision frequency in the close-packing limit.

40|$|Solid particles, {{suspended}} in a fluid {{and subject to}} an external force, such as gravity, settle if {{the density of the}} particles is higher than the density of the fluid. This process, which separates fluid and particles, is called sedimentation. It is important for a variety of processes in nature and industry. While naturally occuring particles {{come in a variety of}} shapes with smooth and rough surfaces, many of the fundamental issues of the sedimentation process can be studied with spherical particles. Experimentally, this situation can be realized, for instance, for glass beads which settle in a vessel. For these systems, theoretical predictions and experiments agree about the average settling rate of the particles, which depends on the concentration of the particles in the fluid. In contrast, there is much controversy about the fluctuations of the particle velocities. Available theories assume that the flow past a particle obeys the steady Stokes equation, i. e. the flow is proportional to the instantaneous particle velocity and decays as $ 1 /$distance from the particle. Caflisch and Luke (Phys. Fluids, 28 : 759, 1985) pointed out that due to these long-range hydrodynamic interactions, the fluctuations diverge for a homogeneous distribution of particles: At a distance $r$ from a particle, the fluctuations of the flow produced by that particle decay as the velocity squared, i. e. as $ 1 /r^ 2 $. Since a spherical shell at distance $r$ and of width $dr$ contains $r^ 2 dr$ particles, all shells contribute equally to the fluctuations and the integral over all shells <b>diverges</b> with the <b>volume</b> of the vessel. While numerical simulations confirm the divergence, it is in marked contrast to experiments, which show that the flow is correlated on a finite length and that correlation length and fluctuations are finite and independent of the vessel size. To uncover the discrepancy between simulations and experiments, a number of theoretical studies have looked at effects of the wall, vertical stratification of the sediment or particle concentration fluctuations. However, no conclusive explanation of the discrepancies has emerged. All theories and simulations for sedimentation above assume that the flow past the particles is steady Stokes flow. This assumption is believed to be fairly robust. In this work, the assumption is dropped and the flow is assumed to be unsteady Stokes flow, i. e. the temporal evolution of the velocity field is taken into account. How does unsteady Stokes flow differ from steady Stokes flow? The differences between steady and unsteady flow are known since the equations were formulated. In his seminal 1851 article, which is most of all famous for the equations which describe the steady flow around a steadily moving sphere, Stokes also provided the equations for the time-dependent flow past a sphere whose center of mass is in oscillatory motion. However, the consequences of the differences between the two cases and in particular their implications for sediment fluctuations have not been studied. As we show here, taking the time-dependence into account goes a long way towards resolving many of the puzzles. In order to see the effects of a time-dependent solution rather more clearly and not clouded by technicalities, we consider the situation of diffusional spreading from localized, sat fluctuating sources. For a homogeneous distribution of sources it is shown that the fluctuations of the concentration field are finite if the full time-dependent equation is used for the concentration field. In contrast, if the concentration field is approximated by the quasisteady concentration field, the fluctuations diverge. The concentration field model suggests new experiments to check time-dependence effects. Moreover, we show that the velocity fluctuations of a particle suspension are finite if the flow around the particles is described by the time-dependent Stokes equation. The fluctuations are regularized essentially due to a cut-off of the steady Stokes flow velocity field. Taking this cut-off into account, the velocity fluctuations for a particle suspension is found in agreement with experimental measurements. Time-dependence of Stokes flow is shown to be important for the dynamics of a particle suspension. This thesis initiates further investigations on particle suspensions and related problems, which take into account time-dependent Stokes flow...|$|R
