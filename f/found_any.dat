5|$|On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two {{intermediate}} stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by structural failure in the rudder and vertical stabilizer following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which <b>found</b> <b>any</b> evidence of a collision.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Flemming Knudson {{was moved}} to head the Royal Greenland fishing concern and current CEO Michael Binzer was hired with a mandate to lead the company towards greater {{commercialisation}} and self-sufficiency under the Qarsoq 2012 ("Arrow 2012") plan. On 13 June, SAS announced its intention to sell its stake in Air Greenland, a move later incorporated into its restructuring programme, but as of 2012 it has not <b>found</b> <b>any</b> buyers. On 1 October, the airline introduced its e-ticket system. Also in 2007, Air Greenland began direct service with Baltimore/Washington International Airport in the United States of America. After sixty American visitors were stranded by a strike of Air Greenland employees and the company refused to make alternate arrangements for their return, ticket sales slumped and the route was closed in March 2008.|$|E

5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian Polyglot, reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (Comma Johanneum). Erasmus replied {{that he had not}} found it in any Greek manuscript. Stunica {{answered}} that Latin manuscripts are more reliable than Greek. In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus replied that he had not <b>found</b> <b>any</b> Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered that this was a case not of omission, but simply of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{efforts were}} {{launched}} from St John's {{in the hope}} of finding more survivors. An English schooner, John Clements, spent a week searching, before returning with Arctics flagstaff but no personnel. The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, owners of the steamer Victoria, offered their vessel to the US consul for a fee of $500 a day, an action which led to considerable local press criticism. By contrast, the Bishop of Newfoundland, the Right Revd Edward Feild, provided his private yacht Hawk free of charge. Eventually Victoria agreed to assist without payment, although an unnamed correspondent of the Public Ledger doubted whether the ship made more than a perfunctory search. None of the ships other than John Clements <b>found</b> <b>any</b> definite traces of Arctic. Some reported that they had sighted debris, but were not able to identify or recover it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither <b>found</b> <b>any</b> {{evidence that}} President Reagan himself {{knew of the}} extent of the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. The Iran-Contra Affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E
