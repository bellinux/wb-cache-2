500|$|The first promotional artwork {{features}} Gaga naked with moss {{covering her}} genitals. The single's official cover art {{was released on}} October 21, showing Gaga's backside, wearing a floral thong. The cover art was shot by photographer Terry Richardson. In an interview with German television station ProSieben, Gaga explained that the explicit imagery for the cover art {{was due to the}} constant criticism and discussion surrounding her, adding that [...] "When I look at how society has changed, I feel like this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> show you my ass, because it's all I choose to give you." ...|$|E
500|$|Wayne Storr of On the Box {{stated the}} series premiere is [...] "another {{cracking}} episode," [...] and [...] "truly wonderful that Spooks still pulls it together {{to be one}} of the best British shows on telly." [...] Storr also stated the episode is an [...] "absolute must watch for anyone who has ever been a fan. For those who aren't, now <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> start." [...] Whilst also reviewing the second episode, as both episodes are considered a two-parter, Greg O'Keefe of the Liverpool Echo stated it was [...] "packed with great action sequences, razor-sharp writing and the usual quota of twists and turns. We were also treated to some excellent scenes, shot in Moscow, as the pesky Russians were established as the villains of the series." [...] John Beresford of TV Scoop stated that although he found [...] "two dodgy moments" [...] in the episode, it [...] "didn't mar what was otherwise an excellent opener to the new series." ...|$|E
500|$|... "All Mixed Up" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club issued the episode a B+ grade, {{and felt that}} the episode was superior {{to those of the}} show's first season. He asserted: [...] "Cougar Town hasn't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one. But the step from 'average' to 'good' was the easy part. Season two is the season where viewers are going {{to find out if the}} show has what it takes to make the small steps needed to get from 'good' to 'great'. There's every indication that it's on the way there in the premiere because it's finally started to wrestle with some of the knottier questions at its center." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall opined that the show averted from its original premise; [...] "It's become one of my favorite comedies, and whether you care about Aniston or not, tonight <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sample it if you dismissed it last year because of the title, the original premise or some of those early episodes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{climate of}} Chhattisgarh is tropical. It {{is hot and}} humid because of its {{proximity}} to the Tropic of Cancer and its dependence on the monsoons for rains.

60|$|Meunier, quoting Spollongain, {{states that}} the {{swordfish}} does not approach the coast of Sicily except in the season of reproduction; the males are then seen pursuing the females. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> capture them, for when the female has been taken the male lingers near and is easily approached. The fish are abundant in the Straits of Messina {{from the middle of}} April to the middle of September; early in the season they hug the Calabrian shore, approaching from the north; after the end of June they are most abundant on the Sicilian shore, approaching from the south.|$|E

"I {{wonder what}} has stirred up the Welsh now, knowing {{as they do}} that, {{although}} they may gain successes at first, it always ends in the harrying of their lands, and the burning of their castles and villages. They have been quiet for some years. But they are always like a swarm of bees. They will work, quietly enough, till they take offence at something; then they will pour out in a fury, attacking all they come across, and caring nothing about death, {{so that they can}} but prick an enemy with their stings. Maybe it is the report that the king is engaging in another Scotch war, and they think that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> gather spoil from their neighbours. They used to be mightily given to warring among themselves, but of late I have heard but little of this.|$|E
6000|$|He {{made another}} trial and failed. Once more he was astonished; once more he was humiliated--and {{as for his}} anger, it rose to summer-heat.

When a client reaches this condition, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> damage his nerve further, and this can always be done by saying some little mocking thing or other that has the outside appearance of a friendly remark--so I employed this art. I suggested that a bet might tauten his nerves, and that I would offer one, but that as I did not want it to be an expense to him, but only a help, I would make it small--a cigar, if he were willing--a cigar that he would fail again; not an expensive one, but a cheap native one, of the Crown Jewel breed, such as is manufactured in Hartford for the clergy. It set him afire all over! I could see the blue flame issue from his eyes. He said, ...|$|E
60|$|This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> drop in a {{paragraph}} of information. There is no regular livery stable in Honolulu, or, indeed, in {{any part of}} the Kingdom of Hawaii; therefore unless you are acquainted with wealthy residents (who all have good horses), you must hire animals of the wretchedest description from the Kanakas. (i.e. natives.) Any horse you hire, even though it be from a white man, is not often of much account, because it will be brought in for you from some ranch, and has necessarily been leading a hard life. If the Kanakas who have been caring for him (inveterate riders they are) have not ridden him half to death every day themselves, you can depend upon it they have been doing the same thing by proxy, by clandestinely hiring him out. At least, so I am informed. The result is, that no horse has a chance to eat, drink, rest, recuperate, or look well or feel well, and so strangers go about the Islands mounted as I was to-day.|$|E
