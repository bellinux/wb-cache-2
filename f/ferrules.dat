25|$|Until 1914 the Kuban Cossack Host wore a {{full dress}} uniform {{comprising}} a dark grey/black kaftan (knee length collarless coat) with red shoulder straps and braiding {{on the wide}} cuffs. Ornamental containers (czerkeska) which had originally contained single loading measures of gunpowder for muzzle-loading muskets, were worn on the breasts of the kaftans. The kaftan had an open front, showing a red waistcoat. Wide grey trousers were worn, tucked into soft leather boots without heels. Officers wore silver epaulettes, braiding and <b>ferrules,</b> the latter in their czerkeskas. This Caucasian national dress was also worn by the Ural Cossack Host but in different facing colors. Tall black fur hats were worn on all occasions with red cloth tops and (for officers) silver lace. A white metal scroll was worn {{on the front of}} the fur hat. A whip was used instead of spurs. Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses, Caucasian saddles and harness). On active service during World War I the Kuban Cossacks retained their distinctive dress but with a black waistcoat replacing the conspicuous red one and without the silver ornaments or red facings of full dress. A black felt cloak (bourki) was worn in bad weather both in peace-time and on active service.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{evaluate}} stress distribution of endodonti-cally treated maxillary central incisors restored with glass fiber posts, composite resin cores, and crowns with different <b>ferrule</b> designs. Materials and Methods: Four three-dimensional models of a maxillary central incisor were modeled in SolidWorks 2006. Tooth with no <b>ferrule,</b> tooth with a 2 mm circumferen-tial <b>ferrule,</b> tooth with a 2 mm beveled <b>ferrule</b> and tooth with a 0. 5 mm circumferential <b>ferrule.</b> The teeth were restored with glass fiber posts, composite resin cores, and full ce-ramics crowns. Each model was loaded (1 N) on the palatal side at an angle of 45 degrees to tooth long axis. Von Mises stress findings along the inner surface of the root canals were assessed and compared. Results: The Von Mises Stress at CEJ was the highest in the model without a <b>ferrule</b> when compared to the other models (without <b>ferrule</b> 0. 0696, short <b>ferrule</b> 0. 0492, cylindrical fer-rule 0. 0248, and beveled <b>ferrule</b> 0. 0387 MPa). Conclusion: Endodontically treated maxillary central incisors with a <b>ferrule</b> length vary-ing between 0. 5 mm and 2. 0 mm exhibit lower stress distribution compared to those with-out a <b>ferrule.</b> Keeping a long <b>ferrule</b> is suggested to decrease the stress at the cervical area of restored teeth...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Preserving intact coronal and radicular tooth structure, {{especially}} maintaining cervical {{tissue to}} create a <b>ferrule</b> effect, {{is considered to be}} crucial for the optimal biomechanical behavior of restored teeth.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to summarize the results of research conducted on different issues related to the <b>ferrule</b> effect and published in peer-reviewed journals listed in PubMed. Methods: The search was conducted using the following key words: "ferrule" and "ferrule effect" alone or in combination with "literature review," "fracture resistance," "fatigue," "finite element analysis," and "clinical trials. " Results: The findings from reviewed articles were categorized into three main categories: laboratory studies, computer simulation, and clinical trials. Laboratory studies were further classified into subchapters based on the main aspect investigated in relation to the <b>ferrule</b> effect. Conclusions: The presence of a 1. 5 - to 2 -mm <b>ferrule</b> has a positive effect on fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. If the clinical situation does not permit a circumferential <b>ferrule,</b> an incomplete <b>ferrule</b> is considered a better option than a complete lack of <b>ferrule.</b> Including a <b>ferrule</b> in preparation design could lead to more favorable fracture patters. Providing an adequate <b>ferrule</b> lowers the impact of the post and core system, luting agents, and the final restoration on tooth performance. In teeth with no coronal structure, in order to provide a <b>ferrule,</b> orthodontic extrusion should be considered rather than surgical crown lengthening.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{investigated}} the effect of different <b>ferrule</b> heights on endodontically treated premolars. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty sound mandibular first premolars were endodontically treated and then restored with 7 -mm fiber post (FRC Postec Plus # 1 Ivoclar-Vivadent) luted with self-polymerized resin cement (Multilink, Ivoclar Vivadent) while the coronal section was restored with hybrid composite core build-up material (Tetric Ceram, Ivoclar-Vivadent), which received all-ceramic crown. Different <b>ferrule</b> heights were investigated: 1 -mm circumferential <b>ferrule</b> without post and core (group 1 used as control), a circumferential 1 -mm <b>ferrule</b> (group 2), non-uniform <b>ferrule</b> 2 -mm buccally and 1 -mm lingually (group 3), non-uniform <b>ferrule</b> 3 -mm buccally and 2 -mm lingually (group 4), and finally no <b>ferrule</b> preparation (group 5). The fracture load and failure pattern of the tested groups were investigated by applying axial load to the ceramic crowns (n= 10). Data were analyzed statistically by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test was used for pair-wise comparisons (&# 945;= 0. 05). RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} among the failure load of all tested groups (P< 0. 780). The control group had the lowest fracture resistance (891. 43 ± 202. 22 N) and the highest catastrophic failure rate (P< 0. 05). Compared to the control group, the use of fiber post reduced the percentage of catastrophic failure while increasing the <b>ferrule</b> height did not influence the fracture resistance of the restored specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, increasing the <b>ferrule</b> length did not influence the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored with glass ceramic crowns.

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} via {{finite element}} analysis the effect of different <b>ferrule</b> heights on stress distribution within each part of a maxillary first premolar (MFP) restored with adhesively luted glass fiber-reinforced resin (GFRR) posts and a ceramic crown. Methods. The solid models consisted of MFP, periodontal ligament and the corresponding alveolar bone process. Four models were created representing different degrees of coronal tissue loss (0 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm of <b>ferrule</b> height). First set of computing runs was performed for in vivo FE-model validation purposes. In the second part, a 200 -N force was applied on the buccal cusp directed at 45 ° to the longitudinal axis of the tooth. Principal stresses values and distribution were recorded within root, abutment, posts, crown and related adhesive interfaces. Results. All FE-models showed similar stress distribution within roots, with highest stress present in the chamfer area. In composite abutments higher stress was observed when no <b>ferrule</b> was present compared to <b>ferruled</b> FE-models. Stress distribution within crown and GFRR posts did not differ among the models. Stress values at the adhesive interfaces decreased with increasing <b>ferrule</b> height. Significance.

Then the Gardeniers, of Hudson and thereabouts, distinguished by many triumphant feats: such as robbing water-melon patches, smoking rabbits out of their holes, and the like, and by being great lovers of roasted pigs' tails; these were the ancestors of the renowned congressman of that name. Then the Van Hoesens, of Sing-Sing, great choristers and players upon the jewsharp; these marched two and two, singing the great song of St. Nicholas. Then the Couenhovens of Sleepy Hollow; these gave birth to a jolly race of publicans, who first discovered the magic artifice of conjuring a quart of wine into a pint bottle.
