40|$|Persistent infections were {{established}} by serial undiluted passages of the Toscana virus {{of the genus}} Phlebovirus in Vero cells. Persistence was maintained through more than 70 passages {{over a period of}} 2 years. The persistently infected cells were morphologically similar to the parental Vero cells and released variable amounts of infectious virus. A small percentage of the persistently infected cells produced infectious virus while a larger percentage was shown to possess viral antigens by fluorescent antibody staining. Temperature sensitivity and host cell interferon production were not involved in establishment or maintenance of persistence. The persistently infected cultures were resistant to superinfection with homologous Toscana virus, but they were susceptible to superinfection with heterologous viruses of different genera or families. Toscana virus persistently infected cells showed aselective <b>graded</b> <b>resistance</b> to the replication of other Phleboviruses. Additionally, the virus from persistently infected cells interfered with the replication of standard Toscana virus when they co-infected normal cells.

The growth rate and morphological characteristics of the persistently infected cells were indistinguishable from normal Vero cells. Virus release declined uring the first 6 passages, a cyclical pattern was observed between passages 6 and 16, and subsequently no virus infectivity could be detected. Co-cultivation with normal RK- 13 or Vero cells enhanced virus yield from virus-producing cultures of Vero-T cells (passage 15), but the addition of susceptible cells {{had no effect on}} non-producer Vero-T cultures (passage 19). Only a small proportion (< 1 %) of the persistently infected cells tested uring the first 16 passages produced infectious virus. The virus released uring the early stages of persistence was temperature-sensitive if grown at 40 °C, more thermolabile at 50 °C than parental virus, and unable to initiate a persistent infection in Vero cells.

40|$|Death of {{unicellular}} organisms {{is brought}} about by the inactivation of a certain number of essential molecules in the cell. If the number of these essential molecules is only one per cell, the order of death is the same as if the cell were identical with this molecule; the order of death is logarithmic following the mass law. If more than one molecule must be inactivated before the cell dies, the order of death is not logarithmic. With 2 or 3 molecules, it still resembles the logarithmic order, but with an increasing number of reacting molecules, it approaches more and more the order of death known with higher organisms, namely a period of no death, followed by a comparatively short period of rapid death. The decision whether or not the logarithmic order exists, should be based upon the constancy of the death rate See PDF for Equation. The existence of a straight line when logarithms of survivors are plotted against time, is not sufficient proof unless the initial number of cells is included. These deductions are made with the assumption that all organisms are exactly alike, and show no individual variations or <b>graded</b> <b>resistance.</b> With most bacteria, the order of death is so nearly logarithmic that death must be {{brought about by}} the inactivation of only one molecule, though there may be several molecules of this same type in each cell...|$|E

Effectiveness of a prototype device in a healthy population', British Journal of Sports Medicine, Vol. 49 (5) : 318 - 322, March 2015, available online at: [URL] Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited. Background: Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylopathy (LE) is experienced as the lateral elbow has a reported prevalence of 1. 3 %, with symptoms lasting up to 18 months. LE is most commonly attributed to tendinopathy involving the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) tendon. The aim of tendinopathy management is to alleviate symptoms and restore function that initially involves relative rest followed by progressive therapeutic exercise. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of two prototype exercises using commonly available clinical equipment to progressively increase resistance and activity of the ECRB. Method: Eighteen healthy participants undertook two exercise progressions. Surface electromyography was used to record ECRB activity during the two progressions, involving eccentric exercises of the wrist extensors and elbow pronation exercises using a prototype device. The two progressions were assessed for their linearity of progression using repeated ANOVA and linear regression analysis. Five participants repeated the study to assess reliability. Results: The exercise progressions led {{to an increase in}} ECRB electromyographic (EMG) activity (p 0. 7) {{between the first and second}} tests for five participants. Conclusions: Manipulation of resistance and leverage with the prototype exercises was effective in creating significant increases of ECRB normalised EMG activity in a linear manner that may, with future research, become useful to clinicians treating LE.

40|$|Increasing drug {{resistance}} in Plasmodium falciparum and {{a resurgence of}} malaria in tropical areas have effected a change in treatment of malaria {{in the last two}} decades. Symptoms of malaria are fever, chills, headache, and malaise. The prognosis worsens as the parasite counts, counts of mature parasites, and counts of neutrophils containing pigment increase. Treatment depends on severity, age of patient, degree of background immunity, likely pattern of susceptibility to antimalarial drugs, and the cost and availability of drugs. Chloroquine should be used for P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. P. vivax has shown high resistance to chloroquine in Oceania, however. Primaquine may be needed to treat P. vivax and P. ovale to rid the body of hypnozoites that survive in the liver. Chloroquine can treat P. falciparum infections acquired in North Africa, Central America north of the Panama Canal, Haiti, or the Middle East but not in most of Africa and some parts of Asia and South America. In areas of low <b>grade</b> <b>resistance</b> to chloroquine, amodiaquine can be used to effectively treat falciparum malaria. A combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is responsive to falciparum infections with high <b>grade</b> <b>resistance</b> to chloroquine. Mefloquine, halofantrine, or quinine with tetracycline can be used to treat multidrug-resistant P. falciparum. Derivatives of artemisinin obtained from qinghao or sweet wormwood developed as pharmaceuticals in China are the most rapidly acting of all antimalarial drugs. Children tend to tolerate antimalarial drugs well. Children who weigh less than 15 kg should not be given mefloquine. Health workers should not prescribe primaquine to pregnant women or newborns due to the risk of hemolysis. Chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, quinine, and quinidine can be safely given in therapeutic doses throughout pregnancy. Clinical manifestations of severe malaria are hypoglycemia, convulsions, severe anemia, acute renal failure, jaundice, pulmonary edema, cerebral malaria, shock, and acidosis. Health workers should be prepared to treat these symptoms accordingly...|$|R

40|$|Plasmodium vivax is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} malaria infection and is an important cause of morbidity in Central and South America and Asia. P. vivax is generally sensitive to the common antimalarial drugs but high level resistance to chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine has been documented in some geographic locations. In the studies reviewed here, the therapeutic responses to antimalarial and antibacterial drugs in vivax malaria have been assessed in the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. The evaluated drugs consisted of the eight most widely used antimalarial drugs and anti-bacterial drugs that possess antimalarial activities (tetracycline, doxycycline, clindamycin or azithromycin). The activities of these drugs in descending order of parasite clearance times were artesunate, artemether, chloroquine, mefloquine, quinine, halofantrine, primaquine, followed by the antibacterial drugs and lastly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Clinical responses to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine were also poor with evidence of high <b>grade</b> <b>resistance</b> in 42 % of the patients. Of the four antibacterial drugs, clindamycin was more effective than azithromycin and can be {{an alternative to the}} tetracyclines. Except for chloroquine and mefloquine which have long plasma half lives and may therefore suppress first relapses, the cumulative cure rates for the short acting antimalarial drugs were similar. Double infection with Plasmodium falciparum was common and usually manifested 3 - 4 weeks following clearance of vivax malaria. The prevalence of cryptic falciparum malaria was 8 - 15 % and was higher in patients treated with less potent antimalarial drugs. Follow-up studies have revealed that the relapse time in Thai patients with vivax malaria is on average only 3 weeks, but can be suppressed by the slowly eliminated antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and mefloquine. For accurate comparison of relapse/recrudescence rates in vivax malaria, at least 2 month's follow-up is required. It can be concluded that in malarious areas of Thailand, double infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax is common affecting at least 25 % of the patients and usually manifests as sequential illnesses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{outcomes in}} dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) pretreated children after genotyping (GT). METHODS: We assessed CD 4 and viral load (VL) in children {{three years after}} baseline GT {{at the time of}} dual NRTI failure. Baseline high <b>grade</b> <b>resistance</b> (HR) was defined as >or= 4 nucleoside analogue mutations (NAMs) +/-Q 151 M or 69 insertion complex, and low <b>grade</b> <b>resistance</b> (LR) was defined as < 4 NAMs. Genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS) were determined. The current selection of antiretrovirals (ARV) was based on physician judgment and ARV availability. RESULTS: Seventy-two children were enrolled, {{with a mean age of}} 9. 3 years; 61 % were female. Baseline median CD 4 was 18 %, VL was 1. 7 log(10) with HR 37. 5 %, LR 56. 9 % and no mutation (NR, no resistance) 5. 6 %. Sixty-five (90. 3 %) switched ARV: 46. 2 % non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), 30. 8 % protease inhibitor (PI), and 23. 1 % PI+NNRTI based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The choice of regimen did not differ based on baseline HR, LR, and NR. The median duration from dual NRTI therapy to HAART was 5. 4 years (interquartile range (IQR) 4. 0 - 6. 9 years) and the mean (SD) duration of current HAART regimen was 1. 51 (1. 78) years; both were similar between ARV groups. Five children continued dual NRTI, two interrupted therapy. The GSS score was significantly higher in the PI group (3. 1) vs. PI+NNRTI (2. 5) vs. NNRTI (2. 6) groups. Sixty-three percent of the HR group used PI or PI+NNRTI-based HAART compared to 41 % of the LR group, p=not significant. At follow-up, median CD 4 changes from baseline were + 5 % and VL - 2. 2 log(10) (p< 0. 001). VL < 1. 7 log(10) was seen in 59. 3 % of HR, 58. 5 % of LR, and 50. 0 % of NR groups (no significant difference). More children on PI (75 %) and PI+NNRTI (80 %) based HAART had VL < 50 compared to NNRTI-based HAART (50 %), p= 0. 003. CONCLUSION: PI-based regimens showed a higher rate of undetectable VL compared with NNRTI-based regimens.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of resistance to}} ampicillin (aminophenylacetamido-penicillanic acid) and penicillin G was investigated by selecting resistant variants of strains of Escherichia coli. Resistance occurred in stepwise manner. The parent strains contained minute amounts of penicillinase and production of the enzyme by resistant variants increased in relation to increase in resistance. Evidence was obtained that production of penicillinase was responsible for this increase in resistance. By using resistant variants and naturally occurring ampicillin-resistant organisms, {{it was found that}} production of only small amounts of penicillinase was sufficient to confer a high degree of resistance to the Gram-negative bacteria examined. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria required much greater quantities of penicillinase for high <b>grade</b> <b>resistance.</b> It is suggested that an important reason for this difference is the complex lipid-containing cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, which slows penetration by penicillin and enables small amounts of penicillinase to protect the cell.

40|$|The {{resistance}} to gentamicin 4 μg. /ml. of 250 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates {{was measured by}} a proportion method. Twenty-eight (11. 2 %) of the cultures fell into the most resistant group, in whose populations between 10 and 100 % of the organisms were resistant. A relatively high percentage of urinary isolates and a comparatively low percentage of isolates from respiratory sources occurred in this group. Three of the 28 were resistant to carbenicillin 150 μg. /ml. and 6 of 18 tested were as resistant to gentamicin 8 μg. /ml. as they were to 4 μg. /ml. The distribution of Ps. aeruginosa isolates between the different <b>grades</b> of <b>resistance</b> did not change significantly during the 10 months in which the survey was performed...|$|R
50|$|One {{possible}} solution was patented in 1834 by E.L. Miller and used extensively by Matthias W. Baldwin. It worked by raising {{a pair of}} levers to attach the tender frame to {{an extension of the}} engine frame, which transferred some weight from the tender to the locomotive frame and increased the adhesive weight. An automatic version was patented in 1835 by George E. Sellers and was used extensively by locomotive builder William Norris after he obtained rights to it. This system used a beam whose fulcrum was the driving axle. On flat and level surfaces, the beam would be slightly raised, but upon starting or on <b>grades,</b> the <b>resistance</b> made the beam assume a horizontal position which caused the locomotive to tip upward.|$|R
40|$|For {{improvement}} of pavement of road, {{the use of}} asphalt material and its mixture are used so that their durability and performance can be enhanced. For which the suitable mixture that is been adopted is SMA Mix (Stone mastic asphalt or Stone matrix asphalt) which is better than bituminous Concrete or dense graded mix (DGM). It was first implemented in European Countries and North America. The Stone Mix asphalt is gap- graded mixture Consisting of Stone or Slag as Coarse aggregate, different binders are used (natural or artificial) as stabilizers and high bitumen Content. For Minimizing the Cost and increasing the efficiency of roads, many different alternative are used for improvement by using different waste materials as fillers among them Coconut shell charcoal is one of them. In the Research work, the main objective is to compare the results obtained by using fillers like Stone dust, Portland cement, Fly ash with Coconut Shell charcoal. The Properties that Coconut shell Charcoal possesses are resistance to crushing, absorption, surface moisture, <b>grading,</b> <b>resistance</b> to freezing, light weight, heating and synthetic resin glues which is most important for pavement of roads. Therefore its Stability and flow parameters and Air Void ratio are obtained {{so that it can}} be compared with different types of Fillers. From that we can establish a perfect combination {{so that it can be}} useful as a substitute as a filler for improving the quality and durability of pavement of roads. Therefore aggregate gradation taken as per IRC-SP- 79 specification for SMA mix. The Binder Content are varied as 4 %, 5 %, 5. 5 %, 6 %, 7 % by weight of aggregates. 0. 3 % by weight of aggregate is used as Optimum Binder Content. Binder of 60 / 70 penetration grade bitumen is used. For carrying out the experiment, Marshall test method is used for obtaining better result...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In Zambia the {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} uncomplicated malaria is artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), with artemether-lumefantrine currently being used. However, the antifolate regimen, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), remains {{the treatment of}} choice in children weighing less than 5 kg and also in expectant mothers. SP is also the choice drug for intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy and serves as stand-by treatment during ACT stock outs. The current study assessed the status of Plasmodium falciparum point mutations associated with antifolate drug resistance {{in the area around}} Macha. Methods A representative sample of 2, 780 residents from the vicinity of Macha was screened for malaria by microscopy. At the same time, blood was collected onto filter paper and dried for subsequent P. falciparum DNA analysis. From 188 (6. 8 %) individuals that were thick film-positive, a simple random sub-set of 95 P. falciparum infections were genotyped for DHFR and DHPS antifolate resistance mutations, using nested PCR and allele-specific restriction enzyme digestion. Results Plasmodium falciparum field samples exhibited a high prevalence of antifolate resistance mutations, including the DHFR triple (Asn- 108 + Arg- 59 + Ile- 51) mutant (41. 3 %) and DHPS double (Gly- 437 + Glu- 540) mutant (16 %). The quintuple (DHFR triple + DHPS double) mutant was found in 4 (6. 5 %) of the samples. Levels of mutated parasites showed a dramatic escalation, relative to previous surveys since 1988. However, neither of the Val- 16 and Thr- 108 mutations, which jointly confer resistance to cycloguanil, was detectable among the human infections. The Leu- 164 mutation, associated with high <b>grade</b> <b>resistance</b> to both pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, as a multiple mutant with Asn- 108, Arg- 59 and (or) Ile- 51, was also absent. Conclusion This study points to escalating levels of P. falciparum antifolate resistance in the vicinity of Macha. Continued monitoring is recommended to ensure timely policy revisions before widespread resistance exacts a serious public health toll. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In the {{automotive}} industry, {{more and more}} it is compulsory to develop new grades of stainless steels, such as high resistant Martensitic Stainless Steels (MA-SS) and Ferritic Stainless Steels (FSS) in order to realise certain or many complex deep drawn pieces. For these <b>grades,</b> <b>resistance</b> spot welding (RSW) is the most widespread process used largely for {{many parts of the}} car body in {{the automotive}} industry. This paper aims to characterise mechanical behaviour (toughness) of the different steel grades under dynamic test conditions. Design/methodology/approach: A special crash test device is used in different temperatures and the simulated crash tests are performed at a constant speed of 5. 52 m/s. Findings: The specimen is submitted to impact tensile test at different temperatures. According to testing temperature, fracture mode varies: At low temperatures, brittle fracture occurs: due to stress concentration, fracture always occurs in the notched section. At high temperatures, the specimen fails by ductile fracture. Toughness of the steel sheets (base metals, BM or welded parts) is well compared at different materials and test conditions. Research limitations/implications: Evaluation of welded thin sheets submitted to the dynamic loading in order to correlate in real service conditions in order to realize a useful correlation between the transition temperature and deep drawability can be used for evaluating of the welding conditions and also of the material characteristics. For detail study, this type of the test needs a standard formulation. Practical implications: This is a new conception of specimen and of the impact/crash machine. It is widely used in automotive industry for practical and economic reason to give rapid answers to designer and also steel makers for ranking the materials. Originality/value: New developed test called impact crash test for evaluating the toughness of thin welded joints (tailored blanks) / mechanical assemblies in high formability steel sheets for stamping submitted to dynamic loads such as experienced in real crash tests...|$|R
50|$|Education in Bolivia, as in {{many other}} areas of Bolivian life, has a divide between Bolivia's rural and urban areas. Rural {{illiteracy}} levels remain high, even {{as the rest of the}} country becomes increasingly literate. This disparity stems partly from the fact that many children living in rural area ation- discuss are not necessarily attributable to lack of funding. Bolivia devotes 23% of its annual budget to educational expenditures, a higher percentage than in most other South American countries, albeit from a smaller national budget. A comprehensive, education reform has made some significant changes. Initiated in 1994, the reform decentralized educational funding in order to meet diverse local needs, improved teacher training and curricula, formalized and expanded intercultural bilingual education and changed the school <b>grade</b> system. <b>Resistance</b> from teachers’ unions, however, has slowed implementation of some of the intended reforms (Contreras and Talavera, 2003).|$|R
