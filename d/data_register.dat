5000|$|The {{instruction}} set resembled, {{but was not}} compatible with, that of the popular DEC VAX minicomputer. It was extremely complex but mostly regular, with a large set of addressing modes. The 32016 was by some considered to be {{very similar to the}} Motorola 68000, which also used 32-bit internals with a 16-bit data bus and 24-bit address bus. This was rejected by NSC employees; one of the key marketing phrases of the time was [...] "Elegance is Everything", comparing the highly orthogonal Series 32000 to the [...] "kludge". One key difference was the Motorola's use of address <b>register</b> and <b>data</b> <b>registers,</b> with instructions only working on either address or <b>data</b> <b>registers.</b> The Series 32000 had general-purpose registers.|$|R
30|$|The <b>data</b> <b>registered</b> by {{both devices}} (Acceleglove and Mega ME 6000) was {{combined}} in a database using the R software (The R Project for Statistical Computing 2012), adjusting mean values {{according to the}} unit of time measured in each case in order to integrate both readings correctly.|$|R

50|$|The {{instruction}} set carries out most ALU actions with postfix (reverse Polish notation) operations that work {{only on the}} expression stack, not on <b>data</b> <b>registers</b> or main memory cells. This can be very convenient for executing high-level languages, because most arithmetic expressions can be easily translated into postfix notation.|$|R
30|$|The {{quality of}} the data was {{assessed}} by an independent clinical research assistant through data monitoring online. Systematic tests for consistency of the data were performed. Five per cent of the CRFs were randomly analysed. If discrepancies were > 5 Â % in a centre, all <b>data</b> <b>registered</b> for that centre were verified.|$|R
50|$|Some {{microcontrollers}} use a Harvard architecture: separate memory buses {{for instructions}} and data, allowing accesses {{to take place}} concurrently.

5000|$|Data {{registers}} {{can hold}} numeric {{values such as}} integer and, in some architectures, floating-point values, as well as characters, small bit arrays and other data.

The system includes a calculator capable of performing mathematical functions responsive to receiving data signals and function command signals. A prover cylinder is provided for measuring the temperature, pressure, and time required for accumulating a predetermined volume of fluid. Along with these signals, signals representing the temperature and pressure of the fluid going into the meter are fed to a plurality of <b>data</b> <b>registers.</b> Under control of a progress controller, the <b>data</b> <b>registers</b> are read out and the information is fed through a data select circuit to the calculator. Command signals are also produced by a function select circuit and are fed to the calculator set indicating the desired function to be performed. The reading is then compared with the reading produced by the flowmeter...|$|R
