50|$|Reflux {{refers to}} {{the portion of the}} {{condensed}} overhead product that is returned to the tower. The reflux flowing downwards provides the cooling required for condensing the vapours flowing upwards. The reflux ratio, which is the ratio of the (internal) reflux to the overhead product, is conversely related to the theoretical number of stages required for efficient separation of the distillation products.Fractional distillation towers or columns are designed to achieve the required separation efficiently. The design of fractionation columns is normally made in two steps; a process design, followed by a mechanical design. The purpose of the process design is to calculate the number of required theoretical stages and stream flows including the reflux ratio, heat reflux and other heat duties. The purpose of the mechanical design, on the other hand, is to select the tower internals, column diameter and height. In most cases, the mechanical design of fractionation towers is not straightforward. For the efficient selection of tower internals and the accurate calculation of column height and diameter, many factors must be taken into account. Some of the factors involved in design calculations include <b>feed</b> <b>load</b> size and properties and the type of distillation column used. The two major types of distillation columns used are tray and packing columns. Packing columns are normally used for smaller towers and loads that are corrosive or temperature sensitive or for vacuum service where pressure drop is important. Tray columns, on the other hand, are used for larger columns with high liquid loads. They first appeared on the scene in the 1820s. In most oil refinery operations, tray columns are mainly used for the separation of petroleum fractions at different stages of oil refining.|$|E

A total of 55 large tanks were reported at seven land-based hatchery locations, i. e., averaging 7. 9 (range of 4 – 12) large tanks per land-based site. In addition, one 21, 000 m 3 floating fiberglass tank in sea was reported. Culture volume ranged from 500 to 1300 m 3 for each land-based tank. Most tanks were circular, but one site used octagonal tanks. Land-based tank diameters ranged from 14. 5 to 20 m diameter, whereas the floating tank was 40 m diameter. Maximum tank depths ranged from 3. 5 to 4. 5 m at land-based facilities, which produced diameter-to-average-depth ratios of 3. 6 : 1 to 5. 5 : 1 m:m. The floating tank was much deeper at 20 m, with a diameter-to-average-depth ratio of only 2. 4 : 1 m:m. All land-based tanks had floors sloping at 4. 0 – 6. 5 % toward the tank center and various pipe configurations that penetrated the culture tank water volume at tank center. These pipes and sloping floors were used to reduce labor when removing dead fish and harvesting fish. Maximum flow ranged from 3 to 19 m 3 /min per land-based tank, with 400 m 3 /min at the floating tank, but tank flow was adjustable at most facilities. Land-based tanks were flushed at a mean hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 35 – 170 min. Maximum <b>feed</b> <b>load</b> on each land-based tank ranged from 525 to 850 kg/day, but the floating tank reached 3700 kg/day. Almost half of the large tanks reported in this survey were installed or renovated since 2013, including the three tank systems with the highest flow rate per tank (greater than 17. 6 m 3 /min). These more recent tanks were operated at more rapid tank HRT’s, i. e., from 34. 8 to 52. 5 min, than the 67 – 170 min HRT typical of the large tanks built before 2013. In addition, flow per unit of <b>feed</b> <b>load</b> in land-based tanks that began operating before 2010 were lower (19 – 30 m 3 flow/kg feed) than in tanks that began operating later (33 – 40 m 3 flow/kg feed). In comparison, the floating tank operates at a maximum daily tank flow to <b>feed</b> <b>load</b> of 160 m 3 flow/kg feed, which is the least intensive of all tanks surveyed.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} that Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) are still facing is the risk that in RAS fish grow less than in flow-through systems due to the accumulation of substances originating from feed, fish or bacteria associated with the water re-use. The present study investigated whether RAS with high and low accumulation levels of these substances affect feed intake and growth of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, African catfish Clarias gariepinus, and European eel Anguilla Anguilla. One-hundred and twenty individuals of each species were used (start body weights: Nile tilapia 264. 8 ± 8. 3 g; African catfish 253. 2 ± 2. 1 g and European eel 66. 6 ± 1. 3 g).

40|$|Aquaculture is {{currently}} {{one of the}} fastest growing food-producing sectors, accounting for around 50 % of the world’s food fish production. Limited resources, together with climatic change, have stimulated the search for solutions to support and sustain the production of fish as a source of protein for human consumption. The integration of a biological filtration (BF) into a semi-recirculating fish rearing system can increase its carrying capacity and increase system efficiency compared to its’ energy consumption with minimum changes of system composition and minimal costs. Question is the capacity of the BF installed to a system and how it affects water quality. Two different amounts of BF media (surface) added to semi-recirculating rearing system compared with the same system without BF were tested in case of this study. The results have shown that if the BF capacity is insufficient, BF can have negative effects to the quality of water environment. The insufficient amount of BF media caused 4 times reduction of ammonia nitrogen (N-NH 4 +) in system with BF compared to non BF system so it increased the system capacity for <b>feed</b> <b>load</b> 4 times.

40|$|Rising {{awareness}} {{in the need}} for environmental protection has brought into question the adequacy of conventional hazardous waste treatment operations. Regulatory standards are increasingly strict, and there is growing concern over the safety of incineration facilities. This research project examines the technoeconomic potential of thermal plasma technology in this context. Adaptive Plasma-Assisted Incineration (APAI) is a novel concept for secondary gas treatment in hazardous waste incineration. As an energy source for waste destruction, a thermal plasma can provide conditions far higher in temperature and in reactivity than those obtained using a combustion flame. Thus, the plasma is more effective at destroying hazardous materials, albeit at a higher cost. APAI features a thermal plasma afterburner with continual on-line optical monitoring of the gas product and feedback optimization of the plasma conditions. This approach allows complete destruction of persistent organic compounds and cost-effective response to <b>feed</b> <b>load</b> variations. The process supplements conventional incineration techniques with the effectiveness and flexibility of thermal plasma treatment. The main objectives are {{to reduce the risk}} of harmful emissions during hazardous waste incineration and to facilitate compliance with new environmental regulations. In this project, the technical feasibility of APAI was demonstrated experimentally using a laboratory-scale plasma afterburner model. The work focused on the development of a spectroscopic monitoring procedure and on the application of optimization techniques for cost-effective operation of the model system. The techno-economic potential and limitations of APAI were addressed in a conceptual study. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were developed for specific applications. The costs of plasma-assisted and conventional methods were compared for contaminated soil remediation (by incineration and desorption) and for organic liquid waste destruction. Economically, APAI appears uncompetitive at the present time. However, it remains a promising alternative in view of ongoing environmental policy changes and developments in plasma technology...|$|E
40|$|Exponential {{increase}} in the demand of steel {{all over the world}} is leading to rapid depletion of the high grade lump iron ore, leaving the low grade iron ore as fines. Hence industries are forced to use low grade iron ore fines by beneficiating it which produces desired high quality ore required for blast furnace. The fines are subjected to the communition like crushers and mills as the alternative beneficiation techniques for uniform liberation of iron ores which {{can be used as a}} feed for blast furnace. In current industries, this liberation technique consumes high energy and lack of constant liberation of the iron fractions. In this study, we have used JKSimMet tool for mass balancing, model fitting and simulating the closed circuit pelletization plant, Tata steel Jamshedpur. The inputs to the circuit like plant operating and design data’s, particle size distribution (PSD), flow rates (TPH), bond work Index, etc were determined by collecting each sample from site and analysing it in laboratory. The ball mill used in simulation is assumed to be working at steady state which utilises perfectly mixing model. The overall mass balancing is achieved with a consistency as compared to the plant data followed to which the model fitting were accomplished. Further, simulations were conducted to monitor the effect of change in ball size distribution on the PSD. As plant ball mill is consuming more energy and unable to maintain the constant optimum ground product, it very important to go for parametric study of plant mill and verifying the effects of the ball mill operating conditions on the performance of the ball mill as well as ROKSH air classifier. The optimum conditions were estimated by minimizing the energy requirement to ball mill and the optimum ground which was the requirement of pelletization plant. This involved a large set of parametric simulations of grinding and classification circuit using JK SimMet involving 5 levels of variation in fractional critical speed of the mill, flowrate of the <b>feed,</b> <b>load</b> fraction in the mill, rotor speed of the classifier, analysis of effect of ball size distribution on ball mill discharge.

Take-off free flight performance was tested at two different body temperatures in males and females of the speckled wood butterfly Pararge aegeria. We found that both males and females accelerated faster at the optimal body temperature compared to the suboptimal one. The multivariate analyses showed significant sex-specific contributions of flight morphology, body temperature treatment and <b>feeding</b> <b>load</b> to explain variation in acceleration performance. Female and male butterflies with a large relative thorax (i. e. flight muscle investment) mass and large, slender wings (i. e. aspect ratio) accelerated fast at optimal temperature. However, high aspect ratio individuals accelerated slowly at suboptimal temperature. Females of low body mass accelerated fast at optimal, but slowly at suboptimal body temperature. In males, there was an interaction effect between body and relative thorax mass: light males with high relative thorax mass had higher performance than males with a low relative thorax mass. In addition, relative distance to the centre of forewing area was positively related to acceleration at both temperatures in males. Males and females with higher <b>feeding</b> <b>loads</b> had lower levels of acceleration.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} the optimum combination of the main process parameters, i. e., the internal pressure and end <b>feeding</b> (<b>load</b> path), for tube hydroforming to minimize the thickness reduction, while satisfying the failure constraint defined by the forming limit diagram of the material. To perform process design optimization with minimum experimentation, the LS-OPT software was utilized in combination with a finite element model (FEM) that simulated a round to square tube hydroforming (THF) process for stainless steel 321 in LS-DYNA. The load path obtained through the optimization procedure {{was applied to the}} THF process and the tube expansion and the thickness results obtained from the FEM were compared with the experimental results in the critical regions of the hydroformed tube.

40|$|AbstractRecirculating {{aquaculture}} systems (RAS) {{are increasingly}} being used for Atlantic salmon smolt production. However, knowledge of how the RAS environment affects welfare and performance of Atlantic salmon is limited. For instance, safe limits for chronic exposure to typical compounds in RAS, such as NH 3 -N, NO 2 -N, and CO 2 should be established for Atlantic salmon, {{as well as their}} interactions with nutrition, other RAS water compounds, and the microbiota. These questions can best be answered in a research facility that is providing a RAS environment. In addition, the facility described here was required to produce 480000 smolts annually, to provide sufficient research fish in the institution. Design and dimensioning of such a facility require attention to flexibility for various experimental designs, and the flexibility to vary specific water quality constituents, properties that are not necessary in a standard production plant. A research facility of 1754 m 2 ground floor area (Nofima Centre for Recirculation in Aquaculture, NCRA), was designed and constructed for these purposes at a cost of 45 mill. NOK (2010 value). The facility included six experimental halls, a number of support rooms, and four independent RASs. Water quality requirements at maximum feed loading were in the design phase set to < 10 mg/L CO 2, < 0. 7 – 1 mg/L TAN, and < 0. 1 mg/L NO 2 -N, and the RASs dimensioned with this objective. The facility was designed so that water from different RAS or flow-through water sources could be chosen {{at the level of the}} culture tanks, thus giving flexibility for experimentation. Performance of the facility was tested in two trials, during the first 3 years of operation. In Trial 1, a standard production study showed that Atlantic salmon parr reared in the facility had growth rates comparable to that seen in the Norwegian Atlantic salmon smolt industry. In Trial 2, water quality and removal efficiencies of RAS 1 were evaluated at increasing daily feed loads. Removal efficiencies were comparable, in the case of TAN, and when calculated for the system as a whole also for CO 2, to assumptions made during dimensioning and design of the facility. The RAS maintained water quality within set limits for TAN and CO 2, but not in the case of nitrite (0. 22 mg/L NO 2 -N versus 0. 1 mg/L limit). The water quality limits of TAN and CO 2 were reached, not at full feed capacity, but at 134 % of the theoretical feed capacity calculated prior to construction. This dimensioning was based on an often used methodology. When recalculating the RAS 1 TAN production, but now using published Atlantic salmon parr N-retention data, it was found that the methodology used prior to construction may over-estimate the TAN production by about 34 %. Thus, Trial 2 was useful for recalibrating the <b>feed</b> <b>load</b> capacity of the RASs, and for accurate experimental design in future projects. It is expected that in the long-term NCRA will be useful in determining the environmental and nutritional requirements of fish reared in RAS...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic digestion, AD, is {{regarded}} as a key environmental technology in industrial, agricultural, and domestic sectors for integrated solid and liquid waste treatment and renewable energy production. The main objectives of this thesis are to investigate effects of micro aerating anaerobic reactors using semi permeable membranes, study biofilm effects on mass transfer and monitoring transient responses following intermittent feeding. It is hypothesized that this approach can enhance the anaerobic digestion while supplying a novel approach for process monitoring and control. A bioenergetic model is developed to study effects of micro aeration on anaerobic processes. Mass transfer characteristics of oxygen via dense polymeric membranes under varying operating conditions are determined using experimental and mathematical approaches. A new micro-aeration strategy called “Membrane Micro-aerated Anaerobic Digester” (MMAD) is developed based on this. Membrane loops with circulating deionized water with dissolved oxygen inside are used to supply oxygen to biofilms in an anaerobic bulk liquid phase in AD. Biofilm behavior and effects are investigated using in– situ oxygen transfer measurements and experiments in an external reaction chamber. Shock loading effects and transient responses are studied in lab scale batch and intermittently fed AD experiments and a full scale co-digestion plant. Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM 1) is used to simulate transient loading effects. The bioenergetic analysis of micro-aeration found that the CH 4 / CO 2 ratio of biogas remain stable up to an oxygen supply of 0. 13 mole O 2 / feed C-mole. Above this threshold limit, biogas composition deteriorates due to the dominance of the aerobic degradation pathways. It is proposed to define micro-aeration as oxygen supply below this threshold. Average overall mass transfer coefficients determined for the thick and thin silicone tubular membranes applied, are 5. 9 x 10 - 5 and 8. 6 x 10 - 5 m/min, respectively. Membrane resistance contributes about 5 % of the total oxygen transport resistance for both membranes. The bulk liquid side resistance contribute about 70 % of total resistance and the remaining 25 % is caused by the inside stagnant liquid layer. Biofilm oxygen utilization can reduce the liquid side resistance when the biofilm is thin (young). Thicker mature biofilms can lead to lower oxygen transfer rates (OTR) due to mass transfer limitations for the substrate from the bulk liquid into the biofilm. OTR and oxygen utilization rates, OUR, were not influenced by the aeration history of the membrane biofilms. All the biofilms grown under varying aeration levels (from zero to continuous for months) consumes oxygen at similar rates when exposed to aerobic conditions. Facultative heterotrophic micro-organisms must therefore be abundant in all these biofilms and OUR is probably transport rather than reaction limited. The shock load investigation shows that negative effect of intermittent feeding {{is a function of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>load</b> to reactor biomass ratio. At higher ratios, specific biogas production decreases, pH drop increases, ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 decreases and the recovery time increases. The ADM 1 simulates transient responses quite well at low ratios, but the correlations between experimental and simulated results deteriorate as shock load increases. This is mainly due to limitations of pH predictions in ADM 1. Measuring oxygen in the membrane lumen of MMAD as a monitoring technique for these transient responses was of limited value. The oxygen level dropped fast after feeding, implying that the method can detect shock load episodes well. The oxygen drop was, however, not much influenced by the magnitude of the shock load. The reason for this is that OUR is transport rather than reaction limited under most relevant conditions. The literature survey and theoretical analysis revealed that the MMAD principle can help stabilize AD exposed to transient loads through oxygen supply and CO 2 removal. Biofilm was not observed on the lumen side of membranes applied but it developed quickly on membrane‟s bulk liquid side. Oxygen was transferred to the MMAD head space when clean membranes were introduced, but after 3 days no more oxygen was found in head space. This is explained by complete oxygen consumption in the membrane-attached biofilm. The MMAD principle is therefore suitable for oxygen supply to AD without diluting the biogas with oxygen. It is generally concluded that the MMAD principle can be used to enhance AD performance by controlling micro-aeration, improving acidogenesis, maintaining biogas quality and detecting process changes. </p...|$|E
50|$|Sediment Profile Imagery (SPI) is an {{underwater}} technique for photographing {{the interface between}} the seabed and the overlying water. The technique is used to measure or estimate biological, chemical, and physical processes occurring {{in the first few}} centimetres of sediment, pore water, and the important benthic boundary layer of water. Time-lapse imaging (tSPI) is used to examine biological activity over natural cycles, like tides and daylight or anthropogenic variables like <b>feeding</b> <b>loads</b> in aquaculture. SPI systems cost between tens {{and hundreds of thousands of}} dollars and weigh between 20 and 400 kilograms. Traditional SPI units can be effectively used to explore continental shelf and abyssal depths. Recently developed SPI-Scan or rSPI (rotational SPI) systems can now also be used to inexpensively investigate shallow (<50m) freshwater, estuarine, and marine systems.|$|R
