40|$|Pulsar {{timing is}} a {{promising}} technique for detecting low frequency sources of gravitational waves. Historically {{the focus has}} been on the detection of diffuse stochastic backgrounds, such as those formed from the superposition of weak signals from a population of binary black holes. More recently, attention has turned to members of the binary population that are nearer and brighter, which stand out from the crowd and can be individually resolved. Here we show that the timing data from an array of pulsars can be used to recover the physical parameters describing an individual black hole binary to good accuracy, even for moderately strong signals. A novel aspect of our analysis is that we include the distance to each pulsar as a search parameter, which allows us to utilize the <b>full</b> gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>signal.</b> This doubles the signal power, improves the sky location determination by an order of magnitude, and allows us to extract the mass and the distance to the black hole binary.

40|$|Using laser/EMAT {{ultrasonic}} {{technique to}} inspect penetration depths of welds in thin structures {{is limited by}} lack of effective signal interpretation methods. The laser-generated ultrasounds in thin structures are very complicated. This research conducts a systematic study to investigate how to effectively apply laser/EMAT ultrasonic technique to measure penetration depths of welds in thin structures. First, the signals acquired during inspections are characterized using 2 -D Fourier Transform and wavelet analysis to establish {{a good understanding of}} laser-generated Lamb waves in thin structures. Secondly, interactions of laser-generated Lamb waves with welds are investigated by measuring <b>full</b> <b>wave</b> field <b>signals</b> and 3 -D Fourier Transform analysis. Thirdly, feasibility of using transmission coefficients of Lamb waves to predict weld penetration depths is studied both numerically and experimentally. A continuous wavelet transform-based algorithm proves effective to fast calculate transmission coefficients of Lamb waves from single acquired signals. Finally, welds of varying penetration depths are manufactured to test the transmission coefficient-based method. Lamb waves sensitive to weld penetration depths are selected and their transmission coefficients are used to develop a neural network to predict weld penetration depth in thin structures accurately. Some considerations regarding the implementation of the developed method are also discussed. Ph. D...|$|R

Gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>signals</b> are often extremely weak and {{the data from the}} detectors, such as LIGO, is contaminated with non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise, often containing transient disturbances which can obscure real signals. Traditional denoising methods, such as principal component analysis and dictionary learning, are not optimal for dealing with this non-Gaussian noise, especially for low signal-to-noise ratio gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>signals.</b> Furthermore, these methods are computationally expensive on large datasets. To overcome these issues, we apply state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, based on recent groundbreaking advancements in deep learning, to denoise gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>signals</b> embedded either in Gaussian noise or in real LIGO noise.
