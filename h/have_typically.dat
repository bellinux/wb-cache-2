Social policy in Norway {{both at the}} national and local level has emphasized the connection between athletics at the mass and elite levels, and athletic centers <b>have</b> <b>typically</b> been built both to accommodate spectators, participants, and training. As an example, the Holmenkollen ski jump has been rebuilt several times, the Bislett Stadion was rebuilt in 2004-2005, and virtually every municipality has built year-round facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} the {{emergence}} of castles is a complex matter which has led to considerable debate. Discussions <b>have</b> <b>typically</b> attributed the rise of the castle to a reaction to attacks by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings and a need for private defence. The breakdown of the Carolingian Empire led to the privatisation of government, and local lords assumed responsibility for the economy and justice. However, while castles proliferated in the 9th and 10th centuries the link between periods of insecurity and building fortifications is not always straightforward. Some high concentrations of castles occur in secure places, while some border regions had relatively few castles.|$|E
5|$|Central to this discussion, it was {{announced}} in 2009, that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47.0mas, {{not too far from}} Perrin's estimate. Unlike most earlier papers, this study encompassed a 15-year period at one specific wavelength. Earlier studies <b>have</b> <b>typically</b> lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56.0±0.1mas seen in 1993 to 47.0±0.1mas seen in 2008—a contraction of almost 0.9AU in 15years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if so, what the periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long. Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and contraction as the star rotates on its axis.|$|E

The emblem on the shirts {{is a red}} rose, rather than the Plantagenet Three Lions {{displayed}} on the shirts of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt sponsor. The change strip is normally red, although prior {{to the introduction of}} the red strip, navy blue was used and was reintroduced for the 2016-17 season. Purple was used as the change strip as of the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby World Cup the change kit was black.|$|E
