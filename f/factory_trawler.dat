40|$|<b>Factory</b> <b>trawlers</b> are {{the most}} {{controversial}} vessel group in Norwegian fisheries. At the time the fleet emerged, stern trawling in combination with on-board processing of cod fillets {{was regarded as a}} major innovation. However, the deep-sea fleet was intended to be a stable supplier of fish to the land-based industry. <b>Factory</b> <b>trawlers</b> were {{not a part of the}} political project. On the contrary, the vessels represented a serious departure from the traditional employment system for the fisheries' dependent districts. <b>Factory</b> <b>trawlers</b> have, since the seventies, been regarded as the main enemy to the coastal vessels and the land-based industry. The vessels have been subject to a profound debate about several built-in contradictory goals for the fisheries policy, such as the ideal of employment for all and the need for a profitable sector without state subsidies. Despite a series of policy-driven initiatives to remove the <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers,</b> the fleet has been one of the most profitable vessel groups in the Norwegian fisheries. Nonetheless, the fleet is now marginalised in the number of vessels and transformed into an obedient supplier of round fish to the land-based industry. In this article, we outline the history of the Norwegian <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers</b> and how the fleet was subject to a series of critical changes reflecting the complexity of the vessels.

25|$|The cod catch {{peaked in}} 1968 at 810,000 tons, {{approximately}} {{three times more}} than the maximum yearly catch achieved before the super-trawlers. Approximately 8 million tons of cod were caught between 1647 and 1750, a period encompassing 25 to 40 cod generations. The <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers</b> took the same amount in 15 years.|$|R
25|$|The {{boats that}} are used for {{trawling}} are called trawlers or draggers. Trawlers vary in size from small open boats with as little as 30 hp (22 kW) engines to large <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers</b> with over 10,000hp (7.5 MW). Trawling {{can be carried out}} by one trawler or by two trawlers fishing cooperatively (pair trawling).|$|R
50|$|Melbu {{has one of}} {{the biggest}} fish {{processing}} facilities of Norway Seafoods/Aker Seafoods in Northern Norway. Several main <b>factory</b> <b>trawler</b> licenses are permanently related to the factory facilities in Melbu. There are also other industry facilities connected to fish processing, aquaculture, and other marine industry in Melbu.|$|E
50|$|Important sectors are {{mechanical}} industry and furniture manufacturing, agriculture, commercial fishing, and aquaculture. The first two are predominant {{in the village}} of Ørsta while agriculture dominates in adjacent valleys like the Follestaddalen, Åmdalen, and Bondalen valleys.

50|$|The {{ship was}} ordered from Narasaki Senpakukogyo Limited at their yard in Muroran, Japan with the yard number 922. The vessel was {{completed}} in December 1978 as Callistratus. The vessel {{was used as a}} <b>factory</b> <b>trawler</b> by the Prince Rupert Fishermen's Co-operative Association participating in emerging North Pacific fisheries (North Pacific hake, turbot and rockfish) resulting from the extension of Canada's exclusive economic zone to 200 nmi km offshore. The vessel was purchased in 1984 by the Government of Canada for conversion to a fisheries research vessel in Pacific waters. The ship entered service with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in 1986, renamed W.E. Ricker, for William Edwin (Bill) Ricker, a former chief scientist of the Fisheries Research Board who developed a mathematical model used for fish population dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The 200-mile {{fishing limit}} has changed fishing {{patterns}} and, in recent times, fishing boats {{are becoming more}} specialised and standardised. In the United States and Canada more use is made of large <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers,</b> while the huge blue water fleets operated by Japan and the Soviet-bloc countries have contracted. In western Europe, fishing vessel design is focused on compact boats with high catching power.|$|R
25|$|U.S. {{fisheries}} use most {{fishing gear}} types. Vessels are often configured {{so they can}} change rapidly between two or more gear types, such as lobster pots to bottom trawls to scallop dredges. The main techniques are purse seining and trawling. Some vessels freeze their catch at sea, such as <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers,</b> tuna boats, Alaskan crab pot vessels, and some southeast shrimp trawlers. Vessels usually land their catches near their homeports.|$|R
50|$|Some {{factory ships}} can also {{function}} as mother ships. The basic {{idea of a}} mother ship {{is that it can}} carry small fishing boats that return to the mother ship with their catch. But the idea extends to include <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers</b> supporting a fleet of smaller catching vessels that are not carried on board. They serve as the main ship in a fleet operating in waters a great distance from their home ports.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 June 1972 an off-duty Modoc crewman, SA James Carignan, of Olympia, Washington, drowned while {{attempting}} to save a 12-year-old girl who had been swept away from a beach by the surf. He was posthumously awarded the Coast Guard Medal. In January 1974 Modoc braved 100 kn winds to assist the stricken tug Sea Racer and her tow, the former Liberty ship Arlington. In November 1974 she retrieved the 40-foot high special environmental data buoy EBO-2 from the Cobb Seamount. On 15 May 1975 she seized the Polish 278-foot fish <b>factory</b> <b>trawler</b> Kalmar 10 miles off Monterey, California, for fishing inside the 12-mile limit and escorted her to San Francisco. A news release about the incident noted: [...] "The Polish fishing vessel KALMAR, seized by the Coast Guard 10 miles off the Monterey coast early this morning was cited for fishing inside the 12-mile limit. Homeported in Swinoujscie, Poland, the vessel carries a crew of approximately 70 men. The KALMAR fished off the West Coast during the 1974 foreign fishing season. It was first observed fishing off California in 1975 off Half Moon Bay on January 14 by a Coast Guard Air Station aircraft patrol from San Francisco. In March 1975 she was observed conducting fishing operations {{in the vicinity of}} Coos Bay, Oregon. During April and May of this year Coast Guard patrols observed the KALMAR fishing off Point Reyes, Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz." ...|$|E
50|$|According to the National Fisheries Conservation Center, in May 1994 {{and again}} in August 1995, {{widespread}} salmon fishery closures in Washington, Oregon, and Northern California resulted in the declaration of a fishery resource disaster declaration by the Secretary of Commerce. An estimated 8,000 commercial fisherman were affected by the closures. Following the declaration $25 million in economic aid, of which $13.6 million was allocated to the State of Washington, was provided via the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan. The funds supported habitat restoration, data collection and salmon license buyback programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided and additional $10 million in disaster unemployment assistance, with $6.4 million of those funds being allocated to Washington. The Rural Development Administration provided $3 million in grants to finance small business development and the Small Business Administration made low-interest loans and debt-restructuring available. All costs that could potentially continue to increase as global warming further degrade existing commercial salmon fisheries. Other potential costs may include {{an increase in the}} amount of government sponsored buyback programs. These programs are designed to ease fishing pressure on declining stocks while providing financial assistance to those individuals who choose to exit the fishery. Buybacks take the form of Vessel Buyback Programs and License Retirement Programs. The average cost of a license or vessel purchased fewer than one of these plans is $10,000 for salmon and small vessel fleets but can rise as high as $10 million for a <b>factory</b> <b>trawler</b> such as those used further north in the Bering Sea. Nationally, these programs have totaled $160 million nationally since 1976.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 The fishing {{behavior}} of factory trawlers in the Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) fishery at different spatio-temporal scales was studied using several modeling techniques. In Chapter 1, a Markov decision process model {{was developed for}} the scheduling of fishing operations on a <b>factory</b> <b>trawler.</b> Stochastic dynamic programming was used to obtain the optimal controls for setting and retrieving the net. The optimal controls generally consisted of a bin threshold that signals the vessel to start fishing and a catch threshold that signals the vessel to stop fishing. A range of simple "rule of thumb" strategies generated nearly as much net revenue as the optimal control, indicating that the reward surface is flat {{in the region of}} the optimal control. In Chapter 2, a statistical analysis was conducted of mesoscale (5 - 50 km) movement patterns of factory trawlers. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to examine influence of the catch rates of prior hauls on the distance between successive hauls. Results of GAM models suggested that deviations from the expected catch rate influence the decision to move from a local foraging area, as expected from optimization models of animal foraging. These decisions appeared to be based on relatively short time frames, such that information from only the most recent 1 - 2 hauls in the area are utilized. In addition, results indicated that the presence of other fishing vessels operating nearby reduces the probability that a vessel will leave an area. In Chapter 3, a simulation model was developed for an individual <b>factory</b> <b>trawler.</b> The model integrated the results of the above analyses in a hierarchical model of decision-making at different spatio-temporal scales. Decision-making occurred at two scales: (1) choosing an area within which fishing will be conducted, and (2) scheduling haul setting and retrievals while fishing within an area. A novel aspect of the model was a procedure, based on the Kalman filter, for modeling information about local fish densities gained by searching and fishing. The simulation model was used to identify the optimal decision rules, and to evaluate the usefulness of indices derived from <b>factory</b> <b>trawler</b> catch data to monitor population abundance trends...|$|E

40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} in trawl catches {{and its influence}} on energy efficiency of trawler operations are discussed in this paper, based on data on landings of a Japanese <b>factory</b> <b>trawler</b> which operated in the Indian waters during 1992 - 93. The factory vessel equipped for stern trawling had a length overall of 110 m, GT of 5460 and installed engine power of 5700 hp. Operations were conducted off west coast of India between 31 and 278 m depth contours, using a 80. 4 m high opening bottom trawl with an adjusted vertical opening of 7. 6  0. 9 m. The catch data was grouped according to the median towing hour, {{by the time of}} the day. CPUE obtained was 3713. 4 kg. h- 1 for day time operations and 1536. 6 kg. h- 1 for night-time operations. Mean daily catches were 31367 kg. day- 1 (SE: 2743) for day time operations and 9430 kg. day- 1 (SE: 966) for night-time operations. Fuel consumption were 0. 399 and 0. 982 kg fuel. kg fish- 1, respectively for day and night-time operations. Total catch and catch components such as threadfin bream, bulls eye, hairtails, trevelly, lizard fish showed significant improvement during day-time operations while swarming crabs showed a significant improvement in the night-time operations. The difference in catch rates between day and night could be attributed to diurnal {{variation in}} the spatial distribution and schooling behaviour of the catch categories, their differential behaviour in the vicinity of trawl systems under varying light levels of day and night and consequent effect on catching efficiency and size selectivity at different stages in the capture process. The results obtained in addition to its importance in the operational planning of trawling in order to realise objectives of maximising catch per unit effort and minimising fuel consumption per unit volume of fish caught, has added significance in the use of bottom trawl surveys in stock abundance estimates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract OnlyThe {{objectives}} {{pursued by}} governments managing fisheries may include harvesting the fish stocks to maximize profits, {{to minimize the}} impact of harvesting on the marine ecosystem, or to secure jobs in the fishing industry. These objectives all depend on {{the composition of the}} fishing fleet as the various vessel types differ with respect to their operating costs, their environmental impacts, or how these boats provide employment opportunities on board or on shore. The Norwegian cod fishery consists of a fleet comprising coastal vessels, large longliners, and the fleet of <b>trawlers</b> and <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers.</b> These vessels score differently when it comes to meeting and reconciling these different objectives, and have therefore received mixed political support. In this paper, we develop an analytical model that shows the optimal TAC, biomass level, and long-run profits taking specifically into account fleet composition. This allows a regulator to adapt optimal management to the current fleet structure, but also analyze the bioeconomic consequences of a change in fleet structure (e. g. a ban on <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers).</b> We specifically take into account the occurrence of a fleet lock in, which means that the fishing fleet cannot be adjusted instantaneously, as several vessels cannot leave the fleet because of economic or political constraints. We apply the model to the case of Northeast Arctic cod, and econometrically estimate not only the cost and harvesting functions of the various vessel types, but also the parameters of the biological model {{as well as those of}} the demand function for cod...|$|R
5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the <b>factory</b> <b>trawlers,</b> the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{trawlers}} {{store the}} fish they catch {{in some form}} of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, {{the more likely it is}} to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted. <b>Factory</b> <b>trawlers</b> may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.|$|R
