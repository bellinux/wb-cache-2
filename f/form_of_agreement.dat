2500|$|Over the {{industrial}} revolution, English courts {{became more and}} more wedded to the concept of [...] "freedom of contract". It was partly a sign of progress, as the vestiges of feudal and mercantile restrictions on workers and businesses were lifted, a move of people (at least in theory) from [...] "status to contract". On the other hand, a preference for laissez faire thought concealed the inequality of bargaining power in multiple contracts, particularly for employment, consumer goods and services, and tenancies. At the centre of the general law of contracts, captured in nursery rhymes like Robert Browning's Pied Piper of Hamelin in 1842, was the fabled notion that if people had promised something [...] "let us keep our promise". But then, the law purported to cover every <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement,</b> as if everybody had the same degree of free will to promise what they wanted. Though many of the most influential liberal thinkers, especially John Stuart Mill, believed in multiple exceptions to the rule that laissez faire was the best policy, the courts were suspicious of interfering in agreements, whoever the parties were. In Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson Sir George Jessel MR proclaimed it a [...] "public policy" [...] that [...] "contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by Courts of justice." [...] The same year, the Judicature Act 1875 merged the Courts of Chancery and common law, with equitable principles (such as estoppel, undue influence, rescission for misrepresentation and fiduciary duties or disclosure requirements in some transactions) always taking precedence.|$|E

Here I may state that the amount of affiliation money collected in England by the Army in 1909 was £1,217, of which £208 was for new cases. Further, £671 was collected and paid over for maintenance to deserted wives. Little or none of this money would have been forthcoming but for its exertions.|$|E
6000|$|I overheard {{the other}} day a scrap of conversation, which I take the liberty to reproduce. [...] "What I advance is true," [...] said one. [...] "But not the whole truth," [...] {{answered}} the other. [...] "Sir," [...] returned the first (and {{it seemed to me}} there was a smack of Dr. Johnson in the speech), [...] "Sir, {{there is no such thing}} as the whole truth!" [...] Indeed, there is nothing so evident in life as that there are two sides to a question. History is one long illustration. The forces of nature are engaged, day by day, in cudgelling it into our backward intelligences. We never pause for a moment's consideration, but we admit it as an axiom. An enthusiast sways humanity exactly by disregarding this great truth, and dinning it into our ears that this or that question has only one possible solution; and your enthusiast is a fine florid fellow, dominates things for a while and shakes the world out of a doze; but when once he is gone, an army of quiet and uninfluential people set to work to remind us of the other side and demolish the generous imposture. While Calvin is putting everybody exactly right in his [...] "Institutes," [...] and hot-headed Knox is thundering in the pulpit, Montaigne is already looking at the other side in his library in Périgord, and predicting that they will find as much to quarrel about in the Bible as they had found already in the Church. Age may have one side, but assuredly Youth has the other. There is nothing more certain than that both are right, except perhaps that both are wrong.

40|$|The classic {{statements}} of deliberative democratic theory defined deliberation {{in opposition to}} negotiation. As deliberative theory has developed, that opposition has weakened. The normative terms of that relation, however, are as yet unclear. Building on work reformulating the regulative ideals for deliberative democracy (Mansbridge et al. forthcoming), this paper argues that four previously excluded <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement</b> are themselves "deliberative. " One is simple convergence on an outcome. The other three [...] incompletely theorized agreements, integrative negotiation, and fully cooperative distributive negotiation [...] are <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> deliberative negotiation. The "regulative ideals" <b>of</b> these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> negotiation, that is, the standards to which we should aspire in their practice even when full achievement is impossible, meet all the criteria for deliberation. This paper aims at reformulating the regulative ideal of deliberative democracy to incorporate these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>agreement.</b> ...|$|R
