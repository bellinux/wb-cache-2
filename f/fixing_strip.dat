The modifications introduced to the pavement plate to increase stability were making holes, inserting <b>fixed</b> <b>strip,</b> modification of bed and bed slope. The first two modifications increased the stability, while the third modification decreased the stability and the fourth modification {{has no effect on}} the stability. The instability of the plate was checked at two different beach slope 1 / 29 and 1 / 7. It was found that, there is no significant effect on the lift force because of changed slope. It was confirmed in experiments that the plate starts to lift when the pressure gradient force between top and bottom of the plate exceeds its self-weight. The threshold head difference and velocity required to make plate unstable was found 6 cm and 0. 40 m/s respectively. After making holes, the stability of the plate increased by 42 % in head and 28 % in velocity, up to 7 number of holes (0. 20 % reduction in area by hole). Upward lift force was decreased after making several holes on the plate.

40|$|We study {{resonances}} of compactly supported potentials V_ε = W (x, x/ε) where W : R^d ×R^d / (2 πZ) ^d →C, d odd. That {{means that}} V_ε is a sum of a slowly varying potential, W_ 0 (x), and one oscillating at frequency 1 /ε. For W_ 0 ≡ 0 we prove {{that there are}} no resonances above the line Imλ = -A (ε^- 1), except possibly a simple resonance of modulus ∼ε^ 2, when d= 1. We show that this result is optimal by constructing a one-dimensional example. In the case when W_ 0 ≠ 0 we prove that resonances in <b>fixed</b> <b>strips</b> admit an expansion in powers of ε. The argument provides a method for computing the coefficients of the expansion.

Specifically, for periodic boundary conditions on [0,L]^ 2, and a force g∈(A^α- 1 / 2), we show there is a <b>fixed</b> <b>strip</b> about the real time axis on which a uniform bound |A^αu|< m_ανκ_ 0 ^α holds for each α∈.

We demonstrate the universality of this "all for one, one for all" law on the union of a hierarchal set of function classes. Finally, we treat {{the question of whether}} the zero solution can be in the global attractor for a nonzero force by showing that if this is so, the force must be in a particular function class.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the spatial scales at which seabirds aggregate and associate with prey over the continental shelf off southwest Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Bird densities and hydroacoustic measures of prey abundance {{were recorded in}} all seasons from 1993 to 1995 from a vessel moving along <b>fixed</b> <b>strip</b> transects (mean distance 93 km; minimum spatial units 250 m). We used the neighbour K analysis to determine the spatial scale (patch radius) and number of birds (crowding) associated with aggregations of birds. Birds were grouped into 3 guilds: divers (dominated by common murres Uria aalge and other alcids), surface-feeders (dominated by California gulls Larus californicus and other gulls) and shearwaters (mainly sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus). Flying birds occurred in smaller aggregations spread over a wider area than birds on the water. For birds on the water, patch radii were usually 2 to 8 km, and crowding averaged 574, 143 and 50 birds per patch for surface-feeders, shearwaters and divers, respectively. Patch radii showed few significant differences among bird species and guilds, and remained relatively constant throughout the year for most species, despite large seasonal changes in density and mean crowding. Abundance of prey (small schooling fish and euphausiids) was highest in the upper 10 m, declining progressively with deeper depths and showed marked seasonal trends (mean scores 4 to 5 x higher in summer than in winter). Significant associations between birds and prey were usually within patch radii of 2 to 8 km. The appropriate scale to map and monitor seabirds and seabird-prey associations, for oil spill assessments and other reasons, would therefore be 1 to 10 km...|$|R

In contrast to established tools {{for the design of}} quad layouts or subdivision base meshes, which are often based on creating individual vertices, edges, and quads, our method takes a more global perspective, operating on a higher level of abstraction: the atomic operation of our method is the cre-ation of an entire cyclic strip, delineating a large number of quad patches at once. The global consistency-preserving nature of this approach reduces demands on the user’s expertise by requiring less advance planning. Efficiency is achieved using a novel method at the heart of our system, which automatically proposes geometri-cally and topologically suitable strips to the user. Based on this we provide interaction tools to influence the design process to any desired degree and visual guides to support the user in this task...|$|R

In order {{to investigate the}} effect of soil moisture content and tractor wheeling intensity on traffic-induced soil compaction, this study was carried out on a field with clay loam soil. Soil dry bulk density and hydraulic conductivity as well as emergence percentage of corn seedlings and dry mass of the sampled mature plants were considered the dependent variables of the experiment. Independent variables consisted of soil moisture content with five levels (12, 15, 17, 19, and 21 %), traffic intensity with three levels (four, two, and zero passes of tractor wheel (tractor model: John Deere 3350) from the entire area of the plot), and soil sampling depth with three levels (0 - 10, 10 - 20, and 20 - 30 cm). According {{to the results of}} this study, gradual increase in soil water content generally resulted in an increase in soil bulk density; moreover, increasing the tractor wheeling intensity from 0 to 4 passes increased bulk density by 13 %. Furthermore, the driest soil water content had the highest and the wettest soil water content had the lowest emergence percentage of corn seedlings among the treatments; moreover, traffic intensity treatment inversely affected the emergence percentage of corn seedlings and the dry mass of mature plants. To sum up, these results indicate that, for improving water permeability and reducing dry bulk density of the examined clay loam soil, as well as better emergence of corn seedlings and ultimately increasing crop yield, it is recommended to avoid wheeling when soil moisture content is high, reduce the number of machinery wheel passes from the farm as low as possible, and restrict the wheel passes to <b>fixed</b> <b>strips</b> along the field, whenever possible...|$|R

Kudzu has previously demonstrated broad intraspecific physiological plasticity while colonizing new environments. The {{objective of this}} paper was to investigate characteristics of kudzu leaflet anatomy that might contribute to its successful growth in climatically distinct environ-ments, and to escape cultivation as well. Fresh and <b>fixed</b> leaflet <b>strips</b> of field-grown plants were analyzed. The lower epidermis of kudzu showed a higher frequency of stomata (147 – 19 stomata mm- 2) than the upper epidermis (26 – 17 stomata mm- 2). The average number of trichomes per square milimeter was 8 for both the upper and the lower epidermis. The average trichome length was 410 – 200 µm for the upper epidermis and 460 – 190 µm for the lower epidermis. Cuticle thickness was not considerably different between lower and upper epidermis. The leaflet blade consisted basically of two layers (up-per and lower) of unicellular epidermis, two layers of palisade parenchyma and one layer of spongy parenchyma. One layer of paraveinal mesophyll was found between palisade and spongy parenchyma.

We had three complications of this type; the first was a fistula of the lower ureter which required uretero-vesical reimplantation via laparotomy without ablation of the prosthesis. No urinary fistula has been described in the literature with this technique to date. Our two other complications consisted of anterior vaginal erosions opposite the prosthesis, a complication which exists in the literature [28]. Our percentage of erosion (2 %) is perfectly in line with that described in the other series published [4, 11, 20, 29, 30, 31]. The appropriate treatment consists of exeresis of the fragment of mesh exposed by the erosion via the vagina, followed by vaginal suture after freshening the edges to be sutured, without any incidence on the anatomical or functional results. In all the series published these prostheses are fixed using non-resorbable suture material.

In Cambodia, hulling or husking rice is done with a device consisting of two baskets. The interior of the smaller basket is coated with clay, in which vertically <b>fixed</b> bamboo <b>strips</b> jut out about one centimeter. The upper basket is pierced near its center with a hole through which the rice is poured. The rice, pushed outward by the rotating movement is husked by passing between the jutting bamboo strips. After hulling, the rice is winnowed and pounded. This operation is necessary for polishing rice and separating it from dirt and the husks that remain after hulling. It is typically done with a wooden or stone mortar. Twenty-five to fifty liters of rice are put in the mortar, and then the rice is ground with a large wooden pestle, usually operated by hand. The rice must be winnowed one last time before it becomes edible. This process has largely now been replaced by mechanization, but the grinding stones are sometimes still used for grinding rice flour for making noodles and cakes.
