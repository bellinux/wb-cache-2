2500|$|AVT is an {{abbreviation}} of [...] "Amiga Video Transceiver", {{software and}} <b>hardware</b> <b>modem</b> originally developed by [...] "Black Belt Systems" [...] (USA) around 1990 for the Amiga home computer popular {{all over the}} world before the IBM PC family gained sufficient audio quality with the help of special sound cards. [...] These AVT modes differ radically from the other modes mentioned above, in that they are synchronous, that is, they have no per-line horizontal synchronization pulse but instead use the standard VIS vertical signal to identify the mode, followed by a frame-leading digital pulse train which pre-aligns the frame timing by counting first one way and then the other, allowing the pulse train to be locked in time at any single point out of 32 where it can be resolved or demodulated successfully, after which they send the actual image data, in a fully synchronous and typically interlaced mode.|$|E

5000|$|Most PC serial ports, the {{traditional}} interface for external hardware modems, {{are limited to}} 115,200 bits per second by UART limitations, though some ports are capable of 230,400 bit/s. V.92 modems with V.44 compression can have an effective throughput of up to 300,000 bit/s. [...] Since a V.92 <b>hardware</b> <b>modem</b> performs V.44 compression internally, {{the speed of a}} serial port can limit a hardware modem's overall speed; this is not an issue for softmodems since the host PC performs V.44 compression and emulates the serial port. Thus, V.92/V.44 softmodems are potentially capable of outperforming hardware modems if the <b>hardware</b> <b>modem</b> is connected to a slow interface like a PC's serial port. This limitation should not apply if the <b>hardware</b> <b>modem</b> is connected via a faster interface like ISA, PCI, PCI Express, or USB.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of software upgradeability was diminished when many newer <b>hardware</b> <b>modems</b> gained {{the ability to}} upgrade firmware to support new standards. Modems such as those made by U.S. Robotics used generic DSP architecture, which achieves the flexibility of softmodems, without sacrificing compatibility.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{generations of}} <b>hardware</b> <b>modems</b> (including {{acoustic}} couplers) and their protocols used relatively simple modulation {{techniques such as}} FSK or ASK at low speeds and with inefficient use of the telephone line's bandwidth. Under these conditions, modems could be built with the analog discrete component technology used during the late 70s and early 80s.|$|R
50|$|As PSTN <b>hardware</b> <b>modem</b> {{technology}} advanced, the modulation and encoding schemes {{became increasingly}} more complex, thus forcing the hardware {{used by the}} modems themselves to increase in complexity.|$|E
5000|$|A 1200 baud AFSK modem, preferably a very low-end, {{that does}} no {{modulation}} on its own. Cubesat Groundstation uses a custom-built <b>hardware</b> <b>modem,</b> {{and possibly a}} software modem (using the sound card as an Analog-to-Digital converter).|$|E
50|$|A more {{practical}} advantage of softmodems {{is given by}} the considerable reductions in production costs, component count, size, weight and power requirements compared to a <b>hardware</b> <b>modem,</b> whether external or internal, {{to the point that}} most modems that are integrated in portable computer systems (including high-end laptops and PDAs) are softmodems.|$|E
50|$|Thus <b>hardware</b> <b>modems</b> {{supporting}} {{those standards}} were becoming steadily {{more complex and}} expensive themselves, {{not to mention the}} fact that several conflicting standards in the early days of the various 33.6K (V.34) and 56K protocols led to incompatibilities and the construction of modems with upgradeable firmware, which did all of the processing via a programmable DSP.|$|R
5000|$|SAGEM also {{introduced}} an ISDN adaptor for GeoPort, the [...] "Planet-ISDN Geoport Adapter", or SPIGA, which they now sell in a USB version. Global Village also produced {{a variant of}} its compact Teleport Modems for Apple Performas and third-party Mac computers that used the 9th pin to supply power, but these were true <b>hardware</b> <b>modems,</b> not GeoPort devices.|$|R
50|$|There {{are both}} <b>hardware</b> (in <b>modems)</b> and {{software}} implementations of a Viterbi decoder.|$|R
50|$|By {{offering}} (or {{claiming to}} offer) the same functionality as a <b>hardware</b> <b>modem</b> {{at a fraction}} of the price and (theoretically) a capacity for unlimited upgrades, the advantages of software-based modems became compelling. However, they would still require significant advances in home PCs' CPU power in order to compete with hardware modems in terms of performance and reliability.|$|E
50|$|Softmodems can be {{separated}} into two clear classes: controllerless modems and pure software modems. Controllerless modems, {{such as those}} made by Lucent and Motorola, perform much of the modem work on the card, and require only small amounts of CPU power to complete. Conexant's HCF standard also falls into the controllerless category. Pure software modems perform the entire emulation of a <b>hardware</b> <b>modem</b> on the main CPU, with Conexant's HSF standard being the most common.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to games, educational and multimedia reference titles were also produced, such as interactive encyclopedias and museum tours, which were popular before public Internet access was widespread. The CD-i {{was also one}} of the earliest gaming systems to implement internet features, including subscriptions, web browsing, downloading, e-mail, and online play. This was facilitated by the use of an additional <b>hardware</b> <b>modem</b> that Philips released in 1996 for $150. Competitors included the Tandy VIS and Commodore CDTV.|$|E

50|$|The GeoPort was dropped, {{along with}} SCSI and ADB, when Apple {{introduced}} the iMac in 1998; early demonstration models had a software modem {{based on the}} GeoPort Telecom Adapter’s technology, but this was replaced with a <b>hardware</b> 56K <b>modem</b> {{by the time the}} iMac shipped.|$|R

Every day more people search for new forms to interconnect these computers in networks to obtain the best productivity and performance. The PLC technology opens a new possibility in computer communications. This consist in use the electrical network installed in every modern house has a way to transmit information between different points of it. This project consist in communicate two computers across the power lines in a Home Area Network, using a specialized <b>hardware</b> (<b>MODEM)</b> and an evaluation software to know the communication errors in real time. First, the specialized <b>hardware</b> (<b>MODEM)</b> to communicate the computers across the power lines was designed and implemented. Next an evaluation of modems communication was made with different connections and noise sources to know how affect this factors the transmitted information. Finally, were identified some connections between two modems that favor a stable communication and other connections that produces a deteriorate transmission process.

30|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{an important}} application of GPU technology to SWR systems. In particular, we develop a novel GPU-based polyphase channelizer architecture that delivers high throughput and provides reduced complexity and optimized parallel processing of many channels, while being configurable via software. Since BB modems require SP accelerators that are performing the same SP tasks on incoming streams of data, {{there are significant}} data and task parallelism available, which we exploit in our proposed architecture using the intensive parallel processing capability of a GPU. In our proposed design, the GPU {{can be used as}} a stand-alone unit or in conjunction with an existing <b>hardware</b> <b>modem.</b> Our goal is to use the GPU as a radio and bring it as close to the antenna as possible. Such a GPU-based system can reduce the burden on a power-hungry BB modem and ideally replace the existing modem altogether. Thus, our proposed channelizer architecture simplifies the design and enhances flexibility while providing significantly accelerated performances.|$|E

40|$|A {{software}} modem for Meteor Burst Communication (MBC) is presented. The software is {{running on a}} DSP board, connected to a PC for user interface. MBC is a unique type of radio communication, which is suitable for non-realtime remote data collection. Forward scattering of radio waves from ionized trails of meteors provides reliable communication channel for path lengths from 300 to 2000 km and in the frequency band of 40 to 100 MHz. The channel is bursty in nature and requires special treatment while designing modulation-demodulation scheme and communication protocol. So far all the modems available for MBC are <b>hardware</b> <b>modems</b> with inherent inflexibility. Here we present a system, which minimizes hardware bondage as much as possible. Adaptability, with respect to modulation type, has been implemented into the system. A unique dynamic channel estimation scheme, appropriate for MBC channel, has been developed and implemented.
