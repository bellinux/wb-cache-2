5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the club}} {{stated that they}} would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{renovate}} Aspmyra for NOK200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA-funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bodø Municipality and Bodø/Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at Rønvikjordene, {{in the northern part}} of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bodø/Glimt would need a capacity for 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bodø was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated that they have the long-term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property.|$|E

25|$|Roanoke Island {{was the key}} {{to control}} of the Sounds. If {{controlled}} by the Union forces, they would have a base that could be attacked only by an amphibious operation, which the Rebels could not mount. If the Union established naval superiority there, all points on the mainland shores would be equally vulnerable to assault. The Confederate defenders would be forced into an impossible situation: they would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give up some positions without a fight, or they would have to spread their assets too thin to be of any use.|$|E

25|$|In practice, these nulls, {{especially}} in elevation, would move {{about when the}} antennas rotated to track a target. At first it had been believed that {{this would not be}} a serious problem, and that it could be addressed by developing a calibration table for each site. But even the very first tests demonstrated that the calibration changed with wavelength. This mean that they would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make multiple calibration tables, one for each wavelength, or that if a single table of corrections for different bearings was desired, the antennas would have to be moved vertically as the wavelength was changed.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{beyond the}} Milky Way, {{there are at}} least 2 {{trillion}} other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times further than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space, intergalactic travel would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> involve voyages lasting millions of years, or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the Alcubierre drive. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that intergalactic travel is impossible in principle.|$|E
25|$|Fifty-one {{municipalities}} {{applied to}} join the project and fourteen were selected. The computing industry warned against the proposals, which would use ND's proprietary minicomputers instead of open standard servers and personal computers. Another concern which was voiced was that if fifteen new computing centers were to be established, it would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be {{at the expense of}} existing major centers, such as the Norwegian Computing Center and SINTEF, or would have to receive subsidies. The project was also disapproved of by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education and Research and the Regional Development Fund, but the issue was carried through by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the Bretton Woods System was that nations could only enforce gold {{convertibility}} on the anchor currency—the United States' dollar. Gold convertibility enforcement was not required, but instead, allowed. Nations could forgo converting dollars to gold, and instead hold dollars. Rather than full convertibility, it provided a fixed price for sales between central banks. However, there was still an open gold market. For the Bretton Woods system to remain workable, it would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> alter the peg of the dollar to gold, or {{it would have to}} maintain the free market price for gold near the $35 per ounce official price. The greater the gap between free market gold prices and central bank gold prices, the greater the temptation to deal with internal economic issues by buying gold at the Bretton Woods price and selling it on the open market.|$|E
25|$|The Half-Faced Man deploys {{his escape}} pod — in reality, a hot-air balloon made of human skin—lifting the {{restaurant}} {{into the sky}} with him and the Doctor inside. The Doctor discovers that the Half-Faced Man {{and parts of the}} restaurant are from the SS Marie Antoinette, the sister ship to the SS Madame de Pompadour ("The Girl in the Fireplace"). The Doctor claims that the Half-Faced Man has replaced his components so many times that he no longer exists in his original form and that he secretly wants to end his existence. He then warns him that he will <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill himself, or the Doctor will be forced to kill him to protect the humans. Clara and the Paternoster Gang are nearly overwhelmed by the other robots when they see them go lifeless. The Half-Faced Man is then shown to be impaled on the spire of Big Ben.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Radiohead singer Yorke and Radiohead {{producer}} Nigel Godrich {{expressed concern}} about how the internet has affected the music business, and accused the music streaming service Spotify of not compensating new artists fairly. Godrich stated: [...] " [...] cannot work {{as a way of}} supporting new artists' work. Spotify and the like <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> address that fact and change the model for new releases or else all new music producers should be bold and vote with their feet."

Even if he possessed such power, those tribunals would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be sanctioned by the [...] "laws of war", as codified by Congress in Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or authorized by statute. As to the statutory authorization, {{there is nothing in}} the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) [...] "even hinting" [...] at expanding the President's war powers beyond those enumerated in Art. 21. Instead, the AUMF, the UCMJ, and the DTA [...] "at most acknowledge" [...] the President's authority to convene military commissions only where justified by the exigencies of war, but still operating within the laws of war.|$|E
500|$|On December 10, the Americans set {{up their}} largest battery of {{artillery}} [...] from the walls. [...] The frozen ground prevented the Americans from entrenching the artillery, so they fashioned a wall out of snow blocks. [...] This battery was used to fire on the city, but the damage it did was of little consequence. [...] Montgomery realized {{he was in a}} very difficult position, because the frozen ground prevented the digging of trenches, and his lack of heavy weapons made it impossible to breach the city's defenses. [...] The enlistments of Arnold's men were expiring {{at the end of the}} year, and no ammunition was on the way from the colonies. Furthermore, it was very likely that British reinforcements would arrive in the spring, meaning he would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> act or withdraw. [...] Montgomery believed his only chance to take the city was during a snowstorm at night, when his men could scale the walls undetected.|$|E
500|$|When Andros came to New York, {{he moved}} to {{stabilize}} the situation. [...] He befriended the Lenape sachems (chiefs), convincing them to act as mediators between the English and other tribes. [...] Peace appeared to be imminent when Bacon's Rebellion broke out in Maryland, resulting in {{an attack on the}} Susquehannock fort on the Potomac. [...] The surviving Susquehannocks sneaked out of the fort one night, some of them making their way east toward Delaware Bay. [...] In June 1676 Andros offered, in exchange for their moving into his jurisdiction, to protect them from their enemies among the Virginian and Maryland settlers. He also extended an offer given by the Mohawk for the Susquehannocks to settle among them. [...] These offers were well received, but Maryland authorities were unable to convince their Indian allies to make the peace offered by Andros, and organized them to march toward the Delaware, which would also fulfil the goal of strengthening the Maryland claim to the area. [...] Andros responded by urging the Susquehannocks to retreat into New York, where they would be beyond Maryland's reach, and delivering a strongly worded threat to Maryland, that it would <b>either</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge his sovereignty over the Susquehannocks, or they would have to peacably take them back. [...] He also offered his services as a mediator, pointing out that the absence of the Susquehannocks now left Maryland settlements open to direct attack by the Iroquois.|$|E
