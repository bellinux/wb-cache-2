The choice of preference order should, in principle, reflect the data quality, {{but this is not}} necessarily the case. For example, the data set with the highest preference order is the marine data set (index = 11), not because of its quality but simply because marine data are given at sea level, whereas other <b>data</b> <b>compilations</b> are upwardly continued to 5 -km altitude. Similarly, the Australian data set, which is known for its homogeneity and quality, has a low preference order (index = 37), but the data set remains unmodified because it is isolated from other <b>data</b> <b>compilations.</b>|$|R

These studies complemented the continental-scale gravity-compilation studies that were {{the subject of the}} TLE “Meter Reader” contributions in March and May of this year. The success of these projects resulted from strategic partnerships, especially with Paterson, Grant and Watson Ltd. (PGW), and links {{to a wide range of}} national organizations. Early compilations covering the whole of Africa, South America, and China were followed by large-scale, small-scale, and national compilations and continue to this day with compilations of U. S. surveys. The projects spawned a range of technical developments, including approaches to remove survey-line noise, the integration of survey grids and disparate ship-track data, and the preservation of the longest-wavelength anomalies associated with the crustal magnetic field. The resulting global gravity and magnetic grids now form an invaluable resource for resource exploration...|$|R

40|$|Numerous primary {{investigators}} {{collected and}} processed long termed time series on German educational statistics {{in the context}} of their studies. As a result there are a multitude of quantitative empirical studies. On the one hand there is the project group on German Educational Statistics. Its projects were targeted at describing and analysing the long-term structural changes of the German educational system on a broad empirical and statistical basis. On the other hand there are comprehensive <b>data</b> <b>compilations</b> of individual research projects, focusing on a wide variety of special educational research topics. The online database ‘histat’ provides central digital access to these datasets on German educational history. Currently, it offers more than 120, 000 long-term time series on the German educational system for a period of 200 years. The striking size of the database shows its key importance for researchers in the field of education. Thus, this paper aims to provide useful insights into the background of the database, the special characteristics of the <b>data</b> <b>compilations</b> and their analytical potential. Additionally, examples are given of how the data have already been used by researchers. JRC. B. 4 -Human Capital and Employmen...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-six {{authoritative}} people, {{covering a}} range of academic disciplines and roles, were interviewed for their views on quality control of (i) research communications, (ii) <b>data</b> <b>compilations,</b> (iii) digital learning and teaching (L&T) materials in higher education, and (iv) scholarly communications on Web 2. 0. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed qualitatively. Little change was expected in peer-review procedures {{in the next five}} years. 'Double-blind' peer review is widespread in the social sciences but almost unknown in the sciences. Neither electronic-only publication nor Open Access is expected to impact substantially on quality control of research communications. For L&T materials, a 'caveat emptor' approach is urged upon lecturers and students alike when they contemplate materials found on the Internet by using search engines. Quality of <b>data</b> <b>compilations</b> varies greatly with discipline: resources susceptible to algorithmic check, such as those in genomics, astronomy and crystallography, are reliable, and older scientific databanks maintained by international scientific unions are sound. Those in the social sciences - including Government statistics - may be of doubtful quality. In the humanities, image databanks need good metadata to be usable. Web 2. 0 social-networking is popular with the younger generation, but there is doubt whether it supplants formal scholarly communication...|$|R
