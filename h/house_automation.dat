40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} automating analyses of historical maps. The problem is motivated {{by the lack of}} accuracy and consistency in the current comparison process of geographical objects found in historical maps by visual inspections. The objective of our work is to compare shape characteristics of the Great Lakes region in a dataset of approximately 40 French and British historical maps created in the 17 th through the 19 th centuries. Our approach decomposes the visual inspection into steps such as object segmentation, spatial scale calibration, extraction of calibrated object descriptors and comparison of descriptors over time and multiple cartographer <b>houses.</b> The <b>automation</b> of object segmentation is achieved by template shape-based segmentation using the Hu moments as shape descriptors and ballbased region growing. The automation of spatial calibration is accomplished by detection and classification of lines along map borders and by mapping striped boundaries intersected by latitude and longitude lines into degrees of arc length. Thus, shape characteristics of segmentation results in pixels can be converted to geographical units, for example, an area of a lake in square miles. We report experimental evaluations of automation accuracy based on comparison with manual segmentation results, as well as the knowledge obtained from the area comparisons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{automation}} systems {{require both}} design-time and runtime integration of diverse engineering tools. Tra-ditional integration approaches {{are based on}} repeating manual work, being time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, applications of semantic integration, dealing with meaning of objects and their interfaces, is explained and shown on a real industrial use-case. Simulations are useful tools for process optimization or performance testing and the presented methodology makes their design for particular industrial plants flexible. The use-case shows that the design of simulation models for passive houses can be user-friendly and feasible even for non-experts as {{it is based on}} a graphical tool that enables to draw a passive house floor plan. Since neither this tool nor a universal simulation library, comprising atomic simulation blocks, were intended for simulation purposes, the presented methodology is a typical example of tool integration having heterogeneous data models. The goal {{of this paper is to}} propose an ontology-based formalization of knowledge representing structures of real industrial plants and simulation models. The paper also intro-duces the design of simulation models for passive houses from other engineering sources, which can be used by non-experts for simulation modeling. The practical usage is restricted by the fact that simulation parameters must be entered manually. The main contributions of the paper are the proposed structure of an automation ontology and a workflow of simulation model design that is not common in engineering disciplines.

Home automation gained {{a lot of interest}} during the end of the 20 th and the beginning of 21 st century. Nowadays, discussion concerning the question whether the phenomenon home automation belongs to the architectural field (or not) takes place in the construction industry. Some professionals and architects think automation is concerned with additions to a house which the architect does not need to interfere with. Obviously, a house must offer the performance as required by the inhabitant.
