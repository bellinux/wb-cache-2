5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among <b>kin</b> <b>and</b> nest mates and evolve from <b>kin</b> <b>and</b> group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} <b>kin</b> <b>and</b> nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E

William Robertson proposes the safest place for Duncan's widow and her children would be with her or Duncan's <b>kin</b> <b>and</b> supporters in Atholl.|$|E

40|$|<b>Kin</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> 2 are S. cerevisiae {{counterparts}} of Par- 1, the C. elegans kinase {{essential for}} the establishment of polarity in the one cell embryo. Here, we present evidence for a novel link between Kin 1, <b>Kin</b> 2 <b>and</b> the secretory machinery of the budding yeast. We isolated <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2 as suppressors of a mutant form of Rho 3, a Rho-GTPase acting in polarized trafficking. Genetic analysis suggests that <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2 act downstream of the Rab-GTPase Sec 4, its exchange factor Sec 2, and several components of the vesicle tethering complex, the Exocyst. We show that <b>Kin</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> 2 physically interact with the t-SNARE Sec 9 and the Lgl homologue Sro 7, proteins acting at the final stage of exocytosis. Structural analysis of Kin 2 reveals that its catalytic activity is essential for its function in the secretory pathway, and implicates the conserved 42 amino acid tail at the carboxyterminal of the kinase in auto-inhibition. Finally, we find that <b>Kin</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Kin</b> 2 induce phosphorylation of t-SNARE Sec 9 in vivo and stimulate its release from the plasma membrane. In summary, we report the finding that yeast Par- 1 counterparts are associated with and regulate the function of the exocytic apparatus via phosphorylation of Sec 9. ...|$|R
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their <b>kin)</b> <b>and</b> also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E
5|$|Flann's {{daughter}} Gormflaith ingen Flann Sinna {{became the}} subject of later literary accounts, accounted which depicted her as a tragic figure. She was married first to Cormac mac Cuilennáin of the Eóganachta, who had taken vows of celibacy as a bishop. On Cormac's death in battle in 908, fighting against her father, she was married to Cerball mac Muirecáin of the Uí Dúnlainge, who supposedly abused her. Cerball was a key ally of Gormlaith's father. After Cerball's death in 909 Gormlaith married her stepbrother Niall Glúndub, who died in 919. The Annals of Clonmacnoise have her wandering Ireland after Niall's death, forsaken by her <b>kin,</b> <b>and</b> reduced to begging from door to door, although this is thought to be later invention rather than a tradition with a basis in fact.|$|E
5|$|Once a queen has {{excavated}} a chamber, {{she will}} lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae {{in less than}} a month. These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults. Mature nests range in size, from a few hundred to over 300,000 workers. Most colonies are monogyne, meaning it only has a single queen, but some colonies can have as many as four. Oligogynous colonies also exist, in which multiple queens are present, but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens. Brood discrimination is known based on recognition of <b>kin,</b> <b>and</b> queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens. Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of workers is present, and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size.|$|E

40|$|Mixed {{synthetic}} oligonucleotides encoding sequences conserved among tyrosine-specific protein kinases {{were used}} to probe the genome of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two genes with homology to protein kinases were isolated and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. These genes, designated <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2, {{are closely related to}} each other. Among previously characterized protein kinases, the products of <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2 are most closely related to the bovine cAMP-dependent protein kinase (30 % amino acid identities) and the protein encoded by the v-src oncogene (27 % and 25 % identities with <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2, respectively) within their putative kinase domains. <b>KIN</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>KIN</b> 2 are transcribed into 3. 5 -kilobase mRNAs that contain uninterrupted open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 117 kDa and 126 kDa, respectively. The predicted proteins are unusual in two respects: (i) their catalytic domains are carried near the N termini of relatively large proteins, in contrast to the majority of characterized protein kinases, and (ii) these catalytic domains are structural mosaics, with some features characteristic of tyrosine-specific protein kinases and other elements that are distinctive of serine/threonine-specific enzymes...|$|R

5|$|Spotted hyena {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably {{similar to those of}} cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party <b>kin</b> <b>and</b> rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is unlike {{that of any other}} carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both <b>kin</b> <b>and</b> unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in Scotland kinship was agnatic, with {{members of a group}} sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women {{retained}} their original surname at marriage, symbolising that they did not join their husband's <b>kin,</b> <b>and</b> marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship. Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties, by which they accrued resources, status and skills {{that would allow them to}} establish a household. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Highland women, based on the higher birth rate of the Highlands, might have married earlier than their Lowland counterparts.|$|E
