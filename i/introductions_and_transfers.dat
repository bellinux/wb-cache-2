40|$|The main {{objective}} of recent international legislative measures and policies concerning marine ecosystems {{is to ensure}} sustainable environmental management to maintain a good status for marine waters, habitats and resources, with the ultimate target of achieving an integrated ecosystem-based approach to management. Because bioinvasions pose significant threats to marine ecosystems and {{the goods and services}} these provide, non-indigenous species (NIS) are included in the more recent legislative documents. A major challenge for the scientific community is to translate the principles of the legislative directives into a realistic, integrated ecosystem-based approach {{and at the same time}} provide stakeholders with best practices for managing NIS. The aim of this paper, prepared by members of the Working Group on <b>Introductions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Transfers</b> of Marine Organisms (WGITMO) of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), is to provide guidance for the application of NIS related management in the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Ten recommendations, including NIS identification, standardization of sampling and data, indicators, propagule pressure and management issues are considered in this paper. While most of these suggestions were developed to improve the implementation of the MSFD, several may be more widely applicable...|$|E
40|$|The {{wide variety}} of goods and {{services}} provided by the coastal zone (food, medicines, nutrient recycling, control of flooding, typhoon protection) account for its many uses (fisheries, aquaculture, agriculture, human settlements, harbors, ports, tourism, industries). Aquaculture now provides a third of total fisheries production. Half of the total aquaculture yield comes from land-based ponds and water-based pens, cages, longlines and stakes in brackish water and marine habitats. But the opportunities for employment, income and foreign exchange from coastal aquaculture have been overshadowed by negative environmental and social effects. The environmental impacts include: mangrove loss, bycatch during collection of wild seed and broodstock, <b>introductions</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> of species, spread of parasites and diseases, misuse of chemicals, and release of wastes. The socioeconomic impacts include: privatization of public lands and waterways, loss of fisheries livelihoods, food insecurity, and urban migration. The paper gives recommendations on the attainment of responsible and sustainable aquaculture with emphasis on herbivorous and omnivorous species, polyculture, integration with agriculture and mangroves, and self-regulation in the form of codes of conduct and best management practices. Recommended approaches include holistic Integrated Coastal Zone Management based on stakeholder needs, mechanisms for conflict resolution, assimilative capacity of the environment, protection of community resources, and rehabilitation of degraded habitats, to improvements in the aquaculture sector pertaining to management of feed, water, and effluents...|$|E
40|$|The 42 th {{meeting of}} the ICES Working Group on <b>Introductions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Transfers</b> of Marine Organisms (WGITMO) was held in Olbia, Italy, 16 – 18 March 2016, with Anna Occhipinti-Ambrogi as host and Henn Ojaveer as chairperson. Representatives from 19 {{countries}} participated in the meeting. Attendants were from Belgium, Canada, Dennark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Sweden contributed by cor-respondence. The objectives of the meeting were to update information and discuss several aspects related to the <b>introductions</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> of non-indigenous aquatic species. Data and information management {{were two of the}} discussion topics of the meeting, with special focus on the better exploitation of the ‘Information system on aquatic non-indigenous and cryptogenic species’ (AquaNIS). The WGITMO also dedicated time for addressing the MSFD D 2 issues: indicator on new non-indigenous species introduced by human activities, and opportunities and problems related to cross-regional comparison of non-indigenous species indicators. Preparation of the manuscript of the alert report on sea squirt Didemnum vexillum, which is to be published in ICES CRR series, was discussed and the steps to be taken to finalise the report were agreed. As usual, adequate time was devoted to discuss national reports, to exchange of information on the management of NIS and to review ongoing and planned research activities. The approach taken during the meeting facilitated presentations and discussions on the issues of relevance related to the Terms of References as well as on a few generic and strategically-important issues of general relevance to bioinvasions. The meeting began with a full-day joint meeting with the Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship Vectors (WGBOSV), which provided an opportunity to discuss and address issues of common interest, such as shipping and biofouling as introduction vectors. The proposed ICES demonstration advice on ‘Risk management of non-indigenous species associated with shipping in the Arctic’ was discussed, and edits were suggested for both the orientation of the demonstration advice {{as well as for the}} exact questions to be asked. Both working groups agreed that the practice of conducting back-to-back meetings with one joint day is useful and will continue in 2017. All Terms of References to be addressed for 2016 were discussed. For some Terms of Ref-erence, more detailed presentations were given, and a short overview of the information and subsequent discussion is provided herein at the end of each section.

40|$|The 43 rd {{meeting of}} the ICES Working Group on <b>Introductions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Transfers</b> of Marine Organisms (WGITMO) {{was held at the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-tion (NOAA) Northeast Fisheries Sciences Center in Woods Hole, USA, on 13 – 15 March 2017. This meeting {{included}} a joint day with the Working Group on Ballast Water and Other Ship Vectors (WGBOSV). The meeting was hosted by Judy Pederson (USA) and chaired by Cynthia McKenzie (Canada). The meeting was attended by 23 scientists in person, two by web-conference and five by correspondence, representing 16 countries; four additional scientists attended on the joint meeting day. The objective of the meeting was to communicate new information and discuss several aspects of the <b>introductions</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> of marine organisms relevant to the six terms of reference for the working group. There was a particular focus on introductions into the Arctic environment, bio-fouling of vessels and structures, and developing indicators to evaluate impact of non-indigenous species in marine environments. This year’s interim report provides: a summary of the 16 National Reports (reports at-tached in Annex 4); the 20 presentations provided by members and chair invited mem-bers in support of term of reference objectives (abstracts provided in Annex 5); discussions, achievements, limitations and a recommendation. All Terms of Reference were discussed with this report structured so that each Term of Reference is dealt with in sequential order. The National Reports provide an overview of the priorities, findings, meetings and publications for each country. In addition, it provides discussion points for methodologies, collaborations and knowledge gaps {{that need to be addressed}} by the group (ToR a). The AquaNIS database continues to be updated and the data is now georeferenced. There were three additional presentations under this term of reference addressing monitoring methodology and an invasion risk assessment tool. WGITMO considered two ToRs jointly with WGBOSV: examining the effect of climate change on the establishment of aquatic species in the Arctic (ToR b); and examining bio-fouling as vector for the introduction and transfer of aquatic organisms on vessels and structures (ToR c). An update was provided on an ongoing initiative to address De-scriptor 2 of the EU-MSFD, in particular Indicator 2. 2. 1 regarding impact of Invasive Al-ien Species (IAS) on marine environments (ToR d). The final goal is to develop a new indicator of impact that can be proposed for the implementation within the Marine Strat-egy Framework Directive. Two ICES Cooperative Research Reports developed by WGITMO were recently released. One was an alien species alert report on the invasive tunicate Didemnum vexillum and the other summarized the status of non-indigenous ma-rine species in the North Atlantic and adjacent waters 2003 – 2007 (ToR a). An update was provided on communications regarding the Suez Canal enlargement and bioinvasion problems in the Mediterranean Sea. A theme session for the 2017 ICES ASC on bioinvasion trajectories and impacts in con-trasting marine environments was proposed by WGITMO as collaboration between IC-ES-PICES-CIESM. The proposal was accepted and will be jointly chaired by representatives of the three groups...|$|E

Fourteen {{countries}} participated in the meeting. At-tendants were from Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Lithua-nia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Greece, Ireland, Spain and Denmark contributed by correspondence. The meeting was also at-tended by the JRC representative. It was the 41 th meeting of this expert group. The objectives of the meeting were to update information and discuss several aspects re-lated to the <b>introductions</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfers</b> of non-indigenous species. Data and information management was {{a key component of}} the meeting with a special focus on the applica-tionof the ‘Information system on aquatic non-indigenous and cryptogenic species’ (AquaNIS) to support WGITMO mandate. These included issues such as: i) fouling of artificial structures by non-indigenous species, ii) how to better address emerging ICES strategic topics (climate impacts, Arctic research) and iii) internal cooperation in ICES (WGBOSV, WGAQUA, WGIMT). The group also dedicated time for addressing the MSFD D 2 issues and discussed these in relation to data availability and management im-plications for NIS in marine ecosystems. Another alien species alert report was published in ICES CRR series (see: Gollasch, S. et al. 2015. Alien Species Alert: Ensis directus. Current status of invasions by the marine bivalve Ensis directus. ICES Cooperative Research Re-port No. 323. 32 pp.). The outline for the new report onthe sea squirt Didemnum vexillum, was developed during the meeting. The group also reviewed OSPAR JAMP Eutrophica-tion Guidelines on phytoplankton species composition and developed advice related to non-indigenous phytoplankton species. As usual, appropriate time was devoted to dis-cuss national reports, exchange of information on the management of NIS and review of research activities. The approach taken during the meeting facilitated presentations and discussions on the issues of relevance related to the Terms of References, but also a few generic and strategi-cally important issues relevant to the theme of bioinvasions in general. The meeting started with a full-day joint meeting with the Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship Vectors (WGBOSV) to provide an opportunity to discuss and address issues of common interest.

40|$|Several {{legal and}} {{administrative}} instruments aimed {{to reduce the}} spread of non-indigenous species, that may pose harm to the environment, economy and/or human health, were developed in recent years at international and national levels, such as the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ship’s Ballast Water and Sediments, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea Code of Practice on the <b>Introductions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Transfers</b> of Marine Organisms, the EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the US Invasive Species Act, the Biosecurity Act of New Zealand, etc. The effectiveness of these instruments can only be measured by successes {{in the prevention of}} new introductions. We propose an indicator, the arrival of new non-indigenous species (nNIS), which helps to assess introduction rates, especially in relation to pathways and vectors of introduction, and is aimed to support management. The technical precondition for the calculation of nNIS is the availability of a global, continuously updated and verified source of information on aquatic non-indigenous species. Such a database is needed, because the indicator should be calculated at different geographical scales: 1) for a particular area, such as port or coast of a country within a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME); 2) for a whole LME; and 3) for a larger biogeographical region, including two or more neighboring LMEs. The geographical scale of nNIS helps to distinguish between a primary introduction and secondary spread, which may involve different pathways and vectors. This, in turn, determines the availability of management options, because it is more feasible to prevent a primary introduction than to stop subsequent secondary spread. The definition of environmental target, size of assessment unit and possible limitations of the indicator are also discussed...|$|E

The meeting was hosted by Judy Peder-son (USA) and chaired by Sarah Bailey (Canada). The meeting was attended by 21 scien-tists in person, 3 by web-conference, and 2 by correspondence, representing 10 countries; 5 additional scientists representing 3 additional countries attended on the joint meeting day. The objective of the meeting was to discuss and address the six terms of reference (ToRs) in order to co-ordinate and advance research activities that {{reduce the risk of}} transporting non-native species via shipping activities. This interim report provides a brief summary of progress achieved on all ToRs and the related workplan, with National Reports and Abstracts for all presentations appended as annexes. The approach taken at the meeting was for each country to provide an update on the status of shipping vector research {{in the form of a}} National Report, facilitating a thorough review of national activities to identify potential collaborations, advance re-search and address knowledge gaps (ToR a). Subsequently, individual ToRs were pro-gressed through contributed presentations and group discussion. WGBOSV considered two ToRs jointly with WGITMO, examining biofouling as vector for the introduction and transfer of aquatic organisms on small boats and large ships (ToR e) and examining the effect of climate change on the establishment of aquatic species in the Arctic (ToR d). During year 2, WGBOSV members submitted numerous manuscripts about methods for collection and analysis of ballast water samples to a special issue in the Journal of Sea Research, and developed a submission to the International Maritime Organization con-cerning the type of scientific data that should be collected during the experience-building phase after entry-into-force of the ballast water convention. Two additional scientific review papers were initiated and progressed intersessionally. One new recommendation came out of the meeting: to formalize the role of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) with the WGBOSV and to formalize the cooperation between ICES, IMO and In-tergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) through a submission from ICES Secretariat to IMO Secretariat.

The meeting dealt in more details with the ‘Information system on aquatic non-indigenous and cryptogenic species’ (AquaNIS) and whether/how to use this platform to further reporting to WGITMO purposes, fouling of artificial structures by alien species, how to better address emerging ICES strategic topics (climate impacts, Arctic research) and cooperation with CIESM and PICES. Importantly, the group also dedicated time for addressing the MSFD D 2 is-sues and finalized the species alert report on Ensis directus. As usual, sufficient time was devoted to presentations of national reports and exchange of knowledge and information (e. g. with the Mediterranean Sea and the Ponto-Caspian region). The approach taken during the meeting facilitated presentations and discussions on the issues of relevance related to the Terms of References, but also a few generic and strategically important issues relevant to bioinvasions in general. The meeting started as a full-day joint meeting with the Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship Vec-tors (WGBOSV) during which issues of common interest were addressed. For the next meeting, the joint meeting is also planned to last one full day.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} study of the {{transfer}} of satellites between elliptic Keplerian orbits using Lyapunov stability theory specific to this problem. The construction of Lyapunov functions is {{based on the fact that}} a non-degenerate Keplerian orbit is uniquely described by its angular momentum and Laplace (-Runge-Lenz) vectors. We suggest a Lyapunov function, which gives a feedback controller such that the target elliptic orbit becomes a locally asymptotically stable periodic orbit in the closed-loop dynamics. We show how to perform a global transfer between two arbitrary elliptic orbits based on the local transfer result. Finally, a second Lyapunov function is presented that works only for circular target orbits. 1. <b>Introduction.</b> Low- <b>and</b> moderate-thrust <b>transfer</b> between satellite orbits in an inverse-square gravity field has been a topic of interest for decades.

40|$|Background New Start, a structured, validated, {{multidisciplinary}} {{training programme}} in sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} (SLNB), was established to allow the <b>introduction</b> <b>and</b> rapid <b>transfer</b> of appropriate knowledge and technical skills to ensure safe and competent practice across the UK. Methods Multidisciplinary teams attended a theory/skills laboratory course, following which they performed 30 consecutive SLNBs, either concurrently with their standard axillary staging procedure (training model A) or as stand-alone SLNB (training model B). SLNB was performed according to a standard protocol using the combined technique of isotope (99 mTc-labelled albumin colloid) and blue dye. An accredited New Start trainer mentored the first five procedures in the participant's hospital, or all 30 if stand-alone. Validation standards for model A and B were a localization rate of at least 90 per cent. In addition, for model A only, in which a minimum of ten patients were required to be node-positive, a false-negative rate (FNR) of 10 per cent or less was required. Results From October 2004 to December 2008, 210 SLNB-naive surgeons, in 103 centres, performed 6685 SLNB procedures. The overall sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization rate was 98 · 9 (95 per cent confidence interval 98 · 6 to 99 · 1) per cent (6610 of 6685) and the FNR 9 · 1 (7 · 9 to 10 · 5) per cent (160 of 1757). The FNR was related to nodal yield, ranging from 14 · 8 per cent for one node and declining to 9 · 7, 6 · 6, 4 · 7 and 4 · 1 per cent for two, three, four and more than four SLNs respectively. No learning curve was identified for localization or FNR. Conclusion The programme successfully trained {{a wide range of}} UK breast teams to perform safe SLNB and suggested that a standard injection protocol and structured multidisciplinary training can abolish learning curves...|$|R
40|$|Many {{economic}} and social networks share two common organizing features: (1) a core-periphery structure; (2) positive correlation between network centrality and payoffs. In this paper, we build a model of network formation where these features emerge endogenously. In our model, the unique equilibrium network architecture is a periphery-sponsored star. In this equilibrium, one player, the center, maintains no links and achieves a high payo¤, while all other players maintain a single link to the center and achieve lower payoffs. With heterogeneous groups, equilibrium networks are interconnected stars. We show that small minorities tend to integrate while large minorities are self-sufficient. Although any player can be the center in a static equilibrium, evolution selects the agent with most valuable resources as the center in the long run. In particular, even small inequalities in resources can lead to large payoff inequality because of the endogenous social structure.

In Experiment l, a group of rats was moved from individual to pair-housing (IP group) and compared to a group of individually-housed rats (IND group) and a group of chronically pair-housed rats (PAIR group). The animals in the IP group showed a temporary (three days) suppression in feeding (initially 23 %). When half of the IND and PAIR group animals were moved between individual- and pair-housing on alternate days (IND-ALT and PAIR-ALT groups, respectively) (Experiment 2), only the rats in the IND-ALT group showed a three day feeding suppression (initially 40 %). Experiment 3 examined the effect of the simultaneous <b>introduction</b> of wheels <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> of housing conditions. The feeding suppression induced by the transfer from individual- to pair-housing was evident prior to, and of a shorter duration than, the feeding suppression induced by wheel access.
