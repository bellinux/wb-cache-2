25|$|Once wasps {{emerge as}} mature adults, they spend the first 2–3 {{days on the}} nest doing very little. After the first 3 <b>idle</b> <b>days,</b> workers can be told from non-workers because workers stay on the nest longer. A wasp that leaves the nest for any reason {{immediately}} after those 3 days is considered a non-worker. Lifetime in the nest, then, seems directly dependent on ones role: queens lived an average of 61 days, workers lived about 31 days, non-workers survived for about 5 days, and males only survived about 4.8 days. This is considered evidence that the caste system determines the individual wasp’s life course. Note that these numbers are based entirely {{on the number of}} days that a wasp is seen in the nest. In some cases, including males, the wasps live the majority of their lives outside of the nest.|$|E
500|$|Lovecraft {{outlined}} the plot {{to his friend}} Rheinhart Kleiner in May 1920 and wrote The Cats of Ulthar on June 15, 1920, five months after completing his previous tale, The Terrible Old Man. Conceived during the author's early period, Lovecraft {{was influenced by the}} writing of Anglo-Irish writer Lord Dunsany and attempted to mimic his style. Among the literary aspects that Lovecraft borrows are the [...] "vengeance motif" [...] and the [...] "ponderous tone" [...] of Dunsany. Dunsany's influence is evident {{on the surface of the}} text as well: wanderers, similar to the ones portrayed in The Cats of Ulthar, appear in Dunsany's earlier tale <b>Idle</b> <b>Days</b> on the Yann. Lovecraft’s character of Menes shares his name with Menes, the semi-mythical founder of the ancient city of Memphis, Egypt. The ancient Egyptians were admirers of cats who made it a crime to kill or export felines.|$|E
500|$|... "Ode on Indolence" [...] {{comprises}} six stanzas containing ten lines each. The poem discusses {{a morning}} of laziness {{on the part}} of the narrator, during which his attention becomes captivated by three figures he sees in a vision. Beginning with an epitaph taken from Matthew 6:28, the poet introduces the theme of indolence through an excerpt of Jesus's suggestion that God provides for the lilies of the field without making them toil. The poem describes the three figures as wearing [...] "placid sandals" [...] and [...] "white robes", which alludes to the Grecian mythology that commonly appears in the 1819 odes. The images pass the narrator three times, which causes him to compare them to images on a spinning urn (line 7). In line 10, the narrator uses the word [...] "Phidian" [...] again as a reference to the Elgin marbles, whose creation was thought to have been overseen by Phidias, a Grecian artist. As the poem progresses, the narrator begins to discuss the intrusion upon his indolence by the figures of Love, Ambition, and Poesy, and he suggests that the images have come to [...] "steal away" [...] his <b>idle</b> <b>days.</b> In the final stanzas, the figure of Poesy is described as a daemon which Helen Vendler suggests poses a direct threat to the idleness the poet wishes to retain. In the final lines, the poet once again rejects the three images: [...] "Vanish, ye phantoms, from my idle spright, / Into the clouds, and never more return!" [...] (lines 39–40) with the intention of once again enjoying the laziness from which the poem obtains its title.|$|E

60|$|A week passed, {{and another}} Sunday came,--a Sunday so still and hot and moist that steam seemed {{to rise from}} the heavy trees,--an <b>idle</b> <b>day</b> for master and servant alike.

6000|$|He {{faced the}} future calmly, with open eyes. It would be rough going at first, very rough going. It meant hard work, incessant work. No more vague masterpieces which {{might or might}} not turn into [...] "Carmen" [...] or [...] "The Spanish Maiden."

No more dreams, seen hazily through the smoke of a cigar, as he lay on the couch and stared at the ceiling, of what he would do to-morrow. To-morrow must look after itself. His business was with the present and the work of the present.|$|E
6000|$|This gave me {{occasion}} to observe that, when men are employed, they are best contented; {{for on the}} days they worked they were good-natured and cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work, they spent the evening jollily; but on our <b>idle</b> <b>days</b> they were mutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in continual ill humor, which put me in mind of a sea captain, whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work; and, when his mate once told him that they had done everything, {{and there was nothing}} further to employ them about, [...] "Oh," [...] says he, [...] "make them scour the anchor." ...|$|E
60|$|As I have stated, the {{legislature}} authorized {{the governor to}} accept the services of ten additional regiments. I had charge of mustering these regiments into the State service. They were assembled at the most convenient railroad centres in their respective congressional districts. I detailed officers to muster in a portion of them, but mustered three {{in the southern part}} of the State myself. One of these was to assemble at Belleville, some eighteen miles south-east of St. Louis. When I got there I found that only one or two companies had arrived. There was no probability of the regiment coming together under five days. This gave me a few <b>idle</b> <b>days</b> which I concluded to spend in St. Louis.|$|E
60|$|He {{certainly}} was thus an entertaining companion {{to those who}} did not pay heed to truth, and liked to hear or laugh at great swelling words; and the Grevilles, on their <b>idle</b> <b>day,</b> were glad to have him with them, and were rather curious to prove how much fact there was in his boast of being a most admirable shot.|$|R

Simpson posted 79-75 for 307, while Brady tied Simpson with a final round 75. McDermott made a birdie on the final hole for 79 to join Simpson and Brady, forcing a three-way playoff. Sunday was an <b>idle</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
6000|$|At {{home the}} charm worked also. No more <b>idle</b> <b>days</b> for Nelly, or fretful ones for Will, because the little sister would not neglect the {{helpless}} creatures so dependent upon her, {{and the big}} brother was ashamed to complain after watching the patience of these lesser sufferers, and merrily said {{he would try to}} bear his own wound as quietly and bravely as the [...] "Commodore" [...] bore his. Nelly never knew how much good she had done Captain Will till he went away again in the early autumn. Then he thanked her for it, and though she cried for joy and sorrow she never forgot it, because he left something behind him which always pleasantly reminded her of the double success her little hospital had won.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, there {{occurred}} to me one other thing to be done. Remembering old Moodie, and his relationship with Priscilla, I determined to seek an interview, {{for the purpose of}} ascertaining whether the knot of affairs was as inextricable on that side as I found it on all others. Being tolerably well acquainted with the old man's haunts, I went, the next day, to the saloon of a certain establishment about which he often lurked. It was a reputable place enough, affording good entertainment in the way of meat, drink, and fumigation; and there, in my young and <b>idle</b> <b>days</b> and nights, when I was neither nice nor wise, I had often amused myself with watching the staid humors and sober jollities of the thirsty souls around me.|$|E
60|$|And here I must vindicate a {{claim to}} {{philosophical}} reflectiveness, by remarking that Mr. Brooke on this occasion little thought of the Radical speech which, at a later period, he was led to make on the incomes of the bishops. What elegant historian would neglect a striking opportunity for pointing out that his heroes did not foresee {{the history of the}} world, or even their own actions?--For example, that Henry of Navarre, when a Protestant baby, little thought of being a Catholic monarch; or that Alfred the Great, when he measured his laborious nights with burning candles, had no idea of future gentlemen measuring their <b>idle</b> <b>days</b> with watches. Here is a mine of truth, which, however vigorously it may be worked, is likely to outlast our coal.|$|E

If Harold went it was for the frolic, not for want of the dainty; and wrong as it was, his mother was grieving more at the thought of his casting away the restraint of his old habits than for the one action.

A bottle of French wine, three or four cutlets of goats' flesh, an omelet made out of the freshest eggs, and an enormous dish of oranges, was the banquet set before me; and though I might have found fault with it in Paris or London, I thought that it did well enough in Jaffa. My poor friend could not join me, but had {{a cup of coffee}} in his room. [...] "At any rate take a little brandy in it," [...] I said to him, as I stood over his bed. [...] "I could not swallow it," [...] said he, looking at me with almost beseeching eyes.

6000|$|Redclyffe {{returned}} {{through the}} quadrangle to the Warden's house; {{and there were}} the brethren, sitting on benches, loitering in the sun, which, though warm for England, seemed scarcely enough to keep these old people warm, even with their cloth robes. They did not seem unhappy; nor yet happy; if they were so, it must be with the mere bliss of existence, a sleepy sense of comfort, and quiet dreaminess about things past, leaving out the things to come,--of which there was nothing, indeed, in their future, save one day after another, just like this, with loaf and ale, and such substantial comforts, and prayers, and <b>idle</b> <b>days</b> again, gathering by the great kitchen fire, and at last a day when they should not be there, but some other old men in their stead. And Redclyffe wondered whether, in the extremity of age, he himself would like {{to be one of the}} brethren of the Leopard's Head. The old men, he was sorry to see, did not seem very genial towards one another; in fact, there appeared to be a secret enjoyment of one another's infirmities, wherefore it was hard to tell, unless that each individual might fancy himself to possess an advantage over his fellow, which he mistook for a positive strength; and so there was sometimes a sardonic smile, when, on rising from his seat, the rheumatism was a little evident in an old fellow's joints; or when the palsy shook another's fingers so that he could barely fill his pipe; or when a cough, the gathered spasmodic trouble of thirty years, fairly convulsed another. Then, any two that happened to be sitting near one another looked into each other's cold eyes, and whispered, or suggested merely by a look (for they were bright to such perceptions), [...] "The old fellow will not outlast another winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was the sum {{that brought}} about the only {{cleavage}} in our lives; and so, as he grew older, and trying to part from each other we no longer could, he ceased going to Scotland. But after that I often felt, and especially when we heard guns, how {{the best and most}} secret instincts of him were being stifled. But what was to be done? In that which was left of a clay pigeon he would take not the faintest interest--the scent of it was paltry. Yet always, even in his most cosseted and <b>idle</b> <b>days,</b> he managed to preserve the grave preoccupation of one professionally concerned with retrieving things that smell; and consoled himself with pastimes such as cricket, which he played in a manner highly specialised, following the ball up the moment it left the bowler's hand, and sometimes retrieving it before it reached the batsman. When remonstrated with, he would consider a little, hanging out a pink tongue and looking rather too eagerly at the ball, then canter slowly out to a sort of forward short leg. Why he always chose that particular position it is difficult to say; possibly he could lurk there better than anywhere else, the batsman's eye not being on him, and the bowler's not too much. As a fieldsman he was perfect, but for an occasional belief that he was not merely short leg, but slip, point, midoff, and wicket-keep; and perhaps a tendency to make the ball a little [...] "jubey." [...] But he worked tremendously, watching every movement; for he knew the game thoroughly, and seldom delayed it more than three minutes when he secured the ball. And if that ball were really lost, then indeed he took over the proceedings with an intensity and quiet vigour that destroyed many shrubs, and the solemn satisfaction which comes from being in the very centre of the stage.|$|E
