5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to <b>induction</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> usually an anthracycline.

5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if <b>induction</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E

Toxicities were greatly reduced from an incidence of grade 3 or greater dysphagia and mucositis of 54 and 53% respectively, to 9%.

25|$|But many HPV+OPC {{present with}} {{involvement}} of the lymph nodes in the neck, and hence a higher stage of disease, generally referred to as locally advanced disease. This group is mostly treated with multimodality therapy, {{with the exception of}} one of the more favourable subgroups with small primary tumours and lymph node involvement confined to a single node no larger than 3nbsp&cm in size, which as noted are considered early stage disease. The three main options for locally advanced but operable disease are resection, neck dissection and adjuvant therapy; chemoradiation (with possible salvage surgery); <b>induction</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> followed by radiation or chemoradiation. However the last option has not been supported in clinical trials that tested it. The primary consideration of surgery for locally advanced disease is to obtain adequate negative margins and spare the patient postoperative chemoradiation. But this must be balanced against the morbidity and functional loss from extensive resection, particularly where the tongue base is involved. To avoid such morbidity, primary chemoradiation is preferred. The management of disease within the cervical lymph nodes has to be taken into account in treating locally advanced disease. Guidelines for all OPC dictate that ectracapsular extension be given postoperative chemoradiation. Where gross neck disease is evident initially primary chemoradiation is usually given.|$|E
500|$|All FAB subtypes except M3 {{are usually}} given <b>induction</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> with {{cytarabine}} (ara-C) and an anthracycline (most often daunorubicin).

40|$|The {{majority}} of patients with head and neck cancer present with locally advanced disease. Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck (LA-SCCHN) poses one of the most complex management challenges. This stage of disease is still potentially curable, but requires combined-modality therapy. One of the novel approaches is the use of targeted agents, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, in treatment strategies in LA-SCCHN. A Medline search covering topics related to targeted therapies in head and neck cancer over the last two decades was made and the facts were compiled. Cetuximab was the first novel agent to obtain regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer HNSCC. Cetuximab has been evaluated in combination with radiotherapy, chemo-radiotherapy, and <b>induction</b> <b>chemotherapies,</b> and was found to increase the overall survival rates in all the arms without raising the toxicity level of the combined modality of treatment significantly. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors Gefinitib and Erlotinib also produced an average response rate of 11 % and 4 % in different studies and also prolonged the disease control rates when used with chemotherapy. This paper will review the role of targeted agents, particularly the EGFR inhibitors, in the present treatment strategies in advanced, recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer...|$|R

2500|$|As {{with the}} {{radiotherapy}} data, {{most of the}} available knowledge on the efficacy of chemotherapy derives from the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer rather than specific studies of HPV+OPC. Since 1976, many clinical studies have compared CRT to RT alone in the primary management of locally advanced head and neck cancers and have demonstrated an advantage to CRT in both survival and locoregional control. Cisplatin is considered the standard agent, and a survival advantage was seen for those patients who received radiation with concurrent cisplatin. Despite this no trials directly comparing cisplatin with other agents in this context have been conducted. The other agent that is widely used is Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A 10% survival advantage at three years was noted when cetuximab was given concurrently with radiation (bioradiation). Cetuximab trials were completed prior to knowledge of HPV status. The main toxicity is an acneiform rash, {{but it has not}} been compared directly to cisplatin in HPV+OPC, although RTOG 1016 is addressing this question. [...] Concurrent chemotherapy is also superior to chemotherapy alone (<b>induction</b> <b>chemotherapy)</b> followed by radiation. Cetuximab shows no advantage when added to cisplatin in combination with radiation. Although chemoradiation became a treatment standard based on clinical trials and in particular, meta-analyses, a subsequent population based study of patients with OPC, indicated no advantage to the addition of chemotherapy to radiation in either HPV+OPC or HPV-OPC, and significant concerns about added toxicity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn open-label, prospective, multicenter {{study was}} {{conducted}} between October 2006 and March 2010 to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous voriconazole (VRCZ) as empirical therapy for antibiotic-refractory febrile neutropenia in Japanese patients with hematological disorders. In addition, to find the patient groups that may benefit from antifungal therapy, the definition of invasive fungal infection proposed by EORTC/MSG (2002) was assessed in this study. Plasma (1 - 3) -β-d-glucan and Aspergillus PCR in blood were also measured to improve the diagnostic accuracy. A total of 103 patients (median age, 59 years), including 25 undergoing <b>induction</b> <b>chemotherapies</b> and 19 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants, were evaluable. Sixty-nine {{percent of the patients}} achieved resolution of clinical symptoms and 31 % achieved treatment success, defined as fulfilling the previously described five-part composite endpoint. Although VRCZ was discontinued in 9. 7 % of the patients because of adverse effects, all the patients recovered soon after discontinuation of VRCZ. The treatment success rate of VRCZ appeared to be higher in patients categorized as “not classified” compared with “possible invasive fungal disease” according to the EORTC/MSG criteria. Moreover, six “not classified” patients were positive for either plasma (1 - 3) -β-d-glucan (n= 5) or Aspergillus PCR in blood (n= 2). The present study demonstrates that empirical VRCZ therapy is safe and effective in Japanese patients. Additionally, (1 - 3) -β-d-glucan and Aspergillus PCR tests were expected to provide additional information on the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hyperuricemia {{is one of}} the oncologic {{emergency}} {{that occurs}} most often in patients with hematologic disorders particularly leukemia and high-grade lymphoma. This study was conducted {{in order to determine the}} prevalence of hyperuricemia with respect to prophylactic treatment (in particular allopurinol) in patients with lymphoproliferative disease in the pediatric hematologic ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 316 children (75 females, 241 males) under the age of 12 years participated. Among the subjects, 66 patients (20. 9 %) had lymphoma and 250 patients (79. 1 %) had leukemia. Results: Of the 56 (17. 7 %) patients diagnosed with hyperuricemia, 13 with lymphoma (19. 7 %) and 43 (17. 2 %) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 52 patients showed hyperuricemia after <b>induction</b> of <b>chemotherapy</b> (p< 0. 001). Hyperuricemia was more prevalent in patients with more advanced disease (50. 9 % in stage IV, p< 0. 001). Hyperuricemia was more frequent in male patients (p< 0. 001). Among the 217 patients who had received prophylaxis (hydration, alkalization, allopurinol), 19 (8. 7 %) subjects had hyperuricemia compare to 37. 3 % in the group of patients who did not receive prophylactic treatment (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: From the literature reviewed, a recombinant form of the urate oxidase enzyme (rasburicase) is a safe and effective alternative to allopurinol to rapidly control plasma uric acid concentrations in patients with hematologic malignancy at high risk for tumor lysis during <b>induction</b> of <b>chemotherapy.</b> In this respect, we recommend a prospective study to compare allopurinol and rasburicase in children with leukemia and lymphoma...|$|R

It was likely that the response to chemotherapy which reduced the tumours' sizes changed the minds of some patients, deciding that they could escape surgery.
