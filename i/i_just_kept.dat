5000|$|Even without eviction, some rise in rent was {{unavoidable}} in Brooklyn Heights, so Scioli {{looked for}} an affordable location to buy rather than rent, {{and found a}} building {{at the corner of}} Court Street and Warren Street in nearby Cobble Hill. The shop operated at that location from 1985 until its closing upon Scioli's retirement in 2016.

500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E

[...] Taylor made his NFL exhibition debut on August 8, 1981, recording 2 sacks in the Giants' 23–7 win over the Chicago Bears. Before the season word spread around the league about Taylor. Years after facing him in an exhibition game, Pittsburgh Steelers Quarterback Terry Bradshaw recalled, [...] "e dang-near killed me, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> saying, 'Who is this guy?'

[...] "When I was 12 years old I climbed my first mountain, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> going, taking on more diverse and grander projects." [...] Fossett {{said that he did}} not have a natural gift for athletics or team sports, so he focused on activities that required persistence and endurance. His father, an Eagle Scout, encouraged Fossett to pursue these types of adventures and encouraged him to become involved with the Boy Scouts early. He became an active member of Troop 170 in Orange, California. At age 13, Fossett earned the Boy Scouts' highest rank of Eagle Scout. He was a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow, the Boy Scouts' honor society, where he served as lodge chief. He also worked as a Ranger at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico during the summer of 1961. Fossett said in 2006 that Scouting was the most important activity of his youth.|$|E

However, the bad weather led to Davies writing in a scene featuring Edward in a wet shirt chopping logs in the rain, which rivalled the famous lake scene in Pride and Prejudice. Cooper told The Birmingham Post's Georgina Rodgers that the bad weather affected his first scene, in which Willoughby carries an injured Marianne home. He explained that the scene was shot on a vertical slope with a rain machine, as the natural rain does not show up on camera. His cloak also kept getting caught under his foot, which made picking up Wakefield even harder. Cooper added, [...] "I couldn't move and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> falling head over heels." [...] Wrotham Park served as the exterior to Norland, the Dashwood family's home. Ham House in Richmond was used for Norland's interior shots, while the grounds were used for exterior scenes. The National Trust was asked not to cut the grass for several weeks before filming began. Ham House also doubled for Cleveland. Loseley Park was chosen for the exterior shots of Sir John Middleton's home, Barton Park. The library doubled for Colonel Brandon's own, while the entrance was used for scenes featuring a gathering of guests for a day out. The Oak Room was also used for the scenes involving Marianne, after she falls sick. Other filming locations included Dorney Court, Hall Barn, Lincoln's Inn and Clovelly Pier.|$|E
500|$|Writer Brian K. Vaughan {{conceived}} Saga in his childhood, {{calling it}} [...] "a fictional universe that I created when I was bored in math class. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> building it." [...] He {{was inspired by}} such influences as Star Wars, Flash Gordon and children's books, and has also invoked the awe and wonder of first seeing the Silver Surfer, which seemed an [...] "incredible and different" [...] concept to him. It was not until his wife became pregnant with his second daughter, however, that he conceived of the protagonists, the winged Alana and the horned Marko, two lovers from warring extraterrestrial races who struggle to survive with their newborn daughter, Hazel, who occasionally narrates the series. It was also {{at this point that}} the central theme that Vaughan wanted for the book emerged. Vaughan explains, [...] "I wanted to write about parenthood, but I wanted to Trojan-horse it inside some sort of interesting genre story, to explore the overlap between artistic creation {{and the creation of a}} child." [...] Vaughan, who intended to return to writing a comics series following the 2010 conclusion of his previous series, Ex Machina, and who notes that the publication of Saga #1 coincided with the birth of his daughter, saw parallels between the caution advised by colleagues against launching a new book in the poor economy and those who cautioned against bringing a new child into the world, observing: ...|$|E

Lucas also stated that the story evolved over time and that [...] "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> telling myself I would make other movies someday."

The video features everyday {{people as well as}} several music artists including Michael Tait, Tammy Trent, Bob Herdman, and Jesse Katina, each holding an empty picture frame to signify their loss of a loved one; as the video progresses, they are holding pictures of their loved ones including Millard with his father's photograph.|$|R

Cuomo stated that initially the song [...] "started out as a really standard pop song called 'bad girl' and had a verse and a chorus and bridge and all that stuff. And I just wasn't satisfied with it. It was too normal. So one day I sat down with my acoustic guitar and I just played [...] song over and over, on basically looping it. My fingers hurt so much, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> playing it. And over the hour that I was playing it, the song slowly evolved and it smoothed over and the sections blurred into each other.

2500|$|Influenced by {{contemporaneous}} hits such as [...] "Come Back to Me (My Love)" [...] and [...] "Come Softly to Me", Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song {{in early}} 1960 which, using elements from [...] "Uptown", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers. It also featured a note hit by Orbison in falsetto that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, [...] "came not from his throat but deeper within". The song was [...] "Only the Lonely". Orbison and Melson tried {{to sell it to}} Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers but were turned down. They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy: building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background. This combination became Orbison's trademark sound. The single shot to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told Rolling Stone in 1988, [...] "I liked the sound of [...] I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> doing it.

We built it track by track in the studio, and we've never really done that before."
