40|$|Estimates of leaf gas-exchange {{characteristics}} using stan¬dard clamp-on leaf chambers {{are prone}} to errors because of diffusion leaks. While some consideration {{has been given to}} CO 2 diffusion leaks, potential water vapour diffusion leaks through chamber gaskets have been neglected. We esti¬mated diffusion leaks of two clamp-on Li-Cor LI- 6400 (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) leaf chambers with polymer foam gaskets and enclosing either 2 or 6 cm 2 leaf area, and conducted a sensitivity analysis of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>leak</b> effects on Farquhar et al. photosynthesis model parameters – the maximum carboxylase activity of ribulose 1 • 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Vcmax), capacity for photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax) and non¬photorespiratory respiration rate in light (Rd). In addition, net assimilation rate (An) versus intercellular CO 2 (Ci) responses were measured in leaves of Mediterranean ever¬green species Quercus ilex L. enclosing the whole leaf chamber in a polyvinyl ﬂuoride bag ﬂushed with the exhaust air of leaf chamber, thereby effectively reducing the CO 2 and water vapour gradients between ambient air and leaf chamber. For the empty chambers, average <b>diffusion</b> <b>leak</b> for CO 2, KCO 2, (molar ﬂow rate corresponding to unit CO 2 mole fraction difference) was ca. 0. 40 mmol s- 1. KCO 2 increased ca. 50 % if a dead leaf was clamped between the leaf chamber. Average <b>diffusion</b> <b>leak</b> for H 2 O was ca. 5 -to 10 -fold larger than the <b>diffusion</b> <b>leak</b> for CO 2. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the consequence of a CO 2 dif¬fusion leak was apparent enhancement of An at high CO 2 mole fraction and reduction at lower CO 2 mole fraction, and overall compression of Ci range. As the result of these modiﬁcations, Farquhar et al. model parameters were over¬estimated. The degree of overestimation increased in the order of Vcmax < Jmax < Rd, and was larger for smaller cham¬bers and for leaves with lower photosynthetic capacity, leading to overestimation of all three parameters by 70 – 290 % for 2 cm 2, and by 10 – 60 % for 6 cm 2 chamber. Sig¬niﬁcant diffusion corrections (5 – 36 %) were even required for leaves with high photosynthetic capacity measured in largest chamber. Water vapour diffusion leaks further enhanced the overestimation of model parameters. For small chambers and low photosynthetic capacities, apparent Ci was simulated to decrease with increasing An because of simultaneous CO 2 and H 2 O diffusion leaks. Measurements in low photosynthetic capacity Quercus ilex leaves enclosed in 2 cm 2 leaf chamber exhibited negative apparent Ci values at highest An. For the same leaves measured with the entire leaf chamber enclosed in the polyvinyl ﬂuoride bag, Ci and An increased monotonically. While the measurements without the bag could be corrected for diffusion leaks, the required correction in An and transpiration rates was 100 – 500 %, and there was large uncertainty in Farquhar et al. model parameters derived from ‘corrected’ An/Ci response curves because of uncertainties in true diffusion leaks. These data demonstrate that both CO 2 and water vapour diffusion leaks need consideration in measurements with clamp-on leaf cuvettes. As plants in natural environments are often characterized by low photosynthetic capacities, cuvette designs need to be improved for reliable measure¬ments in such species. JRC.

40|$|The {{energetics}} {{of neutral}} and branched chain amino acid transport by membrane vesicles from Streptococcus cremoris {{have been studied}} with a novel model system in which beef heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase functions as a proton-motive force (Δp) generating system. In the presence of reduced cytochrome c, a large Δp was generated with a maximum value at pH 6. 0. Apparent H+/amino acid stoichiometries (napp) have been determined at external pH values between 5. 5 and 8. 0 from the steady state levels of accumulation and the Δp. For L-leucine napp (0. 8) was nearly independent of the pH. For L-alanine and L-serine napp decreased from 0. 9 - 1. 0 at pH 5. 5 to 0 - 0. 2 at pH 8. 0. The napp for the different amino acids decreased with increasing external amino acid concentration. At pH 6. 0, first order rate constants for amino acid exit (kex) under steady state conditions for L-leucine, L-alanine, and L-serine were 1. 1 - 1. 3, 0. 084, and 0. 053 min- 1, respectively. From the pH dependence of kex it is concluded that amino acid exit in steady state {{is the sum of}} two processes, pH-dependent carrier-mediated amino acid exit and pH-independent passive <b>diffusion</b> (external <b>leak).</b> The first order rate constant for passive diffusion increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the side chain of the amino acids. As a result of these processes the kinetic steady state attained is less than the amino acid accumulation ratio predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium. The napp determined from the steady state accumulation represents, therefore, a lower limit. It is concluded that the mechanistic stoichiometry (n) for L-leucine, L-alanine, and L-serine transport most likely equals 1. ...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{unidirectional}} [14 C]urea efflux {{from human}} red cells was determined in the self-exchange and net efflux modes with the continuous flow tube method. Self-exchange flux was saturable and followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At 38 degrees C the maximal self-exchange flux was 1. 3 X 10 (- 7) mol cm- 2 s- 1, and the urea concentration for half-maximal flux, K 1 / 2, was 396 mM. At 25 degrees C the maximal self-exchange flux decreased to 8. 2 X 10 (- 8) mol cm- 2 s- 1, and K 1 / 2 to 334 mM. The concentration-dependent urea permeability coefficient was 3 X 10 (- 4) cm s- 1 at 1 mM and 8 X 10 (- 5) cm s- 1 at 800 mM (25 degrees C). The latter value is consonant with previous volumetric determinations of urea permeability. Urea transport was inhibited competitively by thiourea; the half-inhibition constant, Ki, was 17 mM at 38 degrees C and 13 mM at 25 degrees C. Treatment with 1 mM p-chloromercuribenzosulfonate inhibited urea permeability by 92 %. Phloretin reduced urea permeability further (greater than 97 %) to a "ground" permeability of approximately 10 (- 6) cm s- 1 (25 degrees C). This residual permeability is {{probably due to}} urea permeating the hydrophobic core of the membrane by simple diffusion. The apparent activation energy, EA, of urea transport after maximal inhibition was 59 kJ mol- 1, whereas in control cells EA was 34 kJ mol- 1 at 1 M and 12 kJ mol- 1 at 1 mM urea. In net efflux experiments with no extracellular urea, the permeability coefficient remained constantly high, independent of a variation of intracellular urea between 1 and 500 mM, which indicates that the urea transport system is asymmetric. It is concluded that urea permeability above the ground permeability is due to facilitate diffusion and not to <b>diffusion</b> through nonspecific <b>leak</b> pathways as suggested previously...|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. 's (CHG) {{closure of the}} Hanford Site Single-Shell Tank (SST) Waste Management Area (WMA) tank farms, {{numerical}} simulations of flow and solute transport were executed to investigate different potential contaminant source scenarios that may pose long-term risks to groundwater from {{the closure of the}} C Tank Farm. These simulations were based on the initial assessment effort (Zhang et al., 2003), but implemented a revised approach that examined a range of key parameters and multiple base cases. Four different potential source types were identified to represent the four base cases, and included past <b>leaks,</b> <b>diffusion</b> releases from residual wastes, leaks during retrieval, and ancillary equipment sources. Using a two-dimensional cross section through the C Tank Farm (Tanks C- 103 –C- 112) and a unit release from Tank C- 112, two solutes (uranium- 238 (U- 238) and technetium- 99 (Tc 99)) were transported through the problem domain. To evaluate the effect of sorption on contaminant transport, seven different sorption coefficients were simulated for U 238. Apart from differences in source releases, all four base cases utilized the same median parameter values to describe flow and contaminant transport at the WMA C. Forty-six additional cases were also run that examined individual transport responses to the upper and lower limits of the median parameter values implemented in the base case systems. For the conservative solute, Tc- 99, results amongst the base cases showed that the simulations investigating past leaks demonstrated the highest peak concentrations and the earliest arrival times (48 years) due to the proximity of the plume to the water table and the high recharge rate before surface barriers were installed. Simulations investigating leaks during retrieval predicted peak concentrations ~ 60 times smaller than the past leak cases, and corresponding arrival times that occurred ~ 70 years later. The diffusion release base case predicted the lowest peak concentrations and arrival times for all solutes. Even after 10, 000 years of simulation, only 11. 2 % of the Tc- 99 mass migrated past the fence line compliance point in the groundwater. Although ancillary equipment cases released the contaminant at a similar depth as the diffusion cases, nearly all of the Tc- 99 (99. 0 %) exited the groundwater domain {{by the end of the}} simulation due to differences in release rates. These differences were also reflected in the peak arrival times, which were ~ 8, 500 years for the diffusion base case, and ~ 3, 700 years for the base ancillary equipment release. In the diffusion cases, peak concentration predictions were sensitive to the rate of diffusion, but had no impact on the peak concentration arrival times. The average peak concentration was ~ 3. 2 times higher than the base case value for the upper estimate of diffusion, and 3. 2  10 - 3 lower for the lower bounding estimate. The past leak, ancillary equipment and retrieval leak cases were sensitive to the estimate of the pre-barrier installment recharge rate. For example, on average for the past leaks, relative concentrations increased by ~ 2. 2 times for the upper recharge estimate, and decreased by ~ 0. 14 times for the lower bound. Faster arrival times were associated with the upper recharge estimate, and slower arrival times with the lower estimate. Similar trends in both predicted peaks and arrival times occurred for the ancillary equipment and retrieval leaks scenarios that investigated the uncertainty in the pre-barrier installment recharge rate. Uncertainty in the plume depth also impacted predicted peak concentrations and arrival times for the past leak scenario. Trends similar to the pre-barrier installment recharge rate resulted, with higher concentrations and earlier breakthroughs associated with a lower plume depth, and lower concentrations and later breakthroughs with a higher plume depth...|$|R
