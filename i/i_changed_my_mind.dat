500|$|Reagan {{reflected}} on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography, My Turn. She described lunching with former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert S. Strauss, wherein Strauss said to her, [...] "When you first came to town, Nancy, I didn't like you at all. But after I got to know you, <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and said, 'She's some broad!'" [...] Reagan responded, [...] "Bob, based on the press reports I read then, I wouldn't have liked me either!" ...|$|E
500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{was no need}} {{to think}} long, uncle. I know of nothing to make me vacillate. If <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> it must be because of {{something}} important and entirely new to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That second {{glass of}} punch did it, Bastow. It {{is a fine}} morning; we shall have a brisk drive back. I am very glad that <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and brought the gig instead of the close carriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Bellamy," [...] he said, turning {{abruptly}} round, [...] "supposing <b>I</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> supposing <b>I</b> {{open this}} precious document {{and let you}} read it over with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ashley, laughing: [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind?</b> One talks better." [...] He {{lights a}} cigarette. [...] "And, Miss Ramsey, I believe I {{will have a}} cocktail, after all." ...|$|R

60|$|What reports {{could he}} mean? No--I could get no {{more out of}} him; he was too {{cautious}} to commit himself, {{and seemed to be}} satisfied by observing that if <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> I could at any time leave my nephews.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to do that, but then <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and put 'em in a couple of boxes. I thought maybe I might have a chance to train 'em--just like those mice we once saw in a show." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is a third}} connection," [...] he said hoarsely. [...] "Do you {{remember}} that a man called to see me, whom I declined to admit, {{on the night of}} your first visit here? When <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> he had disappeared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good," [...] I said, after a moment's reflection. [...] "If I {{stick to}} my fancy for {{flying into the}} candle, you will see me there. If <b>I</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> it won't matter much to either of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, of course, that I {{was once}} engaged to Miles Lesley. You {{also know that}} that {{engagement}} was broken last autumn for unexplained reasons.

5000|$|Dvir {{reflected}} on the film years later {{in an article in}} the Centre Daily Times: [...] "As a documentary filmmaker, <b>I</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> about societal issues related to my projects much like kids experience growth — I only notice it months, sometimes years, later. Directing and producing “Jessie’s Dad" ... altered my point of view on mandatory sentencing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes," [...] Gaites {{partially}} admitted. [...] "I did {{intend to}} stay over at Middlemount when I left the express there, but <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> {{and decided to}} go on. It's very {{good of you to}} let me come with you." ...|$|E
60|$|ANNA--I went ashore {{to get a}} {{train for}} New York. I'd been waiting and waiting 'till I was sick of it. Then <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and {{decided not to go}} to-day. But I'm going first thing to-morrow, so it'll all be the same in the end.|$|E
60|$|We now {{prepared}} for a considerable walk--from Lucerne to Interlaken, over the Bruenig Pass. But {{at the last moment}} the weather was so good that <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and hired a four-horse carriage. It was a huge vehicle, roomy, as easy in its motion as a palanquin, and exceedingly comfortable.|$|E

60|$|Girls are charming creatures. I {{shall have}} to be twice seventy years old before <b>I</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> as to that. I am {{to talk to a}} crowd of them this afternoon, {{students}} of Barnard College (the sex's annex to Columbia University), and I think I shall have as pleasant a time with those lasses as I had with the Vassar girls twenty-one years ago.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> {{about calling}} at the Milan that morning, but toward five {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} I presented myself there, and gave the hall-porter my card to send up to Miss Delora. He received me with some surprise, but I explained that I had been obliged to postpone my visit into the country.|$|E
60|$|Above {{the spindle}} {{we began to}} see {{sailfish}} jumping everywhere. One leaped thirteen times, and another nineteen. Many of them came out sidewise, with a long, sliding plunge, which action at first I took to be that made by a feeding fish. After a while, however, and upon closer view, <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> about this.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{the end of}} it was that, like a fool, I {{accepted}} Stephen's {{advice and}} did nothing, always the easiest course and generally that which leads to most trouble. Ten minutes afterwards <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> but then it was too late; the Crocodile was out of signalling distance. This was subsequent to a conversation with Hans.|$|E
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [Stopping.] In {{the present}} case, on {{a matter of}} {{practical}} politics, <b>I</b> have <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> That is all.|$|R

I had rather win her and die, than live rich and safe without her to old age. The more she hates and scorns me, the more I love her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again I laughed {{thinking}} that Bes was jesting {{according to his}} fashion. But when that night, chancing to go round {{the corner of the}} house, I came upon him with a circlet of feathers round his head and his big bow in his hand, addressing three great black men who knelt before him as though he were a god, <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> As I withdrew he caught sight of me and said, ...|$|E
60|$|When, however, I saw {{indications}} {{rather than}} traces {{that someone had}} already used it to camp in, <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> and thought that whenever I should get an opportunity I would tell the Vladika of it, as {{he is a man}} on whose discretion I can rely. If we ever have a war here or any sort of invasion, it is just such places that may be dangerous. Even in my own case it is much too near the Castle to be neglected.|$|E
60|$|My first impulse, on glancing through Mr. Marx's brief note, {{was to show}} it to Mr. Ravenor; but, after a second's consideration, <b>I</b> <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> Mr. Marx was a {{complete}} mystery to me. At times it seemed possible that the interest which he undoubtedly showed in me was genuine and kindly, and I struggled against my dislike of the man. Then I remembered his brutal conduct to the lunatic and the other inexplicable parts of his behaviour, and the darkest suspicions and doubts began to take shape in my imagination.|$|E
6000|$|... "I merely {{set that}} as a {{probable}} date. <b>I</b> have <b>changed</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> There is no immediate necessity. Do you wish me to go?" [...] he demanded.|$|R
60|$|Surely {{the receipt}} of my brother's letter was {{sufficient}} answer for you. After that you must have guessed there was no likelihood that <b>I</b> should <b>change</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
5000|$|James Pethokoukis, the [...] "money and {{politics}} blogger" [...] for U.S. News & World Report online, referring to 2008 presidential candidate John McCain, {{noted that in}} changing a position a candidate can [...] "trot out that famous John Maynard Keynes line, 'When the facts <b>change,</b> <b>I</b> <b>change</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> What do you do, sir?'"
