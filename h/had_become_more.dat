5|$|Unfortunately {{during the}} initial {{preparations}} for 2015 event it was realized that the Little Wittenham site was no longer suitable. The reason given was that the logistics <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> difficult over the previous few years, as the event <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> popular {{and the use of}} the land had changed. This was announced by the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires on 7 January 2015.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being {{done at the}} same point in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|During Tiberius' reign Jews <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> {{prominent}} in Rome and Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began proselytizing Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments. Tiberius in 19 AD ordered Jews who were of military age {{to join the}} Roman Army. Tiberius banished {{the rest of the}} Jews from Rome and threatened to enslave them for life if they did not leave the city.|$|E

50|$|Scouting {{organizations}} {{are free to}} interpret the method as laid down by the founder.

5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also {{played a central role in}} a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the sack}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the office's {{continuity}} was broken, {{and when it}} reappears in {{the sources of the}} Palaiologan period, it had lost any judicial functions and resembled more its original military character: according to the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch was a subordinate of the Grand Domestic, charged with the night watch and with supervising the army's scouts. In reality, however, it <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> of a sinecure and was essentially a court dignity devoid of any but ceremonial duties.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{acknowledgement}} on {{the national}} level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} whether the NSW Higher and Local Courts <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> lenient across {{a range of}} offence categories. Method: Examination of trends from 1994 to 2013 in bail outcomes, the use of imprisonment as a sanction for convicted offenders, and average length of prison sentence imposed for convicted offenders. Results: The NSW criminal courts <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> restrictive in the granting of bail; have increased their use of imprisonment for convicted offenders; and have lengthened average prison sentences across many offence types in the past two decades. Conclusion: There {{is no evidence that the}} NSW criminal courts <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> lenient overall in the past two decades; on the contrary, sentencing <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> severe in many offence categories...|$|R

5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the Second World War (1939–1945) the British wanted to reduce growth of Egyptian {{influence}} in Sudan, which <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> likely {{as a result}} of the 1936 treaty, while also suppressing the ultra-nationalist neo-Mahdist movement. They gave their support to Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani of the Khatmiyyah sect as a counterpoise to Sayyid Abd al-Rahman. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman responded by telling the British that Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani was pro-Italian due to his family commitments in Eritrea, but this was not accepted by the British.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{languages}} {{existed in the}} multi-ethnic Empire, {{and some of these}} were given limited official status in their provinces at various times. Notably, {{by the beginning of the}} Middle Ages, Syriac <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> widely used by the educated classes in the far eastern provinces. Similarly Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian became significant among the educated in their provinces, and later foreign contacts made Old Church Slavic, Middle Persian, and Arabic important in the Empire and its sphere of influence.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He {{returned}} to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. At Williams, he <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career. In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1861.|$|E
5|$|The Bonville–Courtenay feud of 1455 engendered {{a series}} of raids, sieges, and attacks between two major Devon families, the Courtenays and the Bonvilles, in south west England, in the mid-fifteenth century. One of many such aristocratic feuds of the time, it became entwined with {{national}} politics due to the political weight of the protagonists. The Courtenay earls of Devon were the traditional powerbrokers in the region, but by this time a local baronial family, the Bonvilles, <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> powerful and rivalled the Courtenays for royal patronage. Eventually this rivalry spilled over into physical violence, including social disorder, murder and siege.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of NY205 transformed the road {{into the main}} north–south connection between West Oneonta and Oaksville. At the same time, the parallel Southern New York Railroad had become unprofitable as the highways running alongside the track <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> appealing to shippers and travelers than the railroad itself. In 1940, the railroad abandoned the section of its line between West Oneonta and Jordanville, Herkimer County. The track ran alongside state routes {{for most of its}} length, and the presence of NY205 and NY167 was noted as a contributing factor to the line's demise in the railroad's abandonment petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission.|$|E

5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised {{as one of the}} parliament's most gifted and articulate members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for severe depression if government finances were not turned around dramatically.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{originally}} place {{heavy emphasis on}} ethical issues, it did see the family as the cornerstone of society. By 1994, it <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put {{in the context of}} a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E
5|$|Blaine’s {{earliest}} expressions in {{the foreign}} policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, {{but by the end}} of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> moderate and nuanced. A dispute over seal hunting in the waters off Alaska was the cause of Blaine’s first interaction with Britain as Harrison’s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban seal hunting in Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations with Britain and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, but the result was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.|$|E

5|$|By {{the eighth}} game, the {{competition}} <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> than {{a battle for}} hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as a battle between contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success in sport was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to allow students to watch the game on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5–3, and Soviet officials stated they would claim the overall victory if the game ended in a draw {{as a result of}} scoring more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied in the third period to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E
5|$|During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Suslov, {{along with}} Anastas Mikoyan, {{operated}} {{in close proximity}} to Budapest in order to direct the activities of the Soviet troops and to lend assistance to the new Hungarian leadership. Suslov and Mikoyan attended the Politburo meeting of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party which elected János Kádár to the General Secretaryship. In a telegram to the Soviet leadership, Suslov and Mikoyan acknowledged that the situation <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> dire, but both were content with the dismissal of Ernő Gerő as General Secretary and the choice of Kádár as his successor. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet criticised Suslov's and Mikoyan's concessions to the new revolutionary government in the People's Republic of Hungary. Despite his initial reservations, Suslov eventually supported the Presidium's decision to intervene in Hungary militarily and replace the counterrevolutionary government's leadership there.|$|E
