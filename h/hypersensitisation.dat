50|$|In 2014, the {{adaptive}} value of sensitisation due to injury {{was tested using}} the predatory interactions between longfin inshore squid and black sea bass (Centropristis striata) which are natural predators of this squid. If injured squid are targeted by a bass, they began their defensive behaviours sooner (indicated by greater alert distances and longer flight initiation distances) than uninjured squid. If anaesthetic (1% ethanol and MgCl2) is administered prior to the injury, this prevents the nociceptive <b>hypersensitisation</b> and blocks the effect. This study has wide implications because both long-term sensitisation and pain are often considered to be maladaptive rather than adaptive; the authors claim {{this study is the}} first evidence to support the argument that nociceptive sensitisation is actually an adaptive response to injuries.|$|E

40|$|Kodak Technical Pan (Tech Pan) {{emulsion}} is {{an extremely}} fine grained, high resolution, pan chromatic negative film with extended red sensitivity. It has been produced under this name since about 1980 (Kodak P- 255, 1981) and is available on Kodak’s Estar base {{in a number of}} thicknesses and sizes. The thick **base Tech Pan is designated 4415 and has been used with great success by the amateur astronomical community for many years (e. g. Martys 1991). Its astronomical potential was recognised early by Everhart (1981). However, tests at professional telescopes (e. g. West et al. 1981) and early sensitometer tests at the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) in 1981 and 1987 were discontinued when the glass and film samples did not respond well to normal <b>hypersensitisation</b> techniques. These and other difficulties led to a lack of interest among the professional astronomical community until quite recently (Russell et al. 1992; Parker & Malin 1992). The first successful use of 14 x 14 inch hypered Tech-Pan 4415 film in the UKST was in March 1991. Films were obtained which exhibited excellent image quality and resolution. Furthermore, in good seeing these appeared to be about 1 magnitude deeper than the equivalent IIIa-F emulsion on glass but with considerably lower grain noise. This result was achieved because two main problems associated with Tech-Pan and film use in the UKST have been resolved. These were: 1 obtaining Tech-Pan film with long exposure speed sufficient for deep astronomical photography (i. e. reduction of low intenstiy reciprocity failure); 2 overcoming the practical difficulties of mounting large-format flexible film at the UKST’s curved focal surface...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{instability}} underlies various diseases including cancer. The {{maintenance of}} genomic stability requires accurate replication of the genome, proper segregation of duplicated DNA to progeny cells, {{and the capacity}} to respond effectively to DNA damage. Early sections of this thesis focus on the response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within compact regions of chromatin (heterochromatin). Here, methodology was optimised for monitoring the repair of site-specific DSBs within regions likely to be enriched for heterochromatin. This system was exploited to examine the function of the Artemis endonuclease in heterochromatic DSB repair. Later sections focus on factors involved in DNA replication and the response to replication stress. Among the various mechanisms involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) to replication stress, the licensing of excess origins of replication has been proposed to safeguard against replication failure. Here, the impact of diminished origin licensing capacity on the response to replication stress was compared in tumour and non-tumour cell lines. I present findings demonstrating that depletion of origin licensing factors causes <b>hypersensitisation</b> of tumour-derived but not non-tumour cell lines to replication stress-inducing agents. Further, combining diminished origin licensing capacity with depletion of the tumour suppressor, p 53, or overexpression of the c-Myc oncogene impairs viability under conditions of replication stress in non-tumour fibroblasts. These findings suggest that tumour cells have a greater reliance on origin licensing capacity, raising the possibility that licensing factors might represent suitable targets for drugbased cancer therapy. Factors involved in replication origin licensing have also been implicated in the establishment of heterochromatin. Here, I examined higher-order chromatin structure and the ionizing radiation (IR) -induced DDR in cells from patients harbouring mutations in origin licensing factors. Findings from these studies provide evidence {{for the first time that}} origin licensing complex (ORC) -deficient Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (MGS) may be classified as a disordered chromatin syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns neurophysiology and pharmacology of the oesophageal afferent pathways involved in oesophago-pharyngeal reflexes and oesophageal nociception. Disturbances of reflexes governing contractile and relaxation responses of the upper oesophageal sphincter (DOS) {{are likely to be}} implicated in the pathophysiology of conditions involving excessive oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation, impaired oesophageal clearance, and an abnormal belch reflex. Visceral hypersensitivity, a heightened perception of gastrointestinal sensation is frequently observed in functional gastrointestinal disorders and provides compelling evidence that it {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of functional heartburn and non-erosive reflux disease. The work in this thesis explores the neurophysiology, pharmacology and pathophysiology of oesophago-DOS reflexes in humans by experimentally inducing DOS relaxations in healthy controls and patients with reflux laryngitis, and by recording DOS motor responses during spontaneous oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation. Nociception was assessed by measuring oesophageal sensitivity to electrical stimulation and oesophageal acid perfusion in healthy controls, which was then compared with several heartburn populations (functional heartburn, erosive and non-erosive reflux disease). Additional studies were performed to evaluate the potential role of intraluminal impedance in defining antegrade bolus flow through the pharyngo-oesophageal segment during swallowing as a prelude to the adaptation of the technique to find a more accurate method for the detection of oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation. The main findings from this work are as follows. 1) Mucosal lignocaine-sensitive afferents mediate the distension-induced oesophago-DOS relaxation reflex and lignocaine insensitive, presumably muscular mechanoceptors, mediate the distension-induced oesophago-DOS contractile reflex. The latter reflex is also upregulated by oesophageal acidification indicative of a possible protective mechanism. 2) Prolonged studies in patients with proven oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation demonstrated that the most common mechanism of oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation is a transient, non-swallow related, relaxation of the DOS. 3) Experimental evaluation of the oesophago-DOS relaxation reflex revealed that it is upregulated in patients with reflux laryngitis, suggesting that the aberrant afferent signalling in the oesophagus may be a contributory factor mediating oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation. 4) Measurement of oesophageal sensory thresholds in response to electrical stimulation and acid perfusion revealed that all patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of mucosal injury, exhibit acid-induced <b>hypersensitisation.</b> 5) The viscro-somatic referral pattern of acid- and electrically-induced chest pain is increased in patients with functional heartburn and non-erosive reflux disease. These findings support the hypothesis that central sensitisation of nociceptive pathways may contribute to symptom reporting in these heartburn populations...|$|E
