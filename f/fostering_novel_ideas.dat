40|$|EWAS. 06, {{the third}} European Workshop on Aspects in Software, follows the {{tradition}} of its two predecessor workshop series organized independently by the German “Gesellschaft für Informatik”, Belgian and Dutch research groups. It focuses on providing AOSD researchers and practitioners with an interactive forum for <b>fostering</b> <b>novel</b> <b>ideas</b> and turning submitted material into conference-ready papers. Improving submitted papers is emphasized by highly interactive “writer's workshop ” sessions {{that are designed to}} give authors constructive feedback regarding their paper's content and presentation. In addition, the EWAS reviewers are typically asked not to confine their comments to criticizing weaknesses but to provide their opinion also on the strengths of a paper and to give advice on how to improve it. This requires more time and consideration than other review formats and therefore EWAS would not be possible without the commitment of many expert reviewers. We are deeply thankful to all the program committee members for the time and effort they put again into their thoughtful reviews. After EWAS 2005 two of the discussed papers were revised, submitted to the AOSD' 06 conference and accepted for the main technical programme. We believe this is a good indication of the usefulness of the EWAS format. The EWAS. 06 programme contains four full papers (included in these proceedings), a tool demonstration (abstract included) and two “early papers ” that where considered worth discussing at the workshop but not yet mature enough for inclusion in the proceedings. The early papers are available at the EWAS. 06 websit...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} the relationships between the molecular structure of wool fibers and their "end-use " macroscopical properties, such as flexibility and elasticity, is needed to <b>foster</b> <b>novel</b> <b>ideas</b> for synthesis of new fibers with the properties that are similar or better than those of natural fibers. Among the objectives of this project is the elucidation {{of the structure of the}} major components of the cortex of wool fibers, the matrix phase and the intermediate filaments, as well as the elucidation of how these two phases are linked together to form a fiber. Polypeptide models of the matrix phase of wool were studied by high resolution liquid state 1 H NMR, and intact wool fibers swollen in water and D 2 O were studied by relaxation 1 H and 2 H NMR which is often performed in solid state. A network structure of the matrix phase was modeled by polypeptide systems containing fragments of high sulfur (HS) proteins from wool with Cys-residues oxidized in pairs to form a network. The oxidation of three- and four-Cys-residue peptide models of the matrix has been monitored by 2 D 1 H NMR. Two peptides, TCLQTSGCETGCG and ICSSVGTCGSSCGQPTCS, which do not contain the characteristic dipeptide and the pentapeptide repats, have been assigned in the initial reduced state, and then analyzed in the oxidized state. The results of these studies suggest that Cysresidue...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{conferences}} {{are more}} impactful when they <b>foster</b> <b>novel</b> <b>ideas,</b> create new networks, and promote inter-disciplinary collaboration. The field of conservation physiology is inherently cross-disciplinary, representing {{the application of}} physiological techniques and knowledge to address conservation issues. Ideally, knowledge transfer comes from both directions: conservation biologists seek input on physiological techniques that {{can contribute to the}} success of their programs, and physiologists collaborate with conservation biologists to plan relevant applications for their work. To assess whether the level of integration between conservation and physiology has been increasing since the formal naming of the discipline of conservation physiology in 2006, we reviewed abstracts from conferences of three societies: Society for Conservation Biology (SCB), Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB), and Society for Experimental Biology (SEB). Specifically, we searched for physiology-related keywords in abstracts from SCB meetings, and for conservation-related keywords in abstracts from SICB and SEB. Our results indicate that the percentage of presentations incorporating physiology at conservation meetings has remained relatively steady (2 – 3 %). In contrast, the percentage of presentations citing conservation applications has been rising at both of the integrative biology societies’ meetings and has reached 4. 4 and 7. 9 % at SICB and SEB, respectively. We provide suggestions for why there may be discrepancies between conference types and ways to encourage the presence of physiological topics at future conservation meetings...|$|R

40|$|Employees in {{organizations}} {{often have to}} generate novel products, services, and even entire business ideas that will appeal to others. One seemingly prudent way to gauge what others will like is by attempting to take their perspective, and thus {{look at the world}} from their point of view. However, in this paper, I argue that taking another person's perspective seems to have detrimental rather than beneficial effects on <b>novel</b> <b>idea</b> generation. I demonstrate in two studies that taking the perspective of someone of the other gender decreases the novelty of the ideas generated for that gender (Study 1), and that this effect holds, even under counter-stereotypical conditions, which are generally conducive to <b>novel</b> <b>idea</b> generation (Study 2). Additionally, even when taking a creative person's perspective (same or other gender), <b>novel</b> <b>idea</b> generation is stifled (Study 3). Last, it seems that this effect is due to the cooperative mindset that is activated by perspective-taking because a competitive mindset was able to mitigate the stifling effects of perspective-taking on novelty (Study 4). Since perspective-taking tends to occur more often in cooperative, rather than competitive, situations in naturalistic settings, I conclude that taking another person's perspective might most often be detrimental to <b>novel</b> <b>idea</b> generation. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R
