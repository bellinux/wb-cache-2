5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not <b>going</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E

According to Harry Walters, an anthropologist and former chairman of the Center for Diné Studies at Diné College in , the incident demonstrates a crucial difference between Navajo and Western culture in the way visions and supernatural experiences are handled: [...] "Rather than focus on the sightings to determine if who saw it was nuts or not – that's what a Westerner would do – we {{look at it as a}} message: 'Are we <b>going</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we should?

2500|$|By 1899, {{the stream}} of gold-seekers had diminished and Skagway's economy began to collapse. By 1900, when the {{railroad}} was completed, the gold rush was nearly over. In 1900, Skagway was incorporated as the first city in the Alaska Territory. [...] Much {{of the history of}} Skagway was saved by early residents, such as Martin Itjen, who ran a tour bus around the historical town. [...] He was responsible for saving and maintaining the gold rush cemetery from complete loss. He purchased Soapy Smith's saloon (Jeff Smith's Parlor), from <b>going</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the wrecking ball, and placed many early artifacts of the city's early history inside and opened Skagway's first museum.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{perspective}} {{was offered}} at the Kansas City, Missouri vigil {{where many of the}} attendees had previously taken part in protests of the Vietnam War, the only other United States war that has had more than five years of protests.

[...] He {{went on to say that}} he felt some didn't feel the war was wrong to begin with but they now feel the war is wrong.

2500|$|Only one {{assembly}} {{could operate}} {{at any given}} point in time, and any session already underway could be dissolved if a magistrate [...] "called away" [...] (avocare) the electors. In addition to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. They were available to help resolve procedural disputes, {{and to provide a}} mechanism through which electors could appeal decisions of the presiding magistrate. There were also religious officials (known as Augurs) either in attendance or on-call, who would be available to help interpret any signs from the Gods (omens), since the Romans believed that their gods let their approval or disapproval with proposed actions be known. In addition, a preliminary search for omens (auspices) was conducted by the presiding magistrate the night before any meeting. On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not <b>going</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they wanted.|$|E
2500|$|Before an SEC record 83,221 fans the Tigers {{get off to}} a slow start, {{leading by}} six points at halftime. [...] "There wasn't panic or anything," [...] said Johnny Robinson. [...] "There was, maybe, a little sense of {{apprehension}} because things weren't <b>going</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they were drawn up. There was an uneasy feeling that we'd better start getting things together—and quickly." [...] Soon after the third quarter began, Fugler intercepted a pass from Richie Petitbon and returned it to the Tulane 30-yard line. From here the Tigers took complete control of the game. Rabb scored on a quarterback keep, and later rushing touchdowns by Robinson and Cannon made the score 27–0 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. The fourth quarter saw LSU take advantage of Tulane's lack of roster depth with multiple long plays. The first was a 55-yard pass from Matherne to Purvis for a touchdown. Later, Robinson returned a punt 47 yards to the goal line, where Cannon ran it in. The final score of the game was a 45-yard touchdown run by Cannon.|$|E
2500|$|Liverpool's first trophy of {{the season}} came in the Football League Cup Final. After {{replacing}} Steven Gerrard as a 78th minute substitute, McAllister scored the team's opening penalty kick in a 5–4 shootout win over Birmingham City. He again came on as a substitute in the FA Cup Final, as Liverpool came from behind to win 21 against Arsenal. Four days later, he was named in the starting line-up in the UEFA Cup Final against Deportivo Alavés in Dortmund. McAllister scored one, and {{had a hand in}} three, of the five Liverpool goals in a memorable 5–4 victory. In the 117th minute, McAllister's free-kick was deflected by Alaves' Delfi Geli into his own net for the winning golden goal.
