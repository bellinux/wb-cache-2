40|$|Mucosal histology, {{crypt cell}} {{proliferation}} and brush border enzymes were measured in rats {{with varying degrees}} of jejunoileal bypass, in order to compare the effect of systemic and luminal factors on adaptive growth and differentiation (brush border enzymes) in small intestinal epithelium. Eighty five percent jejunoileal bypass caused a functional short gut; in intestine remaining in continuity there were significant increases in segmental weight, villus area and crypt depth, compared with sham operated controls and 25 % jejunoileal bypass rats. Despite villus cell hyperplasia in 85 % bypass rats, mucosal sucrase and alkaline phosphatase fell in jejunum and remained low in ileum, while leucine amino peptidase rose in ileum. There was a significant fall in villus area (p less than 0. 01) and crypt cell production (p less than 0. 001) in self <b>emptying</b> <b>loops</b> of 25 % bypass rats not exposed to luminal contents compared with control segments of sham operated rats. In contrast, self <b>emptying</b> <b>loops</b> of 85 % bypass rats were not atrophied despite the much greater distance from luminal nutrients; the villus area (p less than 0. 01) and crypt cell production (p less than 0. 005) were higher than in 25 % bypass rats, and at least as great as in sham operated rats. These results indicate that adaptive hyperplasia has a variable effect on expression of brush border enzymes which might reflect villus cell immaturity. The atrophic effect of diversion of luminal contents can be counteracted by systemic growth factors released as part of the adaptive response; thus systemic growth factors are not dependent on a permissive effect of luminal contents...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{notion of}} group {{was defined as}} a group {{structure}} introduced in the article [1]. The article contains the basic properties of groups, rings, left- and right-modules of an associative ring. MML Identifier:MOD_ 1. WWW:[URL] The articles [3], [1], and [2] provide the notation and terminology for this paper. A group is an add-associative right zeroed right complementable non <b>empty</b> <b>loop</b> structure. The following two propositions are true: (13) 1 Let K be an add-associative right zeroed right complementable right distributive right unital non <b>empty</b> double <b>loop</b> structure and a be an element of K. Then a · − 1 K = −a. (14) Let K be an add-associative right zeroed right complementable left distributive left unital non <b>empty</b> double <b>loop</b> structure and a be an element of K. Then (− 1 K) · a = −a. For simplicity, we use the following convention: R is an Abelian add-associative right zeroed right complementable associative left unital right unital distributive non <b>empty</b> double <b>loop</b> structure, F is a non degenerated field-like ring, x is a scalar of F, V is an add-associative right zeroed right complementable vector space-like non empty vector space structure over F, and v is a vector of V. One can prove the following two propositions: (25) 2 x · v = 0 V iff x = 0 F or v = 0 V. (26) If x � = 0 F, then x − 1 ·(x · v) = v. In the sequel V denotes an add-associative right zeroed right complementable right module-like non empty right module structure over R, x denotes a scalar of R, and v, w denote vectors of V. Next we state four propositions: (37) 3 v · 0 R = 0 V and v · − 1 R = −v and 0 V · x = 0 V. (38) −v · x = v · −x and w − v · x = w+v·−x. (39) (−v) · x = −v · x. 1 Supported by RPBP. III- 24.

40|$|Recent type systems {{allow the}} {{programmer}} to use types that describe more precisely the invariants {{on which the}} program relies. But {{in order to satisfy}} the type system, it often becomes necessary to help the type checker with extra annotations that justify why a piece of code is indeed well-formed. Such annotations take the form of term-level type manipulations, such as type abstractions, type applications, existential package packing and opening, as well as coercions, or casts. While those operations have no direct runtime cost, they tend to introduce extra runtime operations equivalent to η-redexes or even <b>empty</b> <b>loops</b> {{in order to get to}} the point where we can apply that supposedly free operation. We show a coercion that is like a pacific swiss army knife of coercions: it cannot cut but it can instantiate, open, pack, abstract, analyze, or do any combination thereof, reducing the need for extra surrounding runtime operations. And all that, of course, for the price of a single coercion, which still costs absolutely nothing at runtime. This new coercion is derived from Karl Crary’s coercion calculus [Crary, 2000], but can also replace Crary and Weirich’s vcase [Crary and Weirich, 1999]. It additionally happens to come in handy to work around some limitations of value polymorphism. It is presented in the context of Shao et al. ’s Type System for Certified Binaries [Shao et al., 2002]. Other than the coercion itself, another contribution of this work is a slightly different proof technique to show soundness of the type erasure. 1...|$|R

On analyzing the (Aschwanden et al. 2007) scenario of coronal heating process (shifted to the chromospheric heating) we stress, that for efficient loop formation, the primary upflows of plasma in chromosphere/transition region should be relatively cold and fast (as opposed to hot). It is during trapping and accumulation in closed field structures, that the flows thermalize (due to the dissipation of the short scale flow energy) leading to a bright and hot coronal structure. The formation and primary heating of a closed coronal structure (loop at the end) are simultaneous and a process like the ”filling of the <b>empty</b> coronal <b>loop</b> by hot upflows ” is purely speculative and totally unlikely...|$|R
40|$|Chronic myelogenous leukemia, {{a cancer}} of white blood cells, is {{characterized}} by a chromosome translocation between ABL and BCR due to their close proximity during BCR replication. Twenty seven DNA breakpoints are within a major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR), but why these breakpoints are clustered remains unclear. Initially, a Monte-Carlo algorithm calculating the sequence-dependent bending energy was used to position nucleosomes simultaneously in (M-BCR). MNase digestion followed by adapter-mediated PCR was then used to map experimentally the nucleosome boundaries. The discrepancy prompted the development of a replication-directed (RD) algorithm predicting nucleosome positions from the replication origin, one after another, each at the local minimum of bending energy. The better agreement confirms the spatial and temporal importance in nucleosome assembly in vivo. Therefore, a stepwise model for coupled nucleosome disassembly/reassembly across a replication fork was proposed: Unwinding of DNA by helicases may generate positive superhelical tension to facilitate the disassembly of downstream nucleosomes, which in turn may facilitate the reassembly of upstream nucleosomes. The latter may include a DNA loop formation followed by a sequential closing of two DNA arms around each histone core. Chromatin conformation capturing PCR, involving cross-linking, AluI digestion, re-ligation and PCR, preserved the core DNA conformation in 3 -D and confirmed a 292 -bp nucleosome-excluded region (A-rich region) containing a stretch of 17 consecutive A (17 -A). Nineteen breakpoints are upstream from this region: 6 are clustered immediately upstream to the 17 -A, and 10 out of 13 further upstream ones are spread in 4 nucleosome cores. It is likely that (1) the long A-rich region may extrude from the chromatin fiber or form an <b>empty</b> <b>loop</b> or other unusual secondary structures, which may experience greater mechanical stress locally without the "protection" of a histone core; (2) DNA in the newly reassembled nucleosome cores upstream to the A-rich region may lose histone cores under mechanical stress or in a stalled replication. These mechanisms may account for most of the M-BCR breakpoints and at least two other diseases caused by chromosome translocation, suggesting a functional role for the histone core as a "uniform curvature controller" to minimize the DNA breakag...|$|R

40|$|Summary. This {{series of}} papers {{is devoted to}} the notion of the ordered ring, and one of its most {{important}} cases: the notion of ordered field. It follows the results of [5]. The idea of the notion of order in the ring is based on that of positive cone i. e. the set of positive elements. Positive cone has to contain at least squares of all elements, and be closed under sum and product. Therefore the key notions of this theory are that of square, sum of squares, product of squares, etc. and finally elements generated from squares by means of sums and products. Part I contains definitions of all those key notions and inclusions between them. MML Identifier:O_RING_ 1.

40|$|Coronal loop {{emission}} profiles {{are often}} of remarkably constant width along their entire lengths, contradicting expectations based on model coronal magnetic field strengths decreasing with height. Meanwhile Paul Bellan {{has produced a}} theoretical model in which an initially <b>empty,</b> twisted force-free <b>loop,</b> on being filled with plasma via upflow at each foot point, {{in the absence of}} significant gravitational effects, forms a narrow, filamentary loop of constant cross-section. In this paper, we focus on equilibrium states that include stratification by uniform gravity while retaining the effects of magnetic field twist. Comparing these with related force-free equilibria, it is found that injection of low-β plasma under coronal conditions is not likely to change the shape of a loop significantly. These linear equilibria apply to the interiors and boundaries of loops only, with external influences modeled by boundary total pressures. The effects of total pressure balance with surroundings and of gravitational stratification are to inhibit the pinching of a loop to a constant cross-section. Only if the plasma β were high enough for the plasma to reconfigure the external field and the hydrostatic scale height much greater than the loop size could the final state have nearly constant cross section. We do not expect this to occur in the corona. Comment: ApJ accepte...|$|R
5000|$|Take {{the value}} of the {{icosahedron}} (d20), divide by four (round up), and let x = the quotient, and y = the remainder + 1. Place a knight on the xth empty square. Then place the other knight on the yth remaining empty square. In other words, see the d20 as a d5 for the first knight: 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 and 17-20. Then for the second knight, look within the group to get a d4. For example, a 20 is in the fifth group and the fourth spot in that group, so place the knights on the fifth square and the fourth square. An 11 is in the third group and the third spot.You can also use just a d10 since there are only ten unique placements of the knights once the bishops and queen has been placed. Hold one knight on the leftmost square and count one, two, three, four with the other knight on the empty square, then when it loops, move the leftmost knight one square to the right, five, six, seven, then it loops again, eight, nine, and finally with ten both knights are as far right as they go. For example, with a six the knight would be placed on the second of the five empty squares, then the second knight would be place on the second of the three squares that are empty {{to the right of the}} knight. Using a d10 in this way after two different colored d4:s and a d6 is a minimal one-roll way since 4×4×6×10 is exactly 960. (And, by subtracting one from each die and multipying with 1, 4, 16 and 96 respectively, then adding those numbers together, you find the number in the Chess960 numbering scheme.) The d8, d4, d6, d20 still give equal chance for all 960 positions, but with every position being represented in four different ways.Or alternatively (using an additional die and different calculations): Place the first knight according to {{the value of}} the d20 die, by counting the five <b>empty</b> squares and <b>looping</b> back to the left whenever reaching the rightmost empty square. Then with four empty squares remaining, do the same for the other knight using the dodecahedron (d12) die. With this method, every position is represented in 48 different ways.|$|R
