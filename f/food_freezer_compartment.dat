40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the cabinet loads of a typical household refrigerator/ freezer. The thennalload on the cabinet during closed door conditions is investigated. The area of greatest focus is the door and wall edge region of the refrigerator where thennal losses are greatest Conduction heat transfer into the refrigerator cabinet is quantified using numerical computer simulations and experimental measurements. The overall cabinet load is detennined, as well as specific loads for various pathways that sum to equal the total. Based on agreement between simulations and experiments, the complete edge loss accounts for approximately 30 % of the overall cabinet load on the fresh <b>food</b> and <b>freezer</b> <b>compartments.</b> In addition to this primary finding, percentages for heat leakage directly through the door gaskets, along the steel casing at the wall and door flanges, along the steel skin in the mullion section, due to the presence of a mullion anti-sweat heater, and due to the presence of an anti-sweat condenser tube are detennined.

50|$|Early freezer units {{accumulated}} {{ice crystals}} around the freezing units. This {{was a result}} of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing ("defrosting") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> (<b>Freezer</b> Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the freezer's walls for {{a short amount of time}} to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured <b>freezer</b> <b>compartments</b> located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.These older <b>freezer</b> <b>compartments</b> were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around , which is suitable for keeping food for a week.|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} {{on energy}} consumption behavior of household refrigerator cabinet {{can be used}} as a guideline to increase energy efficiency of this appliance. This study investigated the effect of ambient temperature, loading in <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> and frequency of door opening on the energy consumption of a frost free household refrigerator-freezer. The experiments were conducted in the laboratory and a first-order response model was developed utilizing factorial design of experiment and response surface methodology (RSM). The adequacy of the response model has been judged by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 95 % confidence interval. The study reveals that there is no interaction between the factors, and the factors exhibit significant main effect. The ambient temperature has the highest effect on energy consumption, followed by loading in <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment.</b> Frequency of door openings has the lowest effect on energy consumption. Based on the response model, contours have been plotted in loading–door openings planes. The contours help to predict the usage conditions for optimum energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the improvement in}} the performance of a domestic hybrid refrigerator that combines vapour compression technology for the cooler and <b>freezer</b> <b>compartments,</b> and thermoelectric technology for a new compartment. The heat emitted by the Peltier modules is discharged into the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment,</b> forming a cascade refrigeration system. This configuration leads to a significant improvement in the coefficient of operation. Thus, the electric power consumption of the modules and the refrigerator decrease by 95 % and 20 % respectively, with respect to those attained with a cascade refrigeration system connected with the cooler compartment. The optimization process is based on a computational model that simulates the behaviour of the whole refrigerator. Two prototypes have been built and tested. Experimental results indicate that the temperature of the new compartment is easily set up at any value between 0 and - 4 ºC, the oscillation of this temperature is always lower than 0. 4 ºC, and the electric power consumption is low enough to include this hybrid refrigerator into energy efficiency class A, according European rules and regulations...|$|R

50|$|A vapor {{compression}} {{cycle is}} used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below {{the temperature of the}} refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> ("box air") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment,</b> and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{feasibility}} study of neural transplantation in adult rhesus monkey was undertaken.

While 2 monkeys out of 5 injected with preserved tissue had successful transplants after 4 months, all the 10 monkeys injected with fresh tissue had no transplants. The size of the two surviving transplants was small. The neurons in the transplants were mainly in clusters. Many of the cells were immature and some showed early degenerative changes. Neuronal processes were restricted to the transplants and thus showed lack of morphological integration with the host tissue.

50|$|Automatic icemakers for {{the home}} were first offered by the Servel company around 1953. They are usually found inside the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment</b> of a refrigerator. They produce {{crescent-shaped}} ice cubes from a metal mold. An electromechanical or electronic timer first opens a solenoid valve for a few seconds, allowing the mold to fill with water from the domestic cold water supply. The timer then closes the valve and lets the ice freeze for about 30 minutes. Then, the timer turns on a low-power electric heating element inside the mold for several seconds, to melt the ice cubes slightly so they will not stick to the mold. Finally, the timer runs a rotating arm that scoops the ice cubes out of the mold and into a bin, and the cycle repeats. If the bin fills with ice, the ice pushes up a wire arm, which shuts off the icemaker until the ice level in the bin goes down again. The user can also lift up the wire arm at any time to stop the production of ice.|$|R

50|$|The defrost {{mechanism}} in a refrigerator heats the cooling element (evaporator coil) {{for a short}} period of time and melts the frost that has formed on it. The resulting water drains through a duct at the back of the unit. Defrosting is controlled by an electric or electronic timer: For every 6, 8, 10, 12 or 24 hours of compressor operation it turns on a defrost heater for 15 minutes to half an hour. The defrost heater, having a typical power rating of 350 W to 600 W, is mounted just below the evaporator in top- and bottom-freezer models and below and sometimes also in the middle of the evaporator in side-by-side models. It may be protected from short circuits by means of fusible links. In older refrigerators the timer ran continuously. In newer designs the timer only runs while the compressor runs, so the more the refrigerator door is closed, the less the heater will be on and the more energy will be saved. A defrost thermostat opens the heater circuit when the evaporator temperature rises above a preset temperature, 40°F (5°C) or more, thereby preventing excessive heating of the <b>freezer</b> <b>compartment.</b> The defrost timer is such that either the compressor or the defrost heater is on, but not both at the same time.|$|R
