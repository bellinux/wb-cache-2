500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1871, {{before leaving}} Hawaii, Archdeacon Mason {{informed}} Iaukea that had Kamehameha IV still been living, {{he would have}} intended for him to continue his education in Europe, and eventually to groom him to become an ordained chaplain for the royal family. Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a kāhili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed {{under the care of}} Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king's death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Paukaʻa Sugar Plantation. The listless Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: [...] "I was dangling at a loose end. And even though I was enjoying my independence, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> that I did not know just where I was going or what I ought to do. I was frustrated without realizing it." ...|$|E

The rate of recidivism is so high in the United States that most inmates who enter the system are likely to reenter within a year of their release.

2500|$|According to Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, Sub-Zero was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} character named simply Ninja, a mysterious member of [...] "the Lin Kuei, a legendary clan of Chinese ninja." [...] He wrote that inspiration came from the controversial book The Chinese Ninja Connection by Li Hsing, which [...] "posits historical evidence {{for the existence of}} the Lin Kuei and their influence on the Japanese ninja. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of there being some controversy about the author’s claims. So when we split the character in two for palette swaps, I thought it would be fitting that one was of Chinese origin and the other Japanese to kind of embody the argument." [...] Sub-Zero was then named Tundra, but the name was changed after a member of the design team saw the film The Running Man, in which the first assassin fought by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character used the name, albeit not hyphenated. Midway programmer Josh Tsui portrayed the unmasked younger Sub-Zero in the character's Mortal Kombat II ending.|$|E
2500|$|James {{recounts the}} role cricket played in his family's history, and his {{meetings}} with such early West Indian players as George John, Wilton St Hill, the great batsman George Headley and the all-rounder Learie Constantine, but {{focuses on the}} importance of the game and its players to society, specifically to colonial era Trinidad. James argues for the importance of sport in history, and refers to its roots in the Olympic Games of Ancient Greece. [...] He documents the primacy of W. G. Grace in the development of modern cricket, and the values embraced by cricket {{in the development of the}} cultures of the British Empire. He approaches cricket as an art form, as well as discussing its political impact - particularly the role of race and class in early West Indian cricket. [...] "Cricket", he writes, [...] "had plunged me into politics long before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of it. When I did turn to politics, I did not have too much to learn." [...] Cricket is approached as a method of examining the formation of national culture, society in the West Indies, the United Kingdom, and Trinidad. Education, family, national culture, class, race, colonialism, and the process of decolonisation are all examined through the prism of contemporary West Indian cricket, the history of cricket, and James's life as a player of—and commentator and writer on—the sport of cricket.|$|E
2500|$|The IG report {{did find}} that some {{statements}} made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. [...] The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. [...] He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted {{to set the record}} straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. [...] Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard. [...] Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: [...] "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I [...] "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." [...] That statement was too broad. [...] At that same press conference, I made clear that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of the process; I said, [...] "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". [...] Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. [...] Thus, my statement about [...] "discussions" [...] was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{learning}} about the deportations, Horthy wrote the following letter to the prime minister:Dear Sztójay: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> that the Government in the given forced situation has to take many steps that I do not consider correct, and for which I can not take responsibility. Among these matters is {{the handling of the}} Jewish question in a manner that does not correspond to the Hungarian mentality, Hungarian conditions, and, for the matter, Hungarian interests. It is clear to everyone that what among these were done by Germans or by the insistence of the Germans was not in my power to prevent, so in these matters I was forced into passivity. As such, I was not informed in advance, or I am not fully informed now, however, I have heard recently that in many cases in inhumaneness and brutality we exceeded the Germans. I demand that the handling of the Jewish affairs in the Ministry of Interior be taken {{out of the hands of}} Deputy Minister László Endre. Further more, László Baky's assignment to the management of the police forces should be terminated as soon as possible.Just before the deportations began, two Slovakian Jewish prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfréd Wetzler, escaped from Auschwitz and passed details of what was happening inside the camps to officials in Slovakia. This document, known as the Vrba-Wetzler Report, was quickly translated into German and passed among Jewish groups and then to Allied officials. Details from the report were broadcast by the BBC on 15 June and printed in The New York Times on 20 June. World leaders, including Pope Pius XII (25 June), President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 26 June, and King Gustaf V of Sweden on 30 June, subsequently pleaded with Horthy to use his influence to stop the deportations. Roosevelt specifically threatened military retaliation if the transports were not ceased. On 2 July, Allied bombers executed the heaviest bombings inflicted on Hungary during the war. Hungarian radio accused Jews of guiding the bombers to their targets with radio transmissions and light signals, but on 7 July Horthy at last ordered the transports halted. [...] By that time, 437,000 Jews had been sent to Auschwitz, most of them to their deaths. Horthy was informed about the number of the deported Jews some days later: [...] "approximately 400,000". By many estimates, one of every three people murdered at Auschwitz during its operation was a Hungarian Jew killed between May and July 1944.|$|E
