5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands.</b> The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|The woman, who is {{probably}} {{in her late}} teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.1395 – 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes {{to focus attention on}} the sitter. It was not until Hans Memling (c.1435–1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands.</b> The background has darkened with age; {{it is likely that the}} angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between the rich and the poor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Face</b> images <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> {{gestures}} {{provide a}} very ef# fective means of visual communication between humans. Similarly automatic <b>face</b> <b>and</b> gesture rec# ognition systems could be employed for contactless human-machine interaction systems. How# ever, developing such system is difficult, because <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> are both complex and highly vari# able structures.

Experimental re# sults are presented for face pose recovery, face identification, expression recognition and gesture interpretation. 1 Introduction This paper addresses the problem of locating <b>and</b> interpreting <b>faces</b> <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> gestures in images. By interpreting face images we mean recovering the 3 D pose, identifying the individual and recognising the expression; for the hand images we mean re# cognising the configuration of the fingers.

25|$|Human {{skin color}} fades with age. Humans {{over the age}} of thirty {{experience}} a decrease in melanin-producing cells by about 10 to 20 percent per decade as melanocyte stem cells gradually die. The skin of <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> has about twice the amount of pigment cells as unexposed areas of the body, as chronic exposure to the sun continues to stimulate melanocytes. The blotchy appearance of skin color in the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> of older people is due to the uneven distribution of pigment cells and to changes in the interaction between melanocytes and keratinocytes.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} {{is in the}} Northern Renaissance style and was completed most likely around 1630. The Virgin Mary is depicted without the infant Jesus. The artwork soon became known as miraculous and inspired a following. A dedicated chapel was built in 1671 by the Discalced Carmelites. At the same time, possibly borrowing from the Eastern Orthodox tradition, the painting was covered in expensive and elaborate silver and gold clothes leaving only the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> visible.|$|E

The <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> are in good condition; extensively damaged areas in the figure and background have been covered with black overpainting, some of which was removed during a 1992 restoration.|$|E

25|$|Ingres {{painted a}} new {{portrait}} of Napoleon for {{presentation at the}} 1806 Salon, this one showing Napoleon on the Imperial Throne for his coronation.

The scepter of Charles V, the sword of Charlemagne the rich fabrics, furs and capes, crown of gold leaves, golden chains and emblems were all presented in extremely precise detail; the Emperor's <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> were almost lost in the majestic costume.|$|E
25|$|The oldest known {{surviving}} {{example of}} the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in encaustic on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the Iconoclastic disputes that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in Saint Catherine's Monastery, in the remote desert of the Sinai. The gessoed panel, finely painted using a wax medium on a wooden panel, had been coarsely overpainted around the <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> at some time around the thirteenth century. When the overpainting was cleaned in 1962, the ancient image was revealed {{to be a very}} high-quality icon, probably produced in Constantinople.|$|E
