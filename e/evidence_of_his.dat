5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Cole convinces {{himself that}} he is insane, but after another trip {{back and forth in}} time Railly confronts him with <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time travel. They decide to spend their {{remaining}} time together in the Florida Keys before the onset of the plague. On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' father in an animal cage.|$|E
5|$|During {{his five}} {{years with the}} Indians he was {{primarily}} used as a starting pitcher, although he did display the versatility that would become his hallmark. He pitched in 139 games for the Indians, starting 100 and finishing 27. Early <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> versatility is demonstrated by his 41 complete games, 9 shutouts and 8 saves.|$|E
25|$|Many Christians believe Jesus' miracles were {{historical}} events {{and that his}} miraculous works were an important part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life, attesting to his divinity and the Hypostatic union, i.e., the dual natures of Jesus as God and Man. They see Jesus' experiences of hunger, weariness, and death as <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> humanity, and miracles as <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> divinity.|$|R
25|$|Christians {{in general}} believe that Jesus' miracles were actual {{historical}} events {{and that his}} miraculous works were an important part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life, attesting to his divinity and the Hypostatic union, i.e., the dual natures of Christ's humanity and divinity in one hypostasis. Christians believe that while Jesus' experiences of hunger, weariness, and death were <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> humanity, the miracles were <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deity.|$|R

5|$|He {{finds himself}} {{back in his}} car, handcuffed, but {{relieved}} {{to see that the}} green reality Bird is still alive. He gives Bird Hawkins' password ("tulip"), and the information regarding Kessel and the shipping container convinces Bird that something is wrong. He takes Michael to Harper still in cuffs but they both tell her what they have learned. Harper approves Bird's plan to send a team to the storage container but sends Michael to a cell, saying that if they do not find any <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> accusations, he'll go to jail for killing Hawkins.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28–30.|$|E
5|$|No written {{contemporary}} {{description of}} Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no {{evidence suggests that}} he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness, and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led {{to the production of}} several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.|$|E

5|$|On 19 November, he {{was sworn}} in as a Privy Counsellor. He {{suspended}} his duties temporarily on 5 April 1757, when appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, due to an old custom that the Lord Chief Justice took the position when it was empty. He only served until 8 April, and there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> performing anything more than the standard day-to-day duties. He became a cabinet minister in 1757, still serving as Lord Chief Justice, and stayed until 1765.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth (died 1038) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Descended {{from an earlier}} English king, Æthelnoth became a monk prior to {{becoming}} archbishop. While archbishop, he travelled to Rome and brought back saint's relics. He consecrated {{a number of other}} bishops who came from outside his archdiocese, leading to some friction with other archbishops. Although he was regarded as a saint after his death, there is little <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> veneration or of a cult in Canterbury or elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|A year passes. Peter {{has begun}} dating again, some dates being a Stickman and Bonnie, but has talked Joe into posing as Lois {{from time to}} time so that her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie {{indirectly}} reveals to Brian that he killed Lois. Disturbed and angered, Brian vows to bring him to justice. Stewie realizes that keeping the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' trash and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.|$|E

60|$|Until nearly noon Professor Maxon was {{occupied}} in removing the remaining stains and <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gruesome work, {{but when he}} at last turned {{the key in the}} door <b>of</b> <b>his</b> workshop it was to leave behind no single trace of the successful result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> years <b>of</b> labor.|$|R
5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue of slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> failure.|$|E
5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} {{can only be}} described as perfectly honourable and at times humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from the wrath of the Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> humanity was the care that he displayed for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the evidence of the}} Chronicle that Æthelberht was accorded the title of bretwalda, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the Heptarchy. In Essex, Æthelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King Sæberht of Essex, his nephew, to Christianity. It was Æthelberht, and not Sæberht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St Paul's Cathedral now stands. Further evidence is provided by Bede, who explicitly describes Æthelberht as Sæberht's overlord.|$|E
5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E
5|$|Like Conrad von Soest, Lochner often applied black {{cross-hatching}} on gold, {{usually to}} render metallic {{objects such as}} brooches, crowns or buckles, in imitation of goldsmiths work on precious objects such as reliquaries and chalices. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, {{and it has been}} suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith. <b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> imitation of elements of their craft is apparent even in his underdrawings. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement, and Gabriel's clasp on the outer wing of the Dombild altarpiece.|$|E
60|$|For {{a square}} or two he ran swiftly; {{then he turned}} into a little all-night cafe and in the {{lavatory}} removed the <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> over-roof promenade from hands and clothes.

5|$|Macrinus {{and his son}} Diadumenianus were {{declared}} hostes, {{enemies of}} the state, by the Senate immediately after news had arrived of their deaths {{and as part of}} an official declaration of support for the usurper Elagabalus, who was recognized in the Senate as the new Emperor. The declaration of hostes led to two actions being taken against the images of the former Emperors. First, their portraits were destroyed and their names were stricken from inscriptions and papyrii. The second action, taken by the Roman soldiers who had rebelled against Macrinus in favour of Elagabalus, was to destroy all of the works and possessions of Macrinus. The damnatio memoriae against Macrinus is among the earliest of such sanctions enacted by the Senate. Many of the marble busts of Macrinus that exist were defaced and mutilated {{as a response to the}} damnatio memoriae and many of the coins depicting Macrinus and Diadumenianus were also destroyed. These actions against Macrinus are <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unpopularity in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wesley Rackstraw is {{a retired}} pilot and ex-convict who served on an army {{helicopter}} crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He {{came to the attention}} of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in Iran and deported to the U.S. to face explosive possession and check kiting charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false mayday call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot licenses; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him as a suspect in 1979 after no direct <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> involvement could be found.|$|E
5|$|She further {{asserted}} {{that in the}} Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at Mohenjo-Daro, which are often interpreted as depictions of Pashupati, {{as well as the}} deities Osiris and Amon in Egypt and the Minotaur of Minoan Crete. Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by Pan in Greece, Cernunnos in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless {{asserted that}} his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the Dorset Ooser and the Puck Fair as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> veneration.|$|E
50|$|Cary's {{reputation}} {{was that he}} was a man of rare learning spiced with a sense of humour; kindly, industrious and careful in all his undertakings.

He has left behind him many <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> literary talents and industry.|$|R
