Context-based learning aims {{to demonstrate the}} relevance of both philosophical skills and knowledge outwith the academic domain and to also ground philosophical debate in a „real ‟ territory for students. Once the teaching approach has been described, the paper will seek to theoretically justify (and to outline the proposed empirical methodology to support these arguments) a series of claims: (1) that the personalized, context-based approach is more successful at both developing and making the student aware of developing specific <b>educational</b> skills (<b>autonomy,</b> independence, critical aptitude, etc.) which are highly desirable and easily transferable; (2) that the student does not view the acquisition of knowledge as merely {{a means to an}} end (e. g., passing an examination) and, hence, transitory; and (3) the approach is more suited to contemporary cultural conditions in that it successfully breaks free from outdated binary oppositions, namely the academic versus the vocational and the factual versus the technical which no longer map onto current social and economic reality. The final section of the paper will simply open discussion on whether the approach can be broadened to other disciplines or requires a core curriculum of philosophical modules...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing {{recognition}} of the importance of learner autonomy and the role of individual learners in directing their own learning process, {{both inside and outside the}} classroom (Alford & Pachler, 2007; Benson, 2000; Breen, 2001; Conacher & Kelly-Holmes, 2007). However, in practice it is not always clear how to support learners in this role, and how to ensure they are ready to assume it. This paper explores some of the teaching aspects related to the development of learner autonomy and proposes a framework of skills that could be used by teachers as a guide to increasing learner responsibility. Although this framework was developed in the context of language education, its underlying theories apply to all <b>educational</b> settings.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether young black adults who participate in sport differ in psychological well-being and psychosocial development from those who do not participate actively in sport. An availability sample of 293 students between 20 and 35 years old from three tertiary institutions in South Africa completed self-report measures of psychological well-being and psychosocial development. Reliability and validity of instruments were acceptable for use in this particular group. Students who participate actively in sport had significantly lower levels of negative affect, somatic symptoms, symptoms of depression and pessimistic life orientation, and significantly higher levels of positive affect, sense of coherence and self-efficacy beliefs. They also manifested higher levels of purpose and <b>autonomy.</b> <b>Educational</b> and policy implications of findings are indicated.

Focusing on Italian education system, the article analyzes the mechanisms leading parents to choose children’ education paths and investigates the main factors behind the choice between public and private school, exploring how such behavior merely depends on deterministic socioeconomic segmentation or on other cultural variables, such as prestige, ideology, religion, or the status appeal of an education offer. Exploring results of a nationwide Italian PRIN study (consisting in a survey on parents with children at the end of primary and low secondary school and at the beginning of upper secondary schools), the article underlines, besides the influence of parents’ education level and socioeconomic status, the importance of other latent variables influencing parents’ choice, like family involvement in school system and parents’ motivation...|$|R

Its focus lies {{on the right to}} social security, a central norm of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The main question is what impact does the right to social security have on socio-political action in Germany and Finland. The results of the analysis, which was based on the objective hermeneutics, revealed a structural similarity between the conceptions of human beings in both countries. Unemployed people are labelled as deficient and potentially in need of <b>educational</b> measures. Their <b>autonomy</b> is curtailed, sometimes severely. In this sense, the right to social security has hardly any impact. The social work profession in theory and practice should use human rights as a tool against these new forms of oppression...|$|R

Important yeshivot existed in Kraków, Poznań, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a Hebrew Pentateuch (Torah) was printed in Kraków; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and Lublin issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of Talmudic scholarship in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal <b>autonomy</b> <b>educational</b> development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of Jewish law. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{answered}} the research question to what extent variation in extrinsic and intrinsic job preference orientations {{can be attributed to}} and explained by differences between individuals and between countries. We argued that socialization in school, economic deprivation, and job quality influence job preferences, and formulated testable hypotheses on the individual and country level. After first testing for cross-national equivalence of the latent constructs and assuring that factor solutions were satisfactory, we employed multiple response multilevel models on a subset of 22 countries in the European Values Study 1999 / 2000. The findings indicate that higher educational attainment, a high income, working in managerial and higher professional jobs, and having autonomy in one's job stimulate intrinsic job preference orientations, while particularly <b>educational</b> attainment and <b>autonomy</b> temper extrinsic work values. Workers in semi- and unskilled manual jobs have the highest extrinsic job preferences. On top of individual characteristics, living in a nation that invests much in human capital or has a high quality labour market is associated with lower levels of extrinsic job preferences. Moreover, countries with socio-economic features that reduce the risk of economic deprivation have a more intrinsically motivated workforce...|$|R
40|$|While Estonia’s 1925 Law on Cultural Self-Government for National Minorities {{is often}} cited as a rare {{functioning}} example of Renner and Bauer’s non-territorial autonomy scheme, there has until recently been comparatively little research on how the law operated in practice.

Cultural <b>autonomy</b> did not resolve all outstanding points of division between state, majority and (in particular) Baltic German minority; nevertheless, it played a positive role in the regulation of ethnonational tensions. Even less well-known is the international resonance of this unique law, which transnational minority activists argued should serve as a general model for the regulation of minority disputes. The League of Nations rightly questioned this claim, and the non-territorial autonomy model was scarcely applied beyond the Baltic region during the 1920 s. However, it is still instructive to revisit the 1925 law today, at a time when several post-communist states have adopted minority rights legislation based on similar principles...|$|R
