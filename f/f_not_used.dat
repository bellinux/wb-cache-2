40|$|This paper {{examines}} the emerging {{issues in the}} utilization of weblogs in Philippine higher education and how these issues affect the performance of students. This study used a modified Delphi method. The Delphi panel consisted of 12 experts in the integration of technology, particularly blogs, in their teaching. The study yielded the following issues: (a) limited time and access to computer and Internet; (b) tedious preparation, maintenance and management of blogs; (c) technological difficulties of students; (d) low level of interaction among students; (e) digression in comments posted; and (<b>f)</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to online teaching. These issues may curb the optimized benefit of weblogs as a teaching-learning tool. The {{results of this study}} also highly recommend the use of standardized assessment tools for richer academic contributions of weblog activities. The study presents enlightening insights on the place and function of blogging in the academe. Learning is eclectic. It is not confined inside the four walls of the classroom. In our contemporary time, there are other unconventional learning platforms that teachers may explore and utilize to make learning meaningful for students. Tong and Trinidad (2005...|$|E

An interesting observation {{is that the first}} order difference between the residual empirical process and the null model can <b>not</b> be <b>used</b> to asymptotically to distinguish between the two marginal distributions that differ only in their means. This finding is in sharp contrast to a recent claim of Chan and Ling (2008) that such a process has a Gaussian weak limit. We shall also proposes some tests based on the second order difference in this case and analyze some of their properties. Another interesting finding is that residual empirical process tests in the scale problem are robust against not knowing the scale parameter.

40|$|Most of the {{published}} voice conversion schemes {{do not consider}} detailed prosody modeling but only control the F 0 level and range. However, the detailed prosody can also carry a signi�cant amount of speaker identity related information. This paper introduces a new method for converting the prosody in voice conversion. A syllablebased prosodic codebook is used to predict the converted <b>F</b> 0 <b>using</b> <b>not</b> only the source contour but also linguistic information and segmental durations. The selection of the most suitable target contour is carried out using a trained classi�cation and regression tree. The F 0 contours in the codebook are represented in a transformed domain which allows compression and fast comparison. The performance of the prosodic conversion is evaluated in a real voice conversion system. The results indicate a signi�cant improvement in speaker identity and naturalness when compared to GMM (Gaussian mixture model) based pitch prediction approach.

40|$|Over-determined {{systems of}} partial {{differential}} equations may be studied using differential-elimination algorithms, {{as a great}} deal of information about the solution set of the system may be obtained from the output. Unfortunately, many systems are effectively intractable by these methods due to the expression swell incurred in the intermediate stages of the calculations. This can happen when, for example, the input system depends on many variables and is invariant under a large rotation group, so that there is no natural choice of term ordering in the elimination and reduction processes. This paper describes how systems written in terms of the differential invariants of a Lie group action may be processed in a manner analogous to differential-elimination algorithms. The algorithm described terminates and yields, in a sense which we make precise, a complete set of representative invariant integrability conditions which may be calculated in a "critical pair" completion procedure. Further, we discuss some of the profound differences between algebras of differential invariants and standard differential algebras. We use the new, regularized moving frame method of Fels and Olver [11], [12] to write a differential system in terns of the invariants of a symmetry group. The methods described have been implemented as a package in MAPLE. The main example discussed is the analysis of the (2 + 1) -d'Alembert-Hamilton system u(xx) + u(yy) - u(zz) = f(u), u(x) (2) + u(y) (2) - u(z) (2) = 1.
