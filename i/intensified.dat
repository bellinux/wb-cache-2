40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{subjective}} image quality of (1) regular <b>intensifying</b> screens with medium <b>intensifying</b> screens, (2) regular <b>intensifying</b> screens with digital radiography, and (3) medium <b>intensifying</b> screens with digital radiography for panoramic radiographs. Materials and Methods: Forty-five patients participated and a total of 90 radiographs were obtained in the study. The patients were divided into three groups (regular-medium <b>intensifying</b> screen, regular <b>intensifying</b> screen-digital radiography, and medium <b>intensifying</b> screen-digital radiography) that consisted of 15 people each. All radiographs were assessed by three oral radiologists independently. The observers evaluated the images using a 3 -point scale (1 =well visible, 0 =partly visible, - 1 =not or hardly visible) for anatomical structures and pathological findings that are commonly found on panoramic radiographs. Subjective image quality of the groups and comparison of the observers were assessed by using non parametric Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: For all groups and observers, no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found for both anatomical structures and pathologies and between anatomical structures and pathologies according to the Mann Whitney U test. In comparison with observers, no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found for both anatomical structures and pathologies and between anatomical structures and pathologies for all groups according to the Kruskal Wallis test. Conclusion: The subjective image quality of medium and regular <b>intensifying</b> screens and conventional and digital panoramic radiographs were found statistically equal in this study...|$|R

It executed a small loop, and while doing so <b>intensified</b> into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from a nearby upper-level low, Mitch quickly <b>intensified</b> in response to improving conditions which included warm waters and good outflow.

After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly <b>intensified,</b> first into a major hurricane on October25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.|$|E

5|$|Moving very {{steadily}} southwest, {{the storm}} gradually <b>intensified.</b> Early on February 15, the JTWC announced that that system had <b>intensified</b> into a tropical storm. After intensifying slightly (based on JTWC data) that evening, the storm briefly weakened overnight, only to re-intensify the next morning. On February16, Favio turned southwest {{in response to}} a large subtropical ridge. Despite low wind shear, Favio remained a moderate tropical storm for several days; however, on February18, MFR announced that Favio had <b>intensified</b> into a severe tropical storm. Subsequently, the storm turned west as the ridge merged with another one centered over South Africa. Two days later, the agency then upgraded the system into cyclone status. At 0000UTC that day, on February19, the JTWC upgraded the system into a Category1 hurricane-equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) though not much additional intensification was predicted.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, the JTWC {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} disturbance that was located about 1145km (710mi) {{to the northwest}} of Suva, Fiji. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further in an area of low vertical windshear, before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21. Over {{the next couple of days}}, 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23. Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had <b>intensified</b> into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti. During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly <b>intensified</b> further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had <b>intensified</b> into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti <b>intensified</b> into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure. As a result, the system started to move towards the south-southeast.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Due to {{ever-increasing}} {{need for}} diagnostic radiographs in dentistry, {{it is necessary}} to observe techniques to minimize the absorbed patient dose. The aim of this study was the comparative evaluation of inherent visual characteristics such as contrast and density and the gross fog of standard occlusal films with those of occlusal films taken with <b>intensifying</b> screens. Materials and Methods: In this experimental research, standard occlusal films and occlusal films prepared by cutting extraoral films to the size of occlusal films and placing them between <b>intensifying</b> screens were used. After determination of the most appropriate exposure time and maximum kVp and mA, radiographs were taken from one step wedge and processed using the same condition. A total of 25 radiographs were taken from each of the two film types and then the radiographs underwent densitometry at similar points. In order to evaluate the gross fog, densitometry was carried out at 5 similar points on one unexposed film from each type. Data were analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software and Mann-Whitney test (α = 0. 05). Results: Based on the results of this study, the density of the standard occlusal film was more than that of the occlusal film with <b>intensifying</b> screens (p value < 0. 001). The contrast of the film with <b>intensifying</b> screens was more than that of the standard occlusal film (p value < 0. 001). The gross fog of the film with <b>intensifying</b> screens was less than that of the standard occlusal film (p value = 0. 006). Conclusion: Occlusal films with <b>intensifying</b> screens have higher contrast and lower gross fog and density, but in the diagnostic range, in comparison with standard occlusal films; therefore, films with <b>intensifying</b> screens are recommended because they decrease patient absorbed dose by decreasing exposure time.

Initially drifting westward, the storm gradually <b>intensified</b> and became a tropical storm early the next day. By August31, the system strengthened into a Category1 hurricane. The next day, the hurricane entered the Caribbean Sea, passing the island of Dominica as a Category2 hurricane. Continuing to intensify, the storm further <b>intensified</b> into a Category3 hurricane on September2 {{and then to a}} Category4 the following day. Around 18:00UTC on September3, the hurricane peaked with winds of 155mph (250km/h), observed by a ship. Simultaneously, the storm made landfall near Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.|$|E
