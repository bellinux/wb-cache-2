5000|$|Perhaps {{the white}} wing-band was already present by that time; as the copper {{pheasant}} has a highly apomorphic coloration with reduced sexual dimorphism, {{it may well}} have lost such a trait after it settled Japan. But it might also have evolved only after the copper pheasant ancestors had split {{from those of the}} species displaying the wing-band today. However that may be, the minor plumage differences of the wing-banded species suggest that their last common ancestor looked almost identical to the living Mrs. <b>Hume's</b> <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> humiae). At some point during the Pliocene [...] - [...] probably around 2.8 mya during the Piacenzian [...] - [...] the ancestors of the Mikado <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> mikado) settled Taiwan, apparently during the period when that island separated from the mainland and alternated between being a peninsula and an island for some time. They were finally isolated no later than the Late Pliocene; the species is melanistic, suggesting a small founder population. The adjacent mainland population split into the subtropical and partially leucistic Elliot's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> ellioti) and the tropical Mrs. Hume's pheasant only in the Middle Pleistocene, around half a million years ago. This divergence was probably in some way connected to climate changes at the Günz-Mindel interglacial to Mindel boundary, when mountains in the region became dry and at times icebound. The Nanling Mountains region marks the present-day boundary between these sister species and is not inhabited by either.|$|R

50|$|Still, the {{phylogeny}} {{and evolution}} of the long-tailed pheasants can be considered resolved to satisfaction by now. It was long accepted that the three southeastern species—which all have bright white wing-bands of a type not found in any close relative and differ little except in the amount and concentration of eumelanins in their plumage—form a clade. However, the two others are not as closely {{related to each other}} as was previously thought, representing two lineages that diverged independently from the main lineage instead of being sister species. These—Reeves's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> reevesii) and the copper <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> soemmerringii)—are sometimes placed in monotypic genera, but as noted above though this may eventually turn out to be warranted it is not well supported by the available evidence.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to sketch and defend a new {{interpretation}} or theory of objective chance, one that lets us be sure such chances exist and shows how they can play the roles we traditionally grant them. The subtitle obviously emulates the title of Lewis seminal 1980 paper A Subjectivist s Guide to Objective Chance while indicating an important difference in perspective. The view developed below shares two major tenets with Lewis last (1994) account of objective chance: (1) The Principal Principle tells us most of what we know about objective chance; (2) Objective chances are not primitive modal facts, propensities, or powers, but rather facts entailed by the overall pattern of events and processes in the actual world. But it differs from Lewis’ account in most other respects. Another subtitle I considered was A Humean Guide [...] . But while the account of chance below is compatible with any stripe of Humeanism (Lewis, <b>Hume</b> <b>s,</b> and others), it presupposes no general Humean philosophy. Only a skeptical attitude about probability itself is presupposed (as in point (2) above); what we should say about causality, laws, modality and so on is left a separate question. Still, I will label the account to be developed “Humean objective chance”...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This is a dark story: Representations of the Past in Eighteenth-Century Gothic Literature (1764 1794) contends that the Gothic {{can be read as}} a complex reaction to Enlightenment methods of historical representation. It discusses the ways in which both familiar (such as David <b>Hume</b> <b>s</b> The History of England, 1754 62) and lesser known historical works (such as Paul M. Rapin de Thoyras s History of England, 1721 31) influenced and shaped the genre, uncovering in the process hitherto neglected relationships between Gothic fiction and prominent works of eighteenth-century history. As well as discussing established Gothic novelists such as Horace Walpole and Ann Radcliffe, the thesis breaks from tradition by devoting chapters to Clara Reeve and Sophia Lee, important women writers whose works are often ignored or marginalised in discussions of the genre s origins. Emphasising the heterogeneity of the Gothic in the eighteenth century, it shows how, although writers employ and develop similar tropes, they use them for diverse ends. Gothic pasts are sites of intense conflict, with authors (particularly female ones) often writing fictional histories to comment on pressing socio-historical issues. Tracing the Gothic s development from Walpole to Radcliffe (and beyond), this thesis goes on to re-evaluate the literary implications of the French Revolution. Suggesting new areas of enquiry for Gothic scholarship, it argues that the transgressions taking place in France shattered Enlightenment models of historical understanding and that historical discussion moved from multi-volume tomes to the domain of the political pamphlet. Contending that the Gothic reacts to changing conceptions of history and the past at this time, it maintains that the French Revolution caused the Gothic to develop and exhibit a heightened state of historical consciousness. Furthermore, the thesis demonstrates how the settings of Gothic narratives move forward in historical time throughout the eighteenth century, arguing that the turbulent context of the 1790 s provides an explanation for this tendency. With the Revolution in France consuming itself in the Terror, and the British government passing oppressive legislation in order to prevent a similar uprising in England, it is argued that the present had become a more frightening place than the past, and that, because of this, Gothic fiction became increasingly willing to jettison historical and geographical displacement. Although Gothic attitudes towards the past continued to be influenced by the genre s earlier contentious relationship with Enlightenment historiography, Gothic narratives became less dependent on history as a site of terror, and began to situate themselves ever-closer to the present, with significant repercussions for the genre throughout the nineteenth century...|$|R

They are necessary for the constituting of religious experience. Faith itself, in theological sense, is not determinative for religious experience. It has sense only when it is integrated into contemplation. True religious experience is based on the art of contemplation which helps a human being to look with astonishment.

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 -Dependent Monooxygenase Activities and Their Inducibility by Classic P 450 Inducers in the Liver, Kidney, and Nasal Mucosa of Male Adult Ring-Necked Pheasants. Giorgi M., Marini S., Longo V., Mazzaccaro A., Amato G., and Gervasi P. G. (2000). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 167, 237 – 245. In this study, several P 450 -dependent monoxygenase {{activities}} in the liver, kidney, and nasal mucosa of ring-necked pheasants were examined. In addition, the presence and inducibility of P 450 isoenzymes in the hepatic and renal tissues of pheasants were examined by using typical substrates and inducers of P 450 s along with polyclonal antibodies raised against mammalian isoforms. Anti-rat P 450 1 A 1 recognized in microsomes of both pheasant liver and kidney a protein that was markedly induced by b-naphthoflavone and accompanied by an increase of various monooxygenases, in particular, methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase (MROD) activity. Anti-rat P 450 2 E 1 revealed in microsomes of the pheasant liver but not in kidney an immunoreactive protein that was slightly induced by acetone but not accompanied by an increase of para-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity. On the other hand, acetone treatment caused an induction of other hepatic monoxygenases including MROD, erythromycin N-demethylase, and 6 b-testosterone hydroxylase. These two latter activities, known to be markers for 3 A isoenzymes in rodents, were also enhanced in pheasant liver by phenobarbital but not by dexamethasone. The treatment with these two inducers also lacked to point out hepatic and renal proteins immunorelated to P 450 3 A or 2 B subfamily, suggesting that these isoforms may be not expressed in pheasant. On the other hand, anti-rat P 450 2 C 11 recognized two immunorelated proteins in the liver of both control and treated pheasants. The treatment with clofibrate, a mammalian inducer of 4 A subfamily, induced both in liver and kidney of pheasant: i) a protein that cross-reacted with anti rat P 450 4 A 1 and ii) the (v) and (v 21) lauric acid hydroxylase activities, known to be associated in mammals to this P 450 subfamily. In the nasal mucosa of pheasant, a protein immunorelated to P 450 2 A and some monooxygenase activities (i. e., 7 -ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase) linked, in mammals, to this isoform have been found; by contrast a protein immunoreactive with anti P 450 2 G 1 was not found. In conclusion, the immunochemical properties and monooxygenase activities of constitutive and inducible P 450 <b>s</b> in <b>pheasants</b> were different not only from those of mammals but also from those of chickens. The findings of the present work also suggest that the P 450 induction profiles might provide a potential biomarker of pheasant exposure to chemicals or environmental pollutants in the wild-field or in the stock-farm...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} {{wildlife}} use roadside vegetation as habitat. The ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) utilizes roadsides {{for all types}} of cover. Because pheasants are nonmigratory and generally live their entire lives within a 1 - to 2 -mile radius, pheasants are excellent indicator species to predict both quantity and quality of roadside wildlife habitat. Pheasants were introduced to Utah in the late 18002 ̆ 7 s. Populations climbed until pheasant habitat occupied 2 - 4 percent of the total land area in Utah. Populations began to decrease in the 19502 ̆ 7 <b>s.</b> Since 1962, <b>pheasant</b> populations in Cache County, Utah have dropped 2. 71 percent annually. Experts believe the decline in pheasants is directly related to decreased habitat. They attribute the decrease to land use changes. Cache County roadsides currently support 3, 643 acres of wildlife habitat and have the potential to support over 15, 000 acres. To evaluate roadside habitat in Cache County, a roadside vegetation inventory was conducted. This was done by conducting a windshield survey of Cache County roadsides in agricultural areas. Next, vegetation density was measured along roadside transects using a Daubenmire frame and vertical profile board. The results showed Cache County roadsides did not support quality wildlife habitat. The exception was wetlands that contained significant stands of cattail. The evaluation found current maintenance practices of mowing and spraying roadside vegetation has degraded the plant communities and created dense monocultures of a few grass species. A questionnaire was completed by county weed supervisors throughout the state of Utah as well as Utah Department of Transportation personnel and other people associated with the managment of roadside vegetation. The questionnaire provided information about current roadside maintenance practices and attitudes. As a result of the roadside vegetation data and the questionnaire, the study determined that healthier roadside plant communities are possible if current maintenance practices and standards are modified. These modifications should include 1) spot spraying herbicide to eradicate weed species, 2) mowing only 10...|$|R
40|$|A new {{facility}} seeks to manufacture inlets for the turbine {{of the new}} NDA aircraft. The inlet is a new design {{and has never been}} built before. To complicate matters the manufacturer, Aeron 2 Company, has not traditionally produced any inlets, let alone at the expected production rates for the new aircraft that already has thousands of orders. It was decided that in order to meet demand production must be automated in a similar way to the automotive industry. Aeron, and the commercial aerospace industry as a whole, are inexperienced with automation systems and they believed that they lacked the in-house knowledge to develop and integrate their own automated system. They entered into a contract with a robotics integrator that is has traditionally operated within the automotive industry for delivery of a "turnkey" system. This research covers a six-month period that overlaps with the beginning of Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) of the automated assembly line. Initial observations hinted at the possibility of a strained relationship between Aeron and its automation integrator. This thesis sought to understand if the relationship was indeed strained, and if so, what were the causes and could it be improved? The Aeron group most involved with this system purchase, referred to as TWS, is used as a case-study to investigate the different factors that can affect an interorganizational relationship during development of a technically complex system. The research and recommendations can be applied to other companies that are involved in inter-organizational relationships founded upon development of technically complex projects. An inductive-deductive iterative approach was used in three phases to conduct this research. Beginning with background research in phase one an inductive approach is used to develop a qualitative model of the inter-organizational system. This model leads to additional questions regarding inter-organizational relationships and their more important factors, such as expectations and trust; namely, what are the expectations that are held by each party in the relationship and what are their impacts? These additional questions are addressed in a deductive manner in phase two. Through the use of surveys sent to different automation teams across the organization, data was collected that reflected the different relationships. These survey results indicate interesting customer perceptions of their respective automation suppliers. At the time of this writing all of the automation projects are perceived to be technically complex, yet some contractors are perceived as more technically capable than others. These data also indicate a general lack of trust. Expectations are addressed using a simple matrix that outlines the different technical and management expectations held by TWS in regards to the equipment being purchased and their integrator. A number of expectations held by TWS are unrealistic and have, as of this writing, gone unfulfilled. The third and final phase revisited the initial model in phase one and made modifications based on findings from phase two. For technically complex projects, such as the development of an automated assembly line using immature technology to build a new product, it is impossible to capture every design specification for the system. Design changes will occur. It is imperative that correct expectations regarding the equipment and the firm's capabilities are correctly set {{at the beginning of the}} project to reduce a shortfall in expected performance versus actual performance. Expectations, including those that are unrealistic, that go unfulfilled lead to decay in trust. This decay in trust in turn leads to a decreased likelihood in project success. It is recommended that Aeron shy away from "turnkey" systems for such state-of-the-art projects in the future, or at least until Aeron becomes more familiar with automated assembly and their integrators become more familiar with aerospace requirements. This research is most applicable to commercial aerospace companies entering a formal relationship with an automation integrator for an automated assembly line. The research does have general recommendations that are applicable to other industries engaging in similar endeavors. Future work would include a lifecycle study of trust levels within an interorganizational relationship and how they change over the course of the project from conception to delivery. by David L. <b>Hume.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2016.
