25|$|As arsenic is {{a natural}} element in soil, water, and air, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{monitors}} the levels of arsenic in foods, particularly in rice products used commonly for <b>infant</b> <b>food.</b> While growing, rice plants tend to absorb arsenic more readily than other food crops, requiring expanded testing by the FDA for possible arsenic-related risks associated with rice consumption in the United States. In April 2016, the FDA proposed a limit of 100 parts per billion (ppb) for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal and other foods to minimize exposure of infants to arsenic. For water contamination by arsenic, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has set a lower standard of 10 ppb.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, Pillsbury {{was confronted}} with a food safety issue of its own when glass {{contamination}} was found in farina, a cereal commonly used in <b>infant</b> <b>food.</b> Baumann's leadership promoted HACCP in Pillsbury for producing commercial foods, and applied to its own food production. This led to a panel discussion at the 1971 National Conference on Food Protection that included examining CCPs and good manufacturing practices in producing safe foods. Several botulism cases were attributed to under-processed low-acid canned foods in 1970–71. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked Pillsbury to organize and conduct a training program on the inspection of canned foods for FDA inspectors. This 21-day program was first held in September 1972 with 11 days of classroom lecture and 10 days of canning plant evaluations. Canned food regulations (21 CFR 108, 21 CFR 110, 21 CFR 113, and 21 CFR 114) were first published in 1969. Pillsbury's training program to the FDA in 1969, titled [...] "Food Safety through the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point System", {{was the first time}} that HACCP was used.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{indigenous}} Beninese {{food resources}} as potential ingredients for complementary <b>infant</b> <b>foods</b> {{with the aim}} to develop affordable formulations for low-income households in each agro-ecological zone of the country. Potential ingredients were selected on their documented nutritional value. The selected foods encompass 347 food resources, namely 297 plant products from home gardens or collected from natural vegetation and 50 animals, either domesticated or from the wild. The compiled data reveal that {{the distribution of the}} available food resources was unbalanced between agro-ecological zones. Only a few animal ingredients are obtainable in northern Benin. Most resources are seasonal, but their availability may be extended. A high variation was observed in energy and nutrient contents. Antinutritional factors were identified in some resources, but processing techniques were reported to reduce their presence in meals. In general, ingredients from local tree foods (Adansonia digitata, Parkia biglobosa) were adequate as sources of nutrients for complementary <b>infant</b> <b>foods.</b> Based on this review, local foods for the development of complementary food formulas for Beninese infants and children may be selected for each agro-ecological zone.

40|$|The Mediterranean diet is {{well known}} for its health-promoting effects. Among its key ingredients, olive oil is the most characteristic. Processing {{industries}} have been successfully manufacturing and marketing jarred baby foods with the use of vegetable oils, including olive oil, as well as other sources of visible fat. We aimed to survey manufacturer claims concerning added fat in jarred <b>infant</b> <b>foods</b> supplied to the Polish market. A total of 124 kinds of <b>infant</b> <b>foods</b> from six suppliers were analyzed. Corn, canola, and soybean oil occupied the first three positions, respectively, in rank order of vegetable oils used in jarred baby foods. In our sample, only one type of ready-to-eat jars with vegetables contained olive oil. 11 % of products contained cow milk butter or cream. 61 % of jarred “dinners” contained poultry or fish, which are typical sources of animal protein in the Mediterranean diet. Given that commercial baby foods currently available in the Polish market contain no olive oil, we advocate considering home preparation of <b>infant</b> <b>foods</b> with the use of visible fat.

40|$|The study {{reported}} herein {{was conducted in}} order to establish the concentration of 20 essential and non-essential elements in a representative range of commercial <b>infant</b> <b>foods</b> in the UK targeted for infants aged between 6 – 12 months. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} examine the nutritive values and safety of such complementary <b>infant</b> <b>foods</b> on the UK market in relation to dietary and safety guidelines. Quantitative analyses were conducted on eight different products representing four popular brands (poultry and fish based) of ready to-feed <b>infant</b> <b>foods</b> currently on sale in the UK. Six essential elements, namely: calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc were determined by ICP-OES. The concentrations of six essential trace elements (selenium, molybdenum, cobalt, copper, chromium, manganese) and eight non-essential, potentially toxic, elements (arsenic, barium, nickel, cadmium, antimony, lead, mercury, aluminium) were determined by ICP-MS due to the higher sensitivity required. The total daily intakes of essential and trace elements from the consumption of such products were then estimated, based on the results of this study, and were referenced to the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) values and safety guidelines for 6 – 9 months old children. Based on these comparisons the concentration of essential, except for potassium, and trace elements were found to be inadequate in meeting the RNI. In terms of the risk of exposure to toxicity, the concentration of toxic elements in ready to feed products analysed in this study, were not considered to be of concern. These results suggest that commercial complementary <b>infant</b> <b>foods</b> on the UK market may not contain minimum levels of minerals required for labelling declaration of micronutrient content (Commission Directive 2006 / 125 /EC).
