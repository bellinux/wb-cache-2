40|$|This paper {{presents}} an impact dynamic {{analysis of a}} percussive system based on rotary-percussive ultrasonic drill (RPUD). The RPUD employs vibrations on two sides of one single piezoelectric stack to achieve rotary-percussive motion, which improves drilling efficiency. The RPUD’s percussive system is composed of a percussive horn, a free mass, and a <b>drill</b> <b>tool.</b> The percussive horn enlarges longitudinal vibration from piezoelectric stack and delivers the vibration to the <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> through the free mass, which forms the percussive motion. Based on the theory of conservation of momentum and Newton’s impact law, collision process of the percussive system under no-load condition is analyzed to establish the collision model between the percussive horn, the free mass, and the <b>drill</b> <b>tool.</b> The collision model shows that free mass transfers high-frequency small-amplitude vibration of percussive horn into low-frequency large-amplitude vibration of <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> through impact. As an important parameter of free mass, the greater {{the weight of the}} free mass, the higher the kinetic energy obtained by <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> after collision. High-speed camera system and drilling experiments are employed to validate the inference results of collision model by using a prototype of the RPUD...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{directional}} drillers {{are given}} a blue well path to follow that is predetermined by engineers and geologists before the drilling commences. When the directional driller starts the drilling process, periodic surveys are taken with a downhole instrument to provide survey data (inclination and azimuth) of the well bore. These pictures are typically taken at intervals between 10-150 meters (30-500 feet), with 30 meters (90 feet) common during active changes of angle or direction, and distances of 60-100 meters (200-300 feet) being typical while [...] "drilling ahead" [...] (not making active changes to angle and direction). During critical angle and direction changes, especially while using a downhole motor, an MWD (Measurement while <b>drilling)</b> <b>tool</b> {{will be added to}} the drill string to provide continuously updated measurements that may be used for (near) real-time adjustments.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{instrument}} is commonly used in inspections of oil field tool pipe for metal surface pits, fractures, and roundness before being shipped to drilling sites for exploratory wells. The process of inspections are designed to remove weakened drill pipe, so that pipe will not fracture during <b>drilling.</b> <b>Tool</b> pipe with thicker than 1" [...] walls for a 4" [...] diameter tube of hardened steel, fitted with tapered thread collars are re-used after drilling is complete, and thinner-walled tubular oil-well casing is in place. Electronic instrumentation similar to the spherometer in design are modified at inspection plants for casing, tubing, and drill pipe. The equivalent measurements in optics would be for a cylinder, or lens with a cylindrical component having an optical axis, where a plane through the lens would produce an oval circumference.|$|E

40|$|Drilling tools {{with great}} {{cantilever}} {{are used for}} the purpose of deep drilling. Vibrations of the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> caused by changing cutting forces, based on form and position errors of a pilot hole, affects the drilling quality. Within the project IntiBo fundamental mechatronic and control insights on the integration of adaptronic components are being developed by the Fraunhofer IPT exemplified by a <b>drilling</b> <b>tool.</b> Such components contribute {{to the fact that the}} vibrations of the tool and machine structure are compensated, as well as form and position errors in the work piece are minimized. The construction of <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> enables the use of different adaptronic positioning systems. An integrated sensor actor system in the top of the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> guarantee a highly dynamic radial drooping of the cutting edge. The surface of the drilling hole can thereby be structured with a maximum drooping frequency of several hundred hertz or a maximum stroke of 130 urn. Form and position errors of the work piece are compensated by three radially adjustable guiding pads, which are positioned with an offset of 120 on the circumference of the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool.</b> A third positioning system at the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> body is used for active vibration damping of the tool structure. Based on an intelligent combination of different sensor actor systems, the precision of the machine tool can be clearly improved in relation to surface quality and geometrical accuracy of the work piece. New control loops for multi variable adaptronic systems, as they are developed within the project IntiBo, are essential for this purpose...|$|E
