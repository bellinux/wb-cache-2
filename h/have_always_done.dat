On 10 August 1897 (according to his laboratory notebooks), Hoffmann found a better method for making ASA, from salicylic acid refluxed with acetic anhydride.|$|E
25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> my best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|Again and again, {{revert to}} your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, {{if she has}} taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.|$|E

500|$|For {{the fact}} is as I soon came to realise myself, and then heard from others later, that the Colchians are {{obviously}} Egyptian. When the notion occurred to me, [...] I asked both the Colchians and the Egyptians about it, {{and found that the}} Colchians had better recall of the Egyptians than the Egyptians did of them. Some Egyptians said that they thought the Colchians originated with Sesostris’ army, but I myself guessed their Egyptian origin not only because the Colchians are dark-skinned and curly-haired (which does not count for much by itself, because these features are common in others too) but more importantly because Colchians, Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only peoples in the world who practise circumcision and who <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, he {{appeared}} in Jean-Marc Piché's action/supernatural horror film The Minion alongside Françoise Robertson Lundgren portrays Lukas Sadorov, a middle eastern templar and member of an order who are charged with guarding the gateway to Hell that, if opened, will unleash all evil. The {{only thing that can}} open it is a key which is sought by the Minion, a demonic spirit that transfers itself into the nearby host body when his previous one is killed off. Awakening in New York City, the Minion tracks down Karen Goodleaf as Lukas arrives to America to protect her and the key. Michael Haag in his book Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's Temple to the Freemasons (2009) said, [...] "The budget for this film was $12million. A pity they did not spend a cent on research (citing that one reference was 600 years out) ... Lundgren is a butt-kicking Templar monk with a spiked leather glove whose sacred duty it is to do what the Templars <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> and stop a key that has kept the Anti-christ imprisoned for thousands of years from falling into the right hands.". The DVD and Video Guide of 2005 described the film as being [...] "possibly one of the worst films ever".|$|E

2500|$|The {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court in 1999. The ADL agreed to pay $175,000 for the court costs of the groups, two of them Jewish, that sued it, promised that it would not seek {{information}} from sources it knew could not legally disclose such information, consented to remove sensitive information like criminal records or Social Security numbers from its files, and spent $25,000 in order to further relations between the Jewish, Arab and black communities. When the case was settled, Hussein Ibish, director of communications for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), claimed that the ADL had gathered data [...] "systematically in a program whose clear intent was to undermine civil rights and Arab-American organizations". ADL national director Abraham Foxman called the ADC's claims [...] "absolutely untrue", saying that, [...] "if it were true, they would have won their case", and noted that no court found the ADL guilty of any wrongdoing. The ADL released a statement saying that the settlement [...] "explicitly recognizes ADL's right to gather information in any lawful and constitutionally protected manner, which we <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> and will continue to do". John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt claim that the organization, rather than defending Jews from bigotry, was targeting individuals critical of Israel or of U.S. support for Israel.|$|E
2500|$|Unionists criticised the decision. Martin Smyth said, [...] "We {{are told}} that the two {{communities}} have to live together. We had a classic illustration of a name that brought the two communities together – Londonderry. 'London' indicates the British tradition and 'Derry' the Irish tradition. But the Government decided {{to do away with}} 'London' {{in the name of the}} Council." [...] William Ross said, [...] "Derry has never been used as the name of the city or of the island of Londonderry except as a shortened version of a longer name. The name was Derry Columbkille for centuries. It was Londonderry for centuries. Before that it was Derry Calgach [...] Those who sought the change sought it for no good reason. Their aim was to open a door. [...] It is beyond me how the name Derry city council will be separated from the concept of Londonderry city in the public mind. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the Republican elements in Londonderry city will ignore the name as they <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>done.</b> They now have a lever to put up Derry city right across the board. [...] People in Northern Ireland see it as an anti-British move by the most extreme Republican movements in Londonderry and the rest of Northern Ireland." ...|$|E
