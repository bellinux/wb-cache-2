30|$|A {{theory of}} {{financial}} innovation must capture the <b>features</b> <b>that</b> {{are unique to}} financial innovations.

A similarity comparison involves comparing the <b>feature</b> lists <b>that</b> represent the concepts. <b>Features</b> <b>that</b> are shared in the feature lists are commonalities of the pair and <b>features</b> <b>that</b> are contained in one feature set but not the other are differences of the pair. It is possible to account for people's intuitions or ratings of the similarities between concepts by assuming that judgments of similarity increase {{with the number of}} commonalities (weighted by the salience of those commonalities) and decreases with the number of differences (weighted by the salience of the differences).|$|R
5|$|The {{aqueduct}} {{was built}} of local limestone. Stones were attached {{with the use}} of pozzolana. It was this successful <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> gave most praise to Bontadini.

5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} <b>feature</b> <b>that</b> distinguished Maqam al-Khawwas {{from the}} Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, large groups of women and children from the villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, socialize with other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E
