5|$|Guidelines for the {{preparation}} of Krishna icons in design and architecture are described in medieval-era Sanskrit texts on Hindu temple arts such as Vaikhanasa agama, Vishnu dharmottara, Brihat samhita, and Agni Purana. Similarly, early medieval-era Tamil texts also contain guidelines for sculpting Krishna and Rukmini Devi (she is {{sometimes referred to as}} Sauriraja-pperumal in Tamil). Several statues made according to these <b>guidelines</b> <b>are</b> in the collections of the Government Museum, Chennai.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this <b>guideline</b> <b>is</b> to present {{evidence-based}} and consensus-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postoperative delirium. The cornerstones of the <b>guideline</b> <b>are</b> the preoperative identification and handling of patients at risk, adequate intraoperative care, postoperative detection of delirium and management of delirious patients. The scope of this <b>guideline</b> <b>is</b> not to cover ICU delirium. Considering that many medical disciplines {{are involved in the}} treatment of surgical patients, a team-based approach should be implemented into daily practice. This <b>guideline</b> <b>is</b> aimed to promote knowledge and education in the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative setting not only among anaesthesiologists but also among all other healthcare professionals involved in the care of surgical patients...|$|R

The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp cordage.

5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these <b>guidelines</b> <b>are</b> not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these <b>guidelines</b> <b>are</b> always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Lung {{cancer is the}} most common malignancy and screening can decrease the mortality. High quality screening <b>guideline</b> <b>is</b> necessary and important for effective work. Our study is to review and evaluate the basic characteristics and methodology quality of the current global lung cancer screening guidelines so as to provide useful information for domestic study in the future. Methods Electronic searches were done in English and Chinese databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, CBM, Wanfang, and some cancer official websites. Articles were screened according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria by two researchers. The quality of <b>guidelines</b> <b>was</b> assessed by AGREE II. Results At last, a total of 11 <b>guidelines</b> with methodology <b>were</b> included. The <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> issued mainly by USA (81 %). Canada and China developed one, respectively. As for quality, the average score in the “Scale {{and objective}}” of all <b>guidelines</b> <b>was</b> 80, the average score in the “Participants” was 52, the average score in the “rigorism” was 50, the average score in the “clarity” was 76, the average score in the “application” was 43 and the average score in the “independence” was 59. The highest average score was found in 2013 and 2015. Canada guideline had higher quality in six domains. 7 <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> evaluated as A level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gallstone {{disease is}} a {{frequent}} disorder in the Western world with a prevalence of 10 - 20 %. Recommendations for the assessment and management of gallstones vary internationally. The aim of this systematic review was to assess quality of guideline recommendations for treatment of gallstones. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and websites of relevant associations <b>were</b> systematically searched. <b>Guidelines</b> without a critical appraisal of literature were excluded. Quality of <b>guidelines</b> <b>was</b> determined using the AGREE II instrument. Recommendations without consensus or with low level of evidence were considered to define problem areas and clinical research gaps. RESULTS: Fourteen <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> included. Overall quality of <b>guidelines</b> <b>was</b> low, with a mean score of 57 / 100 (standard deviation 19). Five of 14 <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> considered suitable for use in clinical practice without modifications. Ten recommendations from all included <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> based on low level of evidence and subject to controversy. These included major topics, such as definition of symptomatic gallstones, indications for cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiography. CONCLUSION: Only five <b>guidelines</b> on gallstones <b>are</b> evidence-based and of a high quality, but even in these controversy exists on important topics. High quality evidence is needed in specific areas before an international <b>guideline</b> can <b>be</b> developed and endorsed worldwide...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo classify, summarize, {{and compare}} the health {{economic}} guidelines (HE) issued in Europe, North America, and Australia to clarify {{similarities and differences between}} them. Materials and MethodsIn a literature review HE <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> classified according to whether they were 1) formalized, 2) informal, or 3) guidelines for health economic methods. All the <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> summarized in a table format according to 15 important methodological aspects. The aspects were compared both within and between the three groups. ResultsA total of 25 <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> identified, seven formalized, eight informal, and 10 guidelines for HE methods. The levels of agreement for methodological aspects within groups were 40 % to 100 %, 25 % to 100 % and 30 % to 100 % for the formalized, informal, and HE guidelines, respectively. The formal <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> slightly more homogenous than the other groups. The between-group comparison showed that the <b>guidelines</b> <b>were</b> in agreement for about 75 % of methodological aspects. Disagreement between <b>guidelines</b> <b>was</b> found in choice of perspective, resources, and costs that {{should be included in the}} analysis, and in methods of evaluating resources used.
