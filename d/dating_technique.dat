5|$|Creationists {{claim that}} {{evolution}} relies on {{certain types of}} evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. For example, {{it is argued that}} radiometric <b>dating</b> <b>technique</b> of evaluating a material's age based on the radioactive decay rates of certain isotopes generates inconsistent and thus unreliable results. Radiocarbon dating based on the carbon-14 isotope has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay relies on a number of unwarranted assumptions such as the principle of uniformitarianism, consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as closed systems. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the C2RMF {{researchers}} published {{results of}} further investigations to establish when the Paris skull had been carved. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated {{the use of}} lapidary machine tools in its carving. The results of a new <b>dating</b> <b>technique</b> known as quartz hydration dating (QHD) demonstrated that the Paris skull had been carved later than a reference quartz specimen artifact, {{known to have been}} cut in 1740. The researchers conclude that the SEM and QHD results combined with the skull's known provenance indicate it was carved in the 18th or 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Tranquillityite forms thin stripes up to 15 by 65 micrometres in size in basaltic rocks, {{where it}} was {{produced}} at a late crystallization stage. It is associated with troilite, pyroxferroite, cristobalite and alkali feldspar. The mineral is nearly opaque and appears dark red-brown in thin crystals. The analyzed samples contains less than 10% impurities (Y, Al, Mn, Cr, Nb and other rare-earth element) and up to 0.01% (100 ppm) of uranium. Presence of significant amount of uranium allowed to estimate the age of tranquillityite and some associated minerals in Apollo 11 samples as 3710 million years using the uranium-lead <b>dating</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|E

25|$|Kostal Cone in the Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field of}} east-central British Columbia is a cinder cone responsible for basaltic lava flows comprising a lava bed, damming {{the southern end}} of McDougall Lake. There has been activity at this site as recently as 7,600years ago at Dragon Cone, though more likely less than 1,000years ago. Kostal Cone is too young for the potassium-argon <b>dating</b> <b>technique</b> (usable on specimens over 100,000years old), and no charred organic material for radiocarbon dating has been found. However, the uneroded structure of the cone with the existence of trees on its flanks and summit have made it an area for dendrochronology studies, which reveals the growth of tree-ring patterns. Tree-ring dating has revealed an age of about 400years for Kostal Cone, indicating it formed around 1500. This makes Kostal Cone the youngest volcano in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and thus one of the youngest in Canada.|$|E

40|$|Application of {{relative}} and absolute <b>dating</b> <b>techniques</b> in the Alpine environment - The Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene climate oscillation and the Alpine landscape evolution of Val di Rabbi (Trentino, Italy) were reconstructed using a combined methodology {{of relative}} and absolute <b>dating</b> <b>techniques.</b> The research {{was carried out}} in the following four steps: 1) an earlier study examined the investigated area (aerial photos, soil mapping etc.) to detect and sample the most representative sites (soils and boulders); 2) the extraction of the oldest organic matter fraction from the soil profiles followed by radiocarbon dating; 3) the comparison of the 14 C dating results with the 10 Be age sequence from representative boulders; 4) the addition of relative <b>dating</b> <b>techniques</b> to the absolute ones to detect signals of Alpine landscape evolution. We found close links among the results obtained from the relative dating and the absolute ones, showing the dynamics of an Alpine landscape within a relatively small area. The combination of relative and absolute <b>dating</b> <b>techniques</b> is a promising tool for the reconstruction of landscape history and to detect human influences in high-elevation Alpine areas on siliceous substrates...|$|R
