5|$|In the Second Battle of Zürich, the French regained {{control of}} the city, {{along with the rest}} of Switzerland. Notably, Masséna out-generaled Korsakov; {{surrounded}} him, tricked him, and then took more than <b>half</b> <b>his</b> army as a prisoner. Massena also captured the baggage train and most of Korsakov cannons, and inflicted over 8,000 casualties. Most of the fighting took place on both banks of the river Limmat, up to the gates of Zürich, and in part within the city itself. Zürich had declared itself neutral, and was spared general destruction. General Oudinot commanded the French forces on the right bank and general Joseph Mortier, those on the left.|$|E

5|$|Takanohana was the {{youngest}} ever {{to reach the top}} division at just 17, and he set a number of other age-related records. He had a solid but aggressive style, looking to get a right hand grip on his opponents' mawashi and move them quickly out of the ring. He won over <b>half</b> <b>his</b> bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E

5|$|As Benaud's deputy, Harvey helped {{materially}} in Australia's surprise 4–0 series {{victory to}} reclaim the Ashes. Harvey's form was modest, though. He scored 296 runs at 42.29, {{with more than half}} coming in one innings—a brilliant 167 in the Second Test at Melbourne, more than <b>half</b> <b>his</b> team's 308, which helped secure an eight wicket victory in the match. Otherwise, a 41 in the Fourth Test was the only other time he passed 25 in the series. Outside the Tests, he scored 92 in the second match of the season between New South Wales and England, and ended the season with 949 runs at 49.95. It was season of two-halves; in the latter two months, he scored only 339 runs.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{collapse}} of the Imperial army, the battle proved to be of little strategic significance. At the insistence of Francis I, the French army resumed the siege of Carignano, where Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, Enghien was forced to send twenty-three companies of Italian and Gascon infantry—and nearly <b>half</b> <b>his</b> heavy cavalry—to Picardy, which had been invaded by Charles V. Left without a real army, Enghien was unable to capture Milan. D'Avalos, meanwhile, routed a fresh force of Italian infantry under Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano at the Battle of Serravalle. The end of the war saw a return to the status quo in northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed {{it would be easier to}} manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined <b>half</b> <b>his</b> winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.|$|E

5|$|In August 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army. According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, {{he should have been}} returned to Austria. Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment), he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly <b>half</b> <b>his</b> time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines. He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914. On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, Hitler's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's Gefreiter rank. He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.|$|E
5|$|It was at Argentan {{that the}} {{friendship}} between Carrouges and Le Gris began to deteriorate, as Le Gris rapidly became a favourite of Count Pierre. While Carrouges was overlooked, Le Gris was rewarded for {{service to the}} Count, inheriting his father's lordship of the castle at Exmes and being granted a newly purchased estate at Arnou-le-Faucon. Carrouges became jealous of his friend {{and the two men}} soon became rivals at the court. A year after entering Count Pierre's service, tragedy struck Carrouges as both his wife and son died of unknown but natural causes. In response, Carrouges left home and joined the service of Jean de Vienne accompanied by a retinue of nine squires. With this force, under the overall command of King Charles V, Carrouges distinguished himself in minor actions against the English in Beuzeville, Carentan and Coutances in a five-month campaign, during which over <b>half</b> <b>his</b> retinue were killed in battle or by disease.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 2009, Coulson {{signed for}} League Two club Grimsby Town on an initial one-month loan. He made his debut {{two days later}} after {{starting}} in a 0–0 draw away to Lincoln City. He scored his first goal for Grimsby on 5 December 2009 in his fourth appearance, a 1–1 home draw with Dagenham & Redbridge, opening the scoring in the 36th minute before Dagenham equalised in the second <b>half.</b> <b>His</b> loan was extended for a second month in December 2009, keeping him at Grimsby until 23 January 2010. Shortly before the loan was due to expire, Coulson's stay at Grimsby was extended {{until the end of}} 2009–10 on 19 January 2010. He finished the season with five goals in 29 appearances for Grimsby, with the team being relegated to the Conference Premier.|$|E
