5|$|Asipatravana/Asipatrakanana (forest of sword leaves): The Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana reserve this hell <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who digresses {{from the}} {{religious}} teachings of the Vedas and indulges in heresy. The Vishnu Purana states that wanton tree-felling leads to this hell. Yamadutas beat them with whips {{as they try to}} run away in the forest where palm trees have swords as leaves. Afflicted with injury of whips and swords, they faint and cry out for help in vain.|$|E

5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, and that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Louis Faidherbe, the {{governor}} of Senegal, inaugurated the Bouteville boat that was capable of transporting 150 passengers, animals {{and all kinds of}} goods. The boat made ten crosses every day and the fares differed: five centimes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> 50 centimes for a horse, cow or camel, and two francs for a carriage. In less than a year it was obvious that this system was overrun and a second boat was introduced but with no success.|$|E

5|$|Kalasutra (thread of Time/Death): The Bhagavata Purana assigns this hell to {{a murderer}} of a brahmin (the Hindu priestly caste), while the Devi Bhagavata Purana allocates it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who disrespects his parents, elders, {{ancestors}} or brahmins.

5|$|In {{order to}} be issued an {{identity}} card, one needs to fill in a form, which {{should be taken to}} the Identity Documents and Passport Regime Units within the District Police Stations. The forms could be obtained at all District Police Stations.

First-time appliers must also provide a valid birth certificate.

(Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> that size could not live normally in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) he or she must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} of the government budget on 14 October 2008, each person over the age of seventy living in the Republic of Ireland was entitled to a medical card providing free medical, dental and optical treatment and medicines. The budget proposed to change this and introduced a means-tested system of benefits. The proposed income eligibility limits to be introduced for over seventies were published on the Health Service Executive's website on 15 October 2008. The site stated that the net weekly income limit for medical card eligibility would be €201.50 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>person,</b> €173.50 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>person</b> living with <b>a</b> family and €298 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> married couple. One day later, these eligibility levels were increased so that the income rate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>person</b> would be €240.30, the income rate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> married couple was increased to €480.60 per week, whilst the previously proposed rate of €173.50 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>person</b> living with <b>a</b> family was abolished.|$|R
