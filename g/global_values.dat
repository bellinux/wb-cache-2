This paper examines ways that labor educators have modified <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains to teach workers about their industries, and uses two case studies to illustrate the application that <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains have to comprehensive organizing campaigns.

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} {{theoretical}} framework to explain and predict governance patterns in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains. It draws on three streams of literature, transaction costs economics, production networks, and technological capability and firm-level learning to identify three variables that play {{a large role in}} determining how <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains are governed. These are 1) the complexity of transactions, 2) the ability to codify transactions, and 3) the capabilities in the supply-base. The theory predicts how governance patterns in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains are expected to change in accordance with these variables. The paper highlights the dynamism and complexity of <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains through four brief industry case studies: apparel, bicycles, horticulture and electronics. A parsimonious theory cannot explain and predict all outcomes. Institutions, geographic and social contexts and path dependence have profound effects on the governance and change in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains. Nevertheless, the theory advances previous formulations of <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain theory. The paper concludes by identifying key areas for future work, including the application of the framework to existing and new studies of <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains, using the theory to craft policy tools for industrial upgrading, and the development of methods for measuring the key variables in the model.

40|$|PURPOSE – The {{main purpose}} of this article is to {{identify}} some emergent issues when sustainability is introduced into <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains. These issues deal with the conditions under which a sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain might gain international competitiveness. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – An exploratory research was conducted, based on a case study. The main players of the JOBEK's <b>Global</b> <b>Value</b> Chain were identified and interviews were carried out with representatives of these players. A thematic content analysis was developed, supported by Atlas TI software, using interview data and documents. FINDINGS – Three main themes have emerged, which can be considered as underlying issues of an emerging concept that the authors call the “sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain”. These are: bargaining power between the chain's players; a differentiation strategy along the <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain; and a collaborative awareness-building process along the <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – Although the findings result from a single case study, the characteristics of this case have allowed the authors to suggest an emergent concept for the field of international business: the concept of a sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain. This has implications for the development of a new research field and for the introduction of some ethical concerns into this field. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – Managers of organizations that participate in sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chains may consider the emerging concepts and their interrelationships as a guideline for strategic decision-making. In particular, managers need to be aware of how the relationships between power balance, CSR product differentiation strategies and awareness building may influence the competitiveness of their sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain. ORIGINALITY/VALUE – The article proposes the emergence of a new concept that has important ethical implications for international business: the sustainable <b>global</b> <b>value</b> chain. The authors suggest that the further development of this new concept is likely to stimulate the development of an emergent research field. Luciano Barin Cruz and Dirk Michael Boeh...|$|R

40|$|Histories. (Under the {{direction}} of Thomas M. Conte.) Value prediction is a speculative technique to break true data dependencies by using history to predict values before they are computed. Previous research focused on exploiting two types of value locality (computation-based and context-based) in the local value history, which is the value sequence produced by the same instruction that is being predicted. Besides local value history, value locality also exists in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> history, which is the value sequence produced by all dynamic instructions according to their execution order. In this thesis, {{a new type of}} value locality, computational locality in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> history is studied. A prediction scheme, called gDiff, is designed to exploit one special and most common case of this computational model, the stride-based computation, in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> history. Experiments show that there exists very strong stride type of locality in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> sequences and ideally the gDiff predictor can achieve 73 % prediction accuracy for all value producing instructions without any hybrid scheme, much higher than local stride and local context prediction schemes. However, the ability to realistically exploit locality in <b>global</b> <b>value</b> history is greatly challenged b...|$|R
