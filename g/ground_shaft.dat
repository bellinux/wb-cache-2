50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of a profilometer {{is that it}} is not accurate when the size of the features of the surface are close to the same size as the stylus. Another disadvantage is that profilometers have difficulty detecting flaws of the same general size as the roughness of the surface. There are also limitations for non-contact instruments. For example, instruments that rely on optical interference cannot resolve features that are less than some fraction of the operating wavelength. This limitation can make it difficult to accurately measure roughness even on common objects, since the interesting features may be well below the wavelength of light. The wavelength of red light is about 650 nm, while the average roughness, (Ra) of a <b>ground</b> <b>shaft</b> might be 200 nm.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} {{design of}} a single-nave hall with the span of 12 m and pole height from 3. 0 to 4. 5 m. The hall {{can be used for}} warehousing goods, garaging vehicles or shedding farm animals. Construction material is mostly round timber. The structure consists of a strut brace frame with reinforced saddle diaphragm beam in longitudinal module 3. 6 m, timber binding rafter and transversal trusses. Material, construction type and solution of details meet requirements and possibilities of do-it-yourself manufacture and assembly. The construction system of the hall has options for the rigid damp-proof roof course or for the prestressed canvas made of technical textile with water-proof surface finish. Foundation of the building is on concrete abutments, or – in a less traditional way – on concrete-encased poles in the <b>ground</b> <b>shaft.</b> Optional technical solutions (textile roofing, pole foundations) can reduce the framework costs including roofing by about 9 % and total house raising costs by about 45 %...|$|E

40|$|In {{manufacturing}} processes, {{surfaces and}} their properties {{are as important}} as the bulk properties of the materials. Surface treatment is an important aspect of all manufacturing processes. It has been used to impart certain physical and mechanical properties, such as appearance, corrosion, friction, wear and fatigue resistance. Widely used methods of finishing treatment that create necessary parts with the given roughness usually do not provide optimum quality of the surface. Therefore, methods of surface plastic deformation (SPD) are used. One of the most effective representative is the diamond pressing. In this paper the effect of diamond pressing process with a different pressing force (50, 100, 150, 200, 250) N on the state of heat-treated alloy steel surfaces was studied and the results of the experiments are presented. Enhancements on the micro hardness of the heat treated alloy steel surfaces that have been processed by diamond pressing up to the following percentages compared to the ground surfaces: 32, 28, 31 and 43 % for D 2, O 1, H 13 and 3115 hardened alloy steel surfaces, respectively. In addition, {{it has been shown that}} there is an enhancement on the surface quality of heat-treated alloy steel surfaces. The best enhancement of the average surface roughness (Ra) was 16. 6, 45, 36 and 50 % for D 2, O 1, H 13 and 3115, respectively, which are heat-treated. For the microstructure analysis, micrograph of the processed surfaces of D 2 heat-treated alloy steel was given. It has been shown that the depth of plastic deformed layer about 200 &# 956;m. Experimental scheme for wear testing of steel shaft in the friction couple type shaft-cuff and results has been given in this paper. It has been shown that Diamond pressing process has a considerable effect on the wear resistance of D 2 heat treated alloy steel and it is concluded that the DPP has an improvement on the wear resistance of D 2 heat treated alloy steel shaft that have been processed by diamond pressing relative to the <b>ground</b> <b>shaft...</b>|$|E
40|$|AC motors {{are largely}} {{used in a}} wide range of modern systems, from {{household}} appliances to automated industry applications such as: ventilations systems, fans, pumps, conveyors and machine tool drives. Inverters are widely used in industrial and commercial applications due to the growing need for speed control in ASD systems. Fast switching transients and the common mode voltage, in interaction with parasitic capacitive couplings, may cause many unwanted problems in the ASD applications. These include shaft voltage and leakage currents. One of the inherent characteristics of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques is the generation of the common mode voltage, which is defined as the voltage between the electrical neutral of the inverter output and the <b>ground.</b> <b>Shaft</b> voltage can cause bearing currents when it exceeds the amount of breakdown voltage level of the thin lubricant film between the inner and outer rings of the bearing. This phenomenon is the main reason for early bearing failures. A rapid development in power switches technology has lead to a drastic decrement of switching rise and fall times. Because there is considerable capacitance between the stator windings and the frame, there can be a significant capacitive current (ground current escaping to earth through stray capacitors inside a motor) if the common mode voltage has high frequency components. This current leads to noises and Electromagnetic Interferences (EMI) issues in motor drive systems. These problems have been dealt with using a variety of methods which have been reported in the literature. However, cost and maintenance issues have prevented these methods from being widely accepted. Extra cost or rating of the inverter switches is usually the price to pay for such approaches. Thus, the determination of cost-effective techniques for shaft and common mode voltage reduction in ASD systems, with the focus on the first step of the design process, is the targeted scope of this thesis. An introduction to this research – including a description of the research problem, the literature review and an account of the research progress linking the research papers – is presented in Chapter 1. Electrical power generation from renewable energy sources, such as wind energy systems, has become a crucial issue because of environmental problems and a predicted future shortage of traditional energy sources. Thus, Chapter 2 focuses on the shaft voltage analysis of stator-fed induction generators (IG) and Doubly Fed Induction Generators DFIGs in wind turbine applications. This shaft voltage analysis includes: topologies, high frequency modelling, calculation and mitigation techniques. A back-to-back AC-DC-AC converter is investigated in terms of shaft voltage generation in a DFIG. Different topologies of LC filter placement are analysed in an effort to eliminate the shaft voltage. Different capacitive couplings exist in the motor/generator structure and any change in design parameters affects the capacitive couplings. Thus, an appropriate design for AC motors should lead to the smallest possible shaft voltage. Calculation of the shaft voltage based on different capacitive couplings, and an investigation of the effects of different design parameters are discussed in Chapter 3. This is achieved through 2 -D and 3 -D finite element simulation and experimental analysis. End-winding parameters of the motor are also effective factors in the calculation of the shaft voltage and have not been taken into account in previous reported studies. Calculation of the end-winding capacitances is rather complex because of the diversity of end winding shapes and the complexity of their geometry. A comprehensive analysis of these capacitances has been carried out with 3 -D finite element simulations and experimental studies to determine their effective design parameters. These are documented in Chapter 4. Results of this analysis show that, by choosing appropriate design parameters, it is possible to decrease the shaft voltage and resultant bearing current in the primary stage of generator/motor design without using any additional active and passive filter-based techniques. The common mode voltage is defined by a switching pattern and, by using the appropriate pattern; the common mode voltage level can be controlled. Therefore, any PWM pattern which eliminates or minimizes the common mode voltage will be an effective shaft voltage reduction technique. Thus, common mode voltage reduction of a three-phase AC motor supplied with a single-phase diode rectifier is the focus of Chapter 5. The proposed strategy is mainly based on proper utilization of the zero vectors. Multilevel inverters are also used in ASD systems which have more voltage levels and switching states, and can provide more possibilities to reduce common mode voltage. A description of common mode voltage of multilevel inverters is investigated in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 investigates the elimination techniques of the shaft voltage in a DFIG based on the methods presented in the literature by the use of simulation results. However, it could be shown that every solution to reduce the shaft voltage in DFIG systems has its own characteristics, and these have to be taken into account in determining the most effective strategy. Calculation of the capacitive coupling and electric fields between the outer and inner races and the balls at different motor speeds in symmetrical and asymmetrical shaft and balls positions is discussed in Chapter 8. The analysis is carried out using finite element simulations to determine the conditions which will increase the probability of high rates of bearing failure due to current discharges through the balls and races...|$|E

Each of all these formulae has been derived under some comparatively simple assumptions. Although some of these formulae seem to be fairly pertinent for a ground of a certain character, such as homogeneous Quarternary system, it seems to be unreasonable, in many cases, to estimate the earth pressure by the aid of these formulae, while the nature and the conditions of a ground are fairly compricated in general. In this article, therefore, the author described a method for estimating the earth pressure which acts on the outer wall of a shaft lining utilizing the results of measurement of stresses which arise on the inner wall surface of the lining.

The above-ground portion of a fire ant nest, the mound, consisted of a dense matrix of narrow tunnels. Below <b>ground</b> level, subterranean <b>shafts</b> and nodes were excavated through the grass root system (10 – 20 cm), connecting the mound tunnels to the subterranean chambers. Chambers averaged ~ 5 cm 2 and appeared at depths from 10 – 80 cm below ground level. The orientation of mound tunnels and subterranean shafts was more often vertical than horizontal, probably facilitating the diurnal micro-migration of colony members {{back and forth from the}} subterranean chambers to the mound. The mean size of groups in the subterranean chambers of field nests was remarkably small relative to colony size (~ 200 individuals per chamber: 50 % workers, 50 % brood).
