25|$|Bait tactics {{exploited}} the US focus on body counts and its lavish use of firepower, including relatively ineffective Harassment and Interdiction (H) fire. One related method was {{to occupy a}} hamlet or deploy near it, digging into positions at the treeline on {{the perimeter of the}} hamlet for attack or defense. ARVN or US forces would often counterattack by unleashing air and artillery strikes on the community, causing destruction to the persons and property of the civilians {{they were supposed to be}} protecting.

25|$|Initially, the {{touching}} {{ceremony was}} an informal process. Sickly individuals could petition {{the court for}} a royal touch and the touch would be performed at the King's <b>earliest</b> <b>convenience.</b> At times, the King of France would touch afflicted subjects during his royal walkabout. The rapid spread of tuberculosis across France and England, however, necessitated a more formal and efficient touching process. By the time of Louis XIV of France, placards indicating the days and times the King would be available for royal touches were posted regularly; sums of money were doled out as charitable support. In England, the process was extremely formal and efficient. As late as 1633, the Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Church contained a Royal Touch ceremony. The monarch (king or queen), sitting upon a canopied throne, touched the afflicted individual, and presented that individual with a coin – usually an Angel, a gold coin the value of which varied from about 6 shillings to about 10 shillings – by pressing it against the afflicted's neck.|$|E
2500|$|McCarver's {{regiment}} {{had barely}} received its designation {{when it was}} placed {{in danger of losing}} it. In January 1862 Brigadier General William J. Hardee made a decision to detach four of the regiment's best armed and equipped companies (Companies A, B, E & H) and designate them as the 9th Arkansas Infantry Battalion, and place them under the command of Major John H. Kelly. It was Brigadier General Hardee's intention was to take all of the organized Arkansas troops with him when transferred his command to Kentucky in September 1862 except for Colonel Borland's own regiment. [...] However Hardee did not wish to accept poorly armed and untrained troops. [...] It appears that there were sufficient arms to equip four of McCarver's companies, so these companies were detached from the regiment as a separate battalion and departed with General Hardee, with the balance of the regiment to follow when they were properly armed and equipped. Clearly, McCarver considered the detachment of those companies to be temporary, because when the official notice of organization was sent to the Confederate War Department, he assigned the detached companies designations (Cos. A-B-E-H) and noted that they were detached with General Hardee. This arrangement caused some confusion at Richmond, which wrote back to Borland, [...] "Does Col. J. S. McCarver's command consist of only five companies, or a full regiment? If less than a regiment, it will be known as the Eighth Battalion; if ten companies, the Fourteenth Regiment Arkansas Volunteers. Please inform the Department at your <b>earliest</b> <b>convenience</b> the exact state and condition of his command. Maj. F. W. Desha's command will be known as the Seventh Battalion Arkansas Volunteers." [...] McCarver certainly considered that he had a full regiment (the tenth company had arrived on December 18), because as late as February 1862 he was signing correspondence as [...] "colonel commanding 14th Arkansas Regiment." ...|$|E

The results indicate that benefits of early accession outweigh weaknesses and it is thus imperative for the candidate countries to accede to the EU as soon as possible.
