40|$|As {{many will}} recall, for taxable years {{beginning}} after 1986, taxpayers {{were required to}} capitalize the direct costs of production and the “proper share” of the indirect costs (including taxes) which were assignable {{to the production of}} property. 1 That enactment generated stiff resistance from the agricultural sector, particularly among livestock producers, with the result that legislation enacted in 19882 made the <b>provisions</b> <b>inapplicable</b> to “animals” produced by the taxpayer in a farming business for costs incurred after December 31, 1988. 3 For animals not “produced by the taxpayer in a farming business,” the preproductive rules continued to apply. 4 Thus non-material participation landlords with little or no involvement in management could be subject to the preproductive period capitalization rules. 5 However, the rules were not eased for producers of plants. Effective August 21, 2000, final regulations governing the application of preproductive rules to plants (and to animals still subject to the rules) were issued. ...|$|R
5000|$|Confidentiality. The [...] "Speech or Debate" [...] {{clause of}} the Constitution, {{referenced}} in the above congressional resolutions, states that [...] "for any Speech or Debate in either House, Members shall not be questioned in any other Place." [...] While this clause has been interpreted to grant broad legal immunity to Members and their aides for statements made {{during the course of}} debate or when activity occurs in the performance of [...] "legislative acts," [...] it has been made clear in recent years that the protection does not extend to representational responsibilities generally. The protection has been extended to areas where it has been considered necessary to prevent impairment of deliberations and other legitimate legislative activities. Of major concern here has been {{the extent to which a}} policy permitting significant public dissemination of our products might render the protection that our support to Members currently enjoys under the umbrella of this constitutional <b>provision</b> <b>inapplicable</b> to congressional communications with CRS. Currently, CRS products prepared for the Congress are considered to be protected from scrutiny by third parties without permission of the Congress or the Member for whom the work was prepared. Stated simply, the concern in this regard is that if the Service were to become generally known to frequently distribute products directly to the general public—and thereby to be seen more as a purveyor of products to the public rather than as adjunct staff to Congress—we might be subject to [...] "questioning" [...] (i.e., litigation, subpoena, or other demand for production of documents) regarding our work that would do serious harm to our confidential working relationship with our congressional clients.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of pecuniary {{benefits}} and salaries for the public clerks the Romanian legislator has adopted a solution which is not entirely valid. The text of the Law no. 188 / 1999 is not clear, sending for the solution offered by a future regulation, which is still under debate. The amount of benefits for the public worker is not determined by the Law – lato sensu, so the clerks drew applications before the domestic courts, {{in order to determine}} the amount of their rights or to ask protection because they had suffered discrimination in breach of art. 14 read in conjunction with art. 6 of the Convention, or art. 1 from the First Protocol. The Romanian Constitutional Court delivered four decisions in 2008, in which it ruled that domestic courts are not allowed to determine and to conclude discrimination situations, mostly in the matter of public clerks’ benefits and pecuniary rights. The court’s assessments held that the fundamental principle of separation of powers is breached by the court’s decisions, so they have to conclude only on the norms and not on the differences in treatment for similar situations. This attitude might determine another breach of fundamental principles, stated in art. 6 of the Convention, by the Community law, or even the Romanian Constitution, so domestic courts may use the principle of precedence of the Convention as international law and also the precedence of Community law. Those principles reveal that the relationship between the provisions of the Convention or of the Treaty and the national law of the Member States is such that by the entry into force they render automatically <b>inapplicable</b> any conflicting <b>provision</b> of the national law. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Judge plays {{a decisive}} role in {{promoting}} respect for human rights. His activity is governed by the fundamental principles of the "rule of law" concept. The principle of separation of powers is a principle that any democracy, that wants to be real, must necessarily take it into consideration and implement it. Delimitation of powers is, broadly speaking, a different jurisdiction to establish institutional authority, and to exclude other forms of mutual intrusion than those permitted by law. At European level, the criteria and conditions of the judicial domain, and the judges, receive a broader notion, more complex. The structure of today's European Union is {{based solely on the}} rules of law. Rule of law is ensured through creation of Community law that is independent and uniform for all Member States. To ensure judicial protection of individual rights conferred by Community law, transparency is indispensable to national procedural law. Therefore, the national legislation must be put in harmony with European law and the national legislator is obliged to respect the decisions of the EUCJ, which decided that, in principle, the conditions imposed by national law will not have to render virtually the rights conferred by Community law. Any judge, seized within its jurisdiction, is required to apply the provisions of Community law and protect rights which are conferred to individuals, leaving all <b>provisions</b> <b>inapplicable,</b> possibly contrary, the national law, either before or after the Community rule. European law clearly reinforces cultural and legal national judge. Community law isn’t a foreign law, it is an outside law. This law is proper to each of our States as its national law, but it also has this feature to be {{at the same time a}} common value for all...|$|R
2500|$|Since its founding, the EU has {{operated}} among an increasing plurality {{of national and}} globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, {{and in any case}} under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states [...] "have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves" [...] on the [...] "basis of reciprocity". EU law would not [...] "be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question". This meant any [...] "subsequent unilateral act" [...] of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In [...] "accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law", said the Court of Justice, the [...] "directly applicable measures of the institutions" [...] (such as the Regulations in the case) [...] "render automatically <b>inapplicable</b> any conflicting <b>provision</b> of current national law". This was necessary to prevent a [...] "corresponding denial" [...] of Treaty [...] "obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states", that could [...] "imperil the very foundations of the" [...] EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.|$|R
40|$|When {{a person}} of the older {{generation}} in a family owned company wish to transfer his ownership to {{a person in the}} younger generation this can be done through a succession of generation. Different methods can be used to proceed with such a matter, selling the company shares for a price below the market value is one example of this. When the owner transfers shares to a person in the younger generation, either as a gift or by selling them to a price below the market value, the provision in the 7 th chapter 4 § ÄB can be applicable. This provision establish that; when a gift that has been given during the grantors lifetime and when the purpose of this gift is to be equivalent to a testament, the gift shall be returned to the receiver if this action confines with the direct heirs statutory portion. A gift is to be equivalent to a testament when the giver had the intention to arrange the succession when the gift was given away, and when this gift did not amount to any economical sacrifice for the giver. There are two situations which causes a gift to be equivalent to a testament. The first situation arises when the gift is given by the giver right before his death, on his deathbed so to speak. The other situation arises when the giver keeps his right of using the gift or when he claims the right to the return, such as dividends etc, of the given property. Based upon the conditions that are to be fulfilled for a direct heir {{to make use of the}} regulation to claim his statutory portion, some situations can be constructed where the provision in the 7 th chapter 4 § ÄB should be both applicable and inapplicable, depending on the nature of the situation. However, there are situations in which it is doubtful whether a gift in a succession of generation is to be equivalent to a testament and whether there exists certain circumstances that will make the <b>provision</b> <b>inapplicable.</b> Even though it is possible to construct situations where the provision is both applicable and inapplicable, one cannot be certain about the outcome in any particular case since there might be circumstances that differs from one situation to another and which will determine whether the provision is applicable. In situations where the provision is applicable, the receiver of the gift has an obligation to return the gift or secondary to pay compensation if this is not possible. According to the wording in the provision, the receiver should not be able to determine whether to return the property or whether to pay compensation himself, this is since it is stated in the provision that the property is to be returned and payment is only to be made when this is not possible. In situation where the gift can be returned the receiver shall therefore do this regardless of his opinion of the matter...|$|R
