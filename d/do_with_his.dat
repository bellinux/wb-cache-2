This episode opens with Lamb questioning her and learning little, as she had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> disappearance.|$|E

5|$|When Marge {{takes the}} family to the Family Fun Center, she notices Nelson acting like a bully, {{especially}} when he knocks Milhouse off the track and wins a BB gun from stolen prize tickets. Bart and Nelson attempt to be friends, but Marge forbids Bart {{to hang out with}} Nelson. Bart goes to Nelson’s house anyway and starts using Nelson's new BB gun. When Nelson pressures Bart to shoot a bird in a nest, Bart accidentally kills the bird. Marge is furious that Bart killed an animal, but instead of punishing him, she refuses to have anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> destructive ways.|$|E

5000|$|A {{devotee of}} God {{who wishes to}} {{understand}} and to reach Krishna, must offer service (seva) to Krshna, with selfless devotion and love not by knowledge or worship. This Seva is of three kinds-Tanuja (to be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> body), Vittaja (to be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> money) and Mansi (mentally). The last one is the best because we spend more time outside than inside Seva.|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} home, Hinton {{initially was}} indecisive {{about what to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> life. Like many of his fellow soldiers who had returned home, he struggled to adapt to civilian life. He was also extremely uncomfortable with the public attention he received because of {{his status as a}} VC recipient. He eventually found work managing hotels on behalf of Dominion Breweries. He was initially based at the Thistle Hotel, a notorious drinking establishment in Auckland, for three years, during which he received a belated mention in despatches for his escape attempts while a POW. In December 1949 he moved to Hamilton to manage the Hamilton East Hotel. This was the first of many moves up and down the country to manage hotels.|$|E
5|$|Also {{a younger}} son, Gebhard had {{prepared}} for an ecclesiastical career with a broad, Humanist education; {{apart from his}} native German, he had learned several languages (including Latin, Italian, French), and studied history and theology. After studying at the universities of Dillingen, Ingolstadt, Perugia, Louvain and elsewhere, he began his ecclesiastical career in 1560at Augsburg. His conduct at Augsburg caused some scandal; the bishop, his uncle, petitioned the Duke of Bavaria to remonstrate with him about it, which apparently led to some improvement in his behavior. In 1561, he became a deacon at Cologne Cathedral (1561–77), a canon of St. Gereon, the basilica in Cologne (1562–67), a canon in Strassburg (1567–1601), in Ellwangen (1567–83), and in Würzburg (1569–70). In 1571, he became deacon of Strassburg Cathedral, a position he held until his death. In 1576, by papal nomination, he also became provost of the Cathedral in Augsburg. Similar to his opponent, these positions brought him influence and wealth; they had little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> priestly character.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{visits the}} office and announces {{that he wants to}} make amends for his past behavior. He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes, to spite Packer. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but once Pam goes home the {{remaining}} employees eat the cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs, supposedly as revenge for getting him fired (though none of the employees present save Nellie had anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> being fired). He then visits Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them. In the morning, Pam returns to {{the office and}} announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer's deed.|$|E

5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was a best-seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank and honest statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, and went over the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was on poor terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E
25|$|He {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} that {{he suffered from}} severe depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{to the point of}} contemplating suicide, for reasons having to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> troubled first marriage, his perceived failure as a husband and a father, his father Harold's death and Freddie Mercury's illness and death.|$|E
25|$|Noel Malcolm and Cees Leijenhorst {{deny the}} {{political}} {{background of the}} Hobbes-Boyle controversy. They argue that Hobbes’ rejection of the void has no political agenda and has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> attack on incorporeal substances, as Shapin and Schaffer claim. Both Malcolm and Leijenhorst {{call attention to the}} remarkable fact that Hobbes was already attacking incorporeal substances when he was a vacuist, and long before he became a plenist.|$|E

25|$|Photios {{did provide}} {{concession}} {{on the issue}} of jurisdictional rights concerning Bulgaria, and the papal legates made <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the Byzantine rite in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of Boris I of Bulgaria, the papacy was unable to enforce any of its claims.|$|E
25|$|Shevchenko was {{not even}} on the bench for Chelsea's penalty {{shoot-out}} victory over Manchester United at Wembley at the weekend in the season-opening Community Shield. After making a late appearance for Chelsea in their second game of the 2009–10 season, Ancelotti announced that Shevchenko would be likely to leave Chelsea before the summer transfer window closed. Despite this, Ancelotti said it had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> decision to leave Shevchenko out of Chelsea's 2009–10 Champions League squad, but just to continue playing first-team football.|$|E
25|$|From {{approximately}} June 1960 to February 1961, Oswald was in {{a personal}} relationship with Ella German, a co-worker at the factory. He proposed marriage to her at the beginning of 1961, but she refused with the explanation that she did not love him and was afraid to marry an American. Some researchers believe that German's rejection of Oswald's marriage proposal may have had much to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> disillusionment with life in the Soviet Union and his decision to return to the United States.|$|E

25|$|When Kate dismally {{claims to}} Chris (still intent on marrying Ann) that moving on from Larry will be forsaking Joe as a murderer, Chris concludes that George was right. Joe, out of excuses, {{explains}} that he sent out the cracked airheads to avoid closure, intending to notify the base later that they needed repairs. However, when the fleet crashed and made headlines, he lied to Steve and left him at the shop for arrest. Chris cannot accept this, and roars despairingly that he is torn about what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> father now.|$|E
25|$|In the 1840s {{and early}} 1850s, during {{the rule of}} Tsar Nicholas I, the {{political}} climate in Russia was stifling for many writers. This {{is evident in the}} despair and subsequent death of Gogol, and the oppression, persecution, and arrests of artists, scientists, and writers. During this time, thousands of Russian intellectuals, members of the intelligentsia, emigrated to Europe. Among them were Alexander Herzen and Turgenev himself, who moved to Western Europe in 1854, although this decision probably had more to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fateful love for Pauline Viardot than anything else.|$|E
25|$|Favre's agent, Bus Cook, {{later said}} that he also felt the Saints were {{deliberately}} trying to knock Favre out of the game, and claimed that several hits on Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner in the divisional round a week earlier crossed the line as well. It initially appeared that Cook's argument was strengthened {{by the fact that}} Warner was knocked out of that game with a chest injury (although he later returned), and retired two weeks later. However, Warner later said that the hit which knocked him out was legal, and had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> decision to retire.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} Pius IV was a {{reaction}} to the brutal rule of Paul IV and his nephews. Pius had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> predecessor's pride and arrogance and he resumed and completed the Council of Trent. Although he had fathered three children before his consecration as pope, he kept them in obscurity and out of church governance, unlike pope Paul III and pope Alexander VI. His only cardinal-nephew was Charles Borromeo, a future saint – as for Paul IV's nephews, he showed no mercy, arresting Carlo and Alfonso in 1560 (Diomede had died just after the conclave), executing Carlo in 1561 and only pardoning Alfonso after he had spent over a year in prison.|$|E
25|$|Early {{correspondence}} {{shows that}} he always liked school, and was always seeking meaning—seeking {{to do something with}} his life. In 1876, he had the chance to attend high school in Columbus, Wisconsin, which had opened that year. Like many youth, he struggled with what to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> life. After attending a year of high school, he began to teach at a Hampden school, while continuing his studies. In 1879, he attended college at the Oshkosh Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh). He left there after only one year due to financial reasons, and took a job teaching in Columbus, Wisconsin. He hoped to earn enough money to go back to college.|$|E
25|$|Francis of Assisi {{was born}} in late 1181 or early 1182, one of several {{children}} of Pietro di Bernardone, a prosperous silk merchant, and his wife Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except {{that she was a}} noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on business when Francis {{was born in}} Assisi, and Pica had him baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco ("the Frenchman"), possibly in honor of his commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French. Since the child was renamed in infancy, the change can hardly have had anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> aptitude for learning French, as some have thought.|$|E
