The 2009 edition saw instead in the role of conductor Massimo Ranieri.|$|E
5000|$|The BBC {{broadcast}} {{a production of}} the play on 7 June 1967. It marked the television debut of Anthony Hopkins, playing Étienne Plucheux. The same year, the RAI -TV of Italy gave a live broadcast from the Teatro Stabile of Genoa, directed by Luigi Squarzina, starring Olga Villi and Alberto Lionello. In 1976, the ERT gave a broadcast of play, adapted for television, directing and starring by Dinos Iliopoulos, Panos Panopoulos, Nikos Kapios, Manolis Destounis, Dinos Doulgerakis etc. The Mega Channel gave a <b>deferred</b> <b>broadcast</b> in 2015 from the play, as played in the theater [...] "Alice" [...] (Αλίκη) in Athens, 2013-2014 theatrical season.|$|E

In Proceedings of the 2000 ACM {{conference on}} Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW ' 00). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 171 - 180. DOI= 10. 1145 / 358916. 358988 [URL] audienceIn real-time collaborative systems, replicated objects, shared by users, {{are subject to}} concurrency constraints. In order to satisfy these, various algorithms, qualified as optimistic, [3, 5, 13, 17, 14, 15, 18], have been proposed that exploit the semantic properties of operations to serialize concurrent operations and achieve copy convergence of replicated objects. Their drawback is that they either require a condition on user's operations which is hard to verify when possible to ensure, or they need undoing then redoing operations in some situations. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to present two new algorithms that overcome these drawbacks. They are based upon the implementation of a continuous global order which enables that condition to be released, and simplifies the operation integration process. In the second algorithm, thanks to <b>deferred</b> <b>broadcast</b> of operations to other sites, this process becomes even more simplified...|$|E
25|$|Each {{participating}} broadcaster {{is required}} to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish. From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were {{given the opportunity to}} take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme. Three major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999. The Dutch state broadcaster pulled their broadcast of the 2000 final to provide emergency news coverage of a major incident, the Enschede fireworks disaster. Spain's RTVE delayed their broadcast of the second semi-final in the 2009 Contest, due to the Madrid Open tennis tournament. The Albanian state broadcaster <b>deferred</b> their <b>broadcast</b> of the first semi-final in 2012 to provide emergency news coverage of the Qafa e Vishës bus accident.|$|R
50|$|On May 23, 2016 (although first {{reported}} by Robert Feder on his website the day prior), Tribune Broadcasting and The CW reached a five-year affiliation agreement that renewed the network's affiliations with twelve of Tribune's CW-affiliated stations through the 2020-21 television season. However, in negotiating {{the terms of}} the deal, Tribune decided not to renew The CW's affiliation with WGN-TV after the expiration of their initial ten-year agreement on September 1, 2016, choosing instead to operate it as an independent station in order to allow WGN {{to increase the number of}} sports telecasts it carries annually without having to work around contractual stipulations that limit the number of daytime and prime time programming preemptions it could make each year (which resulted in WGN having to <b>defer</b> some sports <b>broadcasts</b> to WPWR - and previously from 1999 to 2015, to WCIU-TV - under time-buy agreements) as well as makegood clauses requiring WGN to rebroadcast CW shows preempted in their regular time periods due to sports events scheduled during network programming hours later in the week (usually on Saturday and/or Sunday evenings, as The CW does not offer any prime time programming on those nights).|$|R
