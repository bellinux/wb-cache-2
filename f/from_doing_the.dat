5|$|The classic {{types are}} the deathmatch (and its team-based variant) in which players score points by killing other players' characters; and capture the flag, in which teams attempt to {{penetrate}} the opposing base, capture a flag {{and return it to}} their own base whilst preventing the other team <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same. Other game modes may involve attempting to capture enemy bases or areas of the map, attempting to take hold of an object {{for as long as possible}} while evading other players, or deathmatch variations involving limited lives or in which players fight over a particularly potent power-up. These match types may also be customizable, allowing the players to vary weapons, health and power-ups found on the map, as well as victory criteria. Games may allow players to choose between various classes, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, equipment and roles within a team.|$|E

25|$|Cryptography {{prior to}} the modern age was {{effectively}} synonymous with encryption, the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients, thereby precluding unwanted persons <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same. The cryptography literature often uses the name Alice ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") for the intended recipient, and Eve ("eavesdropper") for the adversary. Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World WarI {{and the advent of}} computers in World WarII, the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread.|$|E
25|$|Mining was {{intended}} to destroy fortifications and the troops in them and to prevent the opponent <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same. Mining had to be conducted under conditions, which concealed the effort from the opponents, to prevent counter-mining. Excavated material in the Loos area was chalk and thus easily seen; some of the material {{was used in the}} front line but most had to be removed by large carrying-parties and dumped out of sight of German ground observers and the crews and cameras of reconnaissance aircraft. A shaft was dug well back in the defensive system and then a gallery was driven forward, with branch galleries dug at intervals. As the main gallery got close to German defences, the need for silence became paramount, to elude the Germans conducting a similar mining operation. Plans of the mine workings were kept, on which rival German works were plotted, based on mines already sprung and the reports of listeners.|$|E
25|$|The pursuers skillfully took up {{position}} to limit South Carolinas options {{in trying to}} get away, the British windward ship attempted to mask the South Carolinas wind. For eighteen hours the British chased South Carolina. When she came in range, she fired her stern chasers at Diomede, which returned fire from her bow-guns. By 1500hrs the British ships were close enough to exchange shots and could each yaw, fire a broadside and return to the chase while preventing South Carolina <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same. The first of the British broadsides did major damage to South Carolina, leading Joyner to call his officers together to discuss whether to fight or to continue the flight. The decision was to continue the latter. By 1700hrs Quebec and Diomede came up alongside South Carolina, with Astrea behind in support, together with Hope and Constance. The British were soon in position to fire six broadsides, five from the Diomede and the other from the Quebec, all aimed at South Carolinas masts, sails and rigging, which within two hours were in tatters.|$|E

25|$|Much of the state’s {{economic}} activity {{is related to}} its border with the United States state of Arizona. People from both countries regularly cross the border to shop. The border crossings are essential {{to many of the}} communities that straddle the border, not only in the main crossings in Nogales and Agua Prieta, but also in the smaller ones such as Naco. On each side of the border, there is a fifteen km strip, which is designated as a commercial trade zone, where both Mexicans and United States citizens can enter with limited visa requirements. Many Arizonans travel and cross one of the crossings to eat and shop, mostly to experience something different <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same at home. Most spend only the day. The most popular of these border crossings is Nogales, which is just over an hour south from Tucson by highway. The main shopping street in Nogales is Avenida Obregón, which is crowded with pharmacies with lower prices than in the United States, stores selling knock offs of designer names such as Louis Vuitton, Cuban cigars, tequila, cheaper cigarettes and Mexican handcrafts, including some of the best work from artisans from Puebla, Guadalajara, Michoacán and Oaxaca. Although these stores cater mostly to Americans crossing the border, it is still possible to negotiate prices. Many of these communities on the Mexican side also have bars close to the port of entry, taking advantage of Mexico’s lower drinking age of 18.|$|E

According to Reagan, these Iranians sought to establish a quiet relationship with the United States, before establishing formal relationships upon the death of the aging Ayatollah. In Reagan's account, McFarlane told Reagan that the Iranians, to demonstrate their seriousness, offered to persuade the Hezbollah militants to release the seven U.S. hostages. McFarlane met with the Israeli intermediaries; Reagan claimed that he allowed this because he believed that establishing relations with a strategically located country, and preventing the Soviet Union <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same, was a beneficial move.

Soon after, Ian is killed by his own father, who was manipulated by Tokage, and now exists as a spirit, with Tokage possessing his body. Returning to Kaito's shop and after a trip through the Otherworld with , a small yet powerful and vicious fairy in love with Kaito, Ian takes control of the body of a deceased young boy, [...] Moved by his determination, Ainsel agrees to aid him in his quest to regain his body.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{the late}} empire {{maintained}} a central {{feature of the}} forward defence of the Principate: a system of treaties of mutual assistance with tribes living on the imperial frontiers. The Romans would promise to defend the ally from attack by its neighbours. In return, the ally would promise to refrain from raiding imperial territory, and prevent neighbouring tribes <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same. Although the allies would officially be denoted tributarii (i.e. subject to paying tribute to Rome, in cash or in kind), in practice the loyalty of the ally was often secured by gifts or regular subsidies from Rome. This practice was applied on all the frontiers. The Romans continued to assist the client tribes to defend themselves in the 4th century. For example, Constantine I's army constructed two massive lines of defensive earthworks, 100–250km beyond the Danube, totalling c. [...] in length, the Devil's Dykes in Hungary/Romania and the Brazda lui Novac de Nord in Romania. Garrisoned by a mix of Roman and native troops, their purpose was to protect Dacian and Sarmatian tributary tribes of the Tisza and Wallachian plains against Gothic incursions. This created a Transdanubian buffer zone, extending from Aquincum (Budapest) {{all the way to}} the Danube delta, obviously contradicting the proposition that the empire's Danubian border provinces were themselves envisaged as buffer zones. (This was especially unlikely in the case of these regions, as the Illyrian emperors and officer class that dominated the late army would hardly relish seeing their native provinces reduced to combat zones).|$|E
500|$|After his wife's {{death in}} 1766, Fownes Luttrell decided {{to stand at}} the general {{election}} in 1768. Despite his efforts to build up support, there were still factions and opposition to him. To gain some form of patronage in Minehead, he travelled to London and obtained from the Government control over the offices in Minehead, which prevented his opponents <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same. Fownes Luttrell won that election, accumulating more than £1,800 worth of expenses in the process. While a member of parliament, he is not recorded as speaking and does not appear in the small number of division lists still surviving. According to Maxwell Lyte, [...] "it does not appear that [...] had any real zest for Parliamentary life [...] probably far happier with his hounds and his fighting cocks in Devon or Somerset." [...] However, it appears that the Prime Minister, Lord North, believed that in return for the Government's support in 1768, Fownes Luttrell had promised to return the Government's candidate, Thomas Pownall, at the next election; when that time came, in 1774, North supported Fownes Luttrell and [...] "warned off" [...] his rival, Charles Whitworth. However, Fownes Luttrell was elected alongside his eldest son, John, which caused a dispute between the former and North. The dispute was resolved when the elder Fownes Luttrell offered to resign that December, in favour of Pownall, on the condition that Pownall seek his approval before nominating any of his friends or himself in future; a draft document outlining his other conditions included a payment of £3,000 in return for his resignation.|$|E

[...] During their individual performances, Beyoncé was often backed by both male and female dancers and Jay-Z was noted to hold the stage for multiple songs without assistance.

Video interludes filled with [...] "cop chases and other violent outbursts" [...] carried the storytelling between songs. The performances of the joint tour was said to be split up similarly to Jay-Z's previous joint venture with Kanye West, the Watch the Throne Tour. Beyoncé and Jay-Z would take turn holding down the stage, beginning with several songs by Beyoncé first, followed by duets and afterwards Jay-Z rapping his songs. Both artists sported multiple outfits from a variety of fashion designers throughout the performances of the tour.
