5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>Darkness.</b> Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E

He served as Second Unit Director on the film Reverb. Blackburn co-wrote and directed Donkey Punch, which was his first film to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival.

5|$|Development of System Shock 2 {{began in}} 1997 when Looking Glass Studios {{approached}} Irrational Games {{with an idea}} to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans of System Shock and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>Darkness.</b> In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, according to its pitch document, was Junction Point. The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop {{the concept of a}} dungeon crawler, like , in a science fiction setting, the basis for System Shock. However, the press mistook System Shock to be closer to a Doom clone which was cited for poor financial success of System Shock. With Junction Point, the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from Doom.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>Darkness</b> in 1998, Chahi left the video games industry to explore other interests, and subsequently developed a passion for volcanology. In the past, Chahi self-produced video games, as the PC market was independent games-orientated. However, the independent game's importance diminished by 2006, so Chahi decided {{to work with a}} publisher instead. He presented the concept to Ubisoft in 2006. According to Chahi, it was not difficult to convince Ubisoft to fund the project, though initially there was hesitation and the proposal was rejected. After the company reversed its decision, the team spent approximately two years meeting with the key people within Ubisoft; development properly began in January 2008. The team initially only had three people, but it was expanded to about 15 to 20 people, which was considered a small team for Ubisoft.|$|E

25|$|A Polish prose poet of {{the highest}} order, Joseph Conrad, the son of dramatist Apollo Korzeniowski, won {{worldwide}} fame with his English-language novels and stories that are informed with elements of the Polish national experience.

25|$|The {{coast of}} Canvey Island was {{host to the}} Chapman Lighthouse as briefly {{described}} in Joseph Conrad's novel <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>Darkness.</b> It is believed that the peril of the mudflats below such shallow waters off the Canvey Island coast prompted the Romans to devise some form of beacon as a warning in the area. In 1851 a hexagonal lighthouse was constructed by the engineer James Walker, a consultant lighthouse engineer at Trinity House at the time. This all-iron lighthouse replaced a lightship which had been moored {{in the area for}} the preceding four years. The lighthouse was demolished in 1957-1958 due to its poor condition.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} 19th century, Western European colonial powers were {{involved}} in the suppression of the Arab slave trade in Africa, {{as well as in the}} suppression of the slave trade in West Africa. Some Europeans during the time period objected to injustices that occurred in some colonies and lobbied on behalf of aboriginal peoples. Thus, when the Hottentot Venus was displayed in England in the beginning of the 19th century, the African Association publicly opposed itself to the exhibition. The same year that Kipling published his poem, Joseph Conrad published <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>Darkness</b> (1899), a clear criticism of the Congo Free State owned by Leopold II of Belgium.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>Darkness,</b> O'Regan's chamber {{opera in}} one act, with an English-language {{libretto}} by artist Tom Phillips, {{based on the}} novella {{of the same name}} by Joseph Conrad was premiered at the Linbury Theatre of the Royal Opera House. The idea for the opera first came to O'Regan in 2001. It received wide critical attention and marked his first foray into operatic writing. A suite for orchestra and narrator was extrapolated from the opera and was given its London premiere by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and actor Samuel West in April 2013. In May, 2015, <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>Darkness</b> received its North American premiere in a production by Opera Parallèle, presented by Z Space in San Francisco, California. Since the opera, O'Regan composed several pieces influenced by North Africa, which include his first collaborations with both the Dutch National Ballet and the Australian Chamber Orchestra. Recently some of his output has formed the focus of festivals such as the 2014 Vale of Glamorgan Festival and New Music for New Age from The Washington Chorus. O'Regan's first full-length ballet score (Mata Hari, based on the life of Margaretha Zelle MacLeod), commissioned by the Dutch National Ballet with choreography by Ted Brandsen, opened on February 6, 2016 in Amsterdam. On September 30, 2016 Mata Hari was released in DVD and Blu-ray formats by EuroArts, distributed by Warner Classics; the ballet will be revived for a further run in October, 2017. In February, 2017, O'Regan's first album of orchestral music, A Celestial Map of the Sky, performed by The_Hallé under the direction of Sir Mark Elder and Jamie Phillips, was released on the NMC label. The album entered the British Official Charts at number seven in the Specialist Classical Chart and number 18 in the Classical Artist Albums Chart.
