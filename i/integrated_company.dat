Under Fowler, VMT continued to serve as the headquarters for the Dance, Film and Music Societies while he expanded live theater operations, incorporating some community actors and New-York based professionals into Richmond's first resident Actors Equity/LORT company, a troupe that included core members Marie Goodman Hunter, Janet Bell, Lynda Myles, E.G. Marshall, Ken Letner, James Kirkland, Rachael Lindhart, and dramaturg M. Elizabeth Osborn. [...] Fowler retained a focus on classics and musicals, but added an emphasis on new plays and the U.S. premieres of foreign works. [...] His debut production, Marat/Sade (the first racially <b>integrated</b> <b>company</b> on the VMT stage), brought controversy {{into the heart of the}} museum. VMT, known now as VMT Rep (for [...] "repertory"), [...] drew national focus when in 1973 Fowler's staging of Macbeth, starring E.G. Marshall, led Clive Barnes of The New York Times to hail it as the [...] "'Fowler Macbeth'... "splendidly vigorous... probably the goriest Shakespearean production I have seen since Peter Brook's 'Titus Andronicus'." [...] As Fowler expanded the professionalism of the theater, VMT led Richmond into what some recall as a golden age of theater—especially in that in his time the company commissioned and produced eight American and World Premieres and introduced new plays by Pinter, Orton, Fugard, and Handke. [...] International attention arrived in 1975 when the Soviet Arts Consul provided coverage on Moscow Television for Fowler's U.S-premiere of Maxim Gorky's Our Father (originally Poslednje), a VMT production which went on to a New York City premiere at the Manhattan Theater Club.|$|E

We find that net income is more value relevant for full cost companies compared to companies that use the successful efforts accounting method. Furthermore, the value relevance {{of oil and gas}} reserves is different among successful efforts and full cost companies. Larger reserves among successful efforts companies are awarded a premium by stock markets. The value relevance of book value is significantly lower for <b>integrated</b> <b>companies</b> than for pure upstream companies.
