5|$|A {{week after}} the election, Downey {{announced}} that he was resigning for health reasons. Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey's term; under the Senate rules at the time, this gave Nixon seniority over the senators sworn <b>in</b> <b>during</b> January. Nixon took office on December 4, 1950. He used little of his seniority, since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower's running mate, the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969. Downey, who as a former senator retained floor privileges, was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests. In 1952, as Republicans took over the White House and control of both houses of Congress, he was fired. An aide stated that the big corporations did not need Downey anymore. Boddy, dispirited by his election defeat and feeling let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate, lapsed into semi-retirement after his primary defeat. In 1952, he sold his interest in the Daily News, which went into bankruptcy in December 1954.|$|E

40|$|Phenylpropanoid {{compounds}} as secondary metabolites are synthesized by plants <b>during</b> {{development and}} <b>in</b> response to stress. Phenylpropanoids {{contribute to the}} compounds of plant pigmentation, antioxidants and protective agents and also play a regulatory role in growth and morphogenesis. In this research, samples of blade and sheath of leaf,, stem, and root of Saccharum officinarum (cultivar CP 69 - 1062) during the germination, tillering, grand growth, and maturation stages were prepared. In order to studying biochemical changes of phenylpropanoid compounds during development of sugarcane, PAL activity enzyme, phenolic, flavonoids and flavonols component in samples were analyzed. The study of changes of enzyme activity <b>in</b> different tissues <b>during</b> developmental stages showed high enzyme activity of PAL <b>in</b> leaves <b>during</b> all of developmental stages and <b>in</b> sheath <b>during</b> grand growth stage. Enzyme activity was increased <b>in</b> stem <b>during</b> grand growth stage and <b>in</b> root <b>during</b> germination stage. Results indicated that changes of concentration of total phenol and {{the maximum amount of}} total phenol were detected <b>in</b> leaf <b>during</b> germination and maturation stages, <b>in</b> sheath <b>during</b> germination stage, <b>in</b> stem <b>during</b> grand growth stage and <b>in</b> root <b>during</b> maturation stage (...|$|R

5|$|Australia's {{working class}} culture also {{influenced}} {{that of the}} AIF. Approximately three-quarters of AIF volunteers {{were members of the}} working class, with a high proportion also being trade unionists, and soldiers frequently applied their attitudes to industrial relations to the Army. Throughout the war there were incidents where soldiers refused to undertake tasks that they considered demeaning or protested against actual or perceived mistreatment by their officers. These actions were similar to the strikes many soldiers had taken part <b>in</b> <b>during</b> their pre-enlistment employment, with the men not seeing themselves as mutineers. The protests which occurred in 1918 over the planned disbandment of several battalions also used similar tactics to those employed in industrial disputes. Historian Nathan Wise has judged that the frequent use of industrial action in the AIF led to improved conditions for the soldiers, and contributed to it having a less strict military culture than was common in the British Army.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland regressed in {{the ensuing}} season, {{finishing}} with a 4–12 record. Edwards and tight end Kellen Winslow Jr., who the Browns had drafted in 2004, put up respectable numbers, but the Browns were close {{to the bottom of}} the league in points scored and offensive yards gained. Frye injured his wrist toward the end of the season and shared starts with quarterback Derek Anderson, who showed promise in the five games he played <b>in.</b> <b>During</b> the season, the team produced a series of articles on its website called 60th Moments. The series commemorated the establishment of the Browns 60 years before in 1946, recapturing the 60 greatest moments in franchise history. Beginning on September 6, 2006, the Browns' site ran articles covering those 60 moments; the final article ran on December 31, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Conscription for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought <b>in</b> <b>during</b> {{the first half of}} 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E

On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn <b>in</b> <b>during</b> a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia. Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.|$|E

Merkle, after hitting a single, was at first, and Moose McCormick was at third, with two outs.
