25|$|Color field, curiously {{enough or}} perhaps not, became a viable way of {{painting}} {{at exactly the}} time that acrylic paint, the new plastic paint, came into being. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> new paint demanded a new possibility in painting, and the painters arrived at it. Oil paint, which has a medium that is quite different, which isn't water-based, always leaves a slick of oil, or puddle of oil, {{around the edge of}} the color. Acrylic paint stops at its own edge. Color field painting came in at the same time as the invention of this new paint.|$|E
25|$|The most {{striking}} and thorough reform {{imposed by the}} General Velasco's government was to eliminate all large private landholdings, converting most of them into cooperatives owned by prior workers on the estates. The reform was intended to destroy the basis of power of Peru's traditional elite and to foster a more cooperative society {{as an alternative to}} capitalism. Such socialpolitical purposes apparently dominated questions of agricultural production or any planned changes in patterns of land use. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> questions of ownership were what mattered, not the consequences for output or rural incomes. In fact, the government soon created a system of price controls and monopoly food buying by state firms designed to hold down prices to urban consumers, no matter what the cost to rural producers.|$|E

25|$|Asher's scars are {{hesitant}} {{around the}} face and groin, noted by Anita that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Priests flinched at the destruction of such beauty. The Priests (never said which denomination, but it is assumed Catholic) used Holy Water {{in an attempt to}} save Asher's soul (from what is never said, either). Asher is moody with a sadistic mean streak, lashing out at everyone in his fits of melancholic pain. He wants most to be loved and devoted by Jean-Claude, more a lover of men than women. Asher knows that it is through Anita's attraction to him combined with Jean-Claude's that Jean-Claude returns the love. Without Anita's acceptance, Jean-Claude could never bring himself to nearly be consumed for want of Asher again. That coupled with the incident of Asher nearly bleeding Anita to death during their first and only exclusive sexual experience leads to Asher's emotional neglect. Neither Anita nor Jean-Claude trust themselves alone with Asher, but as a trio, they live in nearly perfect love.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked with}} great rapidity and long hours, but {{he used his}} colours thin and covered the canvas with innumerable coats of paint. The colours {{increased}} in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure made a little stronger; then the background, and so on {{from day to day}} and week to week, and often from month to month.... And so the portrait would really grow, really develop as an entirety, very much as a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out graduallyâ€”light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> portrait were hidden within the canvas and the master by passing his wands day after day over the surface evoked the image.|$|E

It received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, and its title track won a Genesis Award from the Humane Society in 1993 for raising awareness for animal rights issues.

2500|$|In 1980 the Mariel boatlift brought {{thousands}} of Cuban refugees to the United States. Many of these refugees were musicians, who were astonished {{to hear what}} sounded to them like Cuban music from the 1950s. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> 60s never happened. Cuban conguero Daniel Ponce summarized this sentiment: [...] "When the Cubans arrived in New York, they all said 'Yuk! This is old music.' The music and the feelings and arrangements [...] changed."

Many players have considered him difficult to play with because of his high level of commitment and performance.

[...] He did, however, lead the Lakers to two championships post-O'Neal while becoming more of a mentor to his teammates. Bryant's longtime head coach Phil Jackson noted that the biggest difference during his second tenure in coaching the Lakers was that [...] " [...] embraced the team and his teammates, calling them up when we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> other players were now his partners, not his personal spear-carriers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orwell's {{writing was}} often {{explicitly}} critical of religion, and Christianity in particular.

In their 1972 study, The Unknown Orwell, the writers Peter Stansky and William Abrahams noted that at Eton Blair displayed a [...] "sceptical attitude" [...] to Christian belief. Crick observed that Orwell displayed [...] "a pronounced anti-Catholicism". Evelyn Waugh, writing in 1946, acknowledged Orwell's high moral sense and respect for justice but believed [...] "he seems never to have been touched at any point by a conception of religious thought and life." [...] His contradictory and sometimes ambiguous views about the social benefits of religious affiliation mirrored the dichotomies between his public and private lives: Stephen Ingle wrote that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> writer George Orwell [...] "vaunted" [...] his unbelief while Eric Blair the individual retained [...] "a deeply ingrained religiosity".|$|E
