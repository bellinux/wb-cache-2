25|$|The most {{spectacular}} of Einstein's predictions was his calculation that the curvature {{terms in the}} spatial components of the spacetime interval could be measured in the bending of light around a massive body. Light has a slope of±1 on a spacetime diagram. Its movement in space is equal to its movement in time. For the weak field expression of the invariant interval, Einstein calculated an exactly <b>equal</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> sign curvature in its spatial components.|$|E
25|$|At {{frequencies}} up {{to about}} 1GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable, forming a twisted pair. This reduces losses from electromagnetic radiation and inductive coupling. A twisted pair must be used with a balanced signalling system, so that the two wires carry <b>equal</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> currents. Each wire in a twisted pair radiates a signal, but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.|$|E

25|$|For a given {{ideal gas}} the {{molecular}} composition is fixed, {{and thus the}} speed of sound depends only on its temperature. At a constant temperature, the gas pressure has no effect on {{the speed of sound}}, since the density will increase, and since pressure and density (also proportional to pressure) have <b>equal</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density—just as in liquids—but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility {{in such a way that}} some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio which can be independently derived from temperature and molecular composition (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (assuming the molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (for which the heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the speed}} of the top plate is low enough, the fluid {{particles}} will move parellel to it, and their speed will vary linearly from zero at the bottom to [...] at the top. [...] Each layer of fluid will move faster than the one just below it, and friction between them will give rise to a force resisting their relative motion. [...] In particular, the fluid will apply on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an <b>equal</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> one to the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required {{in order to keep the}} top plate moving at constant speed.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} coaxial cable have a {{characteristic}} impedance of 75Ω, which would therefore {{be a good}} match for a half-wave dipole, however, without special precautions, coax transmission line easily becomes unbalanced (with one conductor at ground potential) whereas a dipole antenna presents a balanced input (both terminals have an <b>equal</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> voltage with respect to ground). When an antenna is unbalanced, the unbalanced currents or “common mode” currents will flow backward along the outer conductor and the coax line will radiate, {{in addition to the}} antenna itself,. An important consequence is distortion of the antenna’s designed radiation pattern, and change in the impedance seen by the line. The dipole can be properly fed, and retain its expected characteristics, by using a [...] balun in between the coaxial feedline and the antenna terminals. Connection of coax to a dipole antenna using a balun is described in greater detail below.|$|E

Pati wrote to Salam several times expressing interest to work under Salam's direction, in response to which Salam eventually invited Pati to the ICTP seminar in Pakistan. Salam suggested to Pati {{that there should be}} some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry <b>equal</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> electric charge. Protons carry quarks, but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos, with nothing postulated about quarks. If all of nature's ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry, it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel. This {{led to the development of}} Pati–Salam model in particle physics. In 1973, Salam and Jogesh Pati were the first to notice that since Quarks and Leptons have very similar SU(2) × U(1) representation content, they all may have similar entities. They provided a simple realisation of the quark-lepton symmetry by postulating that lepton number was a fourth colour, dubbed [...] "violet".|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} novel {{implementation of}} quantum teleportation protocol of unknown qubit by superposition of displacement operators with <b>equal</b> modulo <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> in sign amplitudes. Entangled hybrid state with coherent components of small amplitude {{is used as}} quantum channel. Coherent components of the quantum channel displace the teleported qubit at the same absolute <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> in sign values, so that any information about amount by which the qubit is displaced is lost {{despite the fact that}} one of these events has definitely occurred. Alice unambiguously distinguishes her measurement outcomes and Bob obtains at his disposal two states of a single photon in superposition state of two modes. The superposition of the displacement operators is nonunitary, so success probability of the protocol depends on the amplitude parameters of the teleported qubit. Remarkably, the success probability of the teleportation can be made arbitrary high for some amplitude values of the teleported state by means of initial amplitude modulation of unknown qubit and bits of classical information for Bob to identify the states. The scheme is realized by linear optics methods and works without photon number resolving measurement. Comment: Research highlights 1. Novel implementation of quantum teleportation of unknown qubit is proposed. 2. The implementation is based on use of superposition of the displacement operators with <b>equal</b> modulo <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> in sign amplitudes. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1605. 0673...|$|R
