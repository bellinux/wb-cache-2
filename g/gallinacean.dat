40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} endo and ecto-parasites in Matebeleland North and South from free range chickens (Gallus domesticus). Only adult chickens were selected for determination of parasite. For intestinal parasites microscopic studies of eggs and faecal egg counts were done using the salt floatation technique. The endo parasites encountered {{in the study were}} Tetrameres americana, Acuaria hamulosa, Ascaridia galli, Heterakis gallinarum, H. dispar, Allodapa suctoria, Capillaria annulate, Raillietina echinobothrida and R. tetragona. A commercially prepared insecticide constituted as follows (0. 02 % Tetamethrin, 0. 03 % pramethrin and 0. 034 % Imiprothrin) was applied for 2 seconds and feathers were then gentle unruffled so that ectoparasites could be counted and identified. Ecto parasites recorded in this study were Menopon gallinae, Menacanthus stramineus, Dermanyssus gallinae, Argas persicus, Ornithonyssus bursa, Cnemidocoptes mutans, Echidnophaga <b>gallinacean,</b> Gonocoites gallinae and Gonocoites hologester. The birds under study showed slow growth, poor egg hatching. Parasites should have contributed substantially to this poor growth although not single handedly...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVisual {{cognition}} {{in birds}} is often tested in restricted and controlled conditions (i. e. laboratory conditions) {{and only in}} a few species of birds (e. g. Pigeons Columbia livia). The results obtained from these studies can inform us on the birds ‘abilities to discriminate and categorize several pictures or objects for example. Nevertheless, {{the question of how}} birds perceive and process biological or artificial stimuli in natural conditions remains an ultimate aim of such questions. In a series of studies performed on a variety of species (e. g. passerine, <b>gallinacean,</b> raptors), we tested the validity of laboratory-issued results, performed on caged animals, in other contexts such as naturalistic settings (e. g. aviaries) or field conditions. In order to do so, we developed a series of cognitive tests adapted to these conditions and compared the birds’ reactions to those obtained in the laboratory setting. The results show 1) variations between species in the adaptability to different experimental procedures, 2) that the same stimuli elicit similar types of reactions in the different settings; 3) however the precise types of reactions (e. g. freezing / flight) clearly depend on context. The various experimental possibilities of testing avian visual cognition exposed here are then discussed...|$|E
40|$|Carotenoid-based {{ornaments}} (many yellow-orange-red colourations) may {{signal the}} genetic or parental {{quality of the}} bearer. Thus, their expression could influence the amount of resources/energy that the mate will invest {{in the production of}} offspring, thereby optimising its reproductive fitness. The differential allocation hypothesis (DAH) predicts that females mated with more attractive males should lay more and better eggs. This has been explored only in few bird species with carotenoid-based traits. We tested this hypothesis in the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), a <b>gallinacean</b> with very variable laying capacity. Both sexes display carotenoid-based ornamentation that gradually fades throughout the laying period. Here, the redness of beak and eye rings of captive males was intensified after mating by means of paint. The proportion of females that laid eggs did not differ between treatments. Amongst laying females, those mated with colour-enhanced males (experimental females) tended to lay earlier and produced significantly more eggs than controls, but of similar quality (egg mass and composition). We additionally investigated whether male attractiveness influenced egg components depending on the clutch size and laying sequence. The testosterone level in eggs from experimental females was positively related to the laying order, whereas control eggs did not show any trend. Our results provided mixed support for the DAH, but nevertheless revealed that female red-legged partridges may adjust their breeding investment according to male carotenoid-based ornamentation.

40|$|The studies {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the nervous formations {{from the base of}} the cranium in the hen and domestic duck. These clarifications are necessary in order to disclose some unknown facts regarding this region in the poultry species used preponderantly in laboratory studies of the aviary flu. The vegetative connections {{from the base of the}} skull have been studied on 10 poultry specimens, 5 hens and 5 ducks. The animals have been euthanatized using chloroform and a special dye has been injected through the heart in order to achieve a better differentiation of the nervous formations. Dissection was performed under a magnifying glass using instruments adequate to highly fine dissections. Photos and sketches of the dissected pieces have been taken. Nomina Anatomica (2003) was used {{to describe the}} observed formations. The studies showed that the cranial cervical ganglia around which is the sub-basal nervous tissue, is located on the border of the occipital hole, at the basis of the temporal pyramid, much deeper than in mammalians; it is better developed in the duck (3 - 4 mm) than in the hen (1 - 2 mm); the cranial cervical ganglia has the shape of a globe in <b>gallinaceans</b> and it is long in shape in the ducks. A multitude of connecting branches were observed around the lymph node, linking it to the vague nerve, to the hypoglossal nerve, to the glossopharyngeal nerve and to the transversal paravertebral chain which is specific to poultry; an obvious branch detaches from the cranial pole, which is the sub-basal connective, while the cervical connective detaches from the caudal pole, connecting it to the cervical-thoracic lymph node...|$|R
40|$|Characterization {{of village}} chicken phealth and {{management}} {{practices in the}} Amatola Basin of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa By Njongenhle M. B. NYONI The majority of rural households in South Africa own village chickens which contribute significantly to their livelihoods. However, limited {{research has been conducted}} to characterize, understand and develop village chicken production in South Africa. This hinders the designing and implementation of village chicken-based developmental programmes that will benefit farmers in rural areas. Thus, it is imperative to initiate studies to describe village chicken production. This study was conducted to characterize village chicken production in Amatola Basin of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Baseline information was gathered using a questionnaire survey of 81 identified from 7 out of 13 villages using snowball sampling technique. Consequently, 20 households were selected to participate in a monitoring study (from July 2010 to June 2011) through purposive sampling. Most (60 %) chicken flocks were owned by women and mainly raised to meet household food requirements. Some (28. 4 %) farmers occasionally sold cocks and hens to neighbours, at an average price of R 50 (USD 7. 55) per bird, as a way of culling their flocks and generating income. However, village chickens were mainly kept for food security rather than for their terminal benefit of cash. Although, all chicken flocks were produced under the scavenging feeding system, most (96 %) flocks were provided with supplementary feed and drinking water. A majority (93. 8 %) of households also provided some form of shelter for their chickens. The mean cock to hen to chick ratio was 1 : 5 : 15. On average, iii each household owned 17 (± 2 S. E. M.) chickens, and hens had 3. 3 clutches per annum. Chicks hatched and chickens received as gifts represented the flock entries, while exits included mortality, consumption, sales and gifts or donations, in that order. Generally, both exits and entries were more pronounced in the summer season than in other seasons. Most (81. 5 %) farmers experienced chicken losses due to predation and health related problems. Parasitism ranked high amongst the village chicken health challenges. During monitoring, the endoprasites identified included nematodes, cestodes and protozoa. Coccidia were the most prevalent endoparasites. The chickens were also infested with a variety of ectoparasites namely: mites, lice, fleas and ticks. The sticktight flea Echidnophaga <b>gallinacean</b> was the most prevalent species. Although ectoparasite infestations were most pronounced in summer, almost all chickens harbored {{one or more of these}} parasites throughout the study period. The prevalence and intensity of parasite infestations were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the summer season compared to the other seasons. This was followed by the autumn, spring and winter seasons, respectively. The majority (77. 5 %) of farmers resorted to alternative remedies, mostly medicinal plants, for treating diseases and controlling parasites. Medicinal plants were used because they were locally available, cheap and perceived to be effective. Therefore, village chicken production in the rural Eastern Cape Province is characterised by several challenges which counter the significant role chickens play in the livelihood of rural households...|$|E
