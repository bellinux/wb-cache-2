5000|$|The plant's state {{observer}} task may {{be extended}} to estimate and predict the disturbance acting on the plant. The plant disturbance prediction and compensation is an original control feature, which allows significant reduction of control error.

The parameter's [...] "true" [...] value does not exist: the model is an approximated description of the plant and then, the parameter's [...] "best" [...] value depends on the cost function adopted to evaluate the difference between model and plant. The identification method estimates the best values of the simplified model parameters {{from the point of view}} of the closed loop control design.Control Parameter Optimization is a tool which performs control parameter tuning in simulated environment. The optimization is performed numerically over a predefined simulated trial, that is for a given mission (<b>host</b> <b>command</b> sequence and disturbance acting on the plant and any other potential event related to the plant performance) and for a given functional cost associated to the plant control performance.|$|E

5000|$|The 4706th Defense Wing was {{organized}} {{at the beginning}} of 1952 at O'Hare IAP in a major reorganization of ADC responding to ADC's difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying fighter squadrons to best advantage. [...] The wing assumed the operational squadrons and air defense mission of the inactivating 142d Fighter-Interceptor Wing (FIW), an Oregon Air National Guard (ANG) wing, which had been federalized and moved to O'Hare in 1951 in the expansion of the USAF for the Korean War. The wing also received the regular USAF 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (FIS). flying F-86 Sabre aircraft, at O'Hare from the inactivating 56th Fighter-Interceptor Group at Selfridge AFB, Michigan and the 97th FIS at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, which had been attached to the 142nd FIW. The wing also assumed command of ANG units stationed elsewhere in this reorganization, the 113th FIS, flying F-51H Mustangs, at Scott AFB, Illinois, and the 166th FIS, at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, flying F-84 Thunderjet aircraft. Thus, the wing's fighter squadrons defended Illinois, Indiana, southern Wisconsin, western Michigan and western Ohio.

30|$|Our {{proposed}} implementation (Figure 2) first {{reads the}} PSDU (physical layer service data unit) data from memory, {{which can be}} a FIFO coming from the <b>host</b> <b>command</b> processor or an internal memory emulated by the MAC processor. Next, the packet data is used to form the PPDU (PLCP protocol data unit) packet, where we can choose to change the start-of-frame delimiter, add a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), change the CRC algorithm or polynomial, and change the maximum length of the packet. The symbol-to-chip mapping block allows us to modify the chipping sequence, which could allow for non-standard spreading codes for, e.g., strengthened privacy. The modulation is performed using OQPSK with configurable constellation and pulse shape.|$|E
