40|$|AbstractIn these days, the {{application}} of using thermal energy of sunlight has become widely used in concentrated solar power generation systems (CSP). In CSP, property of the receiver directly contributes to the system efficiency of CSP. The solar selective absorber {{is used for the}} receiver to reduce energy loss of thermal radiation. To investigate the mass production technology of fabricating solar selective absorber that can be utilized in high temperature condition, we focused on transparent conductive oxides (TCO) thin film on metal substrate. TCO material has plasma wavelength in infrared region. Therefore the electromagnetic wave with shorter wavelength than plasma wavelength goes through the material, while the electromagnetic wave with longer wavelength is reflected on the surface. It is realized that TCO on metal substrate showed high performance as solar selective absorbers, i. e. high absorptance in visible light range and low emittance in infrared range by numerical simulations. The optical property of fabricated TCO coated metal is well consistent with the simulated property. Consequently, we attain high performance solar selective absorber of which solar absorptance is 0. 71 and <b>hemispherical</b> total <b>emittance</b> is 0. 11.

The corresponding thicknesses of the films were increased from 27. 5 nm to 243 nm and 21 nm to 211 nm as the RF power was increased from 100 W to 700 W for the quartz and silicon substrates, respectively. X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy were carried out to investigate the phase and surface morphology of the deposited films. The electronic structure and the vanadium oxidation states of the deposited films were investigated thoroughly by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The as-grown films show only stoichiometric vanadium oxide, where vanadium is in V 5 + and V 4 + states. The phase transitions of the vanadium oxide films were investigated by the differential scanning calorimetric technique. The reversible i. e. smart transition was observed in the region from 337 °C to 343 °C.

40|$|At DLR’s QUARZ Center a {{test bench}} has been {{established}} to measure, using steady state calorimetric method, the total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emittance</b> of cylindrical solar thermal absorber samples at temperatures up to 450 °C. Emittance measurement of solar absorber surfaces is commonly performed by direct-hemispherical reflectance measurements with spectrophotometers. However, the measurement of cylindrical samples with spectrophotometers can be considered still a challenge as integrating spheres, reference samples and calibration services by national metrology institutions are optimized for flat sample measurement. Additionally samples are typically measured at room temperature. The steady state calorimetric method does not rely on reference samples and the measurement is performed at operating temperature. In the steady state calorimetric method electrical power input used to heat the sample is equated to the radiative heat loss from a heated sample to the environment. The total emittance can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation from radiative heat loss power, the defined sample surface area and measured surface temperature. The expanded uncertainty (k= 2) of the total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emittance</b> has been determined to ± 13 % for a typical parabolic trough absorber sample at a temperature of 300 °C and a heating power of 100  W.

40|$|Advanced {{modeling}} and design efforts for many aerospace components require high temperature emittance data. Applications requiring emittance data include propulsion systems, radiators, aeroshells, heatshields/thermal protection systems, and leading edge surfaces. The {{objective of this}} work is to provide emittance data at ultra-high temperatures. MSFC has a new instrument for the measurement of emittance at ultra-high temperatures, the Ultra-High Temperature Emissometer System (Ultra-HITEMS). AZ Technology Inc. developed the instrument, designed to provide emittance measurements over the temperature range 700 - 3500 K. The Ultra-HITEMS instrument measures the emittance of samples, heated by lasers, in vacuum, using a blackbody source and a Fourier Transform Spectrometer. Detectors in a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer measure emittance over the spectral range of 0. 4 - 25 microns. Emitted energy from the specimen and output from a Mikron M 390 S blackbody source at the same temperature with matched collection geometry are measured. Integrating emittance over the spectral range yields the total emittance. The ratio provides a direct measure of total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emittance.</b> Samples are heated using lasers.

Third, the infrared optical properties were interpreted on base of polymerphysical relations. The characterization in the infrared range and the calculation of infrared optical film properties have revealed, that various functional groups of the macromolecular structure are highly absorbing.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} the thermal radiative properties of thin-film selective emitters used in thermophotovoltaic applications has been performed, It {{has been found that}} the effective directional emittance depends strongly on the physical thickness, refractive index and spectral extinction coefficient of the films. The emissivity exhibits a saturation, for an optical depth greater than unity, which is dependent on the refractive index and extinction coefficient of the material, namely the higher the refractive index and extinction coefficient, the lower the saturation value. For transparent films, the thickness required to achieve saturation is of the order of tens of micrometres whereas much lower thicknesses are required for absorbing films. Significantly, an anomalous increase in emittance at low thickness for high-index films has been observed, which might be of particular interest in thermophotovoltaic applications. The emittance has also been found to be strongly dependent on the emissivity and reflectivity of the substrates and on the direction of propagation of radiation. The total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emittance</b> of the films has been found to increase with increasing temperature and total directional emittance, for the wavelength range 0. 9 - 1. 5 mu m.

Here, selective solar absorbers based on two cermet layers are fabricated on mechanically polished stainless steel substrates using a magnetron sputtering technique. The targeted operating temperature is 500 – 600 °C. A detrimental change in the morphology, phase, and optical properties is observed if the cermet layers are deposited on a stainless steel substrate with a thin nickel adhesion layer, which is due to the diffusion of iron atoms from the stainless steel into the cermet layer forming a FeWO[subscript 4] phase. In order to improve thermal stability and reduce the infrared emittance, tungsten is found to be a good candidate for the infrared reflector layer due to its excellent thermal stability and low infrared emittance. A stable solar absorptance of ≈ 0. 90 is demonstrated, with a total <b>hemispherical</b> <b>emittance</b> of 0. 15 at 500 °C. United States.
