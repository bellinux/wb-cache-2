Mission Control noticed a {{reduction}} in the flow from the nozzle that vents <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> water into space. The tank can hold 165 pounds <b>of</b> liquid <b>waste</b> and <b>the</b> crew only managed to get it down to about 80 pounds. Later in the day, astronauts used the camera on Orbital Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to survey <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nozzle.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{historical}} narrative <b>of</b> water purity {{tends to}} chart {{a process of}} secularisation with an increasing importance on cleanliness. We suggest otherwise – that rhetorically at least, water has never been secularised. Moral impurity and water contamination have a long and interrelated history. Even before the connection had been made between contaminated water and disease, baptismal ideas had long fostered associations of hygiene and piety. The predilection for public bathing during Roman times continued long into the Middle Ages. Although John Wesley had pithily declared, ‘Cleanliness is next to godliness’ in the eighteenth century, {{it was not until}} the following century that his words would help to transform <b>the</b> habits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper classes <b>of</b> Britain and North America. Invariably, these notions were translated into ideas of moral hygiene. A polarity was established between the clean and the unclean, the refined and the coarse, the disciplined and the disorderly. Through <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> clean, piped water and <b>flushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes,</b> <b>the</b> sanitary engineer therefore, facilitated acts of physical and moral purification and civilisation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Naruse River mouth showed stable {{topography}} {{at least}} for these 46 years. However, sediment deposit occurred in July 2002, which caused difficulty in ship operation {{going in and out}} of a port located in the river mouth. In addition, <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river mouth after <b>the</b> <b>flushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sand spit on the left-hand side has never been observed for these 50 years. In this paper, characteristic morphological change at the Naruse River mouth is shown with <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> aerial photographs and morphological maps. Furthermore, time-variation <b>of</b> water-level in <b>the</b> river mouth is compared with tidal variation. From this analysis, it can be concluded that the river mouth closure has occurred just before <b>the</b> <b>flushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sand bar in July 2002...|$|R
