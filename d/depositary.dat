25|$|Unsponsored shares {{trade on}} the {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) market. These shares are issued in accordance with market demand, and the foreign company has no formal agreement with a <b>depositary</b> bank. Unsponsored ADRs are often issued {{by more than one}} <b>depositary</b> bank. Each <b>depositary</b> services only the ADRs it has issued. Since the company is not formally involved in an unsponsored issue, the motivation of the company to list overseas is irrelevant for unsponsored programs. Instead, the dynamics of this market is determined by the incentive structure of three types of players: holders of the securities on-shore, the investors in depository receipts off-shore and the intermediaries (depository banks and exchanges).|$|E

25|$|Each ADR {{is issued}} by a {{domestic}} custodian bank when the underlying shares are deposited {{in a foreign}} <b>depositary</b> bank, usually by a broker who has purchased the shares in the open market local to the foreign company. An ADR can represent {{a fraction of a}} share, a single share, or multiple shares of a foreign security. The holder of a DR has the right to obtain the underlying foreign security that the DR represents, but investors usually find it more convenient to own the DR. The price of a DR generally tracks the price of the foreign security in its home market, adjusted for the ratio of DRs to foreign company shares. In the case of companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, creation of ADRs attracts a 1.5% creation fee; this creation fee is different than stamp duty reserve tax charge by the UK government. <b>Depositary</b> banks have various responsibilities to DR holders and to the issuing foreign company the DR represents.|$|E
