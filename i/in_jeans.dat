During the performance, Aguilera kept belting to a minimum. The duo ended their singing with a hug. Caila Ball from Idolator wrote, [...] "Clumsy cross-promotions and hyperbole aside, it was a night of stellar performances, kicked off by Coaches Christina and Blake making the world debut of 'Just a Fool'". She continued to praise the performance, commenting, [...] "It was a refreshingly stripped down performance from Legendtina – who uncharacteristically took the stage <b>in</b> <b>jeans.</b> Blake, on the other hand, looked a little awkward up there without a guitar and a stool".|$|E

On August 5, 2009, Carey performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the fourth season of the talent competition, America's Got Talent. Carey, appearing <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> and a black top, was accompanied by several male dancers and three back-up singers. As she performed the song, the dancers hoisted her into the air several times, and carried her to several areas on the stage. During the performance, several white lights flashed, while monitors behind the dancers showed images of Carey and the video. Breanne Heldman from E! Entertainment Television criticized several aspects of the performance. She described the lighting as [...] "anxiety inducing", and wrote, [...] "That said, no one is doubting the singer's impressive set of pipes, but—frighteningly jarring lighting and quick edits aside—did she actually utilize them on 'America's Got Talent' last night?" [...] Aside from questioning the singers live vocals, she also felt Carey seemed [...] "robotic", and didn't show effort or interest in the performance. A reviewer from Idolator also was critical on the performance, asking if there was [...] "anything good about [...] ". He claimed Carey was lip-syncing, and described it as [...] "lackadaisical", and wrote, [...] "the backup dancers’ moves would have probably received a big red 'X' from at least one of the judges." ...|$|E

500|$|Epstein had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{yet he had}} a strong influence on the band's early dress code and stage demeanor. They had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at The Cavern Club, he thought, [...] "They were a scruffy crowd in leather, {{and they were not}} very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other." [...] Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow {{at the end of their}} performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein's RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> after a short time, and then, after that step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits." [...] Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, but which Epstein approved of: [...] "I thought it was an excellent design at the time." ...|$|E
