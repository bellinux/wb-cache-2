C.) {{was one of the great}} political, social, economic and ideational upheaval in Palestine. This situation was especially true within the Northern Kingdom of Israel. In conjunction with an following the accession of the Omride dynasty (ca. 876 - 842 / 841 B. C.), a number of phenomena occurred which caused a profound transformation of the situation that existed there. The first of these involved the consolidation of the royal power base so that the monarchy became a virtually autocratic institution which was independent of traditional sources of authority (e. g. the Amphictyonic Council at Schehem). The second involved the rise of the “royal interest group” (a social group consisting of those households which benefitted mostly from royal power) and the development of a hierarchical social order. The third involved the emergence of an economic structure that integrated much of northern Palestine. The fourth involved the formation of a pluralistic <b>ideational</b> <b>pattern</b> which caused considerable alienation amongst the traditional sectors of the Israelite population. One of the aspects of Israelite life that was greatly affected by these developments was the urban system. Throughout the north, a host of centres representing a variety of orders were incorporated into a new, more integrated system which encompassed the entire realm and which was designed to serve the needs of the monarchy and its interest group. Under this new arrangement, urban units were given specialized functions so that some became chariot-cities, while others served as store-cities or administrative centers. The present enquiry will focus upon the urban system that prevailed within the seat of North Israelite power, namely the Samaria region. With the aid of a model that accounts for six factors, it will attempt to show that during the ca. 870 - 722 / 721 B. C. period, the dynamics of the cities, towns and villages of this area were governed largely by the above-mentioned political, social, economic and ideational phenomena as well as the technological and physiographical resources that were available. Specifically, it will elucidate the process by which the new city of Samaria became the dominant center of the region and by which the old cities of Sechem and Tirzah became integrated into the northern urban systems as centers of secondary importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{comprehension}} and recall of instructional text is heavily {{dependent upon the}} contexts in which information input and retrieval occur. College students (N= 44) recalled {{the contents of a}} hierarchically structured text immediately after study and again six weeks later. Total meaningful recall was better when the superordinate concepts, or cues, activated prior to study were relevant rather than irrelevant to the content of the text. Total meaningful recall was best, however, when the relwant assimilatory cues were reinstated at the time of retrieval. These findings were generally consistent with the principle of encoding specificity. Clustering analyses of the <b>ideational</b> <b>patterns</b> that were present in recall protocols supported the view that organization was the mechanism underlying cue effects. Additional analyses indicated that the availability of cues at retrieval stimulated the importatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{attempts}} {{to explain and}} account for the immethodical, irregular, and supposedly fragmented form of James Thomson's The Seasons scholars have repeatedly discerned thematic and <b>ideational</b> <b>patterns</b> in the poem rather than tracing its generic diversity and acknowledging its formal integrity. Following Alastair Fowler's notions of kind and mode, The Seasons is contextualised in generic terms as a long poem which draws on the conventions and utilises elements of the epic and the ode to create a novel poetic kind. The interplay between the discursive and the expository, the descriptive and narrative elements of the epic and the dramatic qualities of the lyric modes is traced {{in one of the}} seasons, Spring (1728). The exploration of the generic hybridity of the poem will make visible the formal and generic cohesion of Thomson's composite The Seasons and enable {{a better understanding of the}} long poem generally...|$|R
40|$|Dieser Artikel kritisiert die sowohl in der Politikwissenschaft als auch in der Wirtschaftssoziologie häufig zu beobachtende Entgegensetzung von Ideen und Interessen. Hinter dieser Dichotomie stehen zwei quer zueinander liegende Begriffsdimensionen: erstens die Frage, ob Interessen aus der gesellschaftlichen Position ableitbare Handlungsorientierungen oder subjektive, situative Handlungsintentionen bezeichnen; zweitens die Frage, ob Interessen kulturell begrenzt oder formiert sind. Anhand einer ausführlichen Diskussion verschiedener sozialtheoretischer Perspektiven wird ausgeführt, dass diese beiden Dimensionen schon im Begriff des Interesses selbst impliziert sind. Es wird gezeigt, dass ein mehrdimensionaler Interessenbegriff dabei helfen kann, das gegenseitige konzeptionelle „Aufsaugen“ von Ideen und Interessen in der Politikwissenschaft und in der Wirtschaftssoziologie zu vermeiden und daraus entstehende Erklärungsprobleme zu überwinden. Die Formierung von Interessen wird als Ausdruck der situativen Vermittlung von materiellen Positionen und ideellenWahrnehmungsmustern beschrieben. In {{this article}} the often used {{dichotomy}} between ideas and interests {{in political science}} and economic sociology is criticized. This dichotomy hides two different conceptual dimensions of interests: first, the question whether interests {{can be derived from}} social positions or need to be understood as situational intentions; second, the question whether interests are substantially formed by culture or only culturally constrained. A discussion of different perspectives on interests in sociological theory shows that both dimensions are implicit in the concept of interests. It is then shown how a three-dimensional concept of interests can help to bridge theoretical gaps between structuralism and constructivism in political science and economic sociology. In both fields it can be observed how in many models that try to link ideas and interests one side eventually “absorbs” the other. Instead, the formation of interests is described as situational interference between material social positions and <b>ideational</b> <b>patterns</b> which allows us to overcome the largely unclear dichotomy of ideas and interests in both fields...|$|R
40|$|This thesis' central aim is the {{application}} of a Wendtian-constructivist expansion of Regional Security Complex Theory (RSCT) on a specific case study: the South Caucasus. To that effect, three concepts of RSCT – amity/enmity, state incoherence, and great power penetration – are expanded and developed within the broader above-mentioned ontological-epistemological framework. Amity-enmity is elaborated into an integrated spectrum founded on varying <b>ideational</b> <b>patterns</b> of securitisation alongside objective characteristics, and encompassing conflict formations, security regimes and security communities. States are conceptualised as ideational-institutional-material "providers of security"; their incoherence is characterised over three tiers and two dimensions, leading to a distinction between vertical and horizontal inherent weakness, ostensible instability and failure. Great power penetration is dissected into its objective, subjective and intersubjective elements, resulting in a 1 + 3 + 1 typology of its recurring patterns: unipolar, multipolar-cooperative and multipolar-competitive, bounded by hegemony and disengagement. After the specification of a methodology incorporating both objective macro- and interpretive micro-perspectives, two working hypotheses are specified. Firstly, that state incoherence engenders high levels of regional enmity, and, secondly, that patterns of great power penetration primarily affect transitions of regional amity/enmity between conflict formations and security regimes. The framework is subsequently used to triangulate these hypotheses through an application of the theoretical framework on the post-Soviet Southern Caucasus. An initial macro-overview is subsequently provided of the Southern Caucasus as a regional security complex; the three expanded concepts are consequently investigated, in turn, from the discursive micro-perspective. The South Caucasus is categorised into a "revisionist conflict formation", the nature of its states' incoherence is characterised, and existing patterns of great power penetration are identified as competitive-multipolar. In the final chapter, the hypotheses are largely confirmed, and various scenarios as to the possible emergence of a regional security regime are investigated.

40|$|Despite {{the long}} history of Muslims in Russia, most {{scholarly}} and political literatures on Russia’s Islam still narrowly interpret Muslim-Slavs relations in an ethnic-religious oppositional framework. In my work, I examine Russia’s discourse on Islam to argue that, in fact, the role of Islam in post-Soviet Russia is complex. Drawing from direct sources from academic, state, journalistic, and underground circles, often neglected by Western commentators, I identify <b>ideational</b> <b>patterns</b> in conceptualizations of Islam and reconstruct relational networks among authors. To explain complex intertextual relations within specific contexts, I utilize an analytically eclectic method that appropriately combines theories from different paradigms and/or disciplines. Thanks to my multi-dimensional approach, I show that, contrary to traditional views, Russia’s Muslims participate in processes of post-Soviet Russia’s identity formation. Starting from textual contents, avoiding pre-formed analytical frames, I argue that many Muslims in Russia perceive themselves as part of Russian civilization – even when they challenge the status-quo. Building on my initial findings, I state that a key element in Russia’s conceptualization of Islam is the definition, elaborated in the 1990 s, of traditional Islam as part of Russian civilizational history, as opposed to extremist Islam as extraneous, hostile phenomenon. The differentiation creates an unprecedently safe, if confined, space for Islamic propositions, of which Muslims are taking advantage. Embedded in debates on Russian civilization, conceptualizations of Islam, then, influence Russia’s (geo) political self-perceptions and, consequently, its domestic and international policies. In particular, Russian so-far neglected Islamic doctrine supports views of Islamic terrorism as a political and not religious phenomenon. Hence, Russia interprets both terrorism and counterterrorism within its own historical tradition, causing its strategy to be at odds with Western views. Less apparently, these divergences affect Russian-U. S. broader relations. Finally, in revealing the civilizational value of Russia’s Islam, I expose intellectual relations among influential subjects who share the aim to devise a new civilizational model that should combine Slavic and non-Slavic, Orthodox and Islamic, Western, and Asian components. In this old Russian dilemma, the novelty is Muslims’ participation...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates and {{explains}} {{the shift of}} the relative priority in China’s energy policy in the 1990 s and 2000 s. Between 1996 and 2015, the priority of China’s national energy policy had shifted from an emphasis on energy supply security to energy demand efficiency. A central question this study seeks to answer is: what forces led to this shift of policy priority? To answer the question, this study proposes a multi-layered and cross-sectoral analytical framework based on Historical Institutionalism theory. It focuses on the complex interaction between ideas, institutions and interests to understand the politics of China’s energy policy change. This study establishes a model of policy change {{as a means of}} institutional adaptation to manage an emerging mismatch between evolving <b>ideational</b> <b>patterns</b> at the national level, and the persistence of certain interest-seeking behaviour shaped by historically-formulated institutions at the subnational level. With the introduction of the “Socialist Market Economy” idea in the early 1990 s, China began to deepen its reform on two sets of fundamental institution that define China’s state-industry relations and central-local intergovernmental relations. Over time, the reforms profoundly impacted the development of China’s two major energy-based industrial value chains, namely the Coal-Metallurgical Value Chain (CMVC) and the Oil-Petrochemical Value Chain (OPVC), by shaping their asymmetrical institutional connections with Chinese government at central and local levels. At the national level, the 1990 s reforms helped to build strong institutional connections between the central government and the OPVC, which greatly contributed to China’s energy security in the 2000 s. However, decentralising and marketising most heavy industries allowed interest-seeking local governments to build strong institutional connections with the CMVC, causing the 1990 s reforms to produce an unintended consequence of heavy industrialisation that has significantly changed China’s economic structure. Such uncontrolled heavy industrialisation, revealed by the country’s declining energy efficiency in the early 2000 s, had increasingly went against a new generation of Chinese top leadership’s “Scientific Development” idea. A major energy policy shift was therefore initiated and utilised by the central government to curb the heavy industrialisation. The central government’s institutional connections with the coal-based heavy industries, especially those in the CMVC, were rebuilt and strengthened. Overall, this study provides a more sophisticated understanding of how ideas, institutions and interests dynamically interact to produce major policy change {{in the context of a}} transitional state...|$|R
40|$|Professional {{collaboration}} in schools features prominently in contemporary approaches to educational change. Advocates highlight {{the importance of}} situated knowledge to continuous teacher learning, sustained school reform and improved student learning. Critics portray collaboration as an invisible and coercive means of official control. The framework {{presented in this paper}} aims to treat these perspectives not as ideological positions but as starting points for empirical investigation into the dynamics of power in professional collaboration. The framework draws on social semiotic theories of language and functional linguistics to portray {{the ways in which the}} development of ideas and the development of social relations ideational and interpersonal meaning move in concert. Excerpts from an in-depth study of interaction among science teachers and teacher-leaders in a secondary school undergoing broad reform illustrate the application of this framework. Attention to the dynamics of support and challenge in the most generative of these interactions reveals distinctive patterns of the negotiation of interpersonal and <b>ideational</b> meaning. These <b>patterns</b> of control provide a means of connecting the microprocesses of building knowledge with the broader dynamics of power at play in educational change...|$|R

Eliot, they have examined only cursorily {{the influence of}} St. John of the Cross. The first reference ot Eliot to St. John of the Cross is the second epigraph or "Fragment of a Prologue" written tor The Criterion in 1926 and published with "Fragment or an Agon" under the title, Sweeney Agonistes, in 1932. In the twenty-eight years since this epigraph of Eliot, {{there have been no}} consistent studies of st. John ot the Cross, nor have critics ventured beyond the "dark night of the soul. " Moreover, they classify as the dark night of the soul all the mystical elements in the poetry and drama of Eliot, {{despite the fact that the}} dark night is only one phase of the mystical doctrine of St. John ot the Cross. 	The aim or this study, then, is the examination of the informing influence of st. John of the Cross in the <b>ideational</b> and symbolic <b>patterns</b> of Eliot. It traces the progress of the life of the soul, as described by St. John of the Cross, through the ascetical, mystical, and unitive ways, and shows this development in the poetry and drama ot T. S.
