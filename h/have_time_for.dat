According to Knoke, one time Specht's wife came to visit him on the II./JG 11 base but {{was held at the}} guard room on Specht's orders and refused to receive calls from the guard. Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to 'put herself on ice', saying that he would only <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> her after the war. Specht however did not survive, dying five months before the war in Europe came to an end.|$|E
5|$|In 1780 the Priestleys {{moved to}} Birmingham {{and spent a}} happy decade {{surrounded}} by old friends, until {{they were forced to}} flee in 1791 by religiously motivated mob violence in {{what became known as the}} Priestley Riots. Priestley accepted the ministerial position at New Meeting on the condition that he be required to preach and teach only on Sundays, so that he would <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> his writing and scientific experiments. As in Leeds, Priestley established classes for the youth of his parish and by 1781, he was teaching 150 students. Because Priestley's New Meeting salary was only 100 guineas, friends and patrons donated money and goods to help continue his investigations. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the car, with the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E

5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries to grow a mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him to grow a mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> dating because she has a daughter.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 1–2 July, the Allies were camped at Armerdingen, [...] from Donauwörth. It was here when Marlborough {{received}} an urgent message from Baron Moltenburg, Prince Eugene's Adjutant-General, that Marshal Tallard was marching with 35,000 troops through the Black Forest to reinforce the Franco-Bavarian army. This news convinced Marlborough {{that he did not}} <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a protracted siege and, despite protestations from Baden– arguing that a direct assault would incur severe casualties– the Duke planned for an outright assault on the position. D'Arco knew of the whereabouts of the Allied camp at Armerdingen, and was confident he had at least a full day and night to prepare his defences.|$|E
500|$|Brook Farm was {{initially}} based {{mostly on the}} ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment meant {{to serve as an}} example {{for the rest of the}} world, established on the principles of [...] "industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity". Many in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating. Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. He wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, [...] "labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified".|$|E

500|$|In October 1840, George Ripley {{announced}} to the Transcendental Club that {{he was planning to}} form a Utopian community. Brook Farm, as it would be called, was based on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment was meant to serve as an example {{for the rest of the}} world, based on the principles of [...] "industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity". At Brook Farm, as in other communities, physical labor was perceived as a condition of mental well-being and health. Brook Farm was one of at least 80 communal experiments active in the United States throughout the 1840s, though it was the first to be secular. Ripley believed his experiment would be a model for the rest of society. He predicted: [...] "If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star." [...] As more interested people began to take part in planning, Ripley relocated meetings from his home to the West Street bookshop operated by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.|$|E
500|$|Neither brother married. Wilbur once quipped {{that he did}} not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> both a {{wife and}} an airplane. Following a brief {{training}} flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June 1911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, [...] "When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose." [...] Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European – particularly Parisian – philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would [...] "come home white".|$|E
