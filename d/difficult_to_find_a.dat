5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> record company who would release the track, either because labels {{were worried about}} the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or {{because they did not}} see any {{commercial}} potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded and it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> spot to dock.|$|E

5|$|After Van Leer's death, Paul Weber {{served as}} acting {{president}} from January 1956 to August 1957, while {{still holding the}} title of Dean of Faculties; it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> permanent replacement due to discriminatory state laws and the looming issue of integration, along with a salary gap between Georgia Tech and comparable institutions. Weber's short tenure as acting president saw significantly increased enrollment standards, efforts by the Georgia Tech Foundation to increase faculty salaries, and further campus expansion including the Alexander Memorial Coliseum, which was completed and dedicated on October 27, 1956. Weber left larger organizational changes and integration for his eventual successor. After {{the selection of a}} replacement in the University of Toledo's Dean of Engineering, Edwin D. Harrison, Weber remained a Georgia Tech administrator and was named Vice President for Planning in 1966.|$|E

25|$|In 1971 it was {{described}} {{that it was}} very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> CR cell in the adult cortex, because of the constant number of these cells and the fact that as the brain grows, the distance between these cells increases, required the observation of a great number of preparations to find one of these cells.|$|E
25|$|No, {{never again}} war, which destroys {{the lives of}} {{innocent}} people, teaches how to kill, throws into upheaval even {{the lives of those}} who do the killing and leaves behind a trail of resentment and hatred, thus making it all the more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> just solution of the very problems which provoked the war.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> present-day parallel. The {{withholding}} of copyright, {{though only}} an indirect financial penalty, was both an official act and a hostile signal. We {{do not seem}} to have a word for this kind of indirect pressure, though suppression of dissent comes closer than censorship. Perhaps the modern 'naming and shaming' comes closest. The importance of respectability, reputation and public standing were critical in this case, as so often in traditional societies.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioluminescence}} of {{the larvae}} of fireflies is also circularly polarized, {{as reported in}} 1980 for the species Photuris lucicrescens and Photuris versicolor. For fireflies, it is more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> microscopic explanation for the polarization, because {{the left and right}} lanterns of the larvae were found to emit polarized light of opposite senses. The authors suggest that the light begins with a linear polarization due to inhomogeneties inside aligned photocytes, and it picks up circular polarization while passing through linearly birefringent tissue.|$|E
25|$|Whether DNA testing {{can confirm}} the {{identity}} of the male: According to the experts, the use of ancient DNA technology in archaeological research has yet to be fully developed so there may be technical difficulties. Besides, the male skeleton was not well preserved so the DNA extraction procedure may be very complicated. Even if the technology is fully functional, scientists still require DNA samples from a verified living descendant of Cao Cao to confirm the results. It is very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> living descendant of Cao Cao and verify that he/she is really a descendant of Cao Cao.|$|E
50|$|From 1900 onwards, the Norwegian Army {{sold the}} {{obsolete}} M1867 {{to the public}} for a nominal price. Many of these were converted into hunting rifles and shotguns, so that it has become <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> M1867 in its original form.|$|R
30|$|However, it {{is still}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> {{analytical}} solution from (16)–(18), since the system consisting of (14) and (15) is nonlinear. To simplify this problem, we could consider linear equations instead of nonlinear ones. The following lemma provides a key step in this direction.|$|R
50|$|It is also <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> {{approximate}} {{solution of the}} problem, that satisfies a number of clauses within a guaranteed approximation ratio of the optimal solution. More precisely, the problem is APX-complete, and thus does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme unless P = NP.|$|R
25|$|While islet {{transplantation}} {{research has}} made important progress {{and the success}} stories are encouraging, the long-term safety and efficacy of the procedure remain unclear. Other concerns {{relating to the field}} include questions about the impact of having insulin-producing foreign cells within the hepatic parenchyma, the long-term consequences of elevated portal pressures resulting from the islet infusion, and the fact that islet recipients can be sensitized against donor tissue types, making it more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> suitable donor should another life-saving transplant be required in the future. Also, very few islet transplant recipients have remained euglycemic without the use of any exogenous insulin beyond four years post-transplant. Thus, while most islet recipients achieve better glycemia control and suffer less serious hypoglycemia, islet transplantation continues to fall short of the definitive diabetes cure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1910, Welsh was finding it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> fight. Wolgast was pricing {{himself out of the}} market, McFarland could not reach the weight and the National Sporting Centre could not find a {{credible}} contender to challenge for the Lonsdale Belt. Jim Driscoll, who had earlier won the flyweight Lonsdale Belt, was in a similar situation and a highly anticipated match was arranged between them. Two uninspiring fights were arranged before the Driscoll encounter in December, a sixth round win over middleweight Joe Heathcote and then a ninth round stoppage over Dick Bailey. A long build up to the game caused the relationship between Welsh and Driscoll to sour, and when they met to sign the contracts, an argument broke out between the two men over the choice of referee. Driscoll lost his temper with Welsh, became verbally abusive and stormed out of the meeting.|$|E
25|$|Varangfly, later renamed Norving, was {{the first}} airline to operate {{regularly}} to Båtsfjord. Using seaplanes they flew both air taxi and air ambulance services to Kirkenes, starting in the 1960s. The regular services were terminated in 1963 {{with the opening of}} Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. Varangfly applied to the government for concession and subsidies to operate to Båtsfjord, but the application was rejected. In 1964 Varangfly took initiative to develop plans for a small airfield in Båtsfjord and several other villages in Finnmark. This was followed up by the regional authorities; a Finnmark County Council-appointed committee published a report in 1966 recommending Båtsfjord as one of six regional airports in Finnmark. As the county had the lowest priority on the state-financed construction of regional airports, there were many locals who called for an intermediate solution with locally financed and simpler airfields. Båtsfjord was considered for inclusion in the state-financed regional network, but skipped when it proved <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> suitable location.|$|E

5000|$|On AltDaily, David Paul Kleinman wrote, [...] "Phish {{has always}} been an act extempore, which is {{something}} that separates them out from virtually every other act hitting the large venues they do. It's <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> arena act that has even one second that isn't prescripted. It's <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>an</b> arena band that isn't playing the exact same songs in the exact same order every night: [...] "Thank you, Cleveland... uh, I mean, Baltimore!" [...] Phish is the very rare sort of act that performs without a net, and these two sets from a chilly night in upstate New York illustrate the band's widening range of risky moves. It's one thing to experiment with one kind of music per night. It is quite another thing to experiment with several kinds per night." ...|$|R

25|$|Early {{symptoms}} {{may include}} loss of precision muscle coordination (sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship, frequent small injuries to the hands, and dropped items), cramping pain with sustained use, and trembling. Significant muscle pain and cramping {{may result from}} very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome. Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to temporomandibular joint disorder. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.|$|E
25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} to be a difficult task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because of the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted {{that the people who are}} displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often lower than they would have been had the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 2001, 2002 and 2003, {{the band}} worked on writing new material, {{initially}} renting {{a house in}} St. Tropez where sound engineer Mark Tinley built a recording studio for their first serious writing session. They then returned to London to do some self-financed work with various producers (including old friend Nile Rodgers) and {{search for a new}} record deal. It proved <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> record label willing to gamble on the band's comeback, so Duran Duran went on tour to prove the drawing power of the reunited band. The response of the fans and the media exceeded expectations. The band played a handful of 25th-anniversary dates across 2003, starting with two arena dates in Tokyo filled to capacity. Tickets sold out for each show within minutes, and celebrities turned out en masse for reunion dates. Amongst these were a number of shows at smaller venues that the band had played {{on both sides of the}} pond when they first got together in the early 80s. In August, the band were booked as presenters at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, only to be surprised with a Lifetime Achievement Award. They also received a Lifetime Achievement award from Q magazine in October, and the equivalent Outstanding Contribution award at the BRIT Awards in February 2004.|$|E
5000|$|As box {{designs were}} changed regularly, some boxes or even model/box {{combinations}} were produced in lower quantities, and thus became quite <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> <b>As</b> an example, {{the first seven}} 1-75 models were packaged in [...] "A Moko Lesney" [...] boxes (cf. above, [...] "History", Moko) on which the word [...] "Moko" [...] was written in script. Today, these boxes are extremely valuable. Later '50s boxes — including the 2nd editions of those for model numbers 1 to 7 — had [...] "Moko" [...] in the same capital letters as the words surrounding it.|$|R
