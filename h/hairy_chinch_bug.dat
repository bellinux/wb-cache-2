Greenhouse and field screening studies were initiated to search for cool- and warm-season turfgrasses with resistance to <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> in the Blissus complex. Several warmseason turfgrasses (buffalograss, zoysiagrass, and bermudagrass) with resistance to the western <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> have been identified. Studies are currently underway to investigate the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying resistant turfgrasses. This information is fundamentally important for formulating plant breeding strategies, and subsequently developing chinch bug-resistant germplasm through conventional breeding and biotechnological techniques. This research project has also focused on documenting the presence of multiple <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance among these cool- and warm-season turfgrasses. These studies have identified turfgrasses with resistance to multiple <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> and suggest different feeding mechanisms among the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> complex.

40|$|Blissus leucopterus hirtus Montandon (Hemiptera: Blissidae) (<b>hairy</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bug),</b> is a pest of turfgrass in Quebec and Atlantic Canada {{that causes}} {{considerable}} damage to turf and lawns. This research investigated {{the influence of}} environmental heterogeneity on the phenology, morphology and host preference of B. leucopterus hirtus. Populations of B. leucopterus hirtus in St. John's, NL displayed the lowest threshold for egg development and {{the highest rate of}} egg development compared with other regions across the insect's range, indicating environmental influence attributable to shorter and cooler summers in the St. John's region. This adaptation was also reflected in a more compact phenology compared to other regions. Cumulative Degree Days and Julian Days were both effective in predicting the appearance of 2 nd instars, a critical milestone for pest managers in conducting appropriately timed pesticide application. [...] There was no difference in tertiary sex ratio among sites at a local scale, but there was an greater number of males than females in Fall 2004 and 2005 compared to the sprang, suggesting differential mortality of dispersal. Wing form ratios varied at the local scale and over time, with an increase in brachypters over two years indicating increasingly established populations. Differences in habitat at the local and regional scale were sufficient to produce differences in insect size, with the smallest insect size rankings in St. John's, NL, where egg development rates were also most rapid. [...] Differences in host choice among 1 st instars of B. leucopterus hirtus were observed at the local and regional level, demonstrating flexibility in host choice among populations. Preference was affected by age of insect, with 1 st instars favouring Kentucky bluegrass, while 5 th instars were less discriminant. Tendency for aggregation in later instars appeared to influence choice. Based on these results, pest managers should be better able to predict host vegetation based on insect phenology and potentially apply alternative methods of control such a vacuuming when populations are likely to be found on specific host plants as a result of either feeding preference or other behaviour tendencies such as aggregation. [...] The results of this thesis confirm the influence of environmental heterogeneity on the phenology, morphology and host preference of B. leucopterus hirtus and the subsequent need for regional specificity in pest management, along with consideration of insect age and populations dynamics in host choice research...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{highlights}} the practical {{application of a}} Piper-based botanical insecticide for controlling insect pests {{of the home and}} garden in urban areas in eastern Canada and northeastern North America. Biopesticides, including botanicals, can offer a safe and effective alternative to conventional insecticides for controlling major insect pests within an IPM program. Secondary compounds from the Piperaceae family, specifically the abundant isobutyl amides and lignans, have shown promise for insecticidal applications. A method for extraction and HPLC-MS analysis of Piper spp. was developed in order to allow quick and accurate measure of piperamide levels in P. nigrum, P. tuberculatum, West African Guinea pepper, P. guineense Schum and Thonn, and in less recognized species from Central America. Extraction of leaf and peppercorn material with 50 : 50 ethyl acetate and water provided a greater than 80 % recovery of spiked piperine. HPLC analysis using a binary gradient of acetonitrile and water provided a clean separation of the major amide peaks between 5 and 12 min. The use of APCI-MS improved the detection limit 10 fold below the 2 -ng limit of the HPLC-DAD method. Extracts from P. nigrum, P. guineense and P. tuberculatum were tested for efficacy against insects from five orders. Among the insect pests tested, the most sensitive species were, in order of increasing lethal concentration: Eastern tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum F. < European pine sawfly larvae, Neodiprion sertifer Geoffroy < spindle ermine moth larvae, Yponomeuta cagnagella Hubner < Viburnum leaf beetle larvae, Pyrrhalta viburni Paykull < stripped cucumber beetle adult, Acalymma vittatum Fabrcius < Colorado potato beetle adult, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) < Japanese beetle adult, Popillia japonica Newman < <b>hairy</b> <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> Blissus leucopterus hirtus Montandon. Greenhouse trials revealed that the pepper formulations also had a repellent activity thus protecting plant leaves from: (1) herbivory by lily leaf beetles, Lilioceris lilii (Scopoli) adults and larvae, and striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum F. adults and (2) oviposition by European corn borer, Ostrina nubilalis (Hubner). When an insecticide resistant strain of potato beetle larvae was tested with the P. tuberculatum extract, there was less than a two fold tolerance ratio compared to the 22 -fold tolerance ratio to cypermethrin, a pyrethroid. An in vitro polysubstrate monoxygenase (PSMO) enzyme assay, using the substrate methoxyresorufin O-demethylation (MROD), determined that piperine, is responsible for inhibition of that specific enzyme. A subsequent toxicokinetic study determined that piperine is quickly eliminated from the exoskeleton (t 1 / 2 = 16. 5 h) and hemolymph (t 1 / 2 = 12 h) of the adult American cockroach Periplaneta americana L. after a topical application.

40|$|Plant {{germplasm}} collections {{may offer}} genetic variability useful in identifying insect resistance. The {{goal of this}} project was to evaluate buffalograss genotypes [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.)

The mean number of <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> was significantly different among the 48 genotypes. There was no significant correlation between <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and ploidy level or <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and pubescence.

40|$|Information on genetic {{diversity}} and relationship of native buffalograss germplasm is limited and genetic basis of agronomic traits is unknown. The objectives {{of this research}} were to determine: (1) the {{genetic diversity}}, relationships, and organelle DNA inheritance based on cpDNA and mtDNA, (2) <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance variation in natural buffalograss populations characterized for cpDNA and mtDNA; (3) the degree of correlation between total protein content, basal peroxidase level, <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury, and ploidy level, and (4) total protein content and peroxidase changes of resistant and susceptible germplasm in response to <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs.</b> Fifty-six, 48, 28, and, 6 buffalograsses were evaluated for organelle DNA, <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance, correlation analysis, and peroxidase changes, respectively. Six cpDNA and three mtDNA non-coding regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using universal chloroplast and mitochondrial primer pairs. Each amplified fragment was digested with 2 to 6 different restriction enzymes. For the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> study, genotypes were evaluated in replicated trials under greenhouse conditions. Leaf samples were collected for peroxidase changes from infested and control plants at 7, 14, 21, and 28 day after exposure (DAE) to <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs.</b> Peroxidase analyses were carried out using native gels stained for anionic peroxidases and enzyme kinetics were measured with a spectrophotometer. Forty-seven of 56 genotypes had identical cpDNA and mtDNA RFLPs and the rest showed only a few polymorphic markers, which suggests a single maternal origin for the four buffalograss ploidy levels. Based {{on the use of}} cpDNA primers amplifying intergenic region between psbC and trnS genes, and restriction enzyme Hae III, cpDNA was determined to be maternally inherited in buffalograss. The germplasm had considerable diversity for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance, with approximately 10 % of the germplasm having a high resistance level. There was no significant correlation between <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and ploidy level or <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and pubescence. Of the genotypes studied, 4 were highly resistant, 22 were moderately resistant, 19 were moderately susceptible and three were highly susceptible to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury, showing a continuous distribution. Basal peroxidase expression levels measured in the 28 non-infested plants of resistant and susceptible buffalograsses did not correlate with <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury. All six genoptypes evaluated for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> activity showed an increased level of peroxidase levels in infested plants, suggesting upregulation in response to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury. Relatively low levels of peroxidase in a highly <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistant genotype, PX- 3 - 5 - 1, infers contribution of other genes to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance.

50|$|The <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> {{a native}} to the United States and common in midwestern states, has had a great effect on humans. The <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> {{naturally}} feeds on wild prairie grasses.

Throughout the 20th century, the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> was a major pest to farmers, as it quickly decimated corn or wheat fields. To deal with this problem, many farmers in the area changed their crops to soybeans, which were not a host to the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug.</b> This led to a huge decrease in the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> population in this area.

Nymphs reared on oats, Early Sumac and DeKalb DK- 61 sorghum had higher mortality and slower development than those on wheat, corn SX- 19, ACCO GR- 1089 sorghum, or barley. When provided a choice between sorghum varieties, <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> more severely damaged GR- 1089. ^ The effect of three populations of <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> at two stages (nymphs vs. adults) on seedlings of two sorghum varieties at three heights resulted in greater damage and lower yields for Early Sumac than DeKalb DK- 61. <b>Chinch</b> <b>bug</b> mortality did not differ with variety.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of screening techniques to identify sorghum lines with <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance indicated that single-seedling no-choice tests {{are a good}} starting point in discerning resistance/susceptibility. Multiple choice tests may not be very effective in identifying specific antixenotic properties. Dual-choice single seedling tests helps in the pairwise {{comparison of}} lines with a resistant or susceptible check. This technique is very sensitive and can identify very low levels of resistance/susceptibility. Seedling tolerance tests that study the ability of the line to compensate for early damage by <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> are of more value because they help to identify sorghum lines with good field tolerance to the pest. ^ Sorghum plant volatiles extracted as steam distillates from the resistant line KS 94 possessed <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> repelling qualities when used in high concentrations (2000 and 4000 ppm). The extracts of the susceptible line Double Dwarf Yellow Milo (DDYM) did not possess <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> attracting attributes. <b>Chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistant lines contained significantly higher levels of total phenolics and tannin when compared to susceptible lines. Phenolic acid concentration ranged from 14. 21 μg/ 10 mg of plant sample in DDYM at 2 weeks after planting to 82. 61 μg/ 10 mg of plant sample in KS 94 at 12 weeks after planting. Tannin content ranged from 41. 04 μg/ml of tannin extract at 2 weeks after planting in DDYM to 230. 95 μg/ml of tannin extract in KS 94 at 12 weeks after planting. HPLC separation of phenolic acids indicated that the resistant lines KS 94 and KS 95 had significantly higher concentrations of p-hydroxybenzoic, ferulic and protocatechuic acids.

The flexibility of using multiple input impedances with the AC-DC monitor was valuable for determining the electrical origin (resistance vs. electromotive force components) of the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> waveforms. It was concluded that an input impedance of 107 Ω, with either DC or AC applied voltage, is optimal to detect all resistance- and electromotive force–component waveforms produced during <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> probing. Knowledge of electrical origins suggested hypothesized biological meanings of the waveforms, before time-intensive future correlation experiments by using histology, microscopy, and other techniques...|$|R
40|$|Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.) is a warm season {{perennial}} {{grass that}} {{has emerged as a}} turfgrass species due to its low maintenance requirements, and suitability for different turf uses. Turfgrass quality and western <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> (Blissus occiduus Barber) resistance are of interest to buffalograss breeding programs. The objectives of the current research were to (1) explore genetic variability for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance among available genotypes; (2) assess the merits of hybridization breeding in creating <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance, buffalograss morphological traits, and turfgrass performance genetic variability; and (3) construct a genetic linkage map of diploid buffalograss. Fifteen buffalograss genotypes comprising diploids, tetraploids, pentaploid and hexaploids were evaluated for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance. Three half-sib populations were generated by crossing four diploid buffalograss genotypes (three females and one male). Random samples of the half- sibs were field evaluated for turfgrass performance. One full-sib population was selected, and 94 progeny from this population were evaluated for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and genotyped using Sequence Related Amplified Polymorphisms (SRAP) and Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers for genetic linkage mapping. The evaluation of parents and progeny indicated highly significant differences among the crosses and the parents for all the traits studied. The progeny nested within crosses differed only for genetic color and turfgrass quality in fall. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) showed high improvement potential for lateral spread, genetic color, and spring density. These results support the potential of recombination breeding in identifying transgressive segregants for certain traits of interest in buffalograss genotypes. The genotypes (diploids, tetraploids, pentaploid, and hexaploids) and the progeny evaluated for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance had highly significant differences for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> damage ratings. The genotypes were categorized into moderately resistant to moderately susceptible types. Genotypes NE 3297, 196, 184, Bowie, and Legacy were moderately resistant with a damage rating of 3 ̆e 1, but 3 ̆c 3, while NE 2990, NE 2838, and 1 - 57 - 19 were moderately susceptible with a damage rating of≥ 3, but 3 ̆c 4. The susceptible genotypes, NE 2990, NE 2838, and 378, had area under the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> damage progress curve ranging from 88. 2 to 78. 1, while the resistant genotypes, Prestige, NE 3297 and NE 196, had values of 53. 7 to 59. 2. There was no relationship between ploidy level of the genotypes and <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance. The progeny were segregated into one highly resistant, 78 progeny (83...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, buffalograss, Buchloë dactyloides (Nuttall) Engelmann {{has gained}} {{popularity}} as a turfgrass {{because of its}} low maintenance requirement, drought tolerance, and limited pests and diseases. Within the last decade, however, the western <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> Blissus occiduus Barber has emerged as important pest of buffalograss. Considerable {{progress has been made}} toward identifying buffalograsses with resistance to the western <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> and understanding the mechanisms of the resistance. It has been hypothesized that chinch bug-resistant buffalograsses can effectively detoxify the elevated levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) through enhanced activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes, while ROS accumulates in the susceptible plants because of the inability of the plant to detoxify these compounds. The objectives of this research were to document the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and the levels of peroxidase and catalase in both control and B. occiduus challenged buffalograsses. Two genotypes of buffalograss were evaluated: the chinch bug-resistant (tolerant) cultivar, Prestige, and chinch bug-susceptible cultivar, 378. Histochemical (diaminobenzidine; DAB) staining techniques were employed to document hydrogen peroxide accumulation and catalase activity. Hydrogen peroxide levels were also detected at the ultrastructural level using cerium. <b>Chinch</b> <b>bug</b> infested Prestige plants had higher levels of hydrogen peroxide accumulation relative to their control plants and <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> infested 378 plants. According to DAB staining for catalase activity, both infested 378 and Prestige plants had higher levels of catalase activity initially when compared to their uninfested control plants. However, by day 11 following insect introduction, infested Prestige plants showed a higher apparent level of catalase accumulation as compared to infested 378 plants. In addition, enzyme kinetic studies revealed a higher level of peroxidase activities in 378 plants in response to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding at early time points. However, at later time points both control and infested plants showed similar levels of peroxidase activity. By contrast, infested Prestige plants exhibited significantly higher or similar levels of peroxidase activity to their control plants. <b>Chinch</b> <b>bug</b> infested 378 plants had a lower level of catalase activity relative to their control plants, while similar levels of catalase were observed in chinch bug-infested and control Prestige plants. This research supports our working hypothesis on the importance of hydrogen peroxide and oxidative enzymes in the response of tolerant and susceptible buffalograss plants to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding. The ultimate goal of this research is to help identify the mechanisms underlying the tolerance traits in resistance plants to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug...</b>|$|R
40|$|The grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> Macchiademus diplopterus (Distant) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), is a pest {{of export}} fruit from South Africa of {{quarantine}} concern. During summer adult M. diplopterus move from their host plants, usually wheat, to find shelter for aestivation, and may settle on fruit, sheltering at the stalk and calyx ends. Grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bugs</b> are endemic to the Western Cape region of South Africa, but their distribution and abundance in the fruit-growing areas {{of this region}} are not known. A survey was conducted {{over a period of}} three years (2004 - 2007) to determine if any particular fruit-growing area or fruit type is more prone to grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> infestation. Data on the type of vegetation surrounding the sites used in the survey, and climatic data of each area were analysed to determine which factors influence M. diplopterus abundance. No particular fruit type was found to be more prone to infestation. Areas with high numbers of M. diplopterus (Ceres, Porterville and Piketberg) had significantly lower average monthly relative humidities and minimum temperatures than areas with low numbers. Surrounding wheat fields and close proximity of wheat fields to orchards also contribute to higher numbers of grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> in the orchards. In the absence of methods to control grain <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> in orchards or on deciduous fruit, producers in areas with high numbers are more likely to experience problems with rejections of consignments presented for export. Research is required to develop methods to control M. diplopterus. Revie...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Understanding plant {{resistance}} mechanisms at {{a molecular}} level would provide valuable insights into the biological pathways impacted by insect feeding, and help explain specific plant tolerance mechanisms. As {{a first step in}} this process, we conducted next-generation sequencing using RNA extracted from chinch bug-tolerant and -susceptible buffalograss genotypes at 7 and 14 d after <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding. Sequence descriptions and gene ontology terms were assigned to 1, 701 differentially expressed genes. Defense-related transcripts were differentially expressed within the chinch bug-tolerant buffalograss, Prestige, and susceptible buffalograss, 378. Interestingly, four peroxidase transcripts had higher basal expression in tolerant control plants compared with susceptible control plants. Defense-related transcripts, including two peroxidase genes, two catalase genes, several cytochrome P 450 transcripts, a glutathione s-transferase, and a WRKY gene were upregulated within the Prestige transcriptome in response to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding. The majority of observed transcripts with oxidoreductase activity, including nine peroxidase genes and a catalase gene, were downregulated in 378 in response to initial <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding. The observed difference in transcript expression between these two buffalograss genotypes provides insight into the mechanism(s) of resistance, specifically buffalograss tolerance to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding...|$|R
