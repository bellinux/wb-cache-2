The following work {{is focusing on}} the case of non-flammable liquid as the process liquid in case the working area around the equipment may contain quantities of explosive gases. As stated by Alfa Laval documentation, the major risk is leaking of the explosive atmosphere into the separator from the surrounding environment which may result in producing zone 1 or zone 2 of hazardous area classification. Zone 1 : Area in which an <b>explosive</b> <b>gas-air</b> <b>mixture</b> is likely to occur for short periods in normal operation. 1 Zone 2 : Area in which an <b>explosive</b> <b>gas-air</b> <b>mixture</b> is not likely to occur, and if it occurs it will only exist for a very short time due to an abnormal condition. 1 According to Alfa Laval design package, there is a need of continuous inert gas injection into the separator during the process {{in order to reduce the}} oxygen concentration and keep it in the safe level (inert gas purging) and this policy is aimed to meet the requirements of ATEX-directive 94 / 9 /EC/ 2003. The objective of the current thesis is a wish to have a better understanding of the potential risks, evaluating them and try to find ways to ease the process. The outcome can be useful to make a basic instruction for further tests and simplifications as well. The separator GTN 50 is selected and hydrogen (1 % concentration) is used to simulate the explosive atmosphere. The result of the tests indicates that the cooling down stage after normal operation is the only period in which hydrogen will leak into the separator, frame top part and it should be cleaned up before the next start up.

40|$|Dry low {{emissions}} premixed combustion {{systems have}} the ability to give larger NOx emissions reduction in comparison to diffusion type of combustors. However, these systems are prone to flashback because the fuel and oxidizers are mixed upstream of the combustion chamber. This is particularly true for premixed systems burning high-reactivity fuels due to their higher flame speed. Flashback is undesirable in gas turbines because it leads to overheating and failure of fuel nozzles and premixing sections. Recently, a novel application of Plasma Actuation through non-thermal Dielectric Barrier Discharge has been shown to significantly delay flashback in the core flow along the axis of the premixer. Building on this successful endeavour, efforts were directed to prove the effectiveness of the control method in situations where flashback was triggered in the boundary layer.

The mathematical model of this system is consists of: mathematical model of the tube gas heater, mathematical model of heat distribution in the building structure and corresponding boundary conditions. To solve the tasks of analysis and synthesis must be appropriate mathematical and information support. Purpose. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the developed mathematical and information support that solve the problems of analysis and synthesis of heating systems with gas tube heaters, located in building constructions. Conclusion. Mathematical support includes the development of algorithms and software for the numerical solution of problems analysis and synthesis heating system. Information support includes all the necessary parameters characterizing the thermal properties of materials which used in the heating system, and the parameters characterizing the heat exchange between the coolant and components of the heating system. It was developed algorithms for solving problems of analysis and synthesis heating system with tube gas heater located in structures to use evolutionary search algorithm and software. It was made experimental study and was obtained results allow to calculate the heat transfer from the <b>gas-air</b> <b>mixture</b> to the boundary surface of the building structure. This results and computation will provide full information support for solving problems of analysis and synthesis of the heating system. Was developed mathematical and software support, which allows to solve the problems of analysis and synthesis heating systems with gas tube heaters, located in building structures. Tube gas heaters located in the building structures allows with small capital expenditures to provide space heating. Is necessary to solve the problems of analysis (calculation) and synthesis (design and management regimes) for high-quality design of such systems...|$|R
