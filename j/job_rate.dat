I demonstrate that over "typical" years deteriorating job rates (or wages) increase the probability of attending school and decrease the probability of combining work and school, particularly for boys. After controlling for household and individual characteristics I find that the probability of being in school for secondary school youth was about 6 percentage points higher in 2002 than in 1998 (before the recession started). In fact, a 10 percent decrease in the <b>job</b> <b>rate</b> alone has been responsible for a 5. 4 percentage point rise in the probability of school attendance since 2000.

40|$|In Chapter 1 ，I {{introduce}} the viewpoint {{and the purpose}} of this study. This is a study of the wage and salary administration system which is really the substance of labor management in modern enterprise. In this paper. Wage and salary payment system is taken up as the central problem domain from the viewpoint of business management. And then this study' s purpose is to consider that wage and salary payment system based on the seniority-oriented system should be corrected for what kind of it in the times of aging of population composition, internationalization of labor movement, and the computerization in our country. Moreover. it considers about the rule by which wage and salary payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for wage and salary, and the principles of wage and salary administration which are not established as yet in Japanese enterprise. Chapter 2 is the preceding chapter before the main subject. The wage and salary payment system which is the central problem domain of wage and salary administration system is surrounded by various laws, theories and influences on wage and salary administration. I considered the surrounding four positions. The first is the legal theory on subjects of wage and salary (labor standard law of our country, collective agreement and office regulations of enterprise of our country). The second is the theory of wage and salary as economic theory (the wage fund theory, the marginal productivity theory and the labor value theory). The third is the social theory of the wage and salary as the factor which should be taken into consideration in the case of wage and salary determination (the market rate, the laborer' s living expenses level, change of prices, labor productivity, the ability of enterprise to pay) Finally，it is the business management theory of the wage and salary. Although such theory and influence are not the direct requirements for the wage and salary administration or wage and salary payment system, it's effect is never small Therein is clarified the basic meaning of wage and salary, the positioning wage and salary administration in labor management，and the domain of wage and salary administration. That is to say, the article about wage and salary is taken up from five laws, including the labor standard law of our country. And then，it is clarified that wage and salary is the compensation of labor between laborer and employer. Wage and salary administration is positioned with one basic domain of labor management that is divided to seven domains of labor management (Employment Management, Educational Training and Capability Development Management. Working Environmental Management. Wage and Salary Administration， Health and Welfare Management, Management of Human Relations，Management of lndustrial Relations). Also, the main domain of wage and salary administration is divided into two wage and salary payment system and the amount of money for wage and salary. These two points are occupying the important positions in this study. In Chapter 3, I discussed the trend of the actuality in the wage and salary administration system in enterprise of our country. The first wage and salary payment system in our country is a Den-san type wage structure, this wage structure had the deep color of living wages. Next. the seniority-oriented wage and salary payment system appeared around from 1960, subsequently, job performance abilities evaluation wage rate system appear around from 1975. But the color of living wages and seniority-oriented wages remained in this wage and salary payment system. However, in our country, aging of population composition and internationalization of labor movement progress around from 1980. It becomes increase of personnel expenses (labor cost) and it becomes the big burden of business management in enterprise. Moreover, in the times of the computerization which spreads quickly, the correspondence to change of the job contents is needed by business management in enterprise. In this way， adoption of a new wage and salary payment system come to be seen in after 1990. Here, I touch the annual salary system and profit or added value sharing plan that draws public attention as new wage and salary payment system. It is decided how the result (profit or added value) is shared among both based on recognition as the result of collaboration of laborer and employer (Profit Sharing Plan, Rucker Plan, Scanlon Plan, American Mortor's Plan, Kaiser Plan). The annual salary plan is the wage and salary payment system that is adopted as the managerial position of the company of our country on the pretext of restructuring in after 1990. This plan can say it is correction of the wage and salary payment system from living serious-consideration wages to job serious-consideration wages. Also，this plan has the strong character of reward, and the wage rate in this plan, can be called single <b>job</b> <b>rate.</b> Therefore, it is necessary for us to give feed back on job evaluation research. By the way, the seniority-oriented system and the custom of lifelong things completely, but however, have a close relation in fact. Merely，the wage and salary payment system does not give any answer about the amount of money for wage and salary. Therefore another principle is required. When the wage and salary payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for wage and salary, the separate principle is necessary. That is to say, the purpose of business management is the upkeep and the development of enterprise, and improvement in the laborer' s living standard. What business management should think important is two subjects of cost (labor cost) and laborer' s life (living expenses). From here, business management does not use mind only for the cost reduction, but should adopt “the laborer' s living standard" as the separate principle for the determination of the amount of money. Moreover，I {{introduce the}} principles of wage and salary administration which should be thought important. In case the wage and salary payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for wage and salary，it is very important. That is, conditions on the side of business management is the requirement of management. nature and objective of the organization, integration in administration. And conditions on the side of labor is satisfy the public interest, locality requirement, and reactions of the labor union. These principles are advocated by Prof. Y. Shimabukuro as basic theory of “Consensus Management". This “Consensus Management" is the important principle in that the determination of wage and salary should be reached by consensus among both laborer and employer. These six principles of wage and salary administration must be taken notice of as what functions on the “consensus" formation among business management and laborer. In addition，the incentive nature of wage and salary and the dissatisfied concentration nature of wage and salary are taken up as important matters in enforcement of the wage and salary administration system. Chapter 6 is conclusions of what so far has been described. That is to say wage and salary payment system which is main content of the wage and salary administration system in the modern enterprises has been studied center in this paper. First, as a direction of the ecdysis by aging and internationalization from the seniority-oriented wage and salary payment system, it was asserted that the correction to job evaluation wage rate system was concretely appropriate to the work(job) center wage and salary payment system. Secondly， the adoption of the Paterson method (the job evaluation method) is asserted as the correspondence to change of the job contents by the computerization. Thirdly, when the wage and salary payment system is combined with actual amount of money, the principle to be emphasized is no except for “living standard of the worker". Therefore, it should be sufficiently regarded on this principle in the business administration side. And, I would advocate that it should be equal agreement determination by the “consensus" formation among business management and laborers on the wage and salary administration system. まえがき　Abstract　基本用語　第 1 章 序　第 2 章 賃金管理に影響を与える理論 第 1 節 賃金管理といくつかの立場 第 2 節 賃金問題に関する理論 第 1 項 賃金の法律理論(賃金問題への法の介入) 第 2 項 賃金の経済理論(労働市場における賃金水準の存在) 第 3 項 賃金の社会理論(賃金決定の際に考慮されるべき要因) 第 4 項 賃金の経営理論(労務管理の実体としての賃金管理) 第 3 節 賃金管理と賃金支払制度 第 3 章 我国企業の賃金管理制度における現実の動向 第 1 節 年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱却 第 2 節 我国企業における新しい賃金支払制度の採用 第 1 項 成果分配制度 〈成果分配制度導入企業の実例〉 第 2 項 年俸制 〈年俸制導入企業の実例〉 第 3 節 職務給制度採用の妥当性 第 1 項 高齢化・国際化が要請する年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱皮の試み 第 2 項 職務評価と職務給制度 第 4 章 賃金支払制度と職務給制度 第 1 節 賃金問題と賃金支払制度 第 2 節 賃金支払制度の形態 第 3 節 職務給制度の発展 第 1 項 職務給制度の前身としての計測日給制度 第 2 項 職務給制度と労働能力 第 3 項 職務給制度における賃金体系 第 4 項 賃金規程の実例および職務給制度導入企業の実例 第 4 節 “意思決定"要素による職務評価(バターソン法) 第 1 項 評価要素および評価尺度 第 2 項 職務評価手続き 第 3 項 パターソン法による職務評価の事例(化学工業会社の場合) 第 4 項 パターソン法についてのまとめ 第 5 章 賃金支払制度と賃金額 第 1 節 賃金支払制度の賃金額への結合 第 2 節 賃金管理の原理 第 3 節 賃金管理制度の実施における留意点 第 1 項 賃金の刺激性 第 2 項 賃金とその不満集約性 第 6 章 結 ※注釈 ※参考文献 ※資料①～...|$|E

While the estimated natural <b>rates</b> of <b>job</b> reallocation are contained in a restricted range (see Appendix  2), the actual <b>job</b> reallocation <b>rates</b> are much more changeable, going from 0.2388 to  0. Indeed, this large difference would seem to confirm the criticism according to which actual <b>job</b> reallocation <b>rates</b> are significantly influenced by aggregate shocks, producing a short rather than a long-run measure of the natural need of job reallocation.|$|R
