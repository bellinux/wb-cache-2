25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E
500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. I got a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if I can help it. I tried to persuade the studio to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> different. But every time I went into my {{argument}} about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E
500|$|Barrett, {{along with}} Pink Floyd's managers, Peter Jenner and King, wanted {{to release the}} song as a single in the new year, before being vetoed by both the band and Norman Smith. Jenner said that [...] "Jugband Blues", along with two others that Syd wrote around this time, ("Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man") were [...] "amazing songs." [...] When {{compared}} to [...] "Bike" [...] and [...] "The Scarecrow", Jenner said [...] "You think, 'Well, OK, those are all right, but these are powerful disturbing art.' I wouldn't want anyone {{to have to go}} as mad and disturbed as Syd did to get that, but {{if you are going to}} go that disturbed <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> like that. That's great art." [...] Jenner had also called [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] "an extraordinary song, the ultimate self-diagnosis on a state of schizophrenia, [...] the portrait of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E

5000|$|The group’s name, Matthew 25 {{references}} the 25th {{chapter of}} the gospel of Matthew in which during the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, Jesus Christ summarizes His judgment of the righteous as follows: “For I was hungry and you <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to eat, I was thirsty and you <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.” ...|$|R

500|$|Adamson also {{desired to}} make the film larger in scale; [...] "I've gained {{confidence}} having gone through the first. This time, I {{was able to go}} larger [...] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes." [...] Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by [...] "tell people {{at the end of the}} scene, 'Now just <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> where you're not thinking about anything.' By using it in context, the audience will read an emotion into it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E
2500|$|That injury did {{not have}} him cancel any shows, as saying [...] "He (the doctor) told me it's going to hurt – though nothing could hurt worse than Saturday, I don't think – and they can <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to deaden the pain when I get out there. I also {{have to have a}} doctor {{standing}} by should something give, but I'm going to tape it up, and I'm going to get out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There'll {{have to be}} a change," [...] he said. [...] "Dick's {{accounts}} have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> {{to think}} about. I believe I'm beginning to understand now how his money went." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 {{their second}} single, [...] "You've <b>Given</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Something</b> That I Can't Give Back", made the Top 40, {{charting}} at number 38 and In 2006 The band won a 'Vodafone Live Music Award'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day I'll {{come back}} and be your pupil," [...] Julien promised. [...] "You're a good fellow, David. You've <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>{{something}}</b> to think about, at any rate, {{something to think about}} besides my own misfortunes." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I am hungry. If {{you don't}} <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>{{something}}</b> else to eat, I will eat you as well!", {{he said to}} Kubera. Desperate, Kubera rushed to mount Kailasa to ask Shiva to remedy the situation. The Lord then gave him a handful of roasted rice, saying that {{something as simple as}} a handful of roasted rice would satiate Ganesha, if it were offered with humility and love. Ganesha had swallowed up almost the entire city when Kubera finally arrived and humbly gave him the rice. With that, Ganesha was finally satisfied and calmed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Jim Kurring {{originated in the}} summer of 1998 when actor John C. Reilly grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of COPS with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring's dialogue came from these sessions. This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was [...] "always cast as these heavies or these semi-retarded child men. Can't you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> I can relate to, like falling in love with a girl?" [...] Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.|$|E
2500|$|Aristarchus's [...] "hyper-criticism" [...] {{establishes}} a science for the mock heroic and follows {{up some of}} the ideas set forth by Pope in Peri Bathos in the Miscellanies, Volume the Third (1727). In this piece, the rules of heroic poetry could be inverted for the proper mock-heroic. The epic hero, Pope says, has wisdom, courage, and love. Therefore, the mock-hero should have [...] "Vanity, Impudence, and Debauchery." [...] As a wise man knows without being told, Pope says, so the vain man listens to no opinion but his own, and Pope quotes Cibber as saying, [...] "Let all the world impute to me what Folly or weakness they please; but till Wisdom can <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be Gazed at." [...] Courage becomes a hero, Pope says, and nothing is more perversely brave that summoning all one's courage just to the face, and he quotes Cibber's claim in the Apology that his face was almost the best known in England. Chivalric love is the mark of a hero, and Pope says that this is something easy for the young to have. A mock-hero could keep his lust going when old, could claim, as Cibber does, [...] "a man has his Whore" [...] at the age of 80. When the three qualities of wisdom, courage, and love are combined in an epic hero, the result is, according to Pope, magnanimity that induces admiration in the reader. On the other hand, when vanity, impudence, and debauchery are combined in the [...] "lesser epic" [...] hero (Pope uses the term [...] "lesser epic" [...] to refer to the satirical epic that would function like a satire play in the Classical theatre), the result is [...] "Buffoonry" [...] that induces laughter and disgust. Finally, Pope says that Cibber's offences are compounded by the outlandishness of his claims. Although he was [...] "a person never a hero even on the Stage," [...] he sets himself out as an admirable and imitable person who expects applause for his vices.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm quite ready, thanks," [...] I {{answered}} slowly, for {{his words}} and manner had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to think about. [...] "If you don't mind, I should like to be getting away. It's a long way, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|He leant {{back and}} clasped his hands. 'You have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to live for, dear Lois,' he murmured. 'I {{will try to}} be poor--penniless, hunted, friendless. To win you I will try. And when that day arrives, I shall come to claim you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am," [...] said Cherry, brightening. [...] "It {{seems as}} if He had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to do, and there are you, and Mr. Richard, and Miss Ethel, to help. I should like, please God, to be of some good to those poor children." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I don't care! To walk; {{you have}} <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> to think of." [...] This seemed a salutary impulse, and yet Rowland felt a nameless perplexity.

60|$|Instantly I looked above, for {{clouds are}} so {{uncommon}} {{in the skies}} of Pellucidar--they are practically unknown except above the mightiest mountain ranges--that it had <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> of a start to discover the sun obliterated.

6000|$|... "If my Aunt Jane'd {{been living}} she'd have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> something," [...] he remarked. [...] "And {{if my father}} hadn't run away he might have <b>given</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> too. But I'm {{going to do the}} best I can anyhow. Your Aunt Olivia says I can have the job of {{gathering}} the eggs, and I'm to have one egg out of every dozen to sell for myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] she assented, [...] "yet I {{suppose that}} there is not one of us who knows as much of his neighbour's life as he imagines he does. Good afternoon, Mr. Hurd!

5000|$|... "It {{helped me}} develop memory for lines {{that has been}} a godsend since I started stage work; it <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> of a stage presence; and it helped get rid of my awkwardness. Also, I {{gradually}} developed the ability to speak extemporaneously". —Tracy was a key member of his college debating team, which he later said helped with his acting career.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, a self-seeking retraction," [...] said he. [...] "You <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>something</b> {{that you}} may obtain something." [...] He laughed quite pleasantly. [...] "Well, well; command me." ...|$|E

60|$|Towards {{the end of}} July we {{approached}} Hudson Straits, having seen nothing on the way worth mentioning, except one whale, which passed close under {{the stern of the}} ship.

6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} not tell you, Mrs. Markham," [...] he said seriously. [...] "I {{thought it was going}} to be a joke, but it is very far from being one.
