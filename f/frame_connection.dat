40|$|Master of ScienceArchitectural Engineering and Construction ScienceDonald J. PhillippiSpecial steel moment {{frames are}} one of the most common systems used to resist high seismic forces. Well-proportioned moment {{resisting}} connections are essential. Special steel moment <b>frame</b> <b>connections</b> must be capable of transferring moment and shear forces that are developed in the beams to the column. These connections must be designed as a highly ductile element in order to dissipate extensive energy thus undergo inelastic deformations. Doubler plates and continuity plates have been recommended by several design codes and standards in order to strengthen the column web and prevent the inelastic deformation of the panel zone due to high shear stress concentrations. However, doubler plates and continuity plates are very expensive due to the large amount of detailing and welding requirements. Furthermore, the extensive welding may affect the properties of the steel in which it may cause shrinkage, lower potential notch toughness and cracking. In any of these cases, there is high potential of losing the desirable inelastic performance required for these SMF. This report investigates the design of the special steel moment <b>frame</b> <b>connections</b> thus eliminating the use of doubler and continuity plates in these connections. Tables are provided that show all steel W-Shape beam sizes with all the adequate steel W-Shape column sizes used in special steel moment frames without the use of doubler and continuity plates in <b>frame</b> <b>connections...</b>|$|R

Theoretical relationships between weld penetration and weld failure loads, failure planes and failure lengths are derived. Also, the variation in strength between tensile and shear fillet welds is shown to be dependent upon the extent of weld penetration achieved/ The proposed tensile weld failure theory is extended to predict the theoretical failure of the welds in the end plate space <b>frame</b> <b>connection.</b> A finite element analysis is conducted to verify the assumptions made for this theory.

40|$|Steel {{buildings}} in high seismic areas often require special structural systems to transfer large lateral forces induced by earthquake accelerations. The selection of an appropriate seismic steel system (braced frame, moment frame, shear wall, etc.) is often influenced by architectural considerations. Moment frame configurations {{offer the most}} architectural flexibility, but are limited by code prequalification requirements that limit the use of non-orthogonal (skewed) beam-column connection geometries. A recent study has investigated laterally skewed moment <b>frame</b> <b>connections,</b> indicating that skew increases the potential for column twist and column flange yielding; however, {{it is unclear how}} realistic column axial loads will affect the skewed connection performance. This study investigates the effects of column axial loads on skewed special moment <b>frame</b> <b>connections</b> containing reduced beam sections (RBSs). Detailed finite element analyses are used for all investigations, and several beam-column connection configurations are considered, representing: 3 beam-column geometries (shallow, medium and deep columns); 4 levels of skew at the beam-to-column connection; and 4 levels of applied column axial load. Results indicate that combined beam skew, axial load, and applied connection rotations lead to local buckling issues within deep column moment frame configurations; however, increasing beam-skew and axial load has little effect on connection moment capacity prior to column local buckling initiation. Beam-skew angle is the dominate contributor to resulting column twist and increasing column axial load (up to 50 % ΦPn) has a negligible effect on resulting column twist. Applied column axial loads have little effect on resulting column flange yielding within the skewed beam-to-column connections...|$|R

40|$|In modern-day architecture, {{large glass}} facades often define {{the skin of}} prestigious {{buildings}}. When these buildings are considered a target for terroristic attack, great care is required in the structural design as to saveguard human life. Above all, the window components need to be considered, since glass shard debris is {{the main cause of}} injury in any urban impact event. Typically, laminated glass panes are used in blast resistant glazing systems. These consist of 2 glass plies, bonded together by one or more polymer interlayers to retain glass fragments upon fracture. The efficiency of a laminated glass against impact loading depends on a number of factors: ply thicknesses, viscoelastic properties of the interlayer material and bonding strength between layers. The <b>frame</b> <b>connection</b> also plays an important role. Ideally, the window should remain in its frame without glass fragments being propulsed and without tearing of the interlayer. Then the questions are: - How and when does the glass fracture? - How are the fragments kept together by the interlayer? - How much of the impact energy can be dissipated by the window without causing danger to humans? Or practically, up to which load is a glazing panel able to withstand the attack? It may be clear that destructive testing is a complex and expensive manner to assess the applicability of a structural wall configuration. Computer simulation offers a tool that can save time and costs, and the possibility to gain a deeper insight in the quantification of the main failure mechanisms: brittle cracking, delamination, interlayer tearing and <b>frame</b> <b>connection</b> failure. Our aim is to develop a numerical modelling technique for laminated glass under impact and blast loads, validated by laboratory experiments.

In RBS, some of flanges section area of beams are reduced so that its nominal moment capacity decreasing. The effort leads to the movement of plastic hinges location from the face of beam-column connection to the section of RBS, resulting the more safe plastic collapse mechanism. The research on special moment frames (SMF) using RBS in one direction has been conducted and the result show that the structures experience safe mechanism although their drift are quite excessive. Furthermore, the use of RBS in two orthogonal direction of SMF resulting good structural performance, but inefficient in the columns’ section. Continuing the last research, this study is aimed to observe the structural performance of steel dual system, SMF and concentrically braced frame (CBF), using RBS. Structures are design based on Indonesian steel code, SNI 03 - 1729 - 2002 and AISC 358 - 05. Two office building structures in zone 2 of Indonesian map which are 6 - and 10 -story with symmetrical and typical plan are chosen as the case study. The structural performance is checked using nonliner static pushover analysis and nonlinear time history analysis. The results show that the design of the dual system could not meet the requirement of SNI 03 - 1729 - 2002. The SMF performed well and the mechanism of strong column weak beam could be met. Unfortunately, the CBF failed to fulfill the mechanism as expected leadings to brittle failure of structures.

Parameters investigated included frame size, rigidity of <b>frame</b> <b>connections,</b> frame-wall interface gaps, and bearing wedges at the frame top-corners. In general, there was an initial stiff load deflection response followed by a much less stiff response during which frame-wall separation occurred and another stiff response leading to, in the majority of cases, diagonal tension cracking in the infill walls. Shear sliding along the top most bed joint was observed in some specimens. The cracking phase was followed by a less stiff phase, but with an increasing load resistance leading to ultimate failure through crushing of the wall. Increasing the size of the bounding frames increased the stiffness of the infilled frames and moderately increased the cracking loads. Initial gaps between the roof beams and CASIEL wall panels resulted in reduced infilled frame stiffnesses during the transition phase, although they did not significantly reduce the cracking loads. By using bearing wedges in the top corners, the influence of the top gaps was practically eliminated. This technique may be significant in developing a construction technique for industrial application of infilled frames.
