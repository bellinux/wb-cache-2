50|$|Lolium temulentum, {{typically}} {{known as}} darnel, poison darnel, <b>darnel</b> <b>ryegrass</b> or cockle, is an annual plant that forms {{part of the}} Poaceae family {{and part of the}} Lolium genus. The plant stem can grow up to one meter tall, with inflorescence in the ears and purple grain. It has a global distribution.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} nutrient competition between wheat and three most commonly found weed species in wheat fields of Kahramanmaras City, Turkey. The weeds studies were animated oat (Avena sterilis L.), <b>darnel</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (Lolium temulentum L.) and wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.). The measured nutrients were P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu. The results of paired t-test statistics showed that animated oat plant leaves removed significantly higher concentrations of Ca and Na and lower concentrations of P and Fe compared with accompanying wheat plant leaves. Wild mustard was better competitor for Ca, Mg, Na, Fe and Zn compared to wheat plants. Manganese was the only nutrient for which wheat was more successful for the uptake. <b>Darnel</b> <b>ryegrass</b> removed {{significantly higher levels of}} Ca, Na and Fe compared with the accompanying wheat plants...|$|E

50|$|Lolium rigidum is {{a species}} of annual grass. Common names by which it is known include annual {{ryegrass}}, a name also given to Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), rigid <b>ryegrass,</b> stiff <b>darnel,</b> Swiss <b>ryegrass</b> and Wimmera ryegrass.

50|$|Persian <b>darnel</b> or Persian <b>ryegrass,</b> (Lolium persicum) is {{an annual}} grass. It has an upright stem, {{branching}} from a reddish base, up to 45 cm tall. Its leaves are lower surface glossy, dark green, 6 mm wide.|$|R
40|$|The Early Iron Age granaries of Tell Gradina upon Bosut {{exploded}} {{in a fire}} inferno in the 8 th century B. C. The result of this catastrophe is 2 - 5 cm thick layer with mixed carbonized seeds and fruits. Recently, eight samples were taken from Gradina's profile for archaeobotanical analysis. The goal was to obtain basic information on land use and on major crops and weeds of that period. The most abundant were cereals, followed by millets, pulses and oil/fibre plants. The dominant cereals were einkorn (Triticum monococcum) and hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare vulgare). Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) was also very important. Pulses were represented with six and oil/fibre plants with three species. Among weeds and ruderals, most common are rye brome (Bromus secalinus), fat hen (Chenopodium album), <b>darnel</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (Lolium temulentum), hairy crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis) and corncockle (Agrostemma githago) ...|$|E

Ethylene regulates multiple developmental processes during a plant life cycle, but the effect of ethylene on the upregulation of senescence-, stress-, and post-harvest-related genes in forage grasses is poorly understood. In this work, we used quantitative PCR to determine whether ethylene application affected the expression of selected cell-wall degradation related genes that are typically upregulated post-harvest. The expression levels of beta-D-glucan exohydrolase isoenzyme, alpha glucosidase, and arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase isoenzyme, all putative cell wall degrading enzymes, were quantified at six points in the life cycle of the model grass species <b>Darnel</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (Lolium temulentum L.). We also quantified the expression of ACC oxidase and ACC synthase in response to ethylene application to determine if endogenous upregulation of ethylene biosynthesis occurred. Grass developmental stage {{had a significant impact on}} gene expression response to ethylene-treatment, indicating that discrete life cycle stages present different ethylene-responsive windows for treatment. Under our experimental conditions, ACC oxidase and ACC synthase expression were downregulated in response to ethylene-treatment, suggesting that exogenous ethylene served an auto-inhibitory role. Transcripts corresponding to the three cell wall degradation related genes increased significantly in response to ethylene treatment, suggesting that ethylene may have future utility in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a life cycle analysis of ethylene-induced genes in forage grasses...|$|E
