Snyder {{explained}} his {{reason for his}} casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: [...] "I think the thing you realize {{when you look at}} Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of {{get a sense of how}} tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie <b>is,</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E

He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{signing the}} group, Virgin Records {{launched}} a major campaign for their debut song to promote {{them as the}} new high-profile act. There {{was a period of}} indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be [...] "Wannabe", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be [...] "Say You'll Be There", which they considered a much [...] "cooler" [...] track, or [...] "Love Thing". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that [...] "Wannabe" [...] should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, [...] "It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> single." [...] Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.|$|E

In 2008, Joystiq named her their top pick out of 20 characters from the Final Fantasy franchise they wished to see in Square Enix's crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy, describing her as one of the series' [...] "greatest heroines." [...] IGN listed Tifa as the 13th-best Final Fantasy character of all time in 2008, describing her as an attempt by Square to [...] "give Final Fantasy characters real sex appeal," [...] and someone who [...] "could take care of herself in a pinch"; in a follow-up Reader's Choice edition of the list, Tifa placed first, with the staff repeating their previous comments while attributing her placement on the list to her breasts. In a 2009 IGN article focusing solely on Final Fantasy VII characters, Tifa placed fourth, with a comment that while her sex appeal contributes to her popularity, [...] "Tifa helped drive a tradition of tough, independent RPG heroines." [...] Other sources too praised Tifa for that aspect of her character. Mania Entertainment placed her tenth in the 2010 list of [...] "video game women that kick ass," [...] stating that while subsequent games in the Final Fantasy series introduced other memorable female characters, [...] "Tifa <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> Final Fantasy girl and holds a special place in our hearts." [...] In 2013, Gus Turner of Complex ranked Tifa as the 12th-greatest Final Fantasy character of all time, stating that [...] "next to Lara Croft and Samus, Tifa Lockhart stands out as one of gaming's most independent and empowered females ever." ...|$|E

After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, {{but they were not}} satisfied with the results. The group subsequently enlisted Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as [...] "our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years or whatever it is, but this <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> rock album." [...] Thematically, the record touches on life, death, love, war, faith, and family.|$|E
2500|$|The {{goal of the}} BDL was to {{preserve}} the leading position of agriculture {{in the economy and}} politics of Germany. In one of the founding documents it says: [...] "German agriculture is the primary and most important industry, the strongest support of the empire and of the several states. To protect and strengthen agriculture <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> and most serious task because by the blossoming and flourishing of agriculture, the welfare of all professions is secured." [...] But the BDL also came to the defense of the mom and pop shops as against big-city department store chains, they safeguarded the interests of the rural and small urban middle class, the shop assistants, rural workers, sailors and fishermen and small wine growers. Basically they took all non-industrial workers, and small businesses under their wing.|$|E

[...] Suppose we choose one Langevin observer and consider the other observers who ride on a ring of radius R which is rigidly rotating with angular velocity ω. [...] Then if we take an integral curve (blue helical curve in Fig.nbsp&1) of the spacelike basis vector , we obtain a curve which we might hope {{can be interpreted as}} a [...] "line of simultaneity" [...] for the ring-riding observers. [...] But as we see from Fig.nbsp&1, ideal clocks carried by these ring-riding observers cannot be synchronized. [...] This <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> hint that it is not as easy as one might expect to define a satisfactory notion of spatial geometry even for a rotating ring, much less a rotating disk! ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the often}} {{political}} and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States, because, as she put it, he displayed [...] "almost every trope of blackness". Christopher Hitchens was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president, noting, [...] "Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> black President, the first {{to come from the}} broken home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems. Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [...] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same." [...] Some black activists were also offended, claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before, while not serving black interests. They cite the lack of action during the Rwandan Genocide and his welfare reform, which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst child poverty since the 1960s. Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration.|$|E
