50|$|The {{reasons for}} this are twofold. For one, {{substances}} in nature {{have a tendency to}} move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, as is evident by dropping a drop of food coloring in a glass of water. It does not aggregate, but begins to move from the <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>areas</b> (the colored areas) to the areas of low concentration (clear areas). Second, large groups of predominantly positively charged or negatively charged particles will naturally repel each other. This is demonstrated by attempting to push the two positive poles or two negative poles of a magnet together. Depending on the strength of the magnet, the repulsion may be so strong {{that it is impossible to}} push the magnets together unless aided by machinery. Proton motive force does work on the system by bringing ions back towards the epidermis of the root or surface of a root hair along with the protons. From the surface of the soil/root interface, specific carriers, like H+/K+ symporters allow the specific ions to come into the cell and the out the plasmodesmata/symporters/antiporters of the side of the cell facing away from the soil so that the essential element can make its way up the plant to the area it is needed so that it may supply the plant with important nutrients that are vital to the plant's being able to reach maturity.|$|E

Knowing that age and disease affect neurological tissue, there is a need to better understand the sensitivity of spinal cord injury mechanics to variations in tissue behavior. To address this issue, a plane-strain, geometrically nonlinear, finite element model of a section of a generic human thoracic spinal cord was constructed to model the response to dorsal compression. The material models and stiffness responses for the grey and white matter and pia mater were varied across a range of reported values to observe the sensitivity of model outcomes to the assigned properties. Outcome measures were evaluated for percent change in magnitude and alterations in spatial distribution. In general, principal stresses (114 – 244 % change) and pressure (75 – 119 % change) were the outcomes most sensitive to material variation. Strain outcome measures were less sensitive (7 – 27 % change) than stresses (74 – 244 % change) to variations in material tangent modulus. The pia mater characteristics had limited (< 4 % change) effects on outcomes. Using linear elastic models to represent non-linear behavior had variable effects on outcome measures, and resulted in <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>areas</b> of elevated stresses and strains. Pressure measurements in both the grey and white matter were particularly sensitive to white matter properties, suggesting that degenerative changes in white matter may influence perfusion in a compressed spinal cord. Our results suggest that the mechanics of spinal cord compression are likely to be affected by changes in tissue resulting from aging and disease, indicating a need to study the biomechanical aspects of spinal cord injury in these specific populations...|$|E

40|$|Nanohybrids, {{synthesized}} via {{silver nitrate}} {{reduction in the}} presence of silicate clay, exhibit a high potency against bacterial growth. The plate-like clay, due to its anionic surface charges and a large surface area, serves as the support for the formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) similar to 30 nm in diameter. The nano-hybrid consisting of Ag/silicate at a 7 / 93 weight ratio inhibited the growth of dermal pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pyrogens, as well as the methicillin- and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA and ORSA). Scanning electron microscope revealed that these nanohybrids were adherent on the surface of individual bacteria. The thin silicate plates provide a surface for immobilizing AgNPs in one <b>highly</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>area</b> but prevent them from entering the cell membrane. Subsequent cytotoxicity studies indicated that surface contact with the reduced AgNPs on clay is sufficient to initiate cell death. This toxicity is related to a loss in membrane integrity due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The hybridization of AgNPs on clay surface is viable for generating a new class of nanohybrids exhibiting mild cytotoxicity but high efficacy for battling drug-resistant bacteria.

Urban green infrastructure can be an effective mitigation alternative in <b>highly</b> developed and <b>concentrated</b> <b>area.</b> This study investigates the effect of various types of urban green infrastructure on mitigating disaster damage in Korea. Tobit model is used to analyze the factors that determine disaster damage. Damage variation is predicted with scenarios of RCP 8. 5 and urban green spaces. Seventy-four districts and counties in seven metropolitan areas are defined as the unit and the period from 2005 to 2013 is considered in the analysis. The results indicate that higher urban green ratio, sewer length, financial independence rate, and local government’s budget are relating to lower disaster damage. Based on a precipitation level of RCP 8. 5 scenario in 2050, an increase in economic damage is expected to range from 262 to 1086 %. However, with an increase in urban green ratio by 10 %, increased economic damage is only expected to range from 217 to 1013 %.

Nevertheless, dentists' moving-out rates decreased after the application of global budget compared with the period prior to that. 3. Dentists' moving-in rates were positively associated with percentage ofpopulation older than 65 and growth rates of population, while they were negatively associated with percentage of population younger than 14.

Upon the concentration of grain in the export market, {{the results show that}} initially subterminals reduce costs somewhat regardless of location but as the optimum number is approached location becomes more critical. Key words: Benders Decomposition, facility location, grain subterminals, mixed integer programming. The location of facilities within a distribution network is a complex, recurring problem. This article reports on a distribution facility loca-tion model applied to the location of grain subterminals in Northwest Indiana. Early ap-proaches to the facility location problem used mixed integer programming. It was later dis-covered that computational effort and cost could be reduced considerably using heuris-tic approaches (Elson).
