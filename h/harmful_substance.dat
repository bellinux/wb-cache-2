Besides screening of drugs and active ingredients, response of small organisms is applied to monitor the existence of <b>harmful</b> <b>substances</b> in different water bodies. The conventional approach to monitor presence of toxins in rivers and estuaries applies physicochemical and analytical chemical techniques. However, the constantly increasing diversity of <b>harmful</b> <b>substances</b> and a range of potentially synergistic actions complicate a reliable assessment.
