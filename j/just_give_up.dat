25|$|In India, on Hindu fasting days (Navaratri, Ekadashi, Janmashtami, Maha Shivaratri etc.), fasting {{people in}} {{northern}} states of India eat items made of buckwheat flour. Eating cereals such as wheat or rice is prohibited during such fasting days. However, since buckwheat {{is not a}} cereal, it is considered acceptable for consumption during Hindu fasting days. While strict Hindus do not even drink water during their fast (observing Nirjal Upwas), others <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> cereals and salt and take a meal prepared from non-cereal ingredients such as buckwheat (kuttu). The preparation of buckwheat flour varies across India. The famous ones are kuttu ki puri (buckwheat pancakes) and kuttu pakoras (potato slices dipped in buckwheat flour and deep-fried in oil). In most of northern and western states, buckwheat flour is called kuttu ka atta.|$|E
500|$|Gates was an {{executive}} who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. He interrupted presentations with such comments as [...] "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" [...] and [...] "Why don't you <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> your options {{and join the}} Peace Corps?" [...] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced. When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, {{he was known to}} remark sarcastically, [...] "I'll do it over the weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain thanked his teammates. [...] "It wouldn't {{even have}} been close to {{possible}} without them. They wanted me to get it as much I did." [...] He added, [...] "They had {{to do more than}} <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> open shots. They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic." [...] Knicks' player Richie Guerin felt the Warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside the normal flow of the game. Although effusive in his praise of Chamberlain, Guerin nonetheless estimated that if the game had played out normally, Chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100. Chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if the Knicks [...] "had played straight-up basketball." [...] New York coach Eddie Donovan suggested, [...] "The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them." [...] The Knicks' Naulls stated, [...] "The game was not a fluke ... I thought it was absolutely authentic." [...] Imhoff said Zinkoff's announcements did not help the Knicks' cause.|$|E

2500|$|The Master and the Doctor {{are shown}} to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates on Gallifrey, where the Master {{outperformed}} the Doctor. A similar {{connection between the two}} was also referenced in The End of Time in which the Master reminisces with the Tenth Doctor about his father's estates on Gallifrey and his childhood with the Doctor before saying [...] "look at us now". In the 2007 episode [...] "Utopia", the Tenth Doctor calls the transformed and disguised Master a genius and shows admiration for his intellect before discovering his true identity. The Tenth Doctor further expresses admiration for the Master's intellect in The End of Time by calling him [...] "stone cold brilliant" [...] and yet states that the Master could be more if he would <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> his desire for domination. The Twelfth Doctor states that Missy is [...] "the one person almost as smart as me" [...] ("The Lie of the Land").|$|E
2500|$|The new {{terminal}} building at Donetsk International Airport, {{which had been}} a site of fighting between Ukrainian and separatist troops since May 2014, was captured by the DPR forces on 15 January. In the days prior to the capturing, the airport was heavily barraged by separatist rocket fire. DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko stated that the capture of the airport {{was the first step}} toward regaining territory lost to Ukrainian forces during the middle of 2014. He said [...] "Let our countrymen hear this: We will not <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> our land. We will either take it back peacefully, or like that", referring to the capture of the airport. Such an offensive by separatist forces would signal the complete breakdown of the frequently ignored Minsk Protocol, which established a buffer zone between Ukrainian-controlled and separatist-controlled territories. Ukrainian forces said that there had been [...] "no order to retreat" [...] from the airport, and DPR parliament chairman Andrey Purgin said that while DPR forces had gained control of the terminal buildings, fighting was ongoing because [...] "the Ukrainians have lots of places to hide". Concurrently, a new round of Minsk talks, scheduled for 16 January by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, was called off after DPR and LPR leaders Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky refused to attend.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 April 1802, the {{situation}} suddenly changed when Christophe defected {{with much of}} the Haitian Army over to the French. Louverture was promised his freedom if he agreed to integrate his remaining troops into the French army. Louverture agreed to this on 6 May 1802. Just why Toussaint was motivated to <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> {{has been the subject of}} much debate with most probable explanation being after he was just tired after 11 years of war. Under the terms of surrender, Leclerc gave his solemn word that slavery would not be restored in St. Domingue, that blacks could be officers in the French Army, allowed the Haitian Army to be integrated into the French Army, and gave Toussaint a plantation at Ennery. Toussaint was later deceived, seized by the French and shipped to France. He died months later in prison at Fort-de-Joux in the Jura region. Shortly afterwards, the ferocious Dessalines rode into Le Cap to submit to France and was rewarded by being made the governor of Saint-Marc, a place that Dessalines ruled with his customary cruelty. However, the surrender of Christophe, Toussaint and Dessalines did not mean the end of Haitian resistance. Throughout the countryside, guerrilla warfare continued and the French staged mass executions via firing squads, hanging and drowning Haitians in bags. Rochambeau invented a new means of mass execution, which he called [...] "fumigational-sulphurous baths" [...] of killing hundreds of Haitians in the holds of ships by burning sulphur to make sulphur dioxide to gas them.|$|E
