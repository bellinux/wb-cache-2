40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{results that}} demonstrate {{a new technique}} {{that can be used}} to improve the sensitivity of thermal noise measurements: intracavity intensity stabilization. It is demonstrated that electro-optic feedback can be used to reduce intracavity <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> and the consequent radiation pressure <b>fluctuations,</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 2 below the quantum-noise limit. We show that this reduction is achievable in the presence of large classic <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in the incident laser beam. The benefits of this scheme are a consequence of the sub-Poissonian intensity statistics of the field inside a feedback loop and the quantum nondemolition nature of radiation pressure noise as a readout system for the intracavity <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> (C) 1999 Optical Society of America.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the reduction of}} the <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in a laser by intracavity nonlinear absorption. The optimum operating conditions for reducing the intracavity <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> {{are not the same as}} the conditions for reducing the <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in the output field. For a quite general class of models, we show that at the optimum operating point for reducing <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in the output field reduction in the intracavity <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> is half of the maximum level that can be achieved in the model. We also show that as the laser <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are reduced the phase fluctuations, as measured by the laser linewidth, are correspondingly increased...|$|R

From numerical simulations, it can be easily seen that <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> have unignorable influence on performance of the passive decoy-state QKD protocol with WCP source.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{quantum yield}} of a polymer molecule {{to which an}} energy donor chromophore and an energy acceptor chromophore are attached depends on {{the distance between the}} donor and acceptor chromophores. If this distance fluctuates with time, the fluorescence intensity is expected to fluctuate as well, and the time course of the <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> will be correlated with the time course of the changes in the interchromophore distance. The <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are experimentally measurable if the number of illuminated molecules is small. A theoretical treatment of such fluorescence <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> is presented in terms of a parameter that describes the polymer chain dynamics. Computer simulations were performed to illustrate the dependence of the autocorrelation function of the <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on the polymer chain conformation, the interchromophore energy transfer properties, and the macromolecular dynamics. These simulations demonstrate that the <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> due to nonradiative energy transfer between chromophores attached to polymer chains can be large enough to be experimentally useful in the study of intramolecular dynamics of macromolecules...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} exciton migration and fluorescence <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuation</b> mechanisms in conjugated polymer single molecules, we studied fluorescence decay dynamics at "on" and "off" fluorescence intensity levels with 20 ps time resolution using MEH-PPV [poly(2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 '-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene] dispersed in PMMA. Two types of <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> were distinguished for single chains of conjugated polymers. Abrupt <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> (blinking) {{were found to be}} always accompanied by corresponding changes in fluorescence lifetime. On the contrary, during "smooth" <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> no lifetime change was observed. Time-resolved data in combination with data on fluorescence emission and excitation anisotropy lead to a picture where a single polymer molecule is seen as consisting of several energy transfer domains. Exciton migration is efficient within a domain and not efficient between domains. Each domain can have several emitting low-energy sites over which the exciton continuously migrates until it decays. Emission of individual domains is often highly polarized. Fluorescence from a domain can be strongly quenched by Forster energy transfer to a quencher (hole polaron) if the domain overlaps with the quenching sphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{structure of}} the Universe can be mapped with unresolved <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of the 21 cm line. The power spectrum of the <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> has been proposed as a probe of the baryon acoustic oscillations at low to moderate redshifts with interferometric experiments now under consideration. We discuss the contamination to the low-redshift 21 cm intensity power spectrum generated by the 18 cm OH line since the <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of the OH line generated at a slightly higher redshift contribute to the <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> observed in an experiment. We assume the OH megamaser luminosity is correlated with the star formation rate, and use the simulation to estimate the OH signal and the spatial anisotropies. We also use a semi-analytic simulation to predict the 21 cm power spectrum. At z= 1 to 3, {{we find that the}} OH contamination could reach 0. 1 % to 1 % of the 21 cm rms fluctuations at the scale of the first peak of the baryon acoustic oscillation. When z> 3 the OH signal declines quickly, so that the contamination on the 21 -cm becomes negligible at high redshifts. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables, accepted by ApJ...|$|R

40|$|We couple noise {{into the}} driving current of {{a laser diode}} to produce {{correlated}} light. We characterize the intensity correlations of the laser with two di#erent techniques: two detector photon coincidence {{and analysis of the}} photocurrent from a single detector. The light exhibits bunching with a magnitude and characteristic time set by the bandwidth and amplitude of the noise modulating the laser driving current. A simple model based on amplitude modulation of the laser intensity agrees with the measured correlation functions. The bunched light can be used to probe systems that are sensitive to intensity correlations. I. INTRODUCTION The correlation function of the intensity gives information about the statistics and the temporal distribution of <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> of light.

30|$|In a phase-sensitive optical-time domain {{reflectometry}} (Φ-OTDR) system, {{the challenge}} for dynamic strain measurement lies in large <b>intensity</b> <b>fluctuations</b> from trace to trace.

A novel approach of measuring dynamic strain induced by various driving voltages of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) in Φ-OTDR is also demonstrated. Piezoelectric vibration signals are evaluated through analyzing peak values of fast Fourier transform spectra at the fundamental frequency and high-order harmonics based on Bessel functions.
