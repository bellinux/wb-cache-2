50|$|It {{encompasses}} {{several aspects}} of LTE networks, including both the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRAN) and the <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>System</b> (EPS). It supports single and heterogeneous multi-cell environments, QoS management, multi users environment, user mobility, handover procedures, and frequency reuse techniques. Four kinds of network nodes are modeled: user equipment (UE), evolved Node B (eNB), Home eNB (HeNB), and Mobility Management Entity/Gateway (MME/GW). Four different traffic generators at the application layer have been implemented and the management of data radio bearer is supported. Finally, well-known scheduling strategies (such as Proportional Fair, Modified Largest Weighted Delay First, and Exponential Proportional Fair, Log and Exp rules), AMC scheme, Channel Quality Indicator feedback, frequency reuse techniques, and models for physical layer have been developed.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} project is to improve {{industrial}} system testing efficiency. The thesis is mainly focused {{on the field of}} telecommunication. Testing {{is one of the most}} important steps before selling a product to customers and testing is also an important component of after sale maintenance. The work load for testers can be decreased and more projects could be carried out in parallel, if the testing efficiency can be improved. The thesis project is carried out within the Ericsson Product Development Unit (PDU) <b>Packet</b> Core <b>System</b> Test section. The goal is to improve the system testing efficiency of the <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> Gateway, as <b>system</b> testing has gradually become one of the bottle necks for the whole product release. Ericsson wants to accelerate its pace in releasing new products to the market and releasing new software to their customers. An initial investigation was made to get a clear view about how the complete system testing procedure is currently carried out and then, an analysis was made based on this information. Ideas were collected for a proposed new implementation and finally a prototype for the most useful ideas was developed and evaluated to show how the system testing efficiency can be improved. Finally, these ideas were proved to be valuable for Ericsson PDU <b>Packet</b> Core <b>System</b> Test section and two of them have been adopted and are already under developing...|$|R

The concept of QoS is defined. Furthermore, QoS related entities, their functions and corresponding procedures are described. The methodology for measuring and evaluating of end-to-end QoS as seen from a user’s point of view is designed.

30|$|The <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>System</b> (EPS) bearer is {{the basis}} of the QoS in LTE [1]. It {{provides}} a logical channel between the user entity (UE) and a Packet Data Network (PDN) for transporting IP traffic [17]. The EPS bearer is the degree of granularity for bearer-level QoS control. All packets transferred by an EPS bearer are equally treated by forwarding functionalities (e.g., scheduling policy and queue management policy) [1]. EPS bearers can be classified as GBR or non-GBR bearers. An EPS bearer is named a GBR bearer if the EPS permanently allocates dedicated network resources (more specifically, a GBR value) to it. Otherwise, it is named a non-GBR bearer.|$|E

We briefly present each architecture and qualitatively evaluate their {{advantages and disadvantages}} in terms of security, mobility, and support for location-based policy enforcement and security zoning. While SMA is capable of providing simultaneous multihoming, cryptographic identity-based packet tracking and ready support for location-based security zoning and policy control, EPS enables legal interception of user traffic and protection of user/host privacy by default.

30|$|For LTE/EPC, a UE {{has several}} states {{according}} to the state of the EPS (<b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>System)</b> Mobility Management (EMM) and the state of the EPS Connection Management (ECM). These states can be EMM‐Deregistered/Registered or ECM‐Idle/Connected, as specified in [1]. Two first states of UE indicate whether the UE is registered and authorized to the network or not. When the UE is already registered to the network but it does not use any service so it is called ECM‐Idle state. In contrast, the UE is in ECM‐Connected state when it is registered to the network and is using services (e.g. Internet, Video, etc.). In short, we call these states Deregistered/Registered and Idle/Connected, respectively. We next describe in detail the five typical procedures and also show the transition of the UE state among these states described above.|$|E

Furthermore, the entire LTE protocol stack is framed from the application to the PHY layer, including radio resource control (RRC), radio link control, and MAC entities. This is done for the three kinds of network nodes, that is, UE, eNB, and Mobility Management Entity/Gateway.

This introduces {{the problem of how}} to provide voice call support when a user is within an LTE network and how to ensure voice service continuity when the user moves out of LTE coverage area. Different technologies have been proposed for the purpose of providing a voice to LTE users and to ensure the service continues outside LTE networks. The aim of this paper is to analyze and evaluate the overall performance of these technologies along with Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) Inter-RAT handover to Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Networks / GSM-EDGE radio access Network...|$|E
30|$|The {{architecture}} {{that we are}} going to consider includes M 2 M devices connected directly or via M 2 M gateways to the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) architecture. The evolved Node Bs (eNBs) in the E-UTRAN are connected to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) that provides connectivity to the IP backbone. The <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>System</b> (EPS) including E-UTRAN and EPC forms the M 2 M and the cellular access network. Besides getting access to E-UTRAN through an eNB, the machines can also get access through small cells, such as a relay node (RN) or a Home evolved Node B (HeNB). The aggregated M 2 M and H 2 H traffic collected by the small cells can be routed to a LTE gateway then to an eNB and, finally, to the EPC. In the rest of the paper, we refer to the RNs or HeNBs generically as SCs.|$|E
40|$|Next Generation Mobile Broadband Networks are {{designed}} to solve {{the large amount of}} expected mobile data traffic and to reduce the network costs at the same time. 3 GPP has standardized the <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>System</b> (EPS) in order to address such issues and provide connectivity, mobility, security and Quality-of-Service (QoS) on a connection between User Equipments (UE) and services through the access network. The 3 GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is the next big step in the evolution of mobile core networks following UMTS and HSPA(+) towards all-IP networks, which will be deployed in parallel to the current Long-Term-Evolution (LTE) roll-out. QoS management in NGN is historically operator controlled based on static rules differentiating voice from other data.

40|$|Multimedia {{broadcast}} is the most efficient method to distribute identical content to multiple users in the <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>System</b> (EPS). EPS enables efficient usage of network resources and provisioning of quality of service for every user. Third-party control allows applications in an enterprise domain to invoke network functions like multimedia broadcast. In this paper, an approach to modeling the behavior of Service Capability Server (SCS) for multimedia broadcast in EPS is presented. Third-party applications can access multimedia broadcasting capabilities by using Parlay X Web Service interfaces. The SCS for multimedia broadcast exposes Parlay X interfaces toward 3 rd-party applications and control protocols toward the network. The SCS functional behavior has to be synchronized with the application view on message broadcast {{and the state of}} the network resources intended for the broadcast session. Models of multicast session, IP connectivity session, and bearers’ and charging session are proposed and formally described using the notation of Label Transition Systems. The concept of weak bisimilarity is used to prove that models expose equivalent behavior; that is, they are synchronized...|$|E
40|$|Software-Defined Networking (SDN) {{paradigm}} provides many features including hardware abstraction, programmable {{networking and}} centralized policy control.

In this paper, we propose a virtualized SDN-based <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>System</b> (EPS) cellular network architecture including design of network virtualization controller. After virtualization of core/backhaul network elements, eNodeBs associated with MOs {{become a part of}} resource allocation problem for Backhaul Transport Providers (BTPs). We investigate the performance of our proposed architecture where eNodeBs are assigned to the MOs using quality-of-service (QoS) -aware and QoS-unaware scheduling algorithms under the consideration of time-varying numbers and locations of user equipments (UEs) through Monte-Carlo simulations. The performances are compared with traditional EPS in Long Term Evolution (LTE) architecture and the results reveal that our proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cellular network architecture.

In order to support existing as well as emerging e-Health services over converged next generation network (NGN) architectures, {{there is a need for}} network QoS control mechanisms that meet the often stringent requirements of such services. In this paper, we evaluate the QoS support for e-Health services in the context of the <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>System</b> (EPS), specified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) as a multi-access all-IP NGN. We classify heterogeneous e-Health services based on context and network QoS requirements and propose a mapping to existing 3 GPP QoS Class Identifiers (QCIs) that serve as a basis for the class-based QoS concept of the EPS. The proposed mapping aims to provide network operators with guidelines for meeting heterogeneous e-Health service requirements. As an example, we present the QoS requirements for a prototype e-Health service supporting tele-consultation between a patient and a doctor and illustrate the use of the proposed mapping to QCIs in standardized QoS control procedures...|$|E

40|$|Security in the {{wireless}} access network gained increasing interest {{over the last}} years. Its implementation varies from one access network to another. The current trend in wireless access network is towards implementing mechanisms for mobility management namely handoff process and quality of service control. Consequently, security {{should be taken into}} consideration at each handoff process which may occur between different technologies (inter-technology) or within the same (intra-technology). At the same time, security provisioning impact on network performances (e. g. end-to-end delay, throughput) should be controlled. This chapter aims to give a better understanding of security measures and protocols available in two distinct wireless network families, namely the Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) and the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).
