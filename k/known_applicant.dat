40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a collaborative retrieval problem, {{the recommendation of}} job ads to applicants. Specifically, two proprietary databases are considered. The first one focuses on the context of unskilled low-paid jobs/applicants; the second one focuses on highly qualified jobs/applicants. Each database includes the job ads and applicant resumes together with the collaborative filtering data recording the applicant clicks on job ads. The proposed approach, called LAJAM, focuses on the semi-cold start recommendation problem of recommending new job ads to <b>known</b> <b>applicants.</b> This setting is relevant to the temporary job sector, of increasing importance for current job markets. LAJAM learns a continuous language model on the job ad space, trained {{to comply with the}} collaborative filtering metrics. This language model, implemented as a neural net, can flexibly take into account heterogeneous additional information, e. g. related to the posting time and geolocation of the job ads. The merits of the LAJAM approach are demonstrated comparatively to {{the state of the art}} on the thoroughly studied CiteULike database. The comparison of the public CiteULike database with the proprietary databases sheds some light on the specific difficulties of the job applicant matching problem...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} student motivation for undertaking an entrepreneurship education programme and their ultimate employment aspirations through a novel data mining technique. The study considered what relationship certain motivation characteristics have to students’ aspirations, specifically in terms of their intention to be self-employed or employed. Design/methodology/approach – The study examined enrolment data of 720 students on an entrepreneurial education programme, with work statuses of full-time, part-time or unemployed and have known aspirations to either employment or self-employment. The Classification and Ranking Belief Simplex (CaRBS) technique is employed in the classification analyses undertaken, which offers an uncertain reasoning based visual approach to the exposition of findings. Findings – The classification findings demonstrate the level of contribution of the different motivations to the discernment of students with self-employed and employed aspirations. The most contributing aspirations were Start-Up, Interests and Qualifications. For these aspirations, further understanding is provided with respect to gender and student age (in terms of the association with aspirations towards self-employed or employed). For example, with respect to Start-Up, the older the unemployed student, the increasing association with employment rather than self-employment career aspirations. Research limitations/implications – The study identifies candidate motivation and the demographic profile for student's undertaking an entrepreneurial education programme. <b>Knowing</b> <b>applicant</b> aspirations should inform course design, pedagogy and its inherent flexibility and recognise the specific needs of certain student groups. Originality/value – The study contributes to the literature examining motivations for undertaking entrepreneurship education and categorising motivating factors. These findings will be of value to both education providers and researchers...|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of the bank’s hiring practice, the formal channel—public {{recruitment}} followed by a written test and interviews—was used to gauge candidates’ certifiable qualifications, while the internal referral system was adopted to evaluate candidates’ non-certifiable qualifications. The extent to which a candidate’s non-certifiable qualifications matched the bank’s hiring requirements was assessed through the candidate’s connection with the bank, shown by the reference’s guanxi with the bank and the candidate’s guanxi with the reference. The higher the reference’s status within the bank system, the stronger the guanxi was between the reference and the bank, and thus the more reliable the recommendation was about the candidate’s non-certifiable qualifications. The closer the guanxi between the applicant and the reference, the better the reference <b>knew</b> the <b>applicant,</b> and thus the more detailed information the internal recommendation would contain about the candidate’s non-certifiable qualifications. A hiring decision was eventually made based on an integrative calculation of an applicant’s certifiable qualifications (shown via objective evaluations of the applicant’s resume, as well as performance in the test and interviews) and non-certifiable qualifications (through evaluating the applicant’s references).|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Recruiting is a {{critical}} element of the human resources function. Organizations compete to identify, attract, and hire qualified individuals, and the recruiting competition is as fierce as the battle for sales dollars. Many organizations emphasize recruiting efficiency, hiring new employees using {{the least amount of}} time, cost, labor, and other resources possible. Unfortunately, efficient recruiting does not always produce the best employees. Rather, the emphasis must first be on recruiting effectiveness, hiring workers who will assist in the achievement of corporate objectives. Maximizing effectiveness is imperative in the recruiting process. As a successful salesman must know his product, an effective recruiter must <b>know</b> his <b>applicant</b> pool. Recruiters must be aware not only of the characteristics the company wants employees to possess, but also what applicants expect from the company in terms of salary, insurance benefits, working conditions, and other aspects of the job. Applicants whose needs are satisfied by the organization become content and productive employees, and recruiting programs must emphasize the company's commitment to its employees. B. S.

5000|$|To {{obtain a}} firearm certificate, the police must be {{satisfied}} {{that a person}} has [...] "good reason" [...] to own each firearm, {{and that they can}} be trusted with it [...] "without danger to the public safety or to the peace". Under Home Office guidelines, Firearm Certificates are only issued if a person has legitimate sporting, collecting, or work-related reasons for ownership. Since 1968, self-defence has not been considered a valid reason to own a firearm. The current licensing procedure involves: positive verification of identity, two referees of verifiable good character who have <b>known</b> the <b>applicant</b> {{for at least two years}} (and who may themselves be interviewed and/or investigated as part of the certification), approval of the application by the applicant's own family doctor, an inspection of the premises and cabinet where firearms will be kept and a face-to-face interview by a Firearms Enquiry Officer (FEO) also known as a Firearms Liaison Officer (FLO). A thorough background check of the applicant is then made by Special Branch on behalf of the firearms licensing department. Only when all these stages have been satisfactorily completed will a licence be issued, which must be renewed every 5 years.|$|R

50|$|However, shotgun {{ammunition}} {{which contains}} fewer than 6 projectiles requires a section 1 Firearms Certificate (FAC). Shotguns with a magazine capacity greater than 2 rounds are also {{considered to be}} section 1 firearms and, as such, require an FAC to own. An FAC costs £50 but is much more restrictive than an SGC. The applicant must nominate two referees who are <b>known</b> to the <b>applicant</b> to vouch {{for his or her}} character; a new 'variation' is required for each new caliber of gun to be owned; limits are set on how much ammunition a person can own at any one time; and an FAC can be denied if the applicant does not have sufficient 'good reason'.

40|$|A {{problem that}} often arises {{in the process}} of searching for a job or for a {{candidate}} to fill a position is that <b>applicants</b> do not <b>know</b> if they will receive an offer from any given firm with which they interview, and, conversely, firms do not <b>know</b> whether <b>applicants</b> will definitely take positions they are offered. In this paper, we model the search process as an optimal stopping problem with probabilistic appearance of offers {{from the perspective of a}} single decision-maker who wants to maximize the realized value of the offer she accepts. Our main results quantify the value of information in the following sense: how much better off is the decision-maker if she knows each time whether an offer appeared or not, compared to the case where she is only informed when offers actually appear? We show that for some common distributions of offer values, she can expect to receive very close to her optimal value even in the lower information case, as long as she knows the probability that any given offer will appear. However, her expected value in the low information case (as compared to the high information case) can fall dramatically when she does not know the appearance probability ex ante but must infer it from data. This suggests that hiring and job-search mechanisms may not suffer from serious losses in efficiency or stability from participants hiding information about their decisions, unless agents are uncertain of their own attractiveness as employees or employers.
