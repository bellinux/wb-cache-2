40|$|Zoonotic {{microorganisms}} present {{perhaps the}} greatest past, present, and future risks {{to the safety of}} ambient water and <b>drinking-water.</b> Their worldwide <b>distribution</b> varies and is affected by climate and numerous natural and anthropogenic factors, and some microorganisms are emerging or re-emerging as disease risks. Some of the most significant risk factors include transboundary movements of people, food, and animals and increased intensive food and animal production, waste disposal, and cellular mutations, which ensure that the prevalence venues of these zoonotic microorganisms will continue to expand. Virtually every surface water source and many groundwaters are or will be vulnerable to one or more types of these ubiquitous microorganisms. Analytical methodologies continue to improve our capabilities to detect and identify zoonotic microorganisms with greater specificity and rapidity and to trace them to their sources.

40|$|Iron” {{bacteria}} {{belonging to}} the genus Gallionella were observed by scanning electron microscopy in water samples and attached to pipe surfaces in a Southern California <b>drinking-water</b> <b>distribution</b> system. The cells were recognized by their characteristic elongated helical stalks composed of numerous intertwined microfibrils. Many of the stalks were partially coated with insoluble ferric salt deposits. Stalks recovered directly from water samples were analyzed for their elemental composition by using X-ray energy-dispersive microanalysis. Silicon, aluminum, calcium, and iron were the predominant elements present in the stalks. Smaller quantities of the elements phosphorous, sulfur, chlorine, copper, and zinc were also detected. Manganese, though present in measurable quantities in the water supply, was not detected in the stalks, suggesting that this organism is unable to utilize this element as an electron donor. This represents the first such analysis of Gallionella stalks recovered from environmental samples without prior subculturing in artificial laboratory media...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the amounts of copper {{released}} by copper pipes used for <b>drinking-water</b> <b>distribution</b> into wastewater treatment plants, sewage sludge and surface water in the Netherlands. For the Netherlands as a whole, 57 % of the copper load in wastewater treatment plants is attributed to copper pipes. Of this, an average of 77 % ends up in sewage sludge in such concentrations as to hinder application of sewage sludge in agriculture. The remainder ends up in surface water where it is jointly responsible for the non-compliance of the Dutch surface-water standard for copper. Compliance can only be achieved by substantially reducting emissions. Corrosion control of drinking water contributes to reducing emissions, {{but this is not}} sufficient to meet the surface water standards.

40|$|A major {{objective}} {{of drinking water}} treatment is to provide microbiologically safe drinking water. The combination of conventional drinking water treatment and disinfection {{has proved to be}} one of the major public health advances in modern times. The quality of drinking water delivered to the customer’s tap is influenced by a number of processes; namely water treatment, disinfection and changes during transport of treated water via the distribution system. All natural waters and even treated drinking water exerts disinfectant demand due to the reactions with NOM and other constituents in water. Therefore, the applied disinfectant dose must be sufficient to meet the inherent demand in the treated water, to provide sufficient protection against microbial infection. Thus, controlling free residual chlorine properly is definitely important to ensure meeting regulatory requirements and satisfying customer needs.

40|$|The {{surfaces}} of water distribution mains and {{suspended particulate matter}} from drinking water were examined by using scanning electron microscopy to investigate {{the nature and extent}} of association of microorganisms with these surfaces. In addition, X-ray energy-dispersive microanalysis was used to determine the elemental constitution of the pipe surface. Though distributed sparsely and randomly along the pipe surface, a variety of morphologically distinguishable bacteria-like structures and microcolonies were observed. The morphologies of the individual cells varied form chain-forming cocci to filamentous and prosthecate cell types. The iron-oxidizing bacterium Gallionella, recognized by its characteristic helical stalks, was observed both in water samples and attached to pipe surfaces. Attachment of some microbes to the pipe surface was apparently mediated by extracellular fibrillar appendages. Large numbers of rod-shaped bacteria were also evident adhering to the {{surfaces of}} suspended detritus or silt particles recovered from water samples by filtration. X-ray energy scans of the pipe surface revealed the presence of five major elemental constituents including silicon, phosphorous, sulfur, calcium, and iron. Smaller quantities of the elements zinc, magnesium, aluminum, potassium, and manganese were also detected.

40|$|Any and all {{chemicals}} generated by human activity {{can and will}} {{find their way into}} water supplies. The types and quantities of carcinogens present in drinking water at the point of consumption will differ depending on whether they result from contamination of the source water, arise as a consequence of treatment processes, or enter as the water is conveyed to the user. Source-water contaminants of concern include arsenic, asbestos, radon, agricultural chemicals, and hazardous waste. Of these, the strongest evidence for a cancer risk involves arsenic, which is linked to cancers of the liver, lung, bladder, and kidney. The use of chlorine for water treatment {{to reduce the risk of}} infectious disease may account for a substantial portion of the cancer risk associated with drinking water. The by-products of chlorination are associated with increased risk of bladder and rectal cancer, possibly accounting for 5000 cases of bladder cancer and 8000 cases of rectal cancer per year in the United States. Fluoridation of water has received great scrutiny but appears to pose little or no cancer risk. Further research is needed to identify and quantify risks posed by contaminants from <b>drinking-water</b> <b>distribution</b> pipes, linings, joints, and fixtures and by biologically active micropollutants, such as microbial agents. We need more cost-effective methods for monitoring drinking-water quality and further research on interventions to minimize cancer risks fro...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{research}} is needed to better understand the potential risk of dangerous biological agents that are unintentionally or intentionally introduced into a water distribution system. We report on our capabilities to conduct such studies and our preliminary investigations. In 2004, the Biofilms Laboratory was initiated for the purpose of conducting applied research related to biofilms with a focus on application, application testing and system-scale research. Capabilities within the laboratory are the ability to grow biofilms formed from known bacteria or biofilms from drinking water. Biofilms can be grown quickly in drip-flow reactors or under conditions more analogous to <b>drinking-water</b> <b>distribution</b> systems in annular reactors. Biofilms can be assessed through standard microbiological techniques (i. e, aerobic plate counts) or with various visualization techniques including epifluorescent and confocal laser scanning microscopy and confocal fluorescence hyperspectral imaging with multivariate analysis. We have demonstrated the ability to grow reproducible Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms in the annular reactor with plate counts on the order of 10 {sup 5 } and 10 {sup 6 } CFU/cm{sup 2 }. Stationary phase growth is typically reached 5 to 10 days after inoculation. We have also conducted a series of pathogen-introduction experiments, where we have observed that both polystyrene microspheres and Bacillus cereus (as a surrogate for B. anthracis) stay incorporated in the biofilms for the duration of our experiments, which lasted as long as 36 days. These results indicated that biofilms may act as a safe harbor for bio-pathogens in drinking water systems, making it difficult to decontaminate the systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} and fate {{of model}} microbial “pathogens” within a <b>drinking-water</b> <b>distribution</b> system {{was investigated in}} naturally grown biofilms formed in a novel pilot-scale water distribution system provided with chlorinated and UV-treated water. Biofilms were exposed to 1 -μm hydrophilic and hydrophobic microspheres, Salmonella bacteriophages 28 B, and Legionella pneumophila bacteria, and their fate was monitored over a 38 -day period. The accumulation of model pathogens was generally independent of the biofilm cell density and was shown {{to be dependent on}} particle surface properties, where hydrophilic spheres accumulated to a larger extent than hydrophobic ones. A higher accumulation of culturable legionellae was measured in the chlorinated system compared to the UV-treated system with increasing residence time. The fate of spheres and fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive legionellae was similar and independent of the primary disinfectant applied and water residence time. The more rapid loss of culturable legionellae compared to the fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive legionellae was attributed to a loss in culturability rather than physical desorption. Loss of bacteriophage 28 B plaque-forming ability together with erosion may have affected their fate within biofilms in the pilot-scale distribution system. The current study has demonstrated that desorption was one of the primary mechanisms affecting the loss of microspheres, legionellae, and bacteriophage from biofilms within a pilot-scale distribution system as well as disinfection and biological grazing. In general, two primary disinfection regimens (chlorination and UV treatment) were not shown to have a measurable impact on the accumulation and fate of model microbial pathogens within a water distribution system...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a population-based case-control study {{to evaluate the}} relationship between cancer of the colon-rectum (n = 326), lung (n = 252), brain (n = 37), and pancreas (n = 37), and exposure to tetrachloroethylene (PCE) from public drinking water. Subjects were exposed to PCE when it leached from the vinyl lining of <b>drinking-water</b> <b>distribution</b> pipes. Relative delivered dose of PCE was estimated using a model that took into account residential location, years of residence, water flow, and pipe characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for lung cancer were moderately elevated among subjects whose exposure level was above the 90 th percentile {{whether or not a}} latent period was assumed [ORs and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), 3. 7 (1. 0 - 11. 7), 3. 3 (0. 6 - 13. 4), 6. 2 (1. 1 - 31. 6), and 19. 3 (2. 5 - 141. 7) for 0, 5, 7, and 9 years of latency, respectively]. The adjusted ORs for colon-rectum cancer were modestly elevated among ever-exposed subjects as more years of latency were assumed [OR and CI, 1. 7 (0. 8 - 3. 8) and 2. 0 (0. 6 - 5. 8) for 11 and 13 years of latency, respectively]. These elevated ORs stemmed mainly from associations with rectal cancer. Adjusted ORs for rectal cancer among ever-exposed subjects were more elevated [OR and CI, 2. 6 (0. 8 - 6. 7) and 3. 1 (0. 7 - 10. 9) for 11 and 13 years of latency, respectively] than were corresponding estimates for colon cancer [OR and CI, 1. 3 (0. 5 - 3. 5) and 1. 5 (0. 3 - 5. 8) for 11 and 13 years of latency, respectively]. These results provide evidence for an association between PCE-contaminated public drinking water and cancer of the lung and, possibly, cancer of the colon-rectum.
