50|$|Gas-discharge lamps are {{a family}} of {{artificial}} light sources that generate light by sending an electric discharge through an ionized gas, a plasma. Typically, such lamps use a noble gas (argon, neon, krypton, and xenon) or a mixture of these gases. Some include additional substances, like mercury, sodium, and metal halides, which are vaporized during startup {{to become part of}} the gas mixture. In operation, some of the electrons are forced to leave the atoms of the gas near the anode by the electric field applied between the two electrodes, leaving these atoms positively ionized. The electrons ejected from these atoms flow onto the anode, while the cations thus formed are accelerated by the electric field and flow towards the cathode. Typically, after traveling a very short distance, the ions collide with neutral gas atoms, which transfer their electrons to the ions. The atoms, having lost an electron during the collisions, ionize and speed toward the cathode while the ions, having gained an electron during the collisions, return to a lower energy state while releasing energy in the form of photons. Light of a characteristic frequency is thus emitted. In this way, electrons are relayed through the gas from the anode to the cathode. The color of the light produced depends on the emission spectra of the atoms making up the gas, as well as the pressure of the <b>gas,</b> <b>current</b> density, and other variables. Gas discharge lamps can produce a wide range of colors. Some lamps produce ultraviolet radiation which is converted to visible light by a fluorescent coating on the inside of the lamp's glass surface. The fluorescent lamp is perhaps the best known gas-discharge lamp.|$|E

40|$|Direct current {{operation}} of electroosmotic pumps consumes water and generates electrolysis gas bubbles that can block the working electrode {{and build up}} pressure in the pump housing. The formation of the electrolysis gases can degrade pump performance {{and can lead to}} failure. Although catalysts have been used to recombine the electrolytic <b>gases,</b> <b>current</b> designs are sensitive to orientation relative to gravity making them inappropriate for many portable applications. Here we propose a gas recombination system design that operates independent of pump orientation. The design uses Nafion-sheathed electrodes, a catalyst chamber, and an osmotic membrane to capture and recombine electrolytic gases as well as return the liquid recombination products to the electrolyte reservoir. The pump was tested for 24 h at six major orientations with constant current fluxes. The measured gas chamber pressures and applied pump potentials suggest that the recombination system is functional at all orientations for driving currents of 3 mA and less. Â© 2007 Elsevier B. V.
