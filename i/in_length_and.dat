40|$|Morphometric {{analysis}} identified {{differences in}} body size of selected species of reptiles. For comparison ANOVA and ANCOVA tests were used. For Pachydactylus bibroni males are larger sex <b>in</b> these factors: <b>length</b> <b>and</b> {{width of the}} head absolutely, the absolute difference <b>in</b> the <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of the body, tail <b>length</b> <b>and</b> tail width. For Cosymbotus platyurus is also the absolute difference {{in the size of}} all body parts in favor of males. This difference is the same as Pachydactylus bibroni. In Riopa fernandi males are larger <b>in</b> the <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width, head <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of the body and tail width. The female is larger <b>in</b> the <b>length</b> of the tail. In Takydromus sexlineatus no difference between the sexes <b>in</b> the <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of the head <b>and</b> tail <b>length</b> were found, but the absolute difference <b>in</b> the <b>length</b> <b>and</b> width of the body in favor of females.

5|$|According to a {{study done}} in 1927, the Dewey system {{was used in the}} US in {{approximately}} 96% of responding public libraries and 89% of the college libraries. After the death of Melvil Dewey in 1931, administration of the classification was under the Decimal Classification Committee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation, and the editorial body was the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee with participation of the American Library Association (ALA), Library of Congress, and Forest Press.

5|$|According to {{the length}} of RNA chain, RNA {{includes}} small RNA and long RNA. Usually, small RNAs are shorter than 200nt <b>in</b> <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> long RNAs are greater than 200nt long. Long RNAs, also called large RNAs, mainly include long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA. Small RNAs mainly include 5.8S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) and small rDNA-derived RNA (srRNA).|$|E
5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying <b>in</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E

5|$|Although the Philippines lacks large {{mammalian}} predators, it {{does have}} some very large reptiles such as pythons and cobras, together with gigantic saltwater crocodiles. The largest crocodile in captivity, known locally as Lolong, was captured in the southern island of Mindanao. The national bird, known as the Philippine eagle has the longest body of any eagle, it generally measures 86 to 102 cm (2.82 to 3.35 ft) <b>in</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg (10.4 to 17.6 lb).

To service seven different tributary voyages, the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419, including treasure ships measuring 112m (370ft) to 134m (440ft) <b>in</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> 45m (150ft) to 54m (180ft) in width.|$|E

5|$|Mahakala is {{both the}} most {{primitive}} dromaeosaurid ever described and the smallest.

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} {{are located on}} both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys.
