40|$|A scaled-up fiber wet-spinning {{production}} of electrically conductive and highly stretchable PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers is demonstrated {{for the first}} time. The PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers possess the mechanical properties appropriate for <b>knitting</b> various <b>textile</b> structures. The <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> exhibit strain sensing properties that were dependent upon the number of PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers used in <b>knitting.</b> The <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> show sensitivity (as measured by the gauge factor) that increases {{with the number of}} PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers deployed. A highly stable sensor response was observed when four PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers were co-knitted with a commercial Spandex yarn. The <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> sensor can distinguish different magnitudes of applied strain with cyclically repeatable sensor responses at applied strains of up to 160 %. When used in conjunction with a commercial wireless transmitter, the <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> responded well to the magnitude of bending deformations, demonstrating potential for remote strain sensing applications. The feasibility of an all-polymeric <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> wearable strain sensor was demonstrated in a knee sleeve prototype with application in personal training and rehabilitation following injury...|$|R

40|$|LUX {{studies the}} {{combination}} of electronics and <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> from a textile design perspective. The thought of experiencing textiles without touching them sparked the idea of designing textiles where touch {{is essential for the}} visual appearance. The aim is to design <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> that light up when touched, in order to create an interactive experience for the viewer. Optical fibres were chosen because of their ability to transmit light and copper yarn works as an electrical conductor that triggers the reaction of light. The shapes of the <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles</b> have been created by utilising the characteristics of the optical fibre. LUX introduces a working method in which the optical fibre is given an important role not only as a light source but also as a tool for shaping the textiles. The result of the work is three textiles that display how electronics, consisting of sensors and light, can be merged with textiles and contribute to interactive behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in seamless knitting technology are opening up signiﬁcant {{opportunities in the}} design, production and application of <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> preforms. Introduced in the mid 1990 ’s, seamless machinery enables shaped, 3 -dimensional knitted forms to be produced entirely by machine. While garment producers globally adopted the technology for its economic efficiencies, the standardised templates in the technology’s software have generally reduced the sophistication of designs produced. Although the signiﬁ cant unrealised potential in seamless technology is widely acknowledged, designers and manufacturers are facing diffi culties in understanding and integrating the complex technology into their practice. There remains a fundamental gap in knowledge and skills, {{in part due to}} a simpliﬁed and modular garment based user interface, which fronts a complex and sophisticated technology. Of the limited research in this area, most relates to garment shaping. More recently, we have started to see sophisticated applications of this technology in highly technical or artisanal design outcomes emerging from textile research centres. The design and production of <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> forms in 3 -dimensions, as opposed to the 2 -dimensional ﬂ at pattern and construction of the past, is a signiﬁcant conceptual shift for traditional textile design practice. Traditional craft and design practices are often disrupted by the emergence of new technologies. We believe that the disruption created by seamless knit technology has the potential to vastly change both the design and application of <b>knitted</b> <b>textiles,</b> moving <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> manufacturing up the value chain. This installation showcases the advanced capabilities of seamless knitting technology for innovative, 3 -dimensional form building and high-end design outcomes. The group submitting this proposal consists of a knitwear designer, <b>knitted</b> <b>textile</b> designer and <b>knit</b> technician. All are experienced in this ﬁeld, and will draw on current research and developments to work collaboratively in producing a collection of seamless knitted products that demonstrate unique shaping, 3 -dimensionality, pattern and texture. The collection includes both garment and non-garment applications and may incorporate smart textile applications...|$|R

In this work, Shima Seiki SDS-One Apex computer-aided knitting technology, Shima Seiki industrial knitting machines, and the study of paper origami tessellation patterns were used as tools to understand and predict the self-folding abilities of weft <b>knit</b> <b>textiles.</b> A wide range of self-folding weft knit structures was produced, and relationships between the angles and ratios of the knit and purl stitch types were determined. Mechanical testing was used as a means to characterize differences produced by stitch patterns, and to further understand the relationships between angles and folding abilities. By defining a formulaic method for predicting the nature of the folds that occur due to stitch architecture patterns, we can better design self-folding fabrics for smart textile applications...|$|R

This project shows how established machine knitted 3 D form and surface structure techniques can be learnt on manual, hand-flat knitting machines, translated through knit notation and design software, and produced on computerised and automatic knitting machine systems.
