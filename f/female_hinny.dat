50|$|Female hinnies and mules are not customarily spayed, and {{may or may}} not {{go through}} estrus. Female mules have been known, on rare occasions, to produce {{offspring}} when mated to a horse or donkey, although this is extremely uncommon. Since 1527, more than sixty cases of foals born to female mules around the world have been documented. In contrast, according to the ADMS, there is only one known case of a <b>female</b> <b>hinny</b> doing so.|$|E
5000|$|Other than size, some {{additional}} minor differences occur {{that can be}} used to distinguish between mules and hinnies. The head of a hinny is said to resemble that of a horse more than it does a mule's, with shorter ears (although these are still longer than those of horses), and more horse-like manes and tails than mules. [...] A male hinny is properly called a horse hinny, and a <b>female</b> <b>hinny</b> is properly called a mare hinny, though in British English both female hinnies and a female donkeys are sometimes called a jennet.|$|E
5000|$|His {{and artist}} Jack Abel's {{character}} Sgt. Mule — whose name, [...] "Millie", {{meant she was}} actually not a mule (male) but a <b>hinny</b> (<b>female)</b> — appeared with various keepers including Private Mulvaney (Our Army at War #149 & 160, Star Spangled War Stories #136); Private Skinner (G.I. Combat #104); and Private Smith (Our Army At War #117).|$|R
40|$|An unsual {{feature of}} the family Equidae is their {{remarkable}} ability to produce hybirds among virtually all the member species, regardless of significant chromosomal differences. The best known of these, due to human interest in their production since antiquity, are the mules (male donkey x <b>female</b> horse) and <b>hinny</b> (male horse x female donkey). Here, we report a case of interspecies hybrid of E. asinus (donkey) and E. heminous khur (Asiatic wild ass popularly known as Ghuldkhur).

25|$|The {{offspring}} of a zebra-donkey cross {{is called a}} zonkey, zebroid, zebrass, or zedonk; zebra mule is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a <b>female</b> donkey. Zebra <b>hinny,</b> zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras. There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; {{there is no such}} limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.|$|R
40|$|Most <b>hinnies</b> (<b>female</b> donkey×male horse) and mules (female horse×male donkey) are sterile {{with few}} reports of equine fertile hybrids. The {{main cause of}} this {{sterility}} {{is thought to be}} a meiotic block to spermatogenesis and oogenesis. This study compared the developmental features of the testes and a histological analyses of spermatogenesis in a male hinny with those of a normal, fertile stallion and Jack donkey. Hinny testes showed a thicker tunica albuginea, fewer blood vessels and more connective tissue in the testis parenchyma than those of the stallion and Jack donkey. Although the mean number of seminiferous tubules was significantly higher in stallion and hinny than Jack donkey (p< 0. 01), the mean proportion of seminiferous tubules was lower in the hinny (p< 0. 01) which resulted in a smaller diameter of seminiferous tubules. The mean number of spermatogonia and spermatocytes per unit area were significantly lower in hinny testis (p< 0. 01) and no spermatids or mature spermatozoa cells were found during immunofluorescent analyses. These results indicated that defects in seminiferous tubule development and structure occur in the testis of hinnies. Furthermore, most spermatogonia and spermatocytes cease development in synapsis during mid-meiosis of spermatocytes, which results in a block to spermatogenesis that prevents the formation of spermatids and matured spermatozoa during meiosis in male hinnies...|$|R
