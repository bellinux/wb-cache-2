In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings; singing was reinstated soon after his death.|$|E

30|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} such a model is Becker’s (1971) model of taste-based employer discrimination. In that (frictionless) model, employers have heterogeneous <b>distastes</b> <b>for</b> interacting with one of the two worker types. An equilibrium wage gap clears the market and workers are segregated by type across employers. While neither group has a hiring advantage overall—in the sense that both will be hired for sure if they apply to the ‘right’ job—, the disfavored group will be turned away from the ‘good’ (high wage) jobs, and the favored group will be turned away from the bad jobs if they apply there.|$|R

40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{examined}} the amount of income inequality that people in European ex-Communist societies regard legitimate, the wide cross-national and temporal variation has not been adequately explained. In addition, {{little is known about the}} specific impact of societal characteristics. This article formulates an integrated theoretical framework of macro-level (socioeconomic and cultural characteristics) and micro-level explanations (ideological orientations and self-interests) and further adds a time perspective to them. Hypotheses are tested in a multilevel design using large-scale comparative data from ten transitional societies over five points in time. The changes and differences in the individual ideological orientations and self-interests of the population explain the largest part of the temporal and cross-national variation in the legitimate amount of inequality. Against expectations, people with both very low and very high income, and in both very low and very high subjective status positions find lower amounts of inequality legitimate. Mixed evidence is found on the role of societal characteristics. The prosperity of the nation enhances tolerance for inequalities, whereas the factual level of inequality creates <b>distastes</b> <b>for</b> it. Cultural characteristics hardly influence individual legitimacy judgments...|$|R

40|$|In a {{follow-up}} study to certified athletic trainers' (ATCs') attitudes and judgments toward injury rehabilitation adherence, previously injured and rehabilitated athletes (n= 36) were administered the Athletic Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Questionnaire. The {{purpose of the}} study was to compare the results collected from athletes with those collected previously from ATCs. The questionnaire consisted of 60 statements, categorized into seven scales: athletic trainers' influence, environmental influences, athlete's personality, pain tolerance, self-motivation, goals and incentives, and significant others. Four additional open-ended questions dealing with successful and unsuccessful rehabilitation strategies also were completed. Athletes' responses were generally similar to those of ATCs. Factors deemed significant to rehabilitation adherence were: (a) good rapport and communication between athletic trainers and injured athletes, (b) support from athletic trainers and coaches, (c) self-motivation on the part of athletes, and (d) convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of the rehabilitation facility and staff. The greatest deviations between athletes' and ATCs' responses were in the areas of self-motivation, pain tolerance, education about injury and rehabilitation exercises, and degree of realistic feedback. Analyses of open-ended question responses reinforced the aforementioned results. The strongest findings derived from these questions were the importance of rapport, communication, and support to rehabilitation adherence. Also, athletes' <b>distastes</b> <b>for</b> threats and scare tactics were quite evident...|$|R

Other councilors fared worse; Guangyang, remembered his carefulness, generosity, honesty, uprightness and seriousness, was demoted several times. A lack of division of powers between the Emperor and his councilors apparently resulted in conflicts, and the grand councilors (four total) gave up on state affairs, following prevailing affairs or doing nothing. Appointed to right councilor, Li gave himself over to drinking. He was ultimately implicated in 1390 in a decade-long conspiracy and purged along with his extended family and thirty thousand others. The accusations against him would be memorialized as absurd fabrications, recognized as such by the Emperor Hongwu. He was executed largely {{on the basis of his}} supposed awareness and non-reporting of treason. The post of councilor (or prime minister) was abolished following their execution.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the 1830 s the Concord River {{flowed from}} the village of the same name (the heartland of American Transcendentalism) to meet the Merrimack among the textile mills of Lowell (a {{principal}} hearth of the American industrial revolution). A trip along both rivers in 1839 resulted in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, Henry David Thoreau’s first and longest book. During the 23 years following the excursion, Thoreau made himself into a profound if selective landscape observer. Using the Week and the writings that followed, and in particular the Journal, this paper outlines several aspects of Thoreau’s understanding of manufacturing including: clear insights into the effects of industry on the environment; a “Transcendentalist <b>distaste</b> ” <b>for</b> industry; an enthusiasm and aptitude for mechanical invention; and a moralizing concept of work that privileges autonomy over any structural constraints. It is suggested that these radical, penetrating, and contradictory insights are all framed and limited by what we might term “moral localism. ” “It is nothing but work, work, work ” “Men labor under a mistake...|$|R

Đông Thái was famous for producing high-ranking mandarins and had been the home of senior imperial officials since the time of the Lê Dynasty.

Early on, Phan indicated his <b>distaste</b> <b>for</b> the classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin. He nevertheless persevered with his studies, passing the regional exams in 1876 and then topping the metropolitan exams the following year. In his exam response, Phan cited Japan {{as an example of how}} an Asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower.|$|E

Author Bill McGann believed that Rominger and Berzin were in great form coming into the race. Rominger entered the event after having recently won the Tour de Romandie. Aside from Rominger and Berzin, El Punts Luis Simon named 1988 winner Andrew Hampsten, Russian Pavel Tonkov, and Claudio Chiappucci amongst several other riders that could challenge for the overall title.|$|E

General Moshe Dayan (Israeli Chief of Staff), Shimon Peres and Mordechai Bar-On were {{also part of}} the Israeli delegation. Lloyd warned that the UN, the Commonwealth and Scandinavian countries were opposed to the use of force. Israel demanded that British Canberra bombers bomb Egypt from their bases in Cyprus; Lloyd merely promised to seek the Cabinet’s opinion on the matter. Lloyd demanded that British airstrikes be delayed for 48 hours after the outbreak of hostilities, so that collusion would not be too obvious, but in the end compromised on 36 hours. Lloyd was still worried about an Israeli attack on Jordan. Dayan later recalled (“Story of My Life” p218) that “Lloyd's manner {{could not have been more}} antagonistic. His whole demeanour expressed <b>distaste</b> - <b>for</b> the place, the company, and the topic … His opening remarks suggested the tactics of a customer bargaining with extortionate merchants.” Lloyd left towards midnight.|$|R
500|$|Minton was {{described}} by William Radcliff as a [...] "faithful disciple of judicial restraint," [...] an unexpected development when compared to his overtly partisan political career. Radcliff attributed Minton's conservative position to the <b>distaste</b> he developed <b>for</b> the courts when they overturned legislation passed {{while he was in}} the Senate. The courts actions led him to strongly believe in the limited exercise of judicial power when evaluating the constitutionality of governmental conduct. Much of the recently passed New Deal legislation was being tried in the courts for constitutionality and enforcement, putting Minton in the uncommon position of adjudicating cases depending on legislation he had helped write.|$|R
