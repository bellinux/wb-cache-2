As a child during the Third Great Ninja War, Obito was almost identical to Naruto, including sharing the dream of becoming Hokage, and was originally Kakashi Hatake's teammate in Team Minato. When their teammate Rin (whom Obito was in love with) was kidnapped by Hidden Stone Ninja during a mission, Obito and Kakashi rescue her but {{at the cost of}} {{the right side of the}} former's body crushed in a landslide. Believing his death is certain, Obito has Rin transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi to replace the latter's original left eye. After the rest of his body is buried, however, Obito is saved by Madara Uchiha, who places Zetsu prosthetics on him conditions him to become his apprentice after breaking the youth's hopeful outlook by secretly making him witness Kakashi being forced to kill Rin as a consequence of the war. Coming to the conclusion that he can use the Tailed Beasts to destroy the current reality and create a utopia, Obito takes up Madara's name following the latter's death (using his Zetsu to disguise his voice to resemble Madara's) and creates similar circumstances for Nagato with Yahiko's death, in turn creating the Akatsuki. Obito serves a behind-the-scenes role throughout the first half of Part II and causes most of the tragic events that occurred prior to the series, including Kurama's attack on the Hidden Leaf. Other than being able to use his right Sharingan to manipulate Kamui in a fashion that made it seem he is <b>intangible</b> <b>and</b> teleport over great distances, Obito can use Wood Style attacks as he possesses Hashirama's cells via the Zetsu.|$|E

2500|$|Some call {{attention}} to the conjunction of Commons-based peer production with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques. The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity. Further, it is true that many issues, problems, and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones. For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting and on IP. It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, Commons-based peer production 3D printing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (<b>intangible</b> <b>and</b> tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools. And following Neil Gershenfeld in that [...] "some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies," [...] Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Intangibles</b> <b>and</b> {{human capital}} are {{increasingly}} becoming {{the most prominent}} resources for firms in their mission to ‘create value’. With assets and resources {{that are difficult to}} visualize, measure or report on, it is of great importance to management and investors that the risks are recognized and examined critically. The thesis addresses two main risks associated with <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> human capital – (i) information, and (ii) value. Additionally, <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> human capital regard not only the (a) firm level, but also the (b) macro-economic level. Thus, the risks need to be understood and discounted in each of these fields. The thesis aims to interpret the problem of these diverse subjects by delving into four mixed-method studies as below: • the study of the cost of capital impact modeled by the expected returns of the non- financial and narrative disclosures provided in the annual reports of intangibles- intensive firms from the pharmaceuticals industry (Ch. 3); • the understanding of the impact of regulatory changes (e. g. Reg. FD and SOX) on the information environment with reference to exogenous intermediaries such as News and Analysts, and researching for causality-based relationships (Ch. 4); • the re-visitation of the concept of organizational capital, a much sought after vari- able in the management science, which is here modeled to be a measure of an organization’s overall performance risks (Ch. 5); • the investigation of the difference between human capital and structural capital first using financial accounting data, and then comparing it against a combined non-tradable measure of intangible capital, which is an amalgamation of human and structural capital (Ch. 6). The overall outcome of this study shows {{that there is a need}} for more measures, both financial and non-financial, to better understand the complex concepts of <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> human capital and their implications in terms of value creation and risk. The lack of explicit variables must not necessarily come in the way of this endeavor. The solution to the problems of identifying measures <b>and</b> variables for <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> human capital to understand and manage the different risks associated to them, can be largely overcome by virtue of “liberal interpretations”, albeit preserving a great clarity, of financial and non-financial data already available in the public domain...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how {{firms in}} the Australian {{property}} and construction sector manage their intangibles in order to operationalise sustainable development. Previous research linking <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> corporate sustainability has {{tended to focus on}} intangibles as a phenomenon endeavouring to establish links between <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> corporate financial performance. This thesis makes a unique contribution to knowledge by drawing a conceptual bridge between the <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> corporate sustainability literature using both the phenomenon and practice based approach to intangibles. The practice based approach aims to understand how firms manage <b>and</b> mobilise their <b>intangibles</b> towards a purpose â�� which for this research is sustainable development. A key outcome of this study is a framework to manage firmsâ�� intangibles which outlines how firms identify, measure/value, control, <b>and</b> report their <b>intangibles</b> at various stages of corporate sustainability. The research design is a case study methodology, implemented across two phases, using mixed methods. The first phase focused on the phenomenon of intangibles in the wider Australian property and construction sector. Data was collected using a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews and content analysis. In the second phase, four case studies of individual firms were conducted to study the practice of intangibles. There were two key findings of this research. The first is that the practice based approach to intangibles more accurately reflected how {{firms in the}} Australian property and construction sector manage their intangibles. However, tensions still exist between the more traditional accounting-based phenomenon approach to <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> the practice based approach. This is particularly relevant in the business case for sustainability. The second main finding is that firms in the case study sector are actively managing their intangibles to implement organisational change for sustainability. This finding {{led to the development of}} the â��inside- outâ�� approach to operationalising sustainable development which focuses on managing a firmâ��s intangibles rather than just its environmental and social performance...|$|R
40|$|After three largely {{successful}} scientific {{events in}} 2005 (Ferrara), 2006 (Maastricht) and 2007 (Ferrara), the annual EIASM Workshop on <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> intellectual capital research issues is affirming {{itself as the}} most important and consolidated regular occasion in Europe for scholars from different fields to present and discuss their works in such a rapidly expanding area. The attendance of more than 100 scholars in each of the previous Workshops, as well as the submission of around 80 papers in both these instances, demonstrate the vitality of this research field and its continuous, and actually growing, appeal for scholarly inquiry. Indeed, it is today generally recognised that business enterprises are rapidly changing, where the major drivers of such a discontinuity have an <b>intangible</b> nature <b>and</b> are largely dependent upon organisational knowledge creation, accumulation and appropriation (e. g. patents). Brands, research and innovation, quality of management, competencies and capabilities, organisational culture and climate are only a few examples of those decisive intangible assets. Firms are also becoming increasingly involved in complex networks of alliances deriving their value and growth primarily from intangibles. Knowledge intensive organizations in a multitude of industries – ranging from pharmaceutical, biotech, software up to education – have indeed solid economic reasons for developing and knowing more about their intangibles. Also not-for-profit entities (such as universities, cities, regions, hubs) seem more and more often to realize that their very raison d’être is intangible in nature, that is to contribute to collective knowledge, well-being and well-offness. A new research arena has therefore emerged and attracted the attention of a large and diversified number of scholars. Alongside those well-known research issues, new intangibles-related topics appear to emerge and intertwine with the more explored ones. For instance, the role of technology (i. e., XBRL) and institutions (i. e., SEC, Japanese Governments, EFFAS) in pushing and expanding information on <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> IC and its uses and users; the macro-perspectives on <b>intangibles</b> measurement <b>and</b> management; the financial analysis of such information and its usefulness; the probing of the linkage between <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> value creation; the ambiguous relationship on theoretical and practical grounds of IC management reporting with sustainability, social, and environmental counterparts; the modelling, measurement, and management of risks conceived as intangible liabilities (e. g. reputational risk); and so on. In the light of the above considerations, the 4 th EIASM Worksop on “Visualising, Managing, <b>and</b> Measuring <b>Intangibles</b> <b>and</b> Intellectual Capital” intends to propose itself as a further step towards the widening and strengthening of the scholarly “intangibles community”. A distinctive aspect of such a community is its profound interdisciplinary nature and its open attitude towards all the scientific areas and disciplinary angles in the studying of intangibles. In confirming this feature, this Workshop aims to attract all the scholars who wish to give a contribution to this field from various perspectives – offering them a unique platform to present their research plans and findings –, and to exchange views and ideas with colleagues of the same or other disciplines interested in <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> intellectual capital issues...|$|R
