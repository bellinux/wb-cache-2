500|$|Heffron, humiliated {{and tired}} after several decades in ministerial office, {{resigned}} as Premier {{six months later}} on 30 April 1964 {{at the age of}} 73. His announcement came as a surprise to many members of his own party, although there had been existing hints in the previous months that the Labor caucus had been discussing a departure plan for Heffron, to be replaced by the Deputy Premier Renshaw. Heffron insisted that he had made the decision to himself a year prior, declaring: [...] "It was purely my own decision, so I cannot complain about anyone throwing me out or advising me to get out. Sometimes we are advised to get out – there are hints, but we don't take any notice when they come from outside, {{but it is not the}} same, of course, as coming <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> party." [...] Renshaw succeeded him as Premier. On 24 June 1964, Heffron was granted by Queen Elizabeth II retention of the title [...] "The Honourable" [...] for having served for more than three years as a Member of the Executive Council of New South Wales.|$|E
500|$|During {{the onset}} of the American Revolution, McDonald was an ardent Whig. In March 1777, McDonald {{received}} a personal letter from General George Washington appointing him a lieutenant colonel in a battalion of Thruston's Additional Continental Regiment under the command of Colonel Charles Mynn Thruston, a former rector of Cunningham Chapel in present-day Clarke County, Virginia, and a former associate magistrate of the Frederick County court, where he served alongside McDonald. Despite his loyalty to the American Revolutionary cause, McDonald refused the appointment for either of two reasons: he would have been second-in-command to a colonel lacking prior military experience and McDonald had previously {{been a member of the}} vestry of Cunningham Chapel and resigned following a dispute with Thruston over [...] "a matter of business with the church". General Adam Stephen, a fellow Scotsman, wrote a letter to McDonald dated March 15, 1777, in which he implored him to accept Washington's appointment, stating [...] "Your appointment comes entirely <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> merit." [...] Stephen warned McDonald not to let his [...] "Highland pride" [...] dissuade him from serving under Thruston and in the event McDonald still refused Washington's offer, Stephen wrote: [...] "Write a polite letter to General Washington thanking his excellency for his notice and making the best excuse you can." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{film critics}} have written favorably about the film. It has been {{hailed as a}} masterpiece by Kent Jones, Adolf Heinzlmeier, Berndt Schulz and Penelope Gilliatt, who said it was [...] "not only a masterpiece of filmmaking, not only a great work of humanism in a perfect rococo frame, but also an act of historical testimony." [...] Its themes have been analyzed by film scholar and Renoir's biographer Leo Braudy, who observed that the film [...] "embodies a social world {{in which there are}} rules but no values. If you don't know the rules, you are crushed; but if you do know the rules you are cut off <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> nature." [...] Dudley Andrew described the film's [...] "complex social criticism" [...] while Kenneth Browser and Peter Cowie wrote about its sense of humanity. Other critics have written about the film's darker themes; Andrew Sarris praised its depiction of class differences. The complexity of Renoir's storytelling techniques have been examined by Roger Ebert, who called it [...] "so simple and so labyrinthine, so guileless and so angry, so innocent and so dangerous, that you can't simply watch it, you have to absorb it", Luc Sante, who called it [...] "a dense clockwork mechanism" [...] and Robin Wood, who said the film [...] "operates on all levels." [...] Critics have praised its farcical elements: Pauline Kael called it [...] "a great satirical comedy, a dance of death" [...] and Gerald Mast wrote [...] " [...] depicts the failure of love, the failure of society, and the failure of men to rise above the ridiculous. Their only success is that they try and they care." [...] David Thomson praised Renoir's performance and remarked on [...] "Renoir's admission that the director, supposedly the authoritative and manipulating figure, is as much victim as originator of circumstances." [...] Amy Taubin said [...] "I can think of no other film that is as unfailingly generousto its audience, its characters, its actors, the milieu and the medium." [...] J. Hoberman wrote about its influence on Woody Allen, Robert Altman and Mike Leigh.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the stark prohibitions and warnings against adultery, marital relations were expected and considered a right. A newly married soldier in Israel {{did not have to}} go to war for a year, so that he could bring happiness to his bride. Proverbs encourages the enjoyment of sexual relations within marriage: [...] "Drink water <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> cistern, flowing water <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> well. Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you. Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth...Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress? For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths. The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin. He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sibelius, however, was not {{a natural}} teacher. First, he had little {{patience}} for the tedium of pedagogy or the quotidian nature of instruction, resulting in a teaching style that was [...] "too haphazard" [...] and [...] "anything but systematic or disciplined". This {{was not lost on}} Madetoja, who in January 1910 wrote to Kuula in Paris, [...] "Sibelius has been tutoring me. You know <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> experience that his tutoring is anything but detailed." [...] That said, Madetoja appears to have found some value in the instruction. He recalled, for example, that Sibelius's method consisted of [...] "short, striking remarks" [...] (for example, [...] "No dead notes. Every note must live"! and [...] "You must jump into the water if you are to learn to swim.

2500|$|This {{approach}} earned {{praise from}} two influential intellectual {{figures of the}} Romanian diaspora, critics Monica Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca, whose letter to the author read: [...] "the distances you take <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> background are of most-rare authenticity and tact. You accomplish a radical break, being {{at the same time}} participative, negating things only after you have understood them, being dissociated from both roles of judge and defense counsel." [...] Cioroianu also notes: [...] "He is not the only son of (relatively) well-known communists; but {{he is one of the}} few to have reached the level of detachment needed in order to X-ray, in a cold and precise way, a political system. Does this seem easy to you? I do not know how many of us would be capable of introspecting with such lucidity our own parents' utopias, phantasms and disappointments". The historian opposes Tismăneanu's approach to that of Petre Roman, Romania-s first post-1989 Premier, whose attempts at discussing the public image of his father, the communist politico Valter Roman, are argued by Cioroianu to have [...] "failed".|$|E
2500|$|On December 23, 1783, the State of New Jersey {{presented}} him {{with the use of}} an estate in Bergen County now known as Steuben House, which had been confiscated from Loyalist Jan Zabriskie in 1781. Located in the formerly strategic New Bridge Landing, the estate included a gristmill and about 40 acres of land. Legislators initially conditioned the grant, requiring Steuben to [...] "hold, occupy and enjoy the said estate in person, and not by tenant." [...] Gen.

It described their chemistry as not [...] "at a Margaret and David level yet", but put that down to the recent changeover, and said Bajo had much better chemistry with Hex than with Junglist.

It said the various segments throughout the show's history from different reporters have mostly been hit and miss, adding that [...] "Why Gamers Cheat" [...] was better than a recent segment [...] "which was too silly to be worth paying much attention to". It compared the show positively to video game review series Zero Punctuation, and added that excluding Charlie Brooker's Gameswipe one-off special, it is [...] "the best television based gaming alternative out there" [...] due to being both funny and optimistic {{about the state of the}} gaming industry.|$|E

Additionally, Oliver Kent was brought in as the Head of Continuing Drama Series for BBC Scripted Studios, meaning that Kent would oversee EastEnders along with O'Connor. O'Connor's approach to the show {{was to have a}} firmer focus on realism, which he said was being [...] "true to EastEnders DNA and [...] a way of capturing {{what it would be like}} if Julia Smith and Tony Holland were making the show now." [...] He said that [...] "EastEnders has always had a distinctly different tone from the other soaps but over time we've diluted our unique selling point. I think we need to be ourselves and go back to the origins of the show and what made it successful in the first place. It should be entertaining but it should also be informative—that's part of our unique BBC compact with the audience. It shouldn't just be a distraction <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> life, it should be an exploration of the life shared by the audience and the characters." [...] O'Connor planned to stay with EastEnders until the end of 2017, but announced his departure on 23 June 2017 with immediate effect, saying he wanted to concentrate on a career in film.
