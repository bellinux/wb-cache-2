2500|$|The {{disaster}} to Manchuria occurred at 4:10 {{in the morning}} on 20 August 1906 when the ship went aground between Rabbit Island and Oahu resulting first in <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> and mail during the day as efforts were organized to pull the ship off the reef.

50|$|The tunnel was notorious among steam {{locomotive}} crews for its bad atmosphere, {{the result of}} its unusually narrow bore combined with a steep gradient (1:80) and a bend at the north end.

50|$|All unfortunate {{events that}} {{took place on the}} Star of Empire, were orchestrated by a {{supercomputer}} (SIM?) designed as a harmless autopilot for the ship.

40|$|AbstractFull scale {{experiments}} were performed in an underground subway station {{to investigate the}} effect of water mist on smoke flow from tunnel area to platform through shield door. Smoke temperature, species concentrations and smoke visibility were measured at different points. Dimensionless variables were introduced to represent the variations of smoke characteristics. The smoke temperature with water mist interaction could be reduced to less than 1 / 10 of the spill smoke flow. The mass flow rate could be reduced to less than 1 / 4 of the spill smoke flow. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} water mist system could help to reduce smoke temperature and the concentration of toxic species, improving survival conditions for <b>evacuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, human {{behavior}} in rail tunnel fires is explored. Descriptive knowledge is presented {{related to the}} <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> trains, and the subsequent tunnel evacuation to a safe location. More specifically, a theoretical framework that can aid the understanding of {{human behavior}} is identified, and its applicability to rail tunnels is demonstrated. In addition, new empirical data on the flow rate capacity of train exits during evacuation in rail tunnels, {{as well as on}} walking speeds in smoke free and smoke filled rail tunnels, is presented. Finally, a number of technical installations that may facilitate orientation, movement and exit choice in rail tunnels are suggested. The findings are presented in relation to previously conducted empirical studies, and a discussion is also made on how the findings can be used in application and design...|$|R
5000|$|TEMPSC is {{an acronym}} for [...] "Totally Enclosed Motor Propelled Survival Craft".

50|$|NY Waterway {{has played}} a role in a number of rescue and {{emergency}} operations. In the immediate after effects of September 11, 2001 attacks, the company was instrumental in the <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> who otherwise would have been stranded in Manhattan due to the chaos created in the mass transit system. The ferry service also brought people across the river during Northeast Blackout of 2003 when service on New Jersey Transit and Port Authority Trans-Hudson trains could not operate. During the 2005 New York City transit strike it provided alternative transportation.|$|E

5000|$|On 15 June 1918 Makambo ran aground near Neds Beach, at the {{northern}} end of Lord Howe Island. There was only one immediate casualty; a passenger, Miss Readon, was drowned when a boat capsized during the <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> and crew from the vessel. [...] The ship was only temporarily out of service until repairs could be made; however, Makambo was aground for nine days before she was refloated. The incident had allowed black rats to leave the ship and go ashore on the island, where they thrived. This introduction gave rise to an environmental disaster, with the rats causing the extinction of several of the island’s endemic birds and other fauna {{in the next few years}} through predation, as well as causing hardship to the islanders by raiding their crops and only export commodity, the seeds of the kentia palm.|$|E

Due to the nature of a mass casualty incident, rescue workers employ triage to classify the victims and direct their efforts where they can best affect survival.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II, {{the railway}} {{junction}} and the adjacent air base were the target of several raids.

50|$|Monorail being slimmer than LRT is {{considered}} aesthetically more pleasing than LRT, day light penetration is obstructed by {{the deck of}} a LRT structure while monorail structure allows penetration. Monorail promoters habitually tend to portray monorail systems as light, airy, slender, unobtrusive structures sailing gracefully over fields and streets typically only photos of renditions of single beam guideways are presented. But the practically the slender beam structure has result in various operational issues such as <b>evacuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> during breakdown since there is no platform for the passengers to get off in case of evacuation. Instances where the passengers been stranded for hours such as in Mumbai where the passengers had to be rescued with the help of fire brigade has been cited. To mitigate the practical issue, walkways between the monorail beams have been erected so that people can walk out in such solution which results in them losing the only advantage of day light penetration which is considerably blocked. The Las Vegas project demonstrates, a bona fide, heavy-duty, real world monorail consists of a lot more heavy, physical, elevated infrastructure than just a slender beamway. Similar to monorails not requiring overhead power lines LRT can use third rail system instead of the overhead catenary system.|$|E
