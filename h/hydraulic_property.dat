When used in conjunction with nonlinear parameter estimation software that incorporates advanced regularization functionality (such as PEST), use of pilot points can add a great deal of flexibility to the calibration process {{at the same time as}} it makes this process easier to implement.

Recent results of low-frequency electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements on a range of saturated and unsaturated soil samples suggest that spectral electrical properties can be related to hydraulic conductivity. Therefore, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a promising non-invasive measurement technique to determine hydraulic conductivity patterns in soils and aquifers. In this project, we aim to establish EIT as a method to determine spatial patterns in hydraulic conductivity and to validate the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>property</b> patterns derived from EIT measurements, in the laboratory and the field.

Numerically, this inverse problem is solved by minimizing an output least squares functional. The unknown <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> which are nonlinear coefficients of a partial differential equation are approximated by spline functions. The identification is embedded into a multi-level algorithm and coupled with a linear sensitivity analysis to describe the ill-posedness of the inverse problem...|$|R

Unsaturated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> estimated included <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity and diffusivity {{as a function of}} matrix suction.

40|$|This report {{provides}} the resluts of detailed hydrologic characterization tests conducted within eleven Hanford Site wells during fiscal year 2000. Detailed characterization tests performed included groundwater-flow characterization; barometric response evaluation; slug tests; single-well tracer tests; constant-rate pumping tests; and in-well, vertical flow tests. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>property</b> estimates {{obtained from the}} detailed hydrologic tests include transmissivity; hydraulic conductivity; specific yield; effective porosity; in-well, lateral flow velocity; aquifer-flow velocity; vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity (within the well-screen section); and in-well, verticla flow velocity. In addition, local groundwater-flow characteristics (i. e., hydraulic gradient and flow direction) were determined for four sites where detailed well testing was performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistics}} and correlations among {{the parameters of}} soil <b>hydraulic</b> <b>property</b> functions of completely decomposed granite soils in Hong Kong were studied. The reliability index of a 20 m high soil slope under two different rainfall conditions, i. e., long-term precipitation condition and rainstorm condition, were obtained using Latin Hypercube Sampling technique. The resalts show that {{the reliability of the}} slope with soil hydraulic parameters which have no correlation is smallest while the reliability of the slope with perfectly correlated soil hydraulic parameters is largest. Therefore, {{it is important to consider}} the correlations among soil hydraulic properties and adopt appropriate correlation coefficients in reliability analysis of slope stability under rainfall condition...|$|E
40|$|The Remediation Decision Support (RDS) project, {{managed by}} the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the CH 2 M HILL Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC), has been {{compiling}} physical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>property</b> data and parameters to support risk analyses and waste management decisions at Hanford. In FY 09 the RDS project developed a strategic plan for a physical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>property</b> database. This report documents prototype data models and dictionaries for these properties and associated parameters. Physical properties and hydraulic parameters and their distributions are required for any type of quantitative assessment of risk and uncertainty associated with predictions of contaminant transport and fate in the subsurface. The central plateau of the Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State contains most of the contamination at the Site and has up to {approx} 100 m of unsaturated and unconsolidated or semi-consolidated sediments overlying the unconfined aquifer. These sediments contain {{a wide variety of}} contaminants ranging from organic compounds, such as carbon tetrachloride, to numerous radionuclides including technetium, plutonium, and uranium. Knowledge of the physical and hydraulic properties of the sediments and their distributions is critical for quantitative assessment of the transport of these contaminants in the subsurface, for evaluation of long-term risks and uncertainty associated with model predictions of contaminant transport and fate, and for evaluating, designing, and operating remediation alternatives. One of the goals of PNNL's RDS project is to work with the Hanford Environmental Data Manager (currently with CHPRC) to develop a protocol and schedule for incorporation of physical property and hydraulic parameter datasets currently maintained by PNNL into HEIS. This requires that the data first be reviewed to ensure quality and consistency. New data models must then be developed for HEIS that are approved by the HTAG that oversees HEIS development. After approval, these new data models then need to be implemented in HEIS by the EDM before there is an actual repository for the data. This document summarizes modifications to previously developed data models, and new data models and data dictionaries for physical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>property</b> data and parameters to be transferred to HEIS. A prototype dataset that conforms to the specifications of these recommended data models has been identified and processed, and is ready for transfer to CHPRC for inclusion in HEIS. Additional datasets are planned for transfer from PNNL to CHPRC in FY 11...|$|E
40|$|Compactive {{processes}} affect soil <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> {{and associated}} soil water flow. Soil water retention and transport properties are altered {{in response to}} changes in pore space geometry. Soil water flow is affected not only by soil <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> but additionally by the distribution of sources and sinks {{of water in the}} soil system. Compaction can alter soil pore geometry, and can also affect sources and sinks of water by changing surface configuration, and crop rooting distribution. This paper reviews the literature and presents data and relationships showing the. effects of compaction on soil <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> and water flow, presents numerically modeled water flow for some management systems, and identifies future directions for research...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{unsaturated}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> are {{an important}} input for simulations of water and solute movement in the vadose zone. However, {{in the case of}} soils containing rock fragments, direct measurement of unsaturated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> remains difficult. Recently, an analytical method was proposed (Ma et al., 2009) for determining soil <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> from horizontal water absorption experiments. Here, we test if this method could be used in the determination of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> of stony soils with a set of experiments. The results show that the method can predict accurately and quickly the hydraulic parameters of stony soils using the cumulative infiltration volume and the rate of wetting front advancement during water absorption into a horizontal soil column. The influence of rock fragment content on some soil <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> including air entry suction, saturated hydraulic conductivity and the shape coefficients of hydraulic functions was further evaluated. Both air entry suction and shape coefficient show a large range of variation with rock fragment content. Globally, the saturated hydraulic conductivities of stony soils decreased with increasing rock fragment content. However, when the volumetric rock fragment content is about 0. 08 cm(3) cm(- 3), the stony soil displayed a greater saturated hydraulic conductivity compared to the fine earth at 95 % confidence level. The relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and rock fragment content is not accurately estimated by different equations relating saturated hydraulic conductivity of stony soils to that of non-stony soils. These findings imply that other factors than the reduction of cross sectional area for water flow influence the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>properties</b> of stony soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
