Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, Lacan and Levinas all choose examples of paintings rather than photographs to illustrate, and/or ground, their arguments on issues of visual perception, aesthetic, ethics and politics. It is surprising and disturbing that despite the fact that these philosophers were all exposed to an ever increasing number of disturbing and difficult photographic images, often raising philosophical issues relevant to their own work, they chose to ignore discussions of such photographs in their philosophical work...|$|R
40|$|We see {{currently}} {{the trend of}} having larger and larger displays <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> and {{that more and more}} computer oriented applications which are usually controlled by a mouse are displayed by them. Examples for the latter are web browsing, picture browsing, chatting and email. This leads to two problems. Firstly, most applications and web pages are not designed for situations in which the user is sitting in a relative large distance from the display. The user is therefore often not able to read the text, to interact easily with buttons or to click on hyperlinks. Secondly, it is not appropriate to use the mouse as the input device as flat surfaces are typically not in reach when sitting on the sofa in the <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> This paper investigates firstly whether direct pointing would be a suitable interaction concept and secondly whether the usage of magnifiers helps the user when interacting from a distance.

Through a combination of songs and dances, stories, dress up games and moments to 2 ̆ 7 look through the window 2 ̆ 7 into the real world outside Play school, children are presented with a variety of sounds and images to engage with social concepts.

40|$|While the research, {{theory and}} policy {{literature}} on race, class and gender discrimination in education is extensive, {{the problem of}} education‐based discrimination itself has been widely overlooked. Indeed, the dominant ideologies of meritocracy and human capital (into which we are inculcated throughout our lives by schools, media and the state) proclaim that higher levels of education are and should be linked with greater reward. In a world where education is regularly invoked to legitimate inequality, it can appear nonsensical even to raise concern about education‐based discrimination {{as a matter of}} social injustice.

40|$|Gambling {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} in Sweden during the 1990 s, with betting shops, gambling machines and casino-like gambling in pubs and restaurants, {{as well as}} Bingo-Lotto <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms.</b> Beyond the expansion in availability of legal gambling opportunities, the most notable change is the shift from gambling in specific venues to gambling in a much wider range of social settings. The consequences of this development {{have not yet been}} fully described and analysed. However it is likely that teenagers will observe and engage in gambling activities at younger ages than in the past. The main purpose of this dissertation is to discuss the social impact of increased availability of gambling in society and to obtain a better understanding of gambling activities among teenagers. A critical review of research literature on gambling {{is an essential part of}} the dissertation, as it tries to organise concepts, theories and research results from different research perspectives into a framework for understanding of gambling behaviour among young people. In addition to the literature review this dissertation includes analysis of some empirical data collected in a national two-phase study. The first phase consisted of a survey among the general population in Sweden to obtain some information about gambling activities, individual experiences of gambling and gambling related problems. The second phase was designed to include all respondents with gambling problems in the sample, together with a matched control group. Face to face interviews and data collection were carried out about two years later with 324 respondents, including 96 teenagers. Gambling problems were assessed and then reassessed after two years in the second phase with SOGS-R. Gambling has become institutionalised within the mainstream economy and is supported by the many of stakeholders, including the state, sport organisations, and others, benefiting from its proliferation. Restrictions and age limits reduce the level of gambling activity among teenagers but they do not prevent them from gambling, and attitudes towards gambling could be described as ambivalent or even in favour of gambling. Teenagers seem to look upon their introduction to gambling as part of their normal transition into adulthood. The majority of the teenagers do gamble for recreational and social purposes. Regardless of their age, sex and socio-economic situation, they usually participate in gambling just for the fun of it. But among ten per cents of the teenagers gambling becomes more problematic. A framework for understanding of gambling and gambling problems among young people relates gambling actions to 1) personal background and living conditions, 2) the gambling settings and concepts of space, time and type of gambling, 3) the consequences as flow and the desire to repeat the gambling actions, and 4) the gamblers intention. In spite of lower rates of gambling involvement, teenagers were found to be three times more likely than adults to experience difficulties related to their gambling. A major finding reported in this dissertation is however that gambling problems, at least in less severe forms, seems to be more changeable over time than expected...|$|R
