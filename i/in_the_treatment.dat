40|$|A {{computational}} model utilizing grid and finite difference methods {{were developed to}} simulate focused ultrasound functional neurosurgery interventions. The model couples the propagation of ultrasound in fluids (soft tissues) and solids (skull) with acoustic and visco-elastic wave equations.

40|$|Management {{methods for}} {{invasive}} species {{vary in their}} restoration success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{presence or absence of}} herbivores. We investigated the performance of understory plants after management of the invasive shrub Amur honeysuckle using two herbicide-based methods (cut/paint and basal application) in fenced and unfenced plots. The cut/paint method resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> removal of above-ground stems, while the basal application method resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dead stems remaining in place. Light level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cut/paint <b>treatment</b> was higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basal application <b>treatment,</b> which was higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control (no management) treatment. Across fencing treatments, fruit production, height, and subsequent recruitment of transplanted jewelweed were greater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cut/paint <b>treatment.</b> Across management treatments, jewelweed plants were taller <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fenced <b>treatment.</b> Native species richness was generally higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cut/paint and basal application <b>treatments</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>treatment.</b> There were more jewelweed recruits, more jewelweed fruits, and greater native species richness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cut/paint <b>treatment</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basal application <b>treatment</b> <b>in</b> fenced plots, but these measures were similar in both management treatments in unfenced plots.
