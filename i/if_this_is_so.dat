But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals {{of the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan {{or one of his}} predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, and would not have reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology.|$|E

25|$|Real world {{bodies are}} often not in {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium and not homogeneous. For study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics, a body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into 'cells' of small size. If classical thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation in such a 'cell', then it is homogeneous and a temperature exists for it. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> for every 'cell' of the body, then local thermodynamic equilibrium is said to prevail throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E

500|$|In {{the prose}} {{introduction}} to the poem Lokasenna, Skaði {{is referred to as}} the wife of Njörðr and is cited as one of the goddesses attending Ægir's feast. After Loki has an exchange with the god Heimdallr, [...] Skaði interjects. Skaði tells Loki that he is [...] "light-hearted" [...] and that Loki will not be [...] "playing [...] with [...] tail wagging free" [...] for much longer, for soon the gods will bind Loki to a sharp rock with the ice-cold entrails of his son. Loki responds that, even <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> he was [...] "first and foremost" [...] at the killing of Þjazi. Skaði responds that, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> [...] "baneful advice" [...] will always flow from her [...] "sanctuaries and plains". Loki responds that Skaði was more friendly in speech when Skaði was in his bed—an accusation he makes to most of the goddesses in the poem and is not attested elsewhere. Loki's flyting then turns to the goddess Sif.|$|E
500|$|A paleographical {{study at}} the British Museum in 1938 found that the text had {{undergone}} several corrections. The first corrections were done by several scribes before the manuscript left the scriptorium. Readings which they introduced are designated by the siglum אa. Milne and Skeat have observed that the superscription to 1 Maccabees was made by scribe D, while the text was written by scribe A. Scribe D corrects his own work and that of scribe A, but scribe A limits himself to correcting his own work. In the 6th or 7th century, many alterations were made (אb) – according to a colophon {{at the end of}} the book of Esdras and Esther the source of these alterations was [...] "a very ancient manuscript that had been corrected by the hand of the holy martyr Pamphylus" [...] (martyred in 309). <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> material beginning with 1 Samuel to the end of Esther is Origen's copy of the Hexapla. From this colophon, the correction is concluded to have been made in Caesarea Maritima in the 6th or 7th centuries. The pervasive iotacism, especially of the [...] diphthong, remains uncorrected.|$|E

2500|$|In 1186, {{a certain}} Adam son of Domnall, [...] "the king's outlaw", {{was killed by}} Máel Coluim, Mormaer of Atholl, in the {{sanctuary}} of the church at Cupar, and the church burnt with 58 of Adam's associates within. It may be that this Adam mac Domnaill was a son of Domnall mac Uilleim. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> then the presence of his son in Cupar, south of the Mounth, reinforces the conviction that Domnall fought, not for the Mormaerdom of Moray, but for the kingship of Scotland.

2500|$|Despite this, the Ascension {{itself has}} become an embarrassment, a remnant of an outmoded cosmology. As {{expressed}} in a famous statement by theologian Rudolf Bultmann in his essay The New Testament and Mythology: [...] "We no longer believe in the three-storied universe which the creeds take for granted... No one who {{is old enough to}} think for himself supposes that God lives in a local heaven ... And <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> the story of Christ's ... ascension into heaven is done with." [...] Modern theologians have therefore de-mythologised a heaven in which God sits enthroned above Jerusalem for one which is [...] "the endless, self-sustaining life of God," [...] and the Ascension which is [...] "an emblem in space and time of God's eternal life." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{refers to}} the church, and indeed to {{individual}} Christians, as the ‘temple of the living God’ (1 Cor. 3:16, 6:19). To Western Christians, thinking anachronistically of the temple as simply the Jewish equivalent of a cathedral, the image is simply one metaphor among many and without much apparent significance. For a first-century Jew, however, the Temple had an enormous significance; as a result, when Paul uses such an image within twenty-five years of the Crucifixion (with the actual temple still standing), it is a striking index of the immense change {{that has taken place}} in his [...] thought. The Temple had been superseded by the Church. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> for the Temple, and in Romans 4 for the Land, then it must a fortiori be the case for Jerusalem, which formed the concentric circle in between those two in the normal Jewish worldview.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Akiva cited [...] {{in which}} the duty to punish an {{intentional}} murderer takes precedence over {{the sanctity of the}} altar, to support the proposition that the avoidance of danger to human life takes precedence over the laws of the Sabbath. [...] Thus, if a murderer came as priest to do the Temple service, one could take him away from the precincts of the altar. [...] And Rabbah bar bar Hana taught in the name of Rabbi Johanan that to save life – for example, if a priest could testify to the innocence of a defendant – one could take a priest down from the altar even while he was performing the Temple service. [...] Now <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> even where doubt existed whether there was any substance to the priest’s testimony, yet one interrupted the Temple service, and the Temple service was important enough to suspend the Sabbath, how much more should the saving of human life suspend the Sabbath laws.|$|E

2500|$|The story {{follows the}} {{attempts}} {{of five children}} to clear {{the name of their}} friend Sticky by trailing and catching a homeless thief with disagreeable manners; a [...] "ghastly type" [...] to be identified by his brown boots. The boots are possibly a reference to the 1931 monologue Brahn Boots by Stanley Holloway, which was still regularly played on BBC Home Service radio in the 1950s. The song's lyrics describe the apparent low-class taste of a man clad in brown boots, but he is too modest to say that he has given his good black boots away to the poor; it is really a parable on the subject of unquestioning snobbery. An obvious clue not followed by the children is that the thief initially enters the shop asking for the previous Wednesday's newspaper. The book's publication in 1955 and the timing of the plot during the June half-term holiday possibly indicate the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act of 6 June 1955. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> then the disagreeable man could be taken to be the author's characterisation of D. C. Thomson & Co., or its cartoonist Bill Holroyd, who published children's cartoons such as Jack Silver and His Dog Black. This cartoon was later lampooned by Viz as Jack Black and his Dog Silver. It is perhaps also significant in this context that the publication of Half-Term Trail in 1955 follows press commentary on the first few books of The Cherrys series, and that Scott did not like to be compared with Enid Blyton. In Will Scott's story, the children pursue the brown-booted man unquestioningly, and they are described thus: ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Felix Frankfurter, however, {{felt that}} the {{incorporation}} process ought to be incremental, and that the federal courts should only apply those sections of the Bill of Rights whose abridgment would [...] "shock the conscience," [...] {{as he put it}} in Rochin v. California (1952). Such a selective incorporation approach followed that of Justice Moody, who wrote in Twining v. New Jersey (1908) that [...] "It is possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against National action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> it is not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments, but because they are of such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law." [...] The due process approach thus considers a right to be incorporated not because it was listed in the Bill of Rights, but only because it is required by the definition of due process, which may change over time. [...] For example, Moody's decision in Twining stated that the 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination was not inherent in a conception of due process and so did not apply to states, but was overruled in Malloy v. Hogan (1964). [...] Similarly, Justice Cardozo stated in Palko v. Connecticut (1937) that the right against double jeopardy was not inherent to due process and so does not apply to the states, but that was overruled in Benton v. Maryland (1969). [...] Frankfurter's incrementalist approach did carry the day, but the end result is very nearly what Justice Black advocated, with the exceptions noted below.|$|E
