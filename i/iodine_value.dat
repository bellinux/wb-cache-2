40|$|In Nigeria, frozen fishes are {{extensively}} consumed. But {{there is}} paucity {{of knowledge about}} the essential nutrients and contamination status of the fishes. In this study, fat contents, <b>iodine</b> <b>values,</b> trace and toxic metals were determined in 20 frozen fish obtained from Lagos and Ibadan, south western Nigeria. Average fat contents in the analysed fish species ranged from 4. 38 to 58. 9 %, while average <b>iodine</b> <b>values</b> of oil in the fish samples ranged from 50. 4 to 120 mg/ 100 g. The following ranges were however observed for the average metal concentrations in the fish samples: Pb; 2. 09 - 12. 3 g g - 1, Cd; - 1 (less than the detection limit of AAS), Cu; 2. 38 - 4. 38 g g - 1 and Zn; 22. 9 - 32. 2 g g - 1. The high fat contents and their corresponding <b>iodine</b> <b>values</b> recorded for Atlantic horse mackerel (58. 90. 45 %, 1122. 00 mg/ 100 g), Sardine (34. 43. 15 %, 57. 89. 60 mg/ 100 g) and Chub mackerel (38. 81. 55 %, 12016. 5 mg/ 100 g) suggest that consumption of these fish species could be recommended to people with cardiovascular disorder.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} iodine intake in Japanese infants, iodine contents {{were determined}} in both commercial and homemade baby food samples consumed in Japan. Fifty-three samples of commercial bottled or retort baby food and 25 samples of homemade baby food {{for one day}} were collected and their iodine contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after an extraction with 0. 5 % tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Among the commercial baby food samples, 35 samples showed low <b>iodine</b> <b>values</b> (1000 ng/g wet weight). Significantly higher <b>iodine</b> <b>values</b> were observed in 15 samples composed of dishes cooked using kombu (a kind of kelp) than other samples. Among the homemade baby food samples, 12 samples brought very low iodine intake (< 1 - 24 μg/d), while 5 samples brought very high iodine intake (283 - 978 μg/d). These results indicate that intermittent high iodine baby food including dishes cooked using kombu contributes to sufficient iodine intake in Japanese infants...|$|R

The characteristics of bleached oil are strongly related to type bleaching me-dium, temperature at which bleaching is done and other factors. In this study, we compare perox-ide, free fatty acid, acid and <b>iodine</b> <b>values,</b> copper and iron content of bleached and crude oils to establish the characteristics of edible oils bleached using smectite and kaolinite-rich clays. Oil in-dustries spend {{large sums of money}} purchasing bleaching earths yet no country lacks natural clays which can be developed to bleach oils.

Sterculia foetida oil contains cyclopropene fatty acids such as 8,9 methylene-heptadec-8-enoic acid (malvalic acid) and 9,10-methylene-ocadec-9-enoic acid (sterulic acid). The flash point, <b>iodine</b> <b>value,</b> free fatty acid count, phosphorus content, cloud point, pour point, viscosity at 40 °C, oxidative stability at 110 °C, density, and trace metal count are all within ASTM and EN specifications.|$|E
50|$|A {{vegetable}} oil can be pressed from kapok seeds. The oil has a yellow colour and a pleasant, mild odour and taste, resembling cottonseed oil. It becomes rancid quickly {{when exposed to}} air. Kapok oil is produced in India, Indonesia and Malaysia. It has an <b>iodine</b> <b>value</b> of 85-100; this makes it a nondrying oil, which means {{that it does not}} dry out significantly when exposed to air. Kapok oil has some potential as a biofuel and in paint preparation.|$|E
50|$|Lard {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fats, {{which in the}} language of chemistry are known as triglycerides. These triglycerides are composed of three fatty acids and the distribution of fatty acids varies from oil to oil. In general lard is similar to tallow in its composition. Pigs that have been fed different diets will have lard with a significantly different fatty acid content and <b>iodine</b> <b>value.</b> Peanut-fed hogs or the acorn-fed pigs raised for Jamón ibérico therefore produce a somewhat different kind of lard compared to pigs raised in North American farms that are fed corn.|$|E
40|$|The lipids and {{fatty acids}} in the tissues of Japanese anchovy, EngrauliB japonica, were studied. Samples were {{harvested}} between June and December for adult anchovy, and between August and December for young anchovy, in 1972 {{from the coast}} near Hakodate, Japan. The lipid contents in the tissues of adult samples varied from 1. 3 - 10. 7 % for the flesh and from 2. 6 - 26. 1 % for the viscera during the sampling period. Similar results were found for young fish, 0. 9 - 2. 4 % for the flesh and 1. 8 - 10. 0 % for the viscera. The contents of non-polar lipids, consisted mainly of triglycerides, varied with triglyceride contents, and accordingly, that of total lipids. The <b>iodine</b> <b>values</b> of non-polar lipids for the flesh and viscera of adult samples changed from 161. 7 to 187. 0 and from 155. 0 to 211. 3, respectively, showing high levels of <b>iodine</b> <b>values</b> in both tiBBues when its lipid contents were com-paratively low.

30|$|Furfural (furan- 2 -carbaldehyde) {{serves as}} the {{preferred}} solvent for extraction of vegetable oils due to its miscibility {{and the ability of}} leaching out different types of oils as characterised by spread of <b>iodine</b> <b>values.</b> The tendency of furfural to form dark residues, accelerated by its exposure to heat, light and oxygen, constitutes its main disadvantage. In particular, these residues inhibit the oxidation of oil, retarding the formation of the paint film (Kenyon et al. 1948).|$|R
5000|$|Stillingia oil is {{gained by}} solvent {{from the plant}} seeds of the Sapium family such as, Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) and Sapium discolor (Mountain tallow tree).

Stillingia oil's properties, such as a high <b>iodine</b> <b>value,</b> and {{chemical}} components classifies it as a drying oil. Why it has the appropriate properties to be a drying oil remain disputed. Following are three different arguments from J. Devine (1950), A. Crossley with T.P. Hilditch (1953), and V. C.

50|$|Unrefined {{jojoba oil}} {{appears as a}} clear golden liquid at room {{temperature}} with a slightly nutty odor. Refined jojoba oil is colorless and odorless. The melting point of jojoba oil is approximately 10 °C and the <b>iodine</b> <b>value</b> is approximately 80. Jojoba oil is relatively shelf-stable when compared with other vegetable oils mainly because it contains little triglycerides, unlike most other vegetable oils such as grape seed oil and coconut oil. It has an oxidative stability index of approximately 60, which means {{that it is more}} shelf-stable than safflower oil, canola oil, almond oil or squalene but less than castor oil and coconut oil.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>iodine</b> <b>value</b> (or [...] "iodine {{adsorption}} value" [...] or [...] "iodine number" [...] or [...] "iodine index") {{in chemistry}} is {{the mass of}} iodine in grams that is consumed by 100 grams of a chemical substance. Iodine numbers are often {{used to determine the}} amount of unsaturation in fatty acids. This unsaturation {{is in the form of}} double bonds, which react with iodine compounds. The higher the iodine number, the more C=C bonds are present in the fat. It can be seen from the table that coconut oil is very saturated, which means it is good for making soap. On the other hand, linseed oil is highly unsaturated, which makes it a drying oil, well suited for making oil paints.|$|E

30|$|The <b>iodine</b> <b>value</b> is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} iodine mass absorbed by 100  g of sample. It is taken {{as a measure of}} the degree of unsaturation of the biodiesel. Once the iodine is added to the fatty acid double bonds, the <b>iodine</b> <b>value</b> is increased as the double bonds are increased. As a consequence, the biodiesel with high concentration of saturated fatty acids presents low <b>iodine</b> <b>value,</b> which is increased with mono-, di- and triunsaturates. When the biodiesel <b>iodine</b> <b>value</b> is high and the engine temperature is increased, the fuel is degraded faster and forms solid deposits in the engine.

40|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} component of thyroid hormone, which is indispensable for normal development, growth and metabolism. Iodine Deficiency (ID) results in decreased thyroid hormone synthesis, which can lead to mental retardation. ID is actually the most prevalent preventable cause of mental impairment. Although recent {{attempts have been made to}} eradicate ID, the threat still persists, especially in developing countries. The urinary iodine concentration of a population in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was evaluated because certain parts of Bolivia are thought to be mildly iodine deficient, but current data are not available. It was hypothesized that an urban population would have higher iodine nutrition than a rural population, where iodine deficiency was believed to exist. In summer 2006, I collected urine and blood samples from approximately 183 rural and 110 urban patients from the Santa Cruz area in the Bolivian lowlands. Iodine concentrations in the samples were determined using the Sandell-Kolthoff Method. In the rural population, 11. 5 % of samples had <b>iodine</b> deficient <b>values</b> (0 - 100 µg/L), 81. 9 % had <b>iodine</b> sufficient <b>values</b> (100 - 600 µg/L), and 6. 56 % had high levels of iodine that exceeded 600 µg/L. In the urban samples, 16. 4 % had <b>iodine</b> deficient <b>values,</b> 77. 3 % had <b>iodine</b> sufficient <b>values,</b> and 6. 36 % had levels of iodine exceeding 600 µg/L.
