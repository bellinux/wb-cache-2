5|$|Hans Karl von Winterfeldt {{was born}} at Vanselow Castle (now in Siedenbrünzow, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) in Swedish Pomerania. His {{education}} was imperfect, and in later life he always regretted his lack of <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the French language.|$|E
5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> rehabilitation programs. She used {{the story of a}} young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike as {{a humorous}} {{adaptation}} of Chekhov themes that doesn't require <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> Chekhov. The original Broadway production {{proved to be}} a commercial success, recouping its $2.75 million investment in under four months. In 2013, it won the Tony Award for Best Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, among other awards.|$|E

5000|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{acknowledged}} {{the cast and}} {{the look of the}} film and, despite some <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> the film's conflict, praised Allen's work on the film. He wrote, [...] "For the filmmaker who brought these intertwined universes into being, the film represents new energy in a remarkable career.".|$|R
5|$|Due to the rainout and the racers' lack of <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the EuroSpeedway, CART {{cancelled}} {{qualifying for}} the American Memorial. The starting grid {{was determined by}} drivers' order in the season points standings. The pole position went to de Ferran, though {{due to the lack}} of qualifying, he was not awarded a point in the standings as was customary for pole winners. Bräck earned second position since he held a tie-breaker over Castroneves, who started third, and Andretti began the race in fourth.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} create <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> a common-day setting and tone, Vaughan made this story arc include various {{references}} to current popular culture, including television series, films, and celebrities such as , the Matrix trilogy, and Dr. Phil. Vaughan even makes references to real-world events, such as the Menendez brothers' shootings, the Beltway sniper attacks, Saddam Hussein's hiding and the O. J. Simpson murder case.|$|E
5|$|Lem {{singled out}} only one American science fiction writer for praise, Philip K. Dick, {{for example in}} his 1986 English-language {{anthology}} of his critical essays, Microworlds. In fact, initially Lem held an equally low opinion of Philip K. Dick together with the bulk of American science fiction, explaining later {{this was due to}} limited <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> Dick's work.|$|E
50|$|The author {{coinciding with}} the gnostics, in fear of division, {{addressed}} a group who feel they are separated or discriminated. The author preaches to them of envy. Particularly referring to the New Testament, the author mentions <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> the Pauline epistles about the body of Christ as a unity. The author points out that each and everyone {{is just as important}} as the other person.|$|R
50|$|At the bar {{he accused}} Topcliffe of having boasted to him of indecent <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> the Queen. Hence Topcliffe {{obtained}} a mandamus {{to the sheriff}} {{to proceed with the}} execution, though Archbishop Whitgift endeavoured to delay it and make his godson conform, and though (it is said) Pormort would have admitted conference with Protestant ministers. The gibbet was erected over against the haberdasher's shop, and Portmore was kept standing two hours on the ladder, while Topcliffe vainly urged him to withdraw his accusation.|$|R
60|$|The captain {{manifested}} no displeasure at {{this unexpected}} <b>familiarity,</b> but <b>with</b> suavity as he unmasked the battery, from behind {{which he had}} hitherto carried on his attacks.|$|R
5|$|Risk to {{defensive}} capabilities: Security {{forces are}} not changing armaments annually, and thus small arms manufacturers need civilians as key customers. Crippling of civilian firearms market would likely lead to end of firearms manufacturing in the Czech Republic. At the same time, <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> semi-automatic versions of army rifles by civilians {{is a clear}} defensive advantage in case these {{people need to be}} drafted to defend the country.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor's {{first major}} written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights. As {{her first year}} neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the {{intensity}} and heavy workload of the job. During the oral arguments for National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{central theme}} {{involves}} {{the examination of}} the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49.|$|E
30|$|Faist and Fauser (2011) {{highlight}} {{important changes}} in migration paradigms: they notice {{the desirability of}} temporary labour migration based on the expectation that temporary migrants will constitute no loss in human capital and furthermore transmit {{a higher percentage of}} their income than permanent immigrants. Such temporary labour migration can also help to spread the benefits of migration widely and create <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> destination countries. Temporary labour migration can help Pacific Islanders acquire skills, knowledge and insights that can become crucial when they later have to leave their home countries for good.|$|R
60|$|Meantime, the Woozy had {{approached}} the Sawhorse {{and begun to}} sniff at it. The Sawhorse resented this <b>familiarity</b> and <b>with</b> a sudden kick pounded the Woozy squarely on its head with one gold-shod foot.|$|R
40|$|Early {{childhood}} {{research has}} long established that drawing is a central, and important activity for young children. Less common are {{investigations into the}} drawing activity of adults involved in early childhood. A team of adult early childhood researchers, with differing exposures and <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> drawing, experimented with intergenerational collaborative drawing with colleagues, students, family members and others, to explore the effectiveness of drawing as a research process and as an arts-based methodology. This testing prompted critical thinking into how drawing might facilitate research that involves young children, to operate in more communicable ways, and how research-focused drawings might occur in reference to a research project...|$|R
5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; {{it is likely}} that the character's name was used purely for its <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the public. Shot from a single point of view on a stage set, the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Victorian dancing fairies and elves {{appear in}} much of Tolkien's early poetry, and have {{influence}} upon his later works {{in part due to}} the influence of a production of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan in Birmingham in 1910 and his <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the work of Catholic mystic poet, Francis Thompson which Tolkien had acquired in 1914.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the culture of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E
50|$|Wellek contributed {{insights}} {{he acquired}} from his <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> Russian formalism, the Prague Linguistic Circle, the phenomenology of Roman Ingarden, and {{the movements of}} German Geistesgeschichte and stylistics. Warren’s contributions to the work stemmed from his knowledge of American New Criticism, aesthetics, {{and the history of}} criticism. Harcourt, Brace and Company published Theory of Literature in December 1948 with an imprint of 1949, and {{at the time of the}} publication of Teacher & Critic: Essays by and about Austin Warren, it had been translated into eighteen languages (Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, German, Portuguese, Hebrew, Danish, Serbocroat, modern Greek, Swedish, Rumanian, Finnish, Hindi, Norwegian, Polish, French, and Hungarian, in order).|$|R

5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until}} the 19thcentury that {{interest}} in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates Japanese EFL learners' {{relative}} <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> thirteen catenative verb constructions (henceforth, CVC) {{through an}} analysis of the JEFLL Corpus (Tono, 2007). The results of 4 -gram analyses show that learners tend to use SV, SVC, and SVO patterns in six timed narrative essays. Furthermore, correspondence analysis reveals that learners are mainly familiar with be+ed, be+-ing, like+to-infinitive, and like+-ing. On the other hand, they are unlikely to use the "accusative with infinitive" constructions (Jespersen, 1933, p. 340) such as like+(person/thing) +to -infinitive (SVO). These results suggest that on the basis of four familiar constructions, Tow and intermediate learners at the Japanese university level should gradually enrich their productive catenative verb constructions through pedagogical examples and also use them fluently...|$|R
60|$|The Rosicrucians are {{a people}} I must bring you acquainted with. The best account I know {{of them is}} in a French book call'd 'Le Comte de Gabalis', which both in its title and size is so like a Novel, {{that many of the}} Fair Sex have read it for one by mistake. According to these Gentlemen, the four Elements are {{inhabited}} by Spirits, which they call Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs, and Salamanders. The Gnomes or Dæmons of Earth delight in mischief; but the Sylphs whose habitation is in the Air, are the best-condition'd creatures imaginable. For they say, any mortals may enjoy the most intimate <b>familiarities</b> <b>with</b> these gentle Spirits, upon a condition very easy to all true Adepts, an inviolate preservation of Chastity.|$|R
5|$|Greatly {{expanding}} his <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> {{historical and}} social subjects, Kogălniceanu also {{began work on}} his first volumes: a pioneering study on the Romani people and the French-language Histoire de la Valachie, de la Moldavie et des Valaques transdanubiens ("A History of Wallachia, Moldavia, and of Transdanubian Vlachs", the first volume in a synthesis of Romanian history), {{both of which were}} first published in 1837 inside the German Confederation. He was becoming repulsed by the existence of Roma slavery in his country, and in his study, cited the example of active abolitionists in Western countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} 1950s, Constantine {{supported}} the campaign, led by James, to appoint West Indies cricket's first black captain; {{the success of}} black people like Constantine in attaining government positions while not permitted to captain the cricket team was {{a key factor in}} an ultimately successful campaign. While in government, Constantine assisted {{in the development of the}} West Indies Federation, as a step towards the independence of the islands, and his fame and <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> Britain played some part in the negotiations which led to Trinidad's independence in 1962. After he decided not to stand for re-election in 1961, Williams appointed him as Trinidad and Tobago's first High Commissioner in London.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Old Republic II was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to BioWare's Knights of the Old Republic, and it uses the same Odyssey Engine as the original game. BioWare suggested that Obsidian should be offered the Knights of the Old Republic license due to their <b>familiarity</b> <b>with</b> Obsidian's past work and the good {{relationship between the two}} developers, as well as due to finding LucasArts' development schedule for the sequel to be too tight. The game was released in PC and Xbox versions, but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version, it has multiple unfixed bugs.|$|E
