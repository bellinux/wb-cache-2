Fields such as psychiatry and radiology used to be entered at the registrar stage, but the other registrars would usually have passed part one of a higher qualification, such as a Royal College membership or fellowship before entering that grade. Part two (the complete qualification) was necessary before obtaining a senior registrar post, usually linked to a medical school, but many left <b>hospital</b> <b>practice</b> at this stage rather than wait years to progress to a consultant post.|$|E

In 1952 he was appointed Sir Arthur Sims Commonwealth travelling professor for 1953, visiting Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This was followed by appointments as visiting professor in San Francisco, and at the Montreal Neurological Institute. [...] He was visiting neurologist at Johns Hopkins; an honorary member of both the American Neurological Association and the New York Neurological Association; corresponding member of the Société de Neurologie de Paris; president of both the neurological and psychiatric sections of the Royal Society of Medicine (RSM); and an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. In 1954 he gave the Harveian Oration at the Royal College of Physicians on 18 October and in 1956 was elected president on the Association of British Neurologists. [...] He retired from practice in 1963, moving to Ham, Wiltshire and was elected an honorary fellow of the RSM in 1964. [...] In retirement he enjoyed bird-watching and fly-fishing. [...] He continued to publish, in particular a 1970 edition of his own papers entitled Studies in Neurology. [...] He died in Totteridge, north London on 7 December 1978.|$|E
2500|$|Jardine, one {{of seven}} children, was born in 1784 on a small farm near Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. [...] His father, Andrew Jardine (abt. 1750- d. 1793), {{died when he was}} nine, leaving the family in some {{economic}} difficulty. Though struggling to make ends meet, Jardine's older brother David (1776-1827) provided him with money to attend school. Jardine began to acquire credentials at the age of sixteen. In 1800 he entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School where he took classes in anatomy, medical practice, and obstetrics among others. While his schooling was in progress, Jardine was apprenticed to a surgeon who would provide housing, food, and the essential acquaintance with a <b>hospital</b> <b>practice,</b> with the money his older brother, David, provided. He graduated from the Edinburgh Medical School on 2 March 1802, and was presented a full diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He chose to join the service of the British East India Company and in 1802 at the age of 18 boarded the East Indiaman Brunswick. On 15March, after satisfying the entry requirements, William Jardine, was paid two months advanced wages as a surgeon's mate in the East India Company’s Maritime Marine Service. One advantage of service with the East India Company was that employees were allowed to trade in goods on their own account. Each employee was allowed cargo space equivalent to two chests or about a hundred pounds of cargo. Jardine engaged in this trade with exceptional dexterity, even leasing the apportioned cargo space of other crew members who did not have interest in using the space, and was able to save quite an amount of money.|$|E

60|$|Nearly {{the whole}} of our medical {{profession}} and most of our apparatus for teaching and training doctors subsist on strictly commercial lines by earning fees. This chief source of revenue is eked out by the wanton charity of old women, and conspicuous subscriptions by popularity hunters, and {{a small but growing}} contribution (in the salaries of medical officers of health and so forth) from the public funds.

6000|$|The great {{difficulty}} {{was to keep}} the mothers in bed for ten days, which was the minimum upon which the <b>hospital</b> <b>practice</b> insisted. It was awkward to look after the family, no one would see to the children without payment, and the husband tumbled because his tea was not right when he came home tired from his work and hungry. Philip had heard that the poor helped one another, but woman after woman complained to him that she could not get anyone in to clean up and see to the children's dinner without paying for the service, and she could not afford to pay. By listening to the women as they talked and by chance remarks from which he could deduce much that was left unsaid, Philip learned how little there was in common between the poor and the classes above them. They did not envy their betters, for the life was too different, and they had an ideal of ease which made the existence of the middle-classes seem formal and stiff; moreover, they had a certain contempt for them because they were soft and did not work with their hands. The proud merely wished to be left alone, but the majority looked upon the well-to-do as people to be exploited; they knew what to say in order to get such advantages as the charitable put at their disposal, and they accepted benefits as a right which came to them from the folly of their superiors and their own astuteness. They bore the curate with contemptuous indifference, but the district visitor excited their bitter hatred.

The mothers of 91 healthy, term infants delivered at a university hospital between June 1998 and December 1998, and first seen in the well-child unit within 10 days of delivery, participated in the study. Forty-nine (54 %) infants were exclusively breastfed at 4 months of age. Cox regression analysis showed a negative association between formula supplementation during the hospital stay and duration of exclusive breastfeeding. The median age for starting non–breast milk liquids was 1 month for those who received formula in the hospital and 3 months for those who did not (P =. 001). The <b>hospital</b> <b>practices</b> were more pre-dictive of the duration of exclusive breastfeeding in this study group than mothers’knowledge of infant feeding or psychosocial factors.

6000|$|Unfortunately {{it matters}} not, {{as far as}} {{inheritance}} is concerned, how injurious a quality or structure may be if compatible with life. No one can read the many treatises (12/11. The works which I have read and found most useful are Dr. Prosper Lucas's great work 'Traite de l'Heredite Naturelle' 1847; Mr. W. Sedgwick in 'British and Foreign Medico-Chirurg. Review' April and July 1861 and April and July 1863: Dr. Garrod on Gout is quoted in these articles. Sir Henry Holland 'Medical Notes and Reflections' 3rd edition 1855. Piorry 'De l'Heredite dans les Maladies' 1840. Adams 'A Philosophical Treatise on Hereditary Peculiarities' 2nd edition 1815. Essay on 'Hereditary Diseases' by Dr. J. Steinan 1843. See Paget in 'Medical Times' 1857 page 192 on the Inheritance of Cancer; Dr. Gould in 'Proc. of American Acad. of Sciences' November 8, 1853 gives a curious case of hereditary bleeding in four generations. Harlan 'Medical Researches' page 593.) on hereditary disease and doubt this. The ancients were strongly of this opinion, or, as Ranchin expresses it, Omnes Graeci, Arabes, et Latini in eo consentiunt. A long catalogue could be given {{of all sorts of}} inherited malformations and of predisposition to various diseases. With gout, fifty per cent of the cases observed in <b>hospital</b> <b>practice</b> are, according to Dr. Garrod, inherited, and a greater percentage in private practice. Every one knows how often insanity runs in families, and some of the cases given by Mr. Sedgwick are awful,--as of a surgeon, whose brother, father, and four paternal uncles were all insane, the latter dying by suicide; of a Jew, whose father, mother, and six brothers and sisters were all mad; and in some other cases several members of the same family, during three or four successive generations, have committed suicide. Striking instances have been recorded of epilepsy, consumption, asthma, stone in the bladder, cancer, profuse bleeding from the slightest injuries, of the mother not giving milk, and of bad parturition being inherited. In this latter respect I may mention an odd case given by a good observer (12/12. Marshall quoted by Youatt in his work on 'Cattle' page 284.), in which the fault lay in the offspring, and not in the mother: in a part of Yorkshire the farmers continued to select cattle with large hind-quarters, until they made a strain called [...] "Dutch-buttocked," [...] and [...] "the monstrous size of the buttocks of the calf was frequently fatal to the cow, and numbers of cows were annually lost in calving." ...|$|E
