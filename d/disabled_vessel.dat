25|$|Some days later, West Haven {{came across}} the {{stricken}} British steamer Beechleaf. The 10,000 ton cargo carrier had been in transit from Baton Rouge to Ireland with a cargo of fuel oil when her engines and steering gear were disabled by a fire which killed one crewman and severely burned another. West Haven took the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel</b> in tow to Ambrose Light, arriving 7 June, before continuing on to New York where she berthed the following day.|$|E
25|$|Nearly a {{year later}} in mid October 1928 while coming in across the Richmond bar the Nimbin touched the {{northern}} wall lightly causing the steering gear carried away and some slight damage was done {{to one of the}} plate at the water line. Temporary repairs were affected at Ballina. The steamer proceeded up the river, no tug was available to help the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel</b> and had the accident happened further out the steamer may have become a wreck.|$|E
25|$|An {{emergency}} tow vessel, {{also called}} emergency towing vessel, (ETV) is a multi purpose boat used by state authorities to tow disabled vessels on high seas {{in order to}} prevent dangers to man and environment. The <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel</b> is either towed to a safe haven or kept in place against wind and current until commercial assistance by tug boats has arrived on site or until it has been repaired to the extent of being able to manoeuvre on its own. The need for ETVs as a preventive measure has arisen since the number of available commercial salvage tugs was reduced while potential dangers from individual vessels have increased. E.g. Spain has fourteen, Turkey has eleven, Germany operates eight, Norway has seven, France has five, Sweden three and the Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Iceland and Finland each have one official emergency tug boat. Australia also operates emergency response vessels. The United Kingdom's four strong ETV fleet was to be disbanded in September 2011 due to budget cuts but the two vessels operating in Scottish waters received an extension of contract until the end of 2011.|$|E

60|$|In {{obedience}} to {{orders from the}} repeller, each crab took hold {{of one of the}} <b>disabled</b> <b>vessels,</b> and towed it near the mouth of the harbour, where it was left.|$|R
60|$|A {{few moments}} {{and one of}} those {{overwhelming}} seas which even the inexperienced perceive to be irresistible, roared after the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel.</b> As it reached her she struck again. The billow made a clean sweep over her. Everything was carried away. The boat was overturned, the stout painter snapped, and the crew left struggling in the water.|$|E
60|$|On Sunday evening, {{after two}} days of terrible suspense, a {{temporary}} steering gear was fitted up, and the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel</b> with her distressed crew made for Cork Harbour, steaming with her screw at nine knots an hour. Her flag of distress was sighted at about three o'clock in the afternoon of Tuesday, off the Old Head of Kinsale, and H.M. ship Advice at once steamed out to her assistance and towed her to within a mile of the lighthouse off Cork Harbour by about nine o'clock.|$|E
60|$|Instead {{of giving}} {{any sort of}} aid to the poor shipwrecked crew, Low and his men set to work to plunder their vessel, and they took from it a {{thousand}} pounds in money, and everything of value which they could find on board. Having thus stripped the unfortunate wreck, they departed, leaving the captain and crew of the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel</b> to perish by storm or starvation, unless some other vessel, manned by human beings and not pitiless beasts, should pass their way and save them.|$|E
60|$|Besides the Llangaron, three ironclads {{were now}} {{drifting}} broadside to the sea. But {{there was no}} time to succour <b>disabled</b> <b>vessels,</b> for the rest of the fleet was coming on, and there was great work for the crabs.|$|R
5000|$|Snohomish was {{a regular}} part of the Bering Sea Patrol and {{enforced}} international sealing regulations. Her duties included search and rescue, law enforcement, fisheries patrol, mail delivery to light ships and remote stations, patrolling regattas, and towing <b>disabled</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 1960, Matagorda towed the <b>disabled</b> fishing <b>vessel</b> Wild Goose II.|$|R
60|$|He {{said more}} to the same purpose, {{with the result that}} Bethune secured the contract, and Jimmy left Vancouver with two tugs {{immediately}} afterward. They passed Victoria with the broken-down vessel in fine weather, but that night it began to blow, and the gale that followed lasted a fortnight. What was worse, it blew for the most part straight in from the Pacific, piling a furious surf on shore. Three days after Jimmy left the Strait, the chartered tug put back with engines disabled, badly battered by the gale. Her skipper stated that he had left Jimmy with a broken hawser, hanging on to the collier, which was dragging him to leeward, nearer the dangerous coast. After that an incoming steamer reported having passed a <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel</b> with a tug standing by {{in the middle of a}} furious gale, but although in a dangerous position, she showed no signals and the weather prevented a close approach. Then there was no news for some time.|$|E
60|$|At first sight, {{it might}} seem that all this unusual {{kindness}} was superfluous, and of no avail. This, however, was not really the case, since {{the crew of the}} second schooner was of much real service in forwarding the equipment of the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel.</b> Beaufort has an excellent harbour for vessels of a light draught of water like our two sealers; but the town is insignificant, and extra labourers, especially those of an intelligence suited to such work, very difficult to be had. At the bottom, therefore, Roswell Gardiner found his friendly assistants of much real advantage, the two crews pushing the work before them with as much rapidity as suited even a seaman's impatience. Aided by the crew of his consort, Gardiner got on fast with his repairs, and on the afternoon of the second day after he had entered Beaufort, he was ready to sail once more; his schooner probably in a better state for service than the day she left Oyster Pond.|$|E
60|$|At last, when hope {{had almost}} gone, she reeled in across the smoking Columbia bar one wild morning with her tug ahead, and Jimmy found himself famous {{when he brought}} her safe into harbor. Escaping from the reporters, he went {{off in search of}} coal, and put to sea as soon as he could; but the {{grateful}} captain talked, and the papers made a sensational story of the tow. It appeared that Jimmy had smashed two boats in replacing broken hawsers in a dangerous sea, and had held on to the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel</b> while she drove up {{to the edge of the}} breakers that hammered a rocky coast. Then a sudden shift of wind saved them, but the next night the collier broke adrift, and he spent two days stubbornly searching for her in the haze and spray. She was in serious peril when he found her, but again he towed her clear, and afterward fought a long, stern fight that seemed bound to be a losing one against the fury of the sea.|$|E
50|$|Among her various duties were {{search and}} rescue of lost or <b>disabled</b> <b>vessels</b> and icebreaking {{assistance}} during the cold winter months.

60|$|In {{years and}} years no sailing vessel has {{attempted}} this traverse, and we found ourselves {{in the midst of}} one of the loneliest of the Pacific solitudes. In the sixty days we were crossing it we sighted no sail, lifted no steamer's smoke above the horizon. A <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel</b> could drift in this deserted expanse for a dozen generations, {{and there would be no}} rescue. The only chance of rescue would be from a vessel like the Snark, and the Snark happened to be there principally because of the fact that the traverse had been begun before the particular paragraph in the sailing directions had been read. Standing upright on deck, a straight line drawn from the eye to the horizon would measure three miles and a half. Thus, seven miles was the diameter of the circle of the sea in which we had our centre. Since we remained always in the centre, and since we constantly were moving in some direction, we looked upon many circles. But all circles looked alike. No tufted islets, gray headlands, nor glistening patches of white canvas ever marred the symmetry of that unbroken curve. Clouds came and went, rising up over the rim of the circle, flowing across the space of it, and spilling away and down across the opposite rim.|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} that these {{hopes and fears}} were all realized, and nearly at the same time. A shot struck the ship, producing a great shock, and throwing all on board into terrible consternation. It damaged the rigging, bringing down the rent sails and broken cordage to the deck, and thus stopped the vessel's way. At the same moment some French vessels came in sight, and, {{as soon as they}} understood the case, bore down full sail to rescue the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel.</b> The pursuers, changing suddenly their pursuit to flight, altered their course and moved slowly away. The storm, however, increased, and, preventing them from making the harbor of Dieppe, drove them along the shore, threatening every moment to dash them upon the rocks and breakers. At length the queen's vessel succeeded in getting into a rocky cove, where they were sheltered from the winds and waves, and found a chance to land. The queen ordered out the boat, and was set ashore with her attendants on the rocks. She climbed over them, wet as they were with the dashing spray, and slippery with sea weed. The little party, drenched with the rain, and exhausted and forlorn, wandered along the shore till they came to a little village of fishermen's huts. The queen went into the first wretched cabin which offered itself, and lay down upon the straw in the corner for rest and sleep.|$|E
60|$|This opinion very {{accurately}} described {{that which}} followed. In ten minutes it was blowing heavily, {{in a direction}} nearly opposite to that which had been the previous current of the wind. As a matter of course, the Sea Lion of the Vineyard drew off the land, wallowing through the meeting billows that still came rolling in from the broad Atlantic; while the Sea Lion of Oyster Pond tended to the new currents of air, and rode, as it might be, suspended between the two opposing forces, {{with little or no}} strain on her cables. Gardiner expected to see his consort stand out to sea, and gain an offing; but, instead of this, Captain Daggett brought his schooner quite near to the <b>disabled</b> <b>vessel,</b> and anchored. This act of neighbourly kindness was too unequivocal to require explanation. It was the intention of the Vineyard men to lie by their consort until she was relieved from all apprehensions of danger. The 'butt-end' of the 'nor'-wester' was too large to admit of intercourse until next morning, when that which had been a small gale had dwindled to a good steady breeze, and the seas had gone down, leaving comparatively smooth water all along the coast. The line of white water which marked the breakers was there, and quite visible; but it no longer excited apprehension. The jury-masts on board the disabled craft were got up, and what was very convenient, just at that moment, the wreck came floating out on the ebb, so near to her as to enable the boats to secure all the sails and most of the rigging. The main-boom, too, an excellent spar, was towed alongside and saved.|$|E
