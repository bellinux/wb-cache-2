40|$|Ground-to-space laser uplinks to Earthorbiting {{satellites}} and deep space probes serve {{both as a}} beacon and an uplink command channel for deep space probes and <b>Earth-orbiting</b> <b>satellites.</b> An acquisition and tracking point design to support a high bandwidth downlink from a 20 -cm optical terminal on an orbiting Mars spacecraft typically calls for 2. 5 kW of 1030 -nm uplink optical power in 40 micro-radians divergent beams. 2 The NOHD (nominal ocular hazard distance) of the 1030 nm uplink is in excess of 2 E 5 km, approximately half {{the distance to the}} moon.

50|$|Tony Hale, skilled {{engineer}} and amateur radio ham, smuggles a home-made transceiver on board an <b>Earth-orbiting</b> <b>satellite</b> during his tour of duty.

To back up this demand, he begins destroying swathes of the Earth's surface using a radiation beam. The only secure link between the Earth and the satellite is Tony's radio.|$|E
