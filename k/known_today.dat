5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} the Arabian {{peninsula}} <b>known</b> <b>today</b> as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use the camel, approximately 4,000–5,000years ago.

Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is <b>known</b> <b>today</b> only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E

5|$|As {{threats to}} bird populations grow and extinctions continue, {{historical}} specimens are valuable in documenting {{the impacts of}} human activities and causes of decline for threatened species.

5|$|Early in January 1864, the Yavapai raided {{a number}} of ranches that {{supplied}} cattle to the miners in the Prescott and Agua Fria area.
