He became a detective chief superintendent in March, 1985, when he joined the elite <b>International</b> and <b>Organised</b> <b>Crime</b> Squad (SO1).|$|R
40|$|Key points o Between 2000 and 2012 over 1, 000 police {{stations}} {{have been closed}} in the UK and many more have been placed on reduced opening hours. A similar situation is unfolding in Northern Ireland and Eire. This {{may be viewed as}} a strategic and operational withdrawal from the current concept of rural policing. This closure trend has significantly altered the landscape of rural policing in the UK. o In the same period, the landscapes of rural crime and criminality have also changed in {{that there has been a}} noticeable increase in the levels of the organisation of indigenous and <b>international</b> serious and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups involved in committing rural crimes. In short crime is becoming more entrepreneurial. The increase of rural crimes such as the theft of farm machinery and tools; livestock; and unregulated butchery practices, evidences the danger that serious and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups pose to rural areas as they expand their criminal activities in the current economic recession. It does appear that Eastern European <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups are targeting the UK by stealing tractors and other items of heavy plant for resale in Europe and on the African subcontinent. There is evidence that British based <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups are also becoming more organised at exploiting criminal opportunities in rural areas...|$|R
40|$|Insidious, multi-dimensional {{forms of}} <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> embody {{one of the}} most extreme forms of {{illegality}} often believed to bedevil Greece. Additionally spurred by the intensification of <b>international</b> attention upon <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> over the last twenty years, this issue has become a prominent public concern in Greece, alongside –if sometimes overshadowed by– domestic political violence, foreign affairs, immigration, and corruption. Nevertheless, just as in other jurisdictions regionally and internationally, the evolution of policy in Greece has seen questions raised about the appropriate definition and measurement of <b>organised</b> <b>crime.</b> As has been the case in other countries, Greece has seen official strategies to counter <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> shaped and, more importantly, limited, as much by what they have included as by what they have left out; high-level corruption and white collar crime being key examples of the latter. Equally, Greece has also seen the unfurling of official strategies to counter <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> whose priorities have had very little logical basis in empirical assessments, and have been far more significantly structured by the content and styles of domestic and international policy dogmas, themselves produced by quite different priorities and assessments. Indeed, the discussion of the Greek case presented here does not suggest any significant aberration from the international trend in which the problematisation of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> has been overwhelmingly determined by political, rather than expert, pressures. Yet, indicative of the preponderantly legal more than sociological character of sociolegal scholarship in Greece, the socio-political context that has conditioned the problematisation of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in the country has rarely been subjected to systematic analysis. The review presented in this article of the challenges faced in defining and assessing the threat posed by <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in Greece is therefore offered as a synoptic contribution towards this end...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this article}} is on one hand to {{identify}} the basic challenges and threats as regards the security policy of the countries which have been lately incorporated into the structures of the EU {{and on the other hand}} to determine the basic reasons of a socio-political nature for the difficulties in this cooperation. The cooperation should be based on the concept of security “to something ” and it should be to a greater extent directed at the Eastern neighbors of Poland in order to eliminate from the political thinking and the political activity the syndrome of Poland regarded as a border country. Key words: security and subregional cooperation, institutional cooperation, challenges, threats, economic disparities, <b>international</b> migrations, multiculturalism, <b>organised</b> <b>crime.</b> INTRODUCTION. The discussion concerning security centres around two of its aspects: an internal and external one. The internal security usually means homeostasis, harmoniousness of a given individual or group subject whereas the external security is defined as the lack of threat on the part of other subjects. Obviously different problems appear when we define the sense of security in purely psychological terms, when the perception of threats can remain in variou...|$|R
