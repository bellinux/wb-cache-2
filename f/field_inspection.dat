25|$|Aughanduff was {{probably}} first {{settled in the}} Bronze Age. No prehistoric remains of note appear {{to survive in the}} area, however, bar an undated site listed on the Northern Ireland Environment Agency's Monuments and Buildings Record. This is thought to have been an enclosure 60m in diameter, set on a localised height within the townland at Irish Grid Reference H9736023370. Photographic records show a series of earthworks and although a <b>field</b> <b>inspection</b> in 2004 failed to locate upstanding remains, it is noted that the site would have been an excellent position for a settlement. The townland lies just over a mile (2km) from An Aughnaclough mullion, where in 1815 the first, and reportedly most remarkable, megalith tomb in Ireland (subsequently destroyed) was discovered by Mr. John Bell of Newry. Several prehistoric stone structures have been found and documented in the area but many have been lost over the years. An example of such a structure was a ring fort named 'the Lis' which appears on the map of 1827 as being in the field adjacent to where the Church now stands, however this structure is no longer visible and must be presumed to have been destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract approved: Signature {{redacted}} for privacy. Chris A. Bell The {{evaluation of}} pavement condition {{is an important}} part of pavement management. To evaluate a pavement, a distress survey has been performed mainly by manual <b>field</b> <b>inspections.</b> Several automatic pavement evaluation systems have been developed to overcome the drawbacks of <b>field</b> <b>inspections.</b> Automated evaluation systems, however, imply their own limitations in terms of cost, technical problems, and adaptability for pavement management. The main purpose of this research is to develop a low-cost automatic pavement video imaging system. The secondary purpose is the development of techniques to process the collected video images. A low-cost video image-collection system and an in-office system were developed. A video test was implemented on a selected route including various pavement types and several variables. As a result of the test, seven loop tests provided acceptabl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Kashkan River is an {{important}} branch of Karkheh River. The water basin of this river up to Poledokhtar station is 9400 km 2. After passing 270 km and confluence with Seymareh River at western south of Poledokhtar city, the river (which is now called Karkheh River) flows toward Karkheh Dam. This river due to its morphological characteristics includes various meandering and braiding reaches. Bank erosion at the meanders damages valuable agricultural lands and aggravates the danger of floods. The knowledge of the river behavior is useful for its training. To study the periodic changes of the river plan form, topographic maps and satellite photos were compared together and <b>field</b> <b>inspections</b> accomplished. For determining the meanders characteristics and their development rates, numerous <b>field</b> <b>inspections</b> were done and satellite photos used. On the basis of geometric characteristics of the meanders and using empirical relations, the rates of bank erosion at critical reaches were predicted and some technical ideas suggested...|$|R
