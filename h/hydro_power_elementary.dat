40|$|Instructor: Tomas Qvickström, M. Sc. (Tech) In a {{deregulated}} electricity market, forecasting the hourly {{price of}} electricity is of high importance for generating companies as they aim to optimise their production more profitably. The key issues in forecasting the hourly price of electricity, spot price, are understanding the market fundamentals and effectively utilising the publicly available market information. One of the fundamentals in the Nordic electricity market is <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> production, as <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> accounts for over 50 {{percent of the}} installed generation capacity in the Nordic countries. <b>Hydro</b> <b>power</b> is a flexible production form that is largely dependent on the uncertain hydrological circumstances. Understanding the essentials of <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> production provides the basis for forecasting it. Models for forecasting <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> production {{can be used in}} forecasting the hourly price of electricity. The objectives of this Thesis are to (1) analyse short-term <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> production, (2) and based on the analysis, to give proposals for forecasting short-term <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> production. The Thesis focuses on Norway. The <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> production system in Norway is presented and the flexibility of the production system in different areas of Norway is assessed. Literature on <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> scheduling provides the theoretical background of the Thesis. Based on the theoretical background, publicly available productio...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} within both the economics and power system engineering literature that <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> {{can act as a}} complement to large amounts of intermittent energy.

This paper attempts to extend that literature by describing the effects of cross-border wind and <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> interaction in a day- ahead "spot" market. I use simple econometric distributed lag models with data from the Nordic electricity market and a sample of Norwegian <b>hydro</b> <b>power</b> plants with water storage magazines.
