5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he {{made no effort to}} integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz was not able to support or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in <b>her</b> <b>dance</b> routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.|$|E

Esther Anil was confirmed to reprise her role as the younger sister. Kruthika Jayakumar, a 17-year-old science student from Bangalore, was selected to play the role of elder sister in the film. This happened when a Malayalam filmmaker visited <b>her</b> <b>dance</b> performance in Thiruvananthapuram, and was struck by her expressions and photogenic features. He suggested that she pursue a career in the film industry. She referred to her character as a simple and vulnerable girl, who gets exploited.

50|$|As one of {{the pioneers}} of modern dance in America, Ruth St Denis also {{explored}} Orientalism in <b>her</b> dancing. <b>Her</b> <b>dances</b> were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe. Yet, the exoticism of <b>her</b> <b>dances</b> catered to the interests of society women in America. She included Radha and The Cobras in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, The Nautch in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, Egypta. Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with Ishtar of the Seven Gates in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.|$|R
