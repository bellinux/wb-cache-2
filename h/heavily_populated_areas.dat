Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction currently, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled.|$|E
5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E

25|$|Earthquakes {{that caused}} the {{greatest}} loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> or the ocean, where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, California {{suffered}} from an extended drought, {{and there was}} considerable discussion and debate about how much water each water district was entitled to receive from the Colorado River and its tributaries. As a result, several organizations negotiated an agreement for water rights for their associated districts: the San Diego County Water Authority, the Coachella Valley Water District, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The agreement was a compromise that divided available water resources between the environmentally fragile Imperial Valley and the more <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> of Southern California.|$|E
50|$|An urban {{stream is}} a {{formerly}} natural waterway that flows through a <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>area.</b> Urban streams are often polluted by urban runoff and combined sewer outflows.

25|$|Many early towns covered {{very large}} amounts of land. Once areas had become settled, new towns were {{sometimes}} formed by breaking areas away from the original existing towns. This was an especially common practice during the 18th and early 19th centuries. More <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> were often subdivided on multiple occasions. As a result, towns and cities in urbanized areas are often smaller in terms of land area than an average town in a rural area. Formation of new towns in this manner slowed in the later part of the 19th century and {{early part of the}} 20th century, however. It has not taken place anywhere in New England in the last fifty years; boundary changes of any type are fairly rare.|$|E
25|$|Around 80% of Pakistan's {{population}} speak {{one or more}} of {{the various}} Indo-Aryan languages. Usually concentrated in the <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> east of the Indus river, the Indo-Aryan languages and their cultures form the predominant cultural group in the country. They derive their roots from the Sanskrit language of Aryan invadors and are later heavily influenced by the languages of the later Muslim arrivals (i.e., Turkish, Persian, and Arabic), and are all written in a variant of either the Arabic or Nastaliq script. Urdu, the country's national language, is an Indo-Aryan tongue. Punjabi, Hindko and Seraiki, all mutually intelligible, are classified by linguists as dialects of an Indo-Aryan speech called Lahnda, also spelled as Lehnda. These are also, to a lesser extent, mutually intelligible with Urdu. Added together, speakers of these mutually-intelligible languages make up nearly two-thirds of Pakistan's population. Sindhi is the common language of the people of Sindh in southern Pakistan and has a rich literary history of its own, traced back to the era of the early Arab arrivals. The Dardic languages of Gilgitâ€“Baltistan, Azad Kashmir and the northwestern mountains are sometimes classified by many linguists as belonging to the Indo-Aryan family. Other Indo-Aryan languages include Gujarati, Kutchi, Memoni and others.|$|E
25|$|North Carolina's party loyalties have {{undergone}} {{a series of}} important shifts {{in the last few}} years: While the 2010 midterms saw Tar Heel voters elect a bicameral Republican majority legislature {{for the first time in}} over a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern swing state in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter's comfortable victory in the state in 1976, the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state in 2008. In the 1990s, Democrat Bill Clinton came within a point of winning the state in 1992 and also only narrowly lost the state in 1996. In the early 2000s, Republican George W. Bush easily won the state by over 12 points, but by 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> such as the Research Triangle, Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville, and Asheville, propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In 2012, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. However, Republican Mitt Romney ultimately eked out a 2-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with Indiana) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Eight New York State highways, one three-digit Interstate Highway and one U.S. Highway {{traverse}} {{the city of}} Buffalo. New York State Route 5, {{commonly referred to as}} Main Street within the city, enters through Lackawanna as a limited-access highway and intersects with Interstate 190, a north-south highway connecting Interstate 90 in the southeastern suburb of Cheektowaga with Niagara Falls. NY 354 (Clinton Street) and NY 130 (Broadway) are east to west highways connecting south and downtown Buffalo to the eastern suburbs of West Seneca and Depew. NY 265 (Delaware Avenue) and NY 266 (Niagara Street and River Road) both start in downtown Buffalo and end in the city of Tonawanda. One of three U.S. highways in Erie County, the other two being U.S. 20 (Transit Road) and U.S. 219 (Southern Expressway), U.S. 62 (Bailey Avenue) is a north to south trunk road that enters the city through Lackawanna and exits at the Amherst town border at a junction with NY 5. Within the city, the route passes by light industrial developments and high density areas of the city. Bailey Avenue has major intersections with Interstate 190 and the Kensington Expressway. Three major expressways serve the city of Buffalo. The Scajaquada Expressway (NY 198) is primarily a limited access highway connecting Interstate 190 near Unity Island to New York State Route 33, which starts at the edge of downtown and the city's East Side, continues through <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> of the city, intersects with Interstate 90 in Cheektowaga and ends at the airport. The Peace Bridge is a major international crossing near the city's Black Rock district, connecting Buffalo with Fort Erie and Toronto via the Queen Elizabeth Way.|$|E
500|$|The fine {{particulate}} matter produced by car exhaust {{and other human}} sources of pollution forms cloud condensation nuclei, leads {{to the production of}} clouds and increases the likelihood of rain. As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up {{over the course of the}} week, the likelihood of rain increases: it peaks by Saturday, after five days of weekday pollution has been built up. In <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas</b> that are near the coast, such as the United States' Eastern Seaboard, the effect can be dramatic: there is a 22% higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays. The urban heat island effect warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 Â°C (1.1 to 10.1 Â°F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas. This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%. Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between [...] downwind of cities, compared with upwind. Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the early}} 1960s, the U.S. has safely {{conducted}} more than 3,000 shipments of {{spent nuclear fuel}} without any harmful release of radioactive material. This safety record {{is comparable to the}} worldwide experience where more than 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been transported since 1970 â€“ an amount approximately equal to the total amount of spent nuclear fuel that would have been shipped to Yucca Mountain. However, cities were still concerned about the transport of radioactive waste on highways and railroads that may have passed through <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> <b>areas.</b> Dr. Robert Halstead, who was a transportation adviser to the state of Nevada since 1988, stated regarding transportation of the high level waste, [...] "They would heavily affect cities like Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, in the Chicago metropolitan area, in Omaha." [...] "Coming out of the south, the heaviest impacts would be in Atlanta, in Nashville, St. Louis, Kansas City, moving across through Salt Lake City, through downtown Las Vegas, up to Yucca Mountain. And the same cities would be affected by rail shipments as well." [...] Spencer Abraham (DOE) on the other hand has stated, [...] "I think there's a general understanding that we move hazardous materials in this country, an understanding that the federal government knows how to do it safely." ...|$|E
