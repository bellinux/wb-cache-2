40|$|The use of {{imaginary}} {{numbers in}} modelling quantum mechanical systems encompasses the wave-like nature of quantum states. Here we introduce a resource theoretic framework for imaginarity, where the free states {{are taken to}} be those with density matrices that are real {{with respect to a}} fixed basis. This theory is closely related to the resource theory of coherence, as it is basis dependent, and the imaginary numbers appear in the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. Unlike coherence however, the set of physically realizable <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> is identical to both completely resource non-generating operations, and stochastically resource non-generating operations. Moreover, the resource theory of imaginarity does not have a self-adjoint resource destroying map. After introducing and characterizing the <b>free</b> <b>operations,</b> we provide several measures of imaginarity, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for pure state transformations via physically consistent <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> in the single shot regime.

2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} the {{organizing}} model is inappropriate {{to the task of}} unions in the modern global economy. [...] They say that industrial disputes of the type that organising engenders are harmful to the national economies in which they occur: by increasing uncertainty and raising wages (labor costs), they will make economies less attractive to inward investment. Hence, working people will suffer in the long term, as the less investment there is, the fewer jobs there will be. [...] The conclusion of those who take this line is that unions should emphasize their service aspects, particularly those that contribute toward the well-being of the employer as well as the employee. In addition, there are the criticisms leveled by the anti-union Right, who often associate collective action with the tyranny of 'Big labor', contrasted to the <b>free</b> <b>operation</b> of the capitalist labor market.|$|E

40|$|Building upon work by Matsumoto, we {{show that}} the quantum {{relative}} entropy with full-rank second argument is determined by four simple axioms: i) Continuity in the first argument, ii) {{the validity of the}} data-processing inequality, iii) additivity under tensor products, and iv) super-additivity. This observation has immediate implications for quantum thermodynamics, which we discuss. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under reasonable restrictions, the free energy is singled out as a measure of athermality. In particular, we consider an extended class of Gibbs-preserving maps as <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> in a resource-theoretic framework, in which a catalyst is allowed to build up correlations with the system at hand. The free energy is the only extensive and continuous function that is monotonic under such <b>free</b> <b>operations.</b> Comment: 7 page...|$|R
40|$|Any quantum {{resource}} {{theory is}} based on free states and <b>free</b> <b>operations,</b> i. e., states and operations which can be created and performed at no cost. In the resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis, and <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> are those which cannot create coherence for some particular experimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been discussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these problems. As an example for such a problem, a quantum operation can be incoherent in one particular experimental realization, but it still can create large amount of coherence in another. This problem is resolved by the framework of genuine quantum coherence. Here, we investigate this concept further and study other more general sets of operations which cannot create coherence in any experimental realization. We analyze in detail the mathematical structure of this class of maps and use this to study possible state transformations under these operations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely limited, even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework {{does not have a}} unique golden unit, i. e., there is no single state from which all other states can be created deterministically with the <b>free</b> <b>operations.</b> On the other hand, we show that these theories allow for a richer structure in what comes to stochastic manipulation of states. In particular, we determine the optimal probability of conversion among pure states with genuinely incoherent operations. Still, the aforementioned limitations suggest that any reasonably powerful resource theory of coherence must contain <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> which can potentially create coherence in some experimental realization.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of any {{resource}} theory such as entanglement, quantum thermodynamics, quantum coherence, and asymmetry, is to find necessary and sufficient conditions (NSC) that determine whether one resource {{can be converted to}} another by the set of <b>free</b> <b>operations.</b> Here we find such NSC for a large class of quantum resource theories which we call affine resource theories (ART). ARTs include the resource theories of athermality, asymmetry, and coherence, but not entanglement. Remarkably, the NSC can be expressed as a family of inequalities between resource monotones (quantifiers) that are given in terms of the conditional min entropy. The set of <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> is taken to be (1) the maximal set (i. e. consists of all resource non-generating (RNG) quantum channels) or (2) the self-dual set of <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> (i. e. consists of all RNG maps for which the dual map is also RNG). As an example, we apply our results to quantum thermodynamics with Gibbs preserving operations, and several other ARTs. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results to resource theories that are not affine, and along the way, provide the NSC that a quantum resource theory consists of a resource destroying map.
