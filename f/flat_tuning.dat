500|$|Townsend mainly uses Open C tuning {{for both}} six and seven string guitar. He now also uses Open B tuning and Open B <b>flat</b> <b>tuning</b> (Open C tuning tuned {{a half and}} a whole step down respectively) on his six string guitars. Townsend's {{technique}} varies from fingerpicking, power chords and polychords to sweep-picked arpeggios and tapping techniques. He is also known for his heavy use of reverb and delay effects. He has expressed {{that he has no}} taste for shred guitar, saying that [...] "Musically it doesn't do anything for me" [...] and that he only solos when he thinks that he can {{within the context of the}} song.|$|E
5000|$|During the Shit Hits the Sheds Tour in 1994, {{the song}} would be {{introduced}} {{as a new}} song that Newsted wrote and would include an extended jam, that would include {{one of the main}} riffs of [...] "The Outlaw Torn". From 2004 to 2015, it became a regular closing song {{at the end of the}} band's set. From 1983 to 1994, the song was played in E standard tuning. From 1995-2000 and for one show in 2013, it was played in E <b>flat</b> <b>tuning.</b> It was played in D standard tuning from 2000 to 2015. Starting again in 2015, it was played in E <b>flat</b> <b>tuning.</b> When played live, Hetfield (in the past also Newsted) often changes the beginning lyrics [...] "in the city tonight" [...] by replacing [...] "the city" [...] with the name of the town in which they are performing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} first {{played on the}} first date of the [...] "Shit Hits the Sheds" [...] tour (May 30, 1994), it was played in E <b>flat</b> <b>tuning</b> from 1994 to 2006, since 2010 the song has been played in D {{standard}} tuning. It received frequent live performance during the 2012 European Black Album Tour when it was played {{as a part of the}} Black Album.|$|E
5000|$|The Artôt {{episode was}} very fresh in Tchaikovskys {{mind at the}} time he wrote Romeo and Juliet. He could easily have drawn a {{parallel}} between his personal loss and the tragedy of Shakespeare’s drama. Mily Balakirev praised Romeo and Juliets love theme (written in D flat = Des) with an extraordinary choice of words: [...] "... the second D <b>flat</b> <b>tune</b> is delightful ... It is full of tenderness and the sweetness of love ... When I play it I imagine you are lying naked in your bath and that the Artôt-Padilla herself is washing your stomach with hot lather from scented soap". It was Balakirev who had first suggested Tchaikovsky write a Romeo and Juliet piece, in May 1869 (or August). The work (in its first version) was completed on 29 November 1869, just two months after Artôt’s marriage to Padilla.|$|R

50|$|Takeshi {{typically}} plays a double-necked bass/guitar live, {{which allows}} him to drone away on the guitar during longer numbers but quickly switch to bass without needing to switch instruments. He used an Ibanez SG-style model, and a Steinberger Spirit, before acquiring a replica of a rare Rickenbacker double-neck in 2009, custom built by First Act. He previously used a Music Man Stingray bass. Wata uses Gibson Les Paul custom guitars with Orange heads and cabinets, {{as well as a}} Matamp head also favoured by stoner metal groups Sleep and High on Fire and an Ampeg 810 cabinet; Takeshi uses Sunn Model T amps with Marshall 412 cabinet and an Ampeg SVT II bass amp. Wata and Takeshi tune their instruments in a variety of tunings, most of which are lower than standard E tuning (most commonly B <b>flat</b> <b>tuning),</b> often resulting in the range normally associated with Baritone guitars.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a linear cavity erbium-doped fibre laser with a large tuning range of 1509 - 1621 nm. We obtain a 1 dB <b>flat</b> <b>tuning</b> range of 1538 - 1613 nm and a 3 dB tuning range of 1516 - 1621 nm. The {{threshold}} at 1580 nm is 6. 1 mW, the Mope efficiency is 0. 193 and the output power is 18. 2 mW, when 100 mW pump power at 1480 nm is provided.

50|$|A common {{signaling}} {{device is}} a chime unit {{consisting of two}} flat metal bar resonators, which are struck by plungers operated by two solenoids. The <b>flat</b> bars are <b>tuned</b> to two pleasing notes. When the doorbell button is pressed, the first solenoid's plunger strikes one bar, and when the button is released, a spring on the plunger pushes the plunger up, causing it to strike the other bar, creating a two-tone sound ("ding-dong"). If a second doorbell button is used, it is wired to the other solenoid, which strikes {{only one of the}} bars, to create a single-tone ("ding") sound.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2011, radio {{presenter}} Simon Lederman {{revealed that}} Ravenscroft thought the solo {{was out of}} tune. When asked during a live radio interview on BBC Radio London, [...] "What do {{you think when you}} hear sax solo now?" [...] Ravenscroft replied, [...] "I'm irritated because it's out of tune; yeah it's flat; by enough of a degree that it irritates me at best", and admitted he was [...] "gutted" [...] when he heard it played back. He added that he {{had not been able to}} re-record the take, as he was not involved when the song was mixed. The sax track sounds to be about 11 cents <b>flat</b> from standard <b>tuning.</b>|$|R
40|$|Efficient coding {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a first principle explaining neuronal response properties in the central nervous system. The shape of optimal codes, however, strongly depends on the natural limitations of the particular physical system. Here we investigate how optimal neuronal encoding strategies {{are influenced by the}} finite number of neurons N (place constraint), the limited decoding time window length T (time constraint), the maximum neuronal firing rate f(max) (power constraint), and the maximal average rate (f) (max) (energy constraint). While Fisher information provides a general lower bound for the mean squared error of unbiased signal reconstruction, its use to characterize the coding precision is limited. Analyzing simple examples, we illustrate some typical pitfalls and thereby show that Fisher information provides a valid measure for the precision of a code only if the dynamic range (f(min) T, f(max) T) is sufficiently large. In particular, we demonstrate that the optimal width of gaussian tuning curves depends on the available decoding time T. Within the broader class of unimodal tuning functions, {{it turns out that the}} shape of a Fisher-optimal coding scheme is not unique. We solve this ambiguity by taking the minimum mean square error into account, which leads to <b>flat</b> <b>tuning</b> curves. The tuning width, however, remains to be determined by energy constraints rather than by the principle of efficient coding...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} generation of dense stereo ground-truth using a consumer depth sensor such as the Microsoft Kinect. Such ground-truth allows adapta-tion of stereo algorithms to a specific setting. The method uses a novel residual weighting based on error propagation from image plane measurements to 3 D. We use this ground-truth in wide-angle stereo learning by automatically tuning a novel extension of the best-first-propagation (BFP) dense correspondence algorithm. We extend BFP by adding a coarse-to-fine scheme, and a structure measure that limits propagation along linear struc-tures and <b>flat</b> areas. The <b>tuned</b> correspondence algorithm is evaluated in terms of accu-racy, robustness, and ability to generalise. Both the tuning cost function, and the evalu-ation are designed to balance the accuracy-robustness trade-off inherent in patch-based methods such as BFP. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} pricing for bandwidth provisioning over a single link, where users arrive according to a known stochastic tra#c model. The network administrator controls the resource allocation by setting a price at every epoch, and each user's response to the price is governed by a demand function. We formulate this problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and explore two novel pricing schemes [...] -reactive pricing and spot pricing [...] -and compare their performance to appropriately <b>tuned</b> <b>flat</b> pricing. We use a gradient-ascent approach in all the three pricing schemes. We provide methods for computing the unbiased estimates of the gradient in an online (incremental) fashion. Our simulation results show that our novel schemes {{take advantage of the}} known underlying tra#c model and significantly outperform the model-free pricing scheme of flat pricing...|$|R
5000|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only."Blake decided to compose his score to match the key of the Schubert Mass, in order for the music to continue seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to <b>tune</b> <b>flat</b> to match his intended key.|$|R
40|$|As a {{first step}} toward testing the {{proposed}} "Mobius" scheme[1], we used existing CESR elements to collide round, rather than <b>flat,</b> beams. The <b>tune</b> shift parameter, ¸, was inferred from the beam profiles and current, was compared to the tune shift of the coherent beam-beam ß mode, and was corroborated by luminosity measurement. Values of ¸ up to 0 : 09 were achieved without significant lifetime reduction. 1 INTRODUCTION For round beams (ffl x = ffl y = ffl; fi x = fi y = fi ! oe x = oe y = oe), the well known expressions for the tune shift parameter and the luminosity, written in terms of the emittance, ffl = oe 2 =fi, become ¸ = r e 4 ßflef I ffl; L = I 2 4 ße 2 f fi ffl = fl er e ¸I fi; (1) where I is the current per beam. For a given ¸, L for a round beam is twice as large as for a flat beam; moreover, there is hope of achieving higher values of ¸ with a round beam[2]. For dissimilar beams, equation (1) for the luminosity becomes L = I + I [...] ...|$|R
50|$|About {{four feet}} in length, its design {{consists}} of a large resonator (kudam) carved and hollowed out of a log (usually of jackfruit wood), a tapering hollow neck (dandi) topped with 24 brass or bell-metal frets set in scalloped black wax on wooden tracks, and a tuning box culminating in a downward curve and an ornamental dragon's head (yali).If the veena is built from {{a single piece of}} wood it is called (Ekantha) veena. A small table-like wooden bridge (kudurai) - about 2 x 2½ x 2 inches - is topped by a convex brass plate glued in place with resin. Two rosettes, formerly of ivory, now of plastic or horn, are on the top board (palakai) of the resonator. Four main playing strings tuned to the tonic and the fifth in two octaves (for example, B flat-E flat below bass clef - B flat- E flat in bass clef) stretch from fine tuning connectors attached {{to the end of the}} resonator across the bridge and above the fretboard to four large-headed pegs in the tuning box. Three subsidiary drone strings tuned to the tonic, fifth, and upper tonic (E flat - B flat- E <b>flat</b> in the <b>tuning</b> given above) cross a curving side bridge leaning against the main bridge, and stretch on the player's side of the neck to three pegs matching those of the main playing strings. All seven strings today are of steel, with the lower strings either solid thick.|$|R
6000|$|He had {{not been}} very well that morning, {{suffering}} from some difficulty in breathing, and had not preached in consequence; she was not surprised, therefore, that he was nearly silent at luncheon, still less that he made no allusion to Will Ladislaw. For her own part {{she felt that she}} could never again introduce that subject. They usually spent apart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon in the library dozing chiefly, and Dorothea in her boudoir, where she was wont to occupy herself with some of her favorite books. There was a little heap of them on the table in the bow-window--of various sorts, from Herodotus, which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to her old companion Pascal, and Keble's [...] "Christian Year." [...] But to-day opened one after another, and could read none of them. Everything seemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus--Jewish antiquities--oh dear!--devout epigrams--the sacred chime of favorite hymns--all alike were as <b>flat</b> as <b>tunes</b> beaten on wood: even the spring flowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon clouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which had become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future days in which she would still live with them for her sole companions. It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual effort demanded by her married life. She was always trying to be what her husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she was. The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have, seemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted and not shared by her husband {{it might as well have}} been denied. About Will Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first, and it had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed Dorothea's strong feeling about his claims on the family property, by her being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the wrong, but that she was helpless. This afternoon the helplessness was more wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could be dear to her, and to whom she could be dear. She longed for work which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb, where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would never see the light. Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and seen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and fellowship--turning his face towards her as he went.|$|R
