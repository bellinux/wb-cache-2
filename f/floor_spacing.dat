On a 27 ha site, the plan provided for 11 residential plots, each made up of 5 to 7 blocks, built around communal squares and courtyards, with water features accentuating the closeness of the River Lea. Each of the 67 blocks is of between 8 and 12 storeys high, nominally laid out: Street level of mostly three storey townhouses, with front doors on street level to create an [...] "active frontage". These are supplemented by a mix of single to three storey shops and offices. Floor 3 and above in the centre of the complex are communal raised gardens, which hide carparks beneath. At and above this level are a mix of low cost and private residential apartments, ranging from studio to five bedroom.

The three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations along with the momentum and continuity equations were solved using the FLUENT code for obtaining the velocity and pressure field.

30|$|One such {{mechanism}} is for NBA teams to employ strategies associated with substituting weaker players for stronger ones when they hold various leads, e.g., {{to allow their}} best players to rest or avoid injury, manage <b>floor</b> <b>spacing</b> and offensive/defensive combinations, etc., and then reverse the process when the other team leads. In this way, a team will play more weakly when it leads, and more strongly when it is losing, because of personnel changes alone rather than changes in morale or effort. If teams have different thresholds for making such substitutions, and differently skilled best players, the averaging across these differences would produce the smooth pattern observed in the data. Such substitutions are indeed common in basketball games, while football and hockey teams are inherently less able to alter their effective team skill through such player management, which may explain the restoring force’s presence in NBA games and its absence in CFB, NFL or NHL games. It {{would be interesting to}} determine whether college basketball games exhibit the same restoring force, and the personnel management hypothesis could be tested by estimating the on-court team’s skill as a function of lead size.|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} for the {{structural}} system for tall buildings, called the “Tubed Mega Frame”, {{has been developed}} by Tyréns AB. The structure consists of several hollow reinforced concrete columns at {{the perimeter of the}} building and at certain levels, the columns are tied together with perimeter walls. Together they carry all the vertical and lateral loads. A purpose of the new concept is to eliminate the core {{in the center of the}} building which allows utilizing more <b>floor</b> <b>spacing</b> compared with other skyscrapers. This kind of structure has never been examined before and thus never been designed for such a large building. In this thesis the vertical hollow concrete columns are designed according to the American concrete design code, ACI 318. A literature study on reinforced concrete columns has been investigated, where the goal was to identify the most critical design aspects for columns in high rise structures, especially utilizing high strength concrete. Since this kind of structure never has been designed before, an evaluation of the ACI 318 has been performed to check if it is possible to design the hollow reinforced columns in the Tubed Mega Frame according to this design code. The loads and forces used for the design were extracted from a global finite element model in ETABS of a concept prototype of 800 meter. The design process consisted of design calculations according to the ACI 318, a buckling analysis in SAP 2000 and a non-linear FE-analysis in ATENA. For the buckling analysis in SAP 2000 the lower region of the building was isolated between two main perimeter walls. The model was modified several times to analyze how sensitive the structure was to buckling, with regard to different wall thicknesses, cracked cross-sections, openings in the columns and the dependency of intermediate perimeter walls. The non-linear analysis in ATENA focused on a single hollow column between two perimeter walls in the lower regions of the building. Two models were created, one with a full wall thickness and one with a reduced wall thickness where the ultimate capacity and failure behavior of the columns were investigated. The ultimate capacity of the sections designed by hand calculations and analyzed in ATENA were found to be brittle failure modes. To achieve a more ductile failure, an alternative reinforcement geometry with confining reinforcement has been proposed. The results from the design shows that the structure is redundant against buckling, even with reduced bending stiffness and without intermediate perimeter walls. From the analysis in ATENA, the results demonstrated that the columns are capable of carrying all the ultimate loads even if the wall thickness is reduced by 50 %, and that it is possible to use the ACI 318 to design the reinforced concrete columns. However, an unexpected brittle failure occurred in the flanges of the column corners in the tensile region were shear lag may affect the behavior and caused the premature failure. A deductive conclusion has been drawn which states that proper confinement will be critical to achieve a ductile failure behavior even in the tensile region, which will require further studies in order to fully understand the behavior. Even though the results show that it was possible to reduce the cross-sectional thickness of the columns, more studies have to be performed to evaluate if the global structure fulfills the requirements with the decrease in column wall thickness.  Ett nytt strukturellt koncept för skyskrapor har utvecklats av Tyréns AB, "Tubed Mega Frame", där strukturen består av flera ihåliga armerade betongpelare i utkanten som hålls samman med omslutande tvärväggar, och tillsammans bär de alla vertikala och laterala laster. Denna typ av konstruktion har aldrig analyserats eller utformats tidigare. I detta examensarbete är de vertikala ihåliga betongpelarna dimensionerade enligt den amerikanske byggnormen, ACI 318 och de kritiska aspekterna med att utforma ett höghus i höghållfast betong med ihåliga pelare undersökts. Eftersom denna typ av konstruktion aldrig tidigare utformats, har en utvärdering av ACI 318 genomförts för att kontrollera om det är möjligt att dimensionera de ihåliga vertikala pelarna i Tubed Mega Frame enligt denna norm. De laster och krafter som används för dimensioneringen extraherades ur en global finit elementmodell för en konceptbyggnad på 800 meter i ETABS. Den dimensionerande processen bestod av dimensioneringsberäkningar enligt ACI 318, en knäckningsanalys i SAP 2000 och en icke-linjär FEM-analys i ATENA. För knäckningsanalysen i SAP 2000 isolerades en sektion i den nedre regionen av byggnaden, mellan två omslutande tvärväggar. Modellen ändrades flera gånger för att analysera hur känslig konstruktionen var med hänsyn till knäckning, och de ändringar som gjordes var: minskning av väggtjocklekar, reducering för spruckna tvärsnitt, öppningar i pelarna samt de omslutande mellanliggande tvärväggarnas inverkan på knäckningen av konstruktionen. Den icke-linjära analysen i ATENA fokuserade på en pelare mellan två omslutande tvärväggar i den lägre regionen av byggnaden. Två modeller skapades, en med en full väggtjocklek och en med en reducerad väggtjocklek för att analysera brottbeteendet och verifiera den handberäknade kapaciteten enligt ACI 318. De brottmoder som påträffades för tvärsnittsverifikationen i ATENA var spröda och karakteriserades med krossning av betongen, och för att uppnå ett mer segt brott härleddes en alternativ armeringsgeometri med sammanhållande armeringsbyglar i de mest kritiska regionerna av pelarna. Resultaten visade att konstruktionen är robust mot knäckning, även med minskad böjstyvhet och utan mellanliggande omslutande tvärväggar. Av analysen i ATENA visade resultaten att pelarna är kapabla att bära alla de kritiska lasterna även om väggtjockleken reduceras med 50 % och att det är möjligt att använda ACI 318 som norm för dimensionering av pelarna i Tubed Mega Frame. Dock inträffade ett oväntat sprött brott i den dragna flänsen i nedre regionen av pelaren, framförallt koncentrerat till hörnen. Anledningen till det spröda brottet har utvärderats och analyserats där hypotesen är att flänsskjuvning i kombination med höga spänningskoncentrationerna i hörnen orsakar det lokala brottbeteendet i flänsen. Slutsatsen som baseras på hypotesen är att sammanhållande armeringsbyglar skulle vara avgörande för att uppnå ett segt brottbeteende även för den dragna flänsen. Även om resultaten visade att det var möjligt att reducera tvärsnittstjockleken för pelarna, krävs mer studier för att utvärdera om den globala konstruktionen uppfyller kraven för en minskning av pelarnas väggtjocklekar. ...|$|E
