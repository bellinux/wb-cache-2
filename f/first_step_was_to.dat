5|$|Marshall and Nichols began {{assembling}} the resources they would need. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> obtain {{a high priority}} rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although {{there was also a}} special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Rubinstein's <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{found the}} Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were {{to educate people}} in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to {{a considerable amount of}} Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> secure {{retirement}} benefits for custodians throughout the state. In 1928, {{just a year}} after CSEA formed, the union helped push through SB 551, which allowed school districts to establish {{retirement benefits}} for all school employees, not just teachers. More importantly, it became the first law on the books recognizing school employees other than teachers and administrators.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Dix {{helped raise}} funds for the {{national}} monument to deceased soldiers at Fortress Monroe. Following the war, she resumed her crusade to improve the care of prisoners, the disabled, and the mentally ill. Her <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> review the asylums and prisons in the South to evaluate the war damage to their facilities.|$|E
25|$|Through {{more than}} 70 {{years as a}} {{functional}} but neglected government building, the Palace fell into disrepair. After Hawaii became a state, Governor John A. Burns began an effort to restore the palace in the 1960s. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> move the former Iolani Barracks building from its original position northeast of the palace. It now serves as a visitors center for the palace.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> connect Buenos Aires and the Fortines (fortresses) with {{telegraph}} lines. The government {{signed a}} peace treaty with chieftain Juan José Catriel. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain Namuncurá and 3,500 warriors, he attacked Tres Arroyos, Tandil, Azul, and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and Namuncurá's forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, and drove off 300,000 head of cattle.|$|E

25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} change could have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing {{a great deal to}} lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> stop the built-in inflationary process, but to do it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E
25|$|The Church of the Presidents is {{the last}} {{remaining}} structure associated with all seven presidents who vacationed in Long Branch. In 1999 the Long Branch Historical Museum Association began fundraising efforts to save the building. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> stabilize the building {{to prevent it from}} collapsing. The wood flooring was removed and reinforced concrete was poured to support the building. Steel supports replaced wooden pilasters that had deteriorated. The stained-glass windows, original altar, organ, and handmade pews were removed and put in storage during renovation.|$|E
25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow {{out of the}} water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water-tight doors were then closed and {{the water in the}} dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|E

25|$|During the {{communist}} era, travelling to the West {{was a long}} process for Hungarian citizens. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> obtain an invitation, preferably from a relative {{in the country to}} be visited, and a promise of full financial support. With such an invitation, and assuming he could get a passport, a Hungarian could travel westwards once a year. However, in the absence of such an invitation, he could travel to the West only once every three years. The Communist-era visa restrictions restricted Hungarian artists and musicians since it hindered their ability to travel abroad. As a result, many chose to leave Hungary and settle in the West, such as famed cellist János Starker, who emigrated to the United States in 1948 because it was impossible for him to tour abroad with a Hungarian passport.|$|E
25|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, {{community interest}} in local football {{was at an}} all-time high and the Pro League garnered praise for its development of homegrown professional footballers. As a result, the league implemented a series of marketing plans in 2006 to establish itself as a viable professional league. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> increase league membership back to ten teams with the arrivals of Joe Public, South Starworld Strikers, and Superstar Rangers. The Pro League also established its reserve league in 2007 for players that were previously on the bench during league matches to have a league of their own to show scouts their skills on the field. Each member of the Pro League can have their respective reserve team participate in the under-18 league.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, 118 of the 227 of Hubertia's living {{members were}} men in {{forestry}} (~1/2). Of these 118, 83 held {{a state or}} private forestry office {{in the area of}} what is Baden-Württemberg today, formed by combining the former states Baden and Württemberg during the post-war area in 1952. Hence, as there were roughly 240 forestry offices in the area of Baden-Württemberg in 1920, Hubertia had members managing about 1/3 of all the forestry offices in today's state borders. Köhler wanted to minimize this high number of Huberten. His <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> establish a so-called Numerus clausus for forestry in Freiburg and determined personally about a prospective student's admission in person. During the following ten years, Köhler's selection had its effect on Hubertia's influence: While the fraternity provided 37 prospective forestry officers in 1920, the number fell to only six in 1938.|$|E

25|$|Dashwood {{found out}} that there were three privateers at Mariel, a little west of Havana, and {{decided to try to}} capture them. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> send in Bacchantes boats to take a round tower that was {{protecting}} the harbour. The tower stood 40' high, had three 24-pounders on its top, loopholes for muskets around its circumference, and had a garrison of a captain and 30 men. The attack commenced in the evening of 5 April, with the British capturing the fort despite heavy fire. The 13 British seamen and marines suffered one man wounded before they landed; the Spanish had two killed and three wounded. Leaving a sergeant and six marines to guard the prisoners, the boats then headed into the harbour. There they discovered that the privateers had left the day before. Still, despite heavy small-arms fire, the British succeeded in bringing out two schooners carrying sugar.|$|E
25|$|Social {{problems}} on annexed territory were {{discussed in the}} cabinet meeting on December 22, 1939. The interior minister, Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, {{who was responsible for}} questions of common goods, health service and social policy, proposed a solution based on unification. The Minister for Upper Country, Andor Jaross, disagreed with this solution and proposed providing the Czechoslovak welfare system for those in the annexed areas for a transitional period, but had no objections to decreasing it to the Hungarian level. The cabinet finally agreed on a compromise. The elimination of Czechoslovak laws from annexed territory was understood as a duty, but {{it had to be done}} step by step. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> decrease the value of a retirement pension from its Czechoslovak value (150 pengő) to its Hungarian value (60 pengő) through a transition value of 120 pengő. Sickness insurance for workers in agriculture was preserved in the form of Czechoslovak regulation for the moment, but it was changed from compulsory to voluntary. In Slovakia, the Czechoslovak system of welfare was preserved after the break-up of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|In most households, cooking {{was done}} on an open hearth {{in the middle of}} the main living area, to make {{efficient}} use of the heat. This was the most common arrangement, even in wealthy households, for most of the Middle Ages, where the kitchen was combined with the dining hall. Towards the Late Middle Ages a separate kitchen area began to evolve. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> move the fireplaces towards the walls of the main hall, and later to build a separate building or wing that contained a dedicated kitchen area, often separated from the main building by a covered arcade. This way, the smoke, odors and bustle of the kitchen could be kept out of sight of guests, and the fire risk lessened. Few medieval kitchens survive as they were [...] "notoriously ephemeral structures".|$|E

500|$|General Douglas MacArthur {{arrived in}} Australia on 17 March, and was {{appointed}} Supreme Commander {{of the newly}} established South West Pacific Area (SWPA) on 18 April. [...] Ultra intelligence picked up Japanese plans for an overland advance on 19 May, and on 9 June he informed the commander of Allied Land Forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey, that the evidence was mounting that the Japanese might attempt to attack Port Moresby overland from Buna via Kokoda. On 20 June, Blamey ordered Brigadier Basil Morris, {{the commander of the}} 8th Military District, in charge of all the troops in Papua and New Guinea, to prevent such an attempt. In the wake of the Battle of Midway on 6 June, MacArthur began planning to recapture Rabaul. On 15 July, the Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered {{the first phase of the}} advance, the capture of Guadalcanal, despite MacArthur's warning that inadequate aircraft, airbases and shipping resources on hand made the operation extremely risky. A <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> secure the Buna area, where airfields could be established from whence the Japanese bases could be attacked without aircraft having to overfly the Owen Stanley Range.|$|E
