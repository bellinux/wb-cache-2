Producer Daniel Lanois said, [...] "it was a long jam, and there was just this one section of it that had some kind of magic to it, and we just decided to turn it into something." [...] Producer Brian Eno edited the jam down to the end length. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "it started off as an exercise in playing together with a kind of mood and a place in mind. And it really, for me, it brought me there, it really did succeed as an experiment." [...] Lanois said: [...] "There's something that happens when U2 bash it out in the band room... and sometimes things get out of control, sonically, in a good way. Out of control in the sense that you don't know what it is anymore, it just takes on a life of its own, and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> do things." ...|$|E

It amounts to the same thing as 'good morning,' and 'good evening,' and the other courtesies of society.

6000|$|I would beseech the {{literary}} critics {{of our country}} to disabuse themselves of the mischievous notion that they {{are essential to the}} progress of literature in the way critics have imagined. Canon Farrar confesses that with the best will in the world to profit by the many criticisms of his books, he has never profited in the least by any of them; and this is almost the universal experience of authors. It is not always the fault of the critics. They sometimes deal honestly and fairly by a book, and not so often they deal adequately. But in making a book, if it is at all a good book, the author has learned all that is knowable about it, and every strong point and every weak point in it, far more accurately than any one else can possibly learn them. He has learned to do better than well for the future; but if his book is bad, he cannot be taught anything about it from the outside. It will perish; and if he has not the root of literature in him, he will perish as an author with it. But what is it that gives tendency in art, then? What is <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> like this at one time, and that at another?
