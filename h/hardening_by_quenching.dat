40|$|High {{strength}} boron steels {{are commonly}} used as structural reinforcements or energy absorbing systems in automobile applications due to their favourable strength to weight ratios. The high strength of these steels leads to several problems during forming such as poor formability, increased spring back, and tendency to work-harden. In view of these difficulties, high strength boron steels are usually formed by press hardening at elevated temperatures {{with a view to}} facilitate forming and simultaneous <b>hardening</b> <b>by</b> <b>quenching</b> of complex shaped parts. The high strength steel sheets are used with an Al–Si coating with a view e. g. to prevent scaling of components during hot-metal forming. The Al-Si coated high strength steel can lead to problems with galling (i. e. material transfer from the coated sheet to the tool surface) which have a negative influence {{on the quality of the}} produced parts as well as the process economy. The available results in the open literature pertaining to high temperature galling are very scarce. With this in view, the friction and wear behaviours of different tool steel coatings and different roughness lay directions sliding against Al–Si-coated high-strength steel at elevated temperatures have been investigated by using a high-temperature reciprocating friction and wear tester at temperature of 900 °C. The results have shown that parallel sliding with respect to the surface roughness lay reduces the severity of galling compared to perpendicular sliding. None of the coatings included in this study have shown beneficial effects in view of galling. The DLC coating experienced less galling compared to the AlCrN and TiAlN. Post polishing of the coated tool steel has resulted in more severe material transfer with higher and more unstable friction. Validerat; 20111022 (anonymous) </p...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{tribological}} interfaces that {{are exposed to}} elevated temperatures. Typical examples are the interfaces of various moving assemblies, for examples in aerospace industry, power generation and metalworking processes. The exposure of materials to elevated temperatures results in highly complex interfaces due to changes in morphology, microstructure and mechanical properties coupled with the occurrence of oxidation and diffusion. All of these changes will influence the tribological behaviour of materials at elevated temperatures. Another major concern is lubrication at elevated temperatures since conventional lubricants do not perform at temperatures above ~ 300 ºC. High strength steels are commonly used as structural reinforcements or energy absorbing systems in automobile applications due to their favourable strength to weight ratios. The high strength of these steels leads to several problems during forming such as poor formability, increased spring back, and tendency to work-harden. In view of these difficulties, high strength steels are usually formed at elevated temperatures {{with a view to}} facilitating forming and simultaneous <b>hardening</b> <b>by</b> <b>quenching</b> of complex shaped parts. A review of published literature has revealed that only a few studies pertaining to high temperature tribology (including those of hot metalworking) have been carried out so far. The understanding of the high temperature tribological behaviour of high strength steels and tool steel pairs is also highly inadequate. The aim of this work is therefore to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} friction and wear mechanisms of tool steel and high strength boron steel tribological pairs at elevated temperatures. The experimental studies were carried out by using a high temperature version of the Optimol SRV reciprocating friction and wear test machine. The tribological studies were performed at temperatures ranging from 40 ºC to 800 ºC. The experimental materials were tool steels of three different alloying compositions (with and without nitriding) and high strength boron steel (unhardened, hardened, with and without Al-Si coating). The results have shown that both friction and wear of tool steel and high strength steel pairs are temperature dependant. An increase in temperature has resulted in lower friction for all the material pairs. Tool wear increased when the temperature increased from 40 to 400 ºC during sliding against uncoated high strength steel but remained unchanged when the temperature increased further to 800 ºC. When sliding against Al-Si coated high strength steel, tool wear increased with increasing temperature. Plasma nitriding of tool steels has been effective in reducing friction as well as in providing protection against severe adhesive wear. The Al-Si coating on the high strength steel has resulted in high friction at low temperatures and low friction at elevated temperatures. It has also shown an increased wear resistance at elevated temperatures. The coating undergoes significant surface morphological changes when exposed to elevated temperatures which are likely to influence its tribological behaviour. Hardening of the high strength steel has resulted in decreased friction at all temperatures. It led to higher tool wear at low temperatures and lower tool wear at elevated temperaturesGodkänd; 2007; 20070820 (pafi...|$|E

50|$|Copper was {{the first}} metal in common use for tools and {{containers}} since {{it is one of}} the few metals available in non-oxidized form, not requiring the smelting of an ore. Copper is easily softened by heating and then cooling (it does not <b>harden</b> <b>by</b> <b>quenching,</b> as in cool water). In this annealed state it may then be hammered, stretched and otherwise formed, progressing toward the desired final shape, but becoming harder and less ductile as work progresses. If work continues beyond a certain hardness the metal will tend to fracture when worked and so it may be re-annealed periodically as the shape progresses. Annealing is stopped when the workpiece is near its final desired shape, and so the final product will have a desired stiffness and hardness. The technique of repoussé exploits these properties of copper, enabling the construction of durable jewelry articles and sculptures (including the Statue of Liberty).|$|R

The results obtained are as follows : (1) Until heating temperature is 780 ℃, the quenching hardness is unconcerned in heating time.

50|$|To <b>harden</b> <b>by</b> <b>quenching,</b> a metal (usually {{steel or}} cast iron) must be heated above the upper {{critical}} temperature {{and then quickly}} cooled. Depending on the alloy and other considerations (such as concern for maximum hardness vs. cracking and distortion), cooling may be done with forced air or other gases, (such as nitrogen). Liquids may be used, due to their better thermal conductivity, such as oil, water, a polymer dissolved in water, or a brine. Upon being rapidly cooled, a portion of austenite (dependent on alloy composition) will transform to martensite, a hard, brittle crystalline structure. The quenched hardness of a metal depends on its chemical composition and quenching method. Cooling speeds, from fastest to slowest, go from brine, polymer (i.e. mixtures of water + glycol polymers), fresh water, oil, and forced air. However, quenching a certain steel too fast can result in cracking, which is why high-tensile steels such as AISI 4140 should be quenched in oil, tool steels such as ISO 1.2767 or H13 {{hot work tool steel}} should be quenched in forced air, and low alloy or medium-tensile steels such as XK1320 or AISI 1040 should be quenched in brine.|$|R
40|$|High speed steels (HSS) as iron alloys {{reinforced}} by carbides of tungsten, chromium, vanadium and/or cobalt {{are known for}} more than 100 years. HSS is commonly used for cutting tools fabrication because of their high hardness, ductility, and strength and temperature resistance.

HSS are produced by conventional metallurgical methods and the tools are <b>hardened</b> <b>by</b> <b>quenching</b> and tempering.

There are also some studies about thermal spraying of HSS but there is no evidence about Plasma Transfer Arc cladding of HSS. Two powders of HSS 23, resp. HSS 30 grade were selected and deposited by Plasma Transfer Arc (PTA) and pulsed PTA on to mild steel substrate. In order to find the ability of thick layer forming, four layers cladding were used. To minimize heat input the influence of 76 Hz pulsation was also studied. Vickers hardness was measured on cross section and metallography of coatings was done. It was found that with selected parameters thick layer of HSS can be deposited. Pulsation increases the hardness of coatings in comparison with layers produced by direct current PTA.

60|$|Case-hardening is {{the name}} given to a simple process, by which the outside of iron may be turned into steel. Small tools, fish-hooks, and keys, etc., are usually made of iron; they are {{fashioned}} first, and case-hardened afterwards. There are good reasons for this: first, {{because it is the}} cheapest way of making them; and secondly, because while steel is hard, iron is tough; and anything made of iron and coated with steel, combines some of the advantages of both metals. The civilised method of case-hardening, is to brighten up the iron and to cover it with prussiate of potash, either powdered or made into a paste. The iron is then heated, until the prussiate of potash has burned away: this operation is repeated three or four times. Finally, the iron, now covered with a thin layer of steel, is <b>hardened</b> <b>by</b> <b>quenching</b> it in water. In default of prussiate of potash, animal or even vegetable charcoal may be used, but the latter is a very imperfect substitute. To make animal charcoal, take a scrap of leather, hide, hoof, horn, flesh, blood--anything, in fact, that has animal matter in it; dry it into hard chips like charcoal, before a fire, and powder it. Put the iron that is to be case-hardened, with some of this charcoal round it, into the midst of a lump of loam. This is first placed near the fire to harden, and then quite into it, where it should be allowed to slowly attain a blood-red heat, but no higher. Then, break open the lump, take out the iron, and drop it into water to harden.|$|R

50|$|The fuel {{used was}} {{invariably}} charcoal, and {{the products were}} the bloom (a solid mass of iron) and slag (a liquid waste product).

Semi-finished bars of iron or steel were widely traded in some parts of West Africa, as for example at Sukur on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, which in the nineteenth century exported thousands of bars per year north to the Lake Chad Basin.
