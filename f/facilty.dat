We further argue that {{it would be difficult to}} build a custom implemenation as effective. A great many logics have been proposed as tools in computer science, especially for all sorts of formal, machine checked reasoning.

Subsequently, it is outlined that pan-African organisations operating in the realm, namely AMCOD and UCLGA, can intervene to improve decentralisation’s record to enhance local governance at three points in time: before decentralisation is on the agenda, when it is conceptualised and when local governments are already fully operational. The most promising area of action of these organisations is identified as the improvement of political will and commitment of central governments to democratic decentralisation and good local governance.
