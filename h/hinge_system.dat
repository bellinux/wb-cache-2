40|$|Abstract: As the key {{components}} of large-scale hydraulic radial gate, <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> {{play an important role}} in supporting the gate and sustaining loads. They must satisfy the requirements of intensity, rigidity and supporting stability. Due to the complicated working conditions of the gate, it is difficult to calculate stress and strain of the <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> based on traditional design method. In this paper, taking the radial gate in Silin hydropower station as an example, finite element technology is introduced into the analysis of the <b>hinge</b> <b>system.</b> The approach of this work includes steps of (1) obtaining the maximum load of the <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> by analyzing and comparing different working conditions of the gate, (2) modeling the <b>hinge</b> <b>system</b> by meshing, loading and boundary constraints, and (3) computing stress and strain of its major components under the most dangerous condition.

A rod is contoured to accommodate the occipitocervical angle.

Object: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the safety and efficacy of the <b>hinged</b> rod <b>system</b> in occipitocervical fusion. Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively evaluated 39 patients who underwent occipitocervical arthrodesis. Twenty patients were treated with hinged rods versus 19 with contoured rods. Clinical and radiographic data were compared and analyzed. Results: Preoperative and postoperative Nurick and Frankel scores were similar between both groups. The use of allograft, autograft or bone morphogenetic protein was similar in both groups. The average number of levels fused was 4. 1 (± 2. 4) and 3. 4 (± 2) for hinged and contoured rods, respectively. The operative time, estimated blood loss, and length of stay were similar between both groups. The occiput to C 2 angle was similarly maintained in both groups and all patients demonstrated no movement across the CVJ on flexion-extension X-rays during their last follow-up. The average follow-up for the hinged and contoured rod groups was 12. 2 months and 15. 9 months, respectively. Conclusion: Hinged rods provide a safe and effective alternative to contoured rods during occipitocervical arthrodesis...|$|R
5000|$|Modern rotor {{systems may}} use the {{combined}} principles of the rotor systems mentioned above.

Elastomeric bearings may also be used in place of conventional roller bearings. Elastomeric bearings are constructed from a rubber type material and provide limited movement that is perfectly suited for helicopter applications. Flexures and elastomeric bearings require no lubrication and, therefore, require less maintenance. They also absorb vibration, which means less fatigue and longer service life for the helicopter components.|$|R
