While extensive research seeks for the origin of holistic face processing in perceiver-based properties (e. g., expertise), the present study aimed to pinpoint face-based visual information that may support this hallmark indicator of face processing. Specifically, we used the composite face task, a standard task of holistic processing, to investigate whether <b>facial</b> <b>surface</b> information (e. g., texture) or facial shape information underlies holistic face processing, since both sources of information have been shown to support face recognition. In Experiment 1, participants performed two composite face tasks, one for normal faces (i. e., shape + surface information) and one for shape-only faces (i. e., without <b>facial</b> <b>surface</b> information). We found that facial shape information alone is as sufficient to elicit holistic processing as normal faces, indicating that <b>facial</b> <b>surface</b> information is not necessary for holistic processing. In Experiment 2, we tested whether <b>facial</b> <b>surface</b> information alone is sufficient to observe holistic face processing.

Participants performed two composite face tasks, one for normal faces and one for same-shape faces.
