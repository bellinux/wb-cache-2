5|$|The {{airfield}} {{served as}} an alternative destination for Imperial Airways when Croydon was fogbound. The runway was <b>just</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> this purpose. Using Penshurst as an alternate destination caused delays to the passengers as there were no Customs facilities. On 18 February 1932, both Croydon and Penshurst were fogbound, and Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXE Hengist diverted to Heston Aerodrome. As Customs facilities existed there, passengers {{were on their way}} in 10 minutes, as opposed to the three hour or longer delay when using Penshurst. The practice of having a Customs Officer attend Penshurst on a daily basis was instigated, but it was discontinued in February 1935. On 24 October 1932, a German and a French airliner diverted to Penshurst due to smog over London.|$|E

A survivor tells Conan about the courageous act of Balthus and Slasher, and how their final stand had delayed the Picts <b>just</b> barely <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the settlers to reach safety. He also relates that in the midst of his triumph at Fort Tuscellan, Zogar Sag was mysteriously struck dead, sporting the same kind of wounds Conan had inflicted on the swamp demon. Upon hearing of Balthus' and Slasher's demise, Conan vows to take the heads of ten Picts to pay for Balthus, along with seven heads for the dog, who was [...] "a better warrior than many a man." ...|$|R
60|$|Lawrence {{had gone}} to his room to rest and Lucy Stephen was sitting alone in the veranda {{when she heard the}} roar of an east-bound train coming up the valley. It stopped, which did not often happen, and she put down her book {{and looked out at the}} opening in the pines that led to the track. The smoke that rose into the clear, cold air began to move, and Lucy frowned, because the train had <b>just</b> stopped <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> {{passengers}} to alight. Although the hotel was generally full in summer, there were then only a few other guests, quiet people whose acquaintance she had made, and she did not wish Lawrence to be disturbed by new arrivals. He was getting better, but not so quickly as she wished. Besides, she had another ground for anxiety.|$|R

25|$|In a {{statement}} on 25 June 1961, President Abd al-Karim Qasim of Iraq claimed that Kuwait {{was part of his}} country and announced his intention to annexe it. On the strength of a formal defence commitment between the two countries, Kuwait appealed for help from Britain. A force was assembled (Operation Vantage) which included armour, artillery, commando, and infantry battalions, one being the 2nd Battalion, based in Cyprus. The battalion was not involved in any combat and remained <b>just</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the Arab League to take over from them. All British forces had withdrawn by 19 October.|$|E
25|$|While Setnakhte's reign {{was still}} {{comparatively}} brief, it was <b>just</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him {{to stabilize the}} political situation in Egypt and establish his son, Rameses III, as his successor to the throne of Egypt. The Bakenkhunsu stela reveals that it was Setnakhte who began {{the construction of a}} Temple of Amun-Re in Karnak which was eventually completed by his son, Ramesses III. Setnakhte also started work on a tomb, KV11, in the Valley of the Kings, but stopped it when the tombcarvers accidentally broke into the tomb of the Nineteenth Dynasty Pharaoh Amenmesse. Setnakhte then appropriated the tomb of Queen Twosret (KV14), his predecessor, for his own use. Setnakhte's origins are unknown, and he may have been a commoner, although many Egyptologists believe he was related to the previous dynasty, the Nineteenth, through his mother and may thus have been a grandson of Ramesses II. Setnakhte's son and successor, Ramesses III, is regarded as the last great king of the New Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Buford's cavalry {{division}} {{played a}} crucial role in the Gettysburg Campaign that summer. Arriving at the small town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on June 30 before the Confederate troops reached the place, Buford set up defensive positions. On the morning of July 1, Buford's division was attacked by a Confederate division under the command of Major General Henry Heth. His men held <b>just</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Union reinforcements to arrive. After a massive three day battle, the Union troops emerged victorious. Later, Buford rendered valuable service to the Army, both in the pursuit of Robert E.

On his deathbed, he received a personal message from President Abraham Lincoln, promoting him to major general of volunteers in recognition of his tactical skill and leadership displayed on the first day of Gettysburg. He died at age 37.|$|E

It was a very short day's run, but the dragoman {{does not want to}} go further, and has invented a plausible lie about the country beyond this being infested by ferocious Arabs, who would make sleeping in their midst a dangerous pastime. Well, they ought to be dangerous. They carry a rusty old weather-beaten flint-lock gun, with a barrel that is longer than themselves; it has no sights on it, it will not carry farther than a brickbat, and is not half so certain. And the great sash they wear in many a fold around their waists has two or three absurd old horse-pistols in it that are rusty from eternal disuse --weapons that would hang fire <b>just</b> about <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> you to walk out of range, and then burst and blow the Arab's head off.

50|$|Stung to fury by the {{frustration}} of his plot, Men-Hari stabs his father in the stomach with a long dagger. As Phillip rushes to Za-Tor's aid, Men-Hari attempts to kill him, but Kallikrates' guards kill Men-Hari with their swords at their king's command. Kallikrates, now despondent beyond all reasoning, then commits suicide by re-entering the sacred flame, despite Sharna's efforts to stop him. As the others watch in horror, Kallikrates ages hundreds of years {{in a matter of}} seconds, then dies and crumbles to dust. As Phillip and Carol leave the chamber and head for the main entrance to the city, Za-Tor revives <b>just</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to pray <b>for</b> Kuma's destruction, since its people have now become evil beyond all hope of rehabilitation. In direct response, the sacred flame explodes outward, and an earthquake begins to tear the city apart. Phillip and Carol just barely make it out of the entrance before the city crumbles and collapses, killing everyone within. As the two lovers begin making their way back to civilization, the last fragments of the giant sculpture of Ayesha that stood above the entrance are engulfed by the sacred flame, signifying the end of Kuma and the Magi for all time.|$|R

500|$|The finals of {{the tournament}} to crown the first champions saw Los Infernales ("The Infernal Ones"; the team of MS-1, Pirata Morgan, and El Satánico) defeat Los Brazos ("The Arms"; El Brazo, Brazo de Oro, and Brazo de Plata) {{to become the first}} champions. Los Brazos would win the {{championship}} 9months later but only hold them for a short while. In February 1986 Los Brazos became the first team to hold the title twice as they defeated Dos Caras, Villano III, and Villano IV for the championship. EMLL rebranded themselves [...] "Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre" [...] ("World Wrestling Council") in 1991 and created the CMLL World Trios Championship but also kept the rights to the Mexican National Trios Championship. In 1992 Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) was formed by a group of officials and wrestlers who broke away from CMLL. The then-reigning champions Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000 left CMLL to join AAA and brought the Mexican National Trios Championship with them as it was not a CMLL owned title. The Commission granted AAAthe right to control the title from 1992 on, later on when AAA began working with Promotora Mexicana de Lucha Libre (PROMELL) both promotions were allowed used the Trios title by the commission. In 1996 AAA and PROMELL stopped working together and the title was vacated. PROMELL was granted the right to promote the title from that point on and held a tournament to crown new champions. Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera, and El Signo won the tournament and would go on to hold the titles for 1,728days, although {{for the majority of the}} time the three did not team up and the Trios championship was inactive. In 2001 the trio worked a couple of matches for CMLL, <b>just</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> them to lose the championship to Mr. Niebla, Olímpico, and Safari, bringing the championship back under CMLL's control, where it has remained ever since.|$|E

2500|$|Media {{coverage}} of the spill was intense {{from the moment the}} oil reached the shore. [...] The spill was the major headline in many morning newspapers on February 5, also receiving wide coverage on radio and television. [...] The same morning, a U.S. Senate subcommittee interviewed local officials as well as Fred Hartley, president of Union Oil, on the disaster in the making. [...] Three major television networks were there along with over 50 reporters, the largest media turnout for any Senate subcommittee meeting since the Committee on Foreign Relations discussed the Vietnam War. [...] During the meeting, local officials made their case that the Federal government had a conflict of interest, in that they were making money from the same drilling they were mandated to oversee and regulate. [...] Hartley defended Union's record and denied that the event was a disaster: [...] "I don't like to call it a disaster, because there has been no loss of human life.
