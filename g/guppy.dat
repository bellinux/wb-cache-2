25|$|Male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) {{have been}} {{observed}} to forcefully copulate with females by trying to insert their gonopodium (male sex organ) into female’s genital pores, {{whether or not they}} are accepting. Sometimes, male guppies also try to forcefully mate with Skiffia bilineata (goodeid) females, which resemble <b>guppy</b> females and tend to share the same habitat, even when <b>guppy</b> females are available. A possible explanation for this is the deeper genital cavity of S. bilineata, which stimulates the males more than when mating with <b>guppy</b> females.|$|E
50|$|Two {{or three}} generations of <b>guppies</b> per year occur in the wild. <b>Guppies</b> are well {{developed}} and capable of independent existence without further parental care {{by the time they}} are born. Young <b>guppies</b> school together and perform antipredator tactics. Brood size is extremely variable, yet some consistent differences exist among populations depending on the predation level and other factors. Females of matching body sizes tend to produce more numerous but smaller-sized offspring in high-predation conditions. Female <b>guppies</b> first produce offspring at 10-20 weeks of age, and they continue to reproduce until 20-34 months of age. Male <b>guppies</b> mature in 7 weeks or less. Total lifespan of <b>guppies</b> in the wild varies greatly, but it is typically around 2 years. Variations in such life historic characteristics of <b>guppies</b> are observed in different populations, indicating that different evolutionary pressures exist.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of early speciation through mate preference in <b>guppies.</b> <b>Guppies</b> are located across several isolated streams in Trinidad and male colour patterns differ geographically. Female <b>guppies</b> have no coloration but their preference for these colour patterns also vary across locations. In a mate choice study, female <b>guppies</b> were shown to prefer males with colour patterns that are typical of their home stream. This preference could result in reproductive isolation if two populations came into contact again.|$|R
5000|$|An effect {{caused by}} {{pentachlorophenol}} is {{a decrease in}} response to predator attacks in <b>guppies</b> (Poecilia reticula). Pentachlorophenol was exposed to juvenile <b>guppies</b> at 500 and 700 μg/L, and both concentrations decreased the guppies’ reactions to predators. [...] The predators {{did not have to}} strike as frequently, did not have to pursue as frequently, or have to pursue the <b>guppies</b> as long as <b>guppies</b> that had not been exposed to these levels of pentachlorophenol. [...] The <b>guppies</b> that were exposed to this chemical {{were more likely to be}} eaten due to their slower responses. This is another example of a behavioral sublethal effect that leads to ecological death.|$|R

50|$|<b>Guppies</b> {{living in}} northeastern South America face {{a variety of}} {{evolutionary}} pressures {{based on the number}} of predators in their individual habitat. Researchers found that near the headwaters of most streams, the <b>guppies</b> had few natural enemies, but that near the end of the streams, they faced much greater predatory pressure. Consequently, <b>guppies</b> near the headwaters developed brighter colors in order to attract attention from potential mates, while <b>guppies</b> farther downstream, though still carrying some bright markings, tended strongly towards duller coloration for the purpose of camouflage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Guppies</b> {{are native}} to Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Brazil, Guyana, Jamaica, the Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Venezuela. However, <b>guppies</b> have been {{introduced}} to many different countries on every continent except Antarctica. Sometimes this has occurred accidentally, but most often {{as a means of}} mosquito control. The <b>guppies</b> were expected to eat the mosquito larvae and help slow the spread of malaria, but in many cases, these <b>guppies</b> have had a negative impact on native fish populations. Field studies reveal that <b>guppies</b> have colonized almost every freshwater body accessible to them in their natural ranges, especially in the streams located near the coastal fringes of mainland South America. Although not typically found there, <b>guppies</b> also have tolerance to brackish water and have colonized some brackish habitats. They tend to be more abundant in smaller streams and pools than in large, deep, or fast-flowing rivers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between sagittal plane and coronal plane curvatures in <b>guppies</b> by investigating the curvature angles of sagittal and sagittal-coronal <b>guppies.</b> MethodsAfter mating between 1000 spinal curvature <b>guppies,</b> 124 <b>guppies</b> (3 -month old) were screened from progenies for the present study. Photos of all fishes were taken and the sagittal and coronal angles were calculated via angle measure tool of Photoshop 12. 0 software. All data were analyzed by SPSS 11. 0. ResultsIn sagittal and sagittal-coronal curvature <b>guppies,</b> {{there was a significant}} linear correlation between sagittal angles and coronal angles. In 48 sagittal-coronal curvatures, their sagittal angles were above 40 °, meanwhile, in 76 sagittal <b>guppies,</b> their sagittal angles were mostly below 40 °. ConclusionsThese findings indicated that the occurrence of coronal curvature might be later than sagittal curvature and could be influenced by other factors. Sagittal angles 40 ° might be involved in the onset of coronal curvature...|$|R

50|$|<b>Guppies</b> {{have many}} predators, such as larger fish and birds, {{in their natural}} habitats. Some of their common predators in the wild are Crenicichla alta, Anablepsoides hartii, and Aequidens pulcher. Guppies' small bodies and the bright {{coloration}} of males make them easy prey, and like many fish, they often school together to avoid predation. Schooling is more favored by evolution in populations of <b>guppies</b> under high predation pressure, exerted either by predator type or predator density. Coloration of <b>guppies</b> also evolves differentially in response to predation. Male <b>guppies</b> that are brighter in color have an advantage in mating as they attract more females in general, {{but they have a}} higher risk of being noticed by predators than duller males. Male <b>guppies</b> evolve to be more dull in color and have fewer, smaller spots under intense predation both in wild and in laboratory settings. Female <b>guppies</b> in a high-predation environment also evolve to prefer brightly colored males less, often rejecting them.|$|R
40|$|Visually {{mediated}} mating behaviour {{has been}} extensively studied in <b>guppies,</b> Poecilia reticulata. In contrast, the effects of signals from other sensory modalities on receiver behaviour have received very little attention. Here we describe three field and laboratory experiments to investigate the attraction of females to conspecific chemosensory cues using <b>guppies</b> from the Caroni drainage of Trinidad. In an experiment with stationary water and concentrated stimulus solutions, <b>guppies</b> were equally attracted to chemosensory cues from males and females, and {{did not respond to}} control stimuli without conspecific cues. In the wild, <b>guppies</b> showed no attraction to conspecific chemosensory cues. In a laboratory flow chamber, set up to mimic the natural situation but without distractions from visual and other chemosensory stimuli, <b>guppies</b> were also not attracted to chemosensory cues from male or female <b>guppies.</b> In addition, the attraction of individual females to conspecific chemosensory cues was not repeatable. These experiments suggest that the use of conspecific chemosensory cues can attract female <b>guppies</b> only when in high concentrations. We discuss the effects of differences in experimental design on our findings, and the possibility of multimodal interactions between visual and chemosensory cues...|$|R
50|$|Guppies' diet {{preference}} {{is not simply}} correlated to the abundance of a particular food. Laboratory experiments confirmed that <b>guppies</b> show 'diet switching' behavior, in which they feed disproportionately on the more abundant food when they are offered two food choices. The result shows that different groups of <b>guppies</b> have weak and variable food preference. Diet preference in <b>guppies</b> {{could be related to}} factors such as the presence of competitors. For example, the lower Tacarigua River has a larger variety of species and competition for invertebrate prey is higher, therefore the proportion of invertebrates is small in diets of those <b>guppies.</b>|$|R
25|$|Librarians at John Rylands {{before its}} merger include Edward Gordon Duff in 1899 and 1900 and Henry <b>Guppy</b> between 1899 and 1948 (joint Librarian with Duff until 1900).

25|$|The Space Shuttle was {{originally}} designed to utilize on-board turbofan engines for propulsion within the atmosphere, both upon re-entry and for ferry flights between landing sites, such as Edwards Air Force Base, the White Sands Missile Range, or contingency landing sites such as Easter Island, to the launch site at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. When the air-breathing engines were deleted from the Shuttle design due to cost and weight concerns, a requirement arose for a transport aircraft capable of carrying the Shuttle from landing sites back to the Kennedy Space Center. One early design for a shuttle carrier aircraft was proposed by John M.

40|$|The enemy release {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} in parasite depleted habitats, populations will experience relaxed selection {{and become more}} susceptible (or less tolerant) to pathogenic infections. Here, we focus on a population of <b>guppies</b> (Poecilia reticulata) that are found in an extreme environment (the Pitch Lake, Trinidad) and examine whether this habitat represents a refuge from parasites. We investigated the efficacy of pitch in preventing microbial infections in Pitch Lake <b>guppies,</b> by exposing them to dechlorinated water, and reducing gyrodactylid infections on non-Pitch Lake <b>guppies</b> by transferring them to Pitch Lake water. We show that (i) natural prevalence of ectoparasites in the Pitch Lake is low compared to reference populations, (ii) Pitch Lake <b>guppies</b> transferred into aquarium water develop microbial infections, and (iii) experimentally infected <b>guppies</b> are cured of their gyrodactylid infections both by natural Pitch Lake water and by dechlorinated water containing solid pitch. These results indicate a role for Pitch Lake water in the defence of <b>guppies</b> from their parasites and suggest that Pitch Lake <b>guppies</b> might have undergone enemy release in this extreme environment. The Pitch Lake provides an ideal ecosystem for studies on immune gene evolution {{in the absence of}} parasites and long-term evolutionary implications of hydrocarbon pollution for vertebrates...|$|R
50|$|Sensory bias {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in <b>guppies,</b> freshwater fish from Trinidad and Tobago. In this mating system, female <b>guppies</b> prefer to mate with males with more orange body coloration. However, outside of a mating context, both sexes prefer animate orange objects which suggests that preference originally evolved in another context, like foraging. Orange fruits are a rare treat that fall into streams where the <b>guppies</b> live. The ability to find these fruits quickly is an adaptive quality that has evolved outside of a mating context. Sometime after the affinity for orange objects arose, male <b>guppies</b> exploited this preference by incorporating large orange spots to attract females.|$|R
50|$|Similar sexual {{dimorphism}} and mating choice {{are also}} observed in many fish species. For example, in <b>guppies</b> males have colorful spots and ornamentations while females are generally grey in color. Female <b>guppies</b> prefer brightly colored males to duller males.|$|R
25|$|After the {{construction}} and ground testing of a stage was completed, it was then shipped to the Kennedy Space Center.

After rounding Florida, it was then transported up the Intra-Coastal Waterway to the Vertical Assembly Building (now called the Vehicle Assembly Building). This was essentially the same route which would be used later by NASA to ship Space Shuttle External Tanks. The S-II was constructed in California and thus traveled to Florida via the Panama Canal. The third stage and Instrument Unit could be carried by the Aero Spacelines Pregnant <b>Guppy</b> and Super <b>Guppy,</b> but could also have been carried by barge if warranted.|$|E

40|$|<b>Guppies</b> (Poecilia reticulata Peters 1859) {{in lakes}} and from captive-bred populations are {{predicted}} to show little rheotaxis compared to conspecifics {{in a stream}} environment that are regularly exposed to flash floods associated with involuntary downstream migration. Here we test this hypothesis using an artificial stream, examining <b>guppies</b> of two wild riverine populations, one lake population, and one ornamental strain. <b>Guppies</b> from the most upstream riverine habitat show the most pronounced rheotaxis and {{are less likely to}} be swept downstream during flooding events. However, there is no significant difference between <b>guppies</b> from the lowland riverine habitat, the Pitch Lake and ornamental strain. We propose that station-keeping behaviours are most strongly selected in the upstream population because large spatial differences exist in ecology and environment between up- and downstream habitats. Given that these sites are separated by barrier waterfalls that prevent compensatory upstream migration, natural selection operates particularly strong against upstream <b>guppies</b> that have been displaced downstream during flooding events...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and empirical work argues that growth rate can evolve and be optimized, rather than always being maximized. Chronically low resource availability is predicted to favour the evolution of slow growth, whereas attaining a size-refuge from mortality risk is predicted to favor the evolution of rapid growth. <b>Guppies</b> (Poecilia reticulata) evolve difference in behaviour, morphology and life-history traits in response to predation, thus demonstrating that predators are potent agents of selection. Predators in low-predation environments prey preferentially on small <b>guppies,</b> but hose in high-predation environments appear to be non-selective. Because <b>guppies</b> can outgrow their main predator in low- but not high-predation localities, we predict that predation will select for higher growth rate in the low-predation environments. However, low-predation localities also tend to have lower productivity than high-predation localities, yielding the prediction that <b>guppies</b> from these sites should have slower growth rate. Here, we compare the growth rates of the second laboratory-born generation of <b>guppies</b> from paired high- and low-predation localities from four different drainages. In two out of four comparisons, <b>guppies</b> from high-predation sites grew significantly faster than their low-predation counterparts. We also compare laboratory born descendants from a field introduction experiment and show that <b>guppies</b> introduced to a low-predation environment evolved slower growth rates after 13 years, although this was evident only at the high food level. The weight of {{the evidence suggests that}} resource availability plays a more important role than predation in shaping the evolution of growth rates...|$|R
50|$|<b>Guppies</b> often forage {{in groups}} {{because they can}} find food more easily. Shoaling <b>guppies</b> spend less time and energy on antipredatory {{behavior}} than solitary ones and {{spend more time on}} feeding. However, such behavior results in food that is found being shared {{with other members of the}} group. Studies also show when an evolutionary cost exists, <b>guppies</b> that tend to shoal are less aggressive and less competitive with regards to scarce resources. Therefore, shoaling is preferred in high-predation regions, but not in low-predation regions. When <b>guppies</b> with a high tendency to shoal were isolated from high-predation regions and were relocated to predator-free environments, over time, they decreased their shoaling behavior, supporting the hypothesis that shoaling is less preferred in low-predation environments.|$|R

40|$|This study 2 ̆ 7 s main {{objective}} was to determine how mortality patterns mold the life histories of natural populations of <b>guppies</b> (Poecilia reticulata) in the Northern Range of Trinidad. These populations are exposed to differences in both the intensity and mode of predation. The three types of localities considered in this study include: (1) Crenicichla localities, where <b>guppies</b> co-occur with Crenicichla alta plus other species of predators and {{are exposed to the}} highest overall levels of predation plus selective predation against large, mature size classes; (2) Rivulus localities, where the only potential predator is Rivulus hartii, an omnivore that exerts moderate predation pressure and selects small, immature size classes of guppies; and (3) Aequidens localities, where <b>guppies</b> co-occur with the cichlid Aequidens pulchur, with R. hartii rare or absent, and are exposed to the lowest overall levels of predation. ^ In comparing wild-caught <b>guppies</b> from 16 field localities, I found that Crenicichla <b>guppies</b> initiate reproduction at a smaller size, produce larger packages of offspring relative to their body size, produce more and smaller offspring per litter, and reproduce more frequently than Rivulus <b>guppies.</b> Aequidens <b>guppies</b> equal Crenicichla <b>guppies</b> in the frequency of reproduction, have intermediate-sized packages at each reproductive event, but are similar to Rivulus <b>guppies</b> for the remaining variables. Studies of the second generation of laboratory-born fish from two Rivulus and two Crenicichla localities demonstrated a genetic basis for all the above differences, except for the size of the reproductive package. In addition, both male and female Crenicichla <b>guppies</b> matured at a younger age than Rivulus <b>guppies.</b> I also measured reproductive effort (RE) as the percentage of consumed calories devoted to offspring; Crenicichla <b>guppies</b> had significantly greater RE 2 ̆ 7 s than Rivulus <b>guppies.</b> ^ Evidence indicating that the predators selected for these life history patterns included: (1) Comparisons between wild-caught <b>guppies</b> collected within a short distance of one another, but exposed to different predator 2 ̆ 2 treatments 2 ̆ 2; (2) the results of an introduction experiment; and (3) the results of a selection experiment. Three hypotheses concerning how the predators selected for these life history patterns were discussed, including interpopulation differences in: (1) Age (size) selective predation; (2) the intensity of predation; and (3) predator-mediated intra-specific competition (r- and K-selection). Predicted life history patterns based on all these hypotheses are consistent to some extent with the observed life histories. ^ A second objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the tradeoff between growth and reproduction. I first compared the growth of reproducing and non-reproducing siblings raised on quantified food resources. Non-reproducing females had significantly more calories in fat tissues, but exhibited no differences in somatic growth, indicating that, within a genotype, growth will not increase if reproductive investment is artificially decreased. A second comparison was made between fish which devoted different percentages of consumed energy to reproduction. Increased or decreased reproductive investment caused the opposite response in somatic investment, indicating that evolving a change in growth or reproduction results in a complementary change in the other variable. Such tradeoffs are a key element in most life history theory, but have rarely been characterized in real organisms. ...|$|R

40|$|The antipredator {{behaviour}} of prey organisms {{is shaped}} {{by a series of}} threat-sensitive trade-offs between the benefits associated with successful predator avoidance and a suite of other fitness-related behaviours such as foraging, mating and territorial defence. Recent research has shown that the overall intensity of antipredator response and the pattern of threat-sensitive trade-offs are influenced by current conditions, including variability in predation risk over a period of days to weeks. Here, we tested the hypothesis that long-term predation pressure will likewise have shaped the nature of the threat-sensitive antipredator behaviour of wild-caught Trinidadian <b>guppies</b> (Poecilia reticulata). Female <b>guppies</b> were collected two populations that have evolved under high- and low-predation pressure, respectively, in the Aripo River, Northern Mountain Range, Trinidad. Under laboratory conditions, we exposed shoals of three <b>guppies</b> to varying concentrations of conspecific damage-released chemical alarm cues. Lower Aripo (high-predation) <b>guppies</b> exhibited the strongest antipredator response when exposed to the highest alarm cue concentration and a graded decline in response intensity with decreasing concentrations of alarm cue. Upper Aripo (low-predation) <b>guppies,</b> however, exhibited a nongraded (hypersensitive) response pattern. Our results suggest that long-term predation pressure shapes not only the overall intensity of antipredator responses of Trinidadian <b>guppies,</b> but also their threat-sensitive behavioural response patterns. ...|$|R
