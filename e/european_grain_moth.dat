50|$|Nemapogon granella (European grain worm or <b>European</b> <b>grain</b> <b>moth)</b> is {{a species}} of tineoid moth.

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>grain</b> <b>moth,</b> Nemapogon granellus (L.) (Lepidoptera, Tineidae), is {{reported}} as a pest in wine cellars where larvae feed on, and tunnel into, the corks of wine bottles. When tunnels ultimately connect {{both ends of}} the cork, the wine itself is affected and bottles rejected due to alteration in the organoleptic properties of the wine. Activity of larvae causes also aesthetic damage to the corks, which must be replaced before delivery to consumers. During 2011 and 2012 heavy infestations of <b>European</b> <b>grain</b> <b>moth</b> was observed in two Italian wine cellars, causing serious damage on exposed wine-bottle corks. The infestation occurred on high quality red wine bottles (approximately 13, 000) stored for aging for over twenty years. In the control of N. granellus Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy was adopted: monitoring an trapping of adults with pheromone traps, accompanied by careful cleaning of the rooms, shelves and machinery, alternated with localized treatments using fogs with pyrethrum, and by the replacement of the infested corks. In addition, adoption of cellar sanitation procedures reduced the sources of pests as well as the possibility of insect reproduction...|$|E

The monitoring methods comprised visual observation, monitoring of harvested panicles for the emergence of adults and use of sex pheromone or aggregation traps.

PhillipsKnowing {{the factors}} that {{influence}} the distribution patterns, establishment and persistence of stored product insects aids {{in the development of a}} more effective pest management program in grain storage structures. This research focuses mainly on the insect communities of stored wheat and stored rice in two different geographical locations, their temporal relationships and the most important or abundant species within that community. Stored wheat was sampled for one season in Manhattan, KS and for rice stored in Beaumont, TX was sampled for two seasons. Hairy fungus beetle, Typhaea stercorea (Coleoptera: Mycetophagidae) was one of the most abundant species and was present in every bin of either wheat or rice and appeared to move into and out of the grain mass. In wheat bin, Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was a predominant species captured in the bin headspace, but was not frequently recovered in the grain mass. Headspace temperatures tended to be warmer than grain temperatures and outside temperatures. Other major insects recovered in wheat bin included the following groups or species: Anthicidae, Lathridiidae, Cryptolestes, foreign grain beetle Ahasverus advena (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), sawtoothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), smalleyed flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionoidea) and minute pirate bug Xylocoris favipes (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae).

The percentage of parasitizing females at 15 Â°C was significantly lower than that at 20, 25, and 30 Â°Ð¡. At constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, and 30 Â°C, mean durations of pre-oviposition periods were 6. 5, 2. 1, 0. 9, and 0. 6 days, respectively (differences were significant between all regimens). In most of females, parasi-tization induced by high temperature (25 Â°C) continued after the temperature decrease to 15 Â°C. These results sug-gest that although emerged females are ready to lay eggs, rather prolonged pre-oviposition period may precede parasitization of less preferred hosts, and the duration of this period may depend on temperature.
