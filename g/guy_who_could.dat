500|$|Lofton {{accepted}} a basketball scholarship {{to play at}} the University of Arizona. Wildcats head coach Lute Olson said of Lofton, [...] "He's quick and a great leaper." [...] At one point Lofton performed a 360-degree slam dunk for his unsuspecting teammates. For the Wildcats, Lofton was the backup point guard (to Craig McMillan and Steve Kerr) on a team that made it to the Final Four of the 1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. He was the starting point guard the following year when the Wildcats made it to the Sweet Sixteen. Lofton is one of only two men to play in a college basketball Final Four (1988) and a MLB World Series. (The other is fellow East Chicago Washington High School alumnus Tim Stoddard.) He left as the Wildcats' leader in career steals (a record eventually broken). [...] "In strength and agility drills, he just killed it. He's a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> have played pro football or basketball or baseball", said former Wildcats teammate Bruce Fraser.|$|E

I mean, there are probably five or six <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> play Cochran's role, but who else is there <b>who</b> <b>could</b> play the role of Tibbey? The Tiburon character has to be really charming and Anthony has that in spades. He has to have danger and he has to have presence. Anthony has that because he's been a leading man all his life.

500|$|Enforcers {{typically}} only fight each other, {{with only}} the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight. There is {{a high degree of}} respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory. This is also known as granting a [...] "free pass". Enforcer Darren McCarty described fighters as being divided into [...] "heavyweights" [...] and [...] "light heavyweights", and said that players in the former category [...] "end up dancing with some <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> end (their) career with a single punch." ...|$|R
500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{the writer}} of the episode, wanted Bryan Cranston to play the {{antagonist}} because he felt he would humanize the role. “We needed a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> be scary and kind of loathsome {{but at the same}} time had a deep, resounding humanity," [...] he later said. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, [...] "We had this villain, and we needed the audience to feel bad for him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it.” Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files noted that Cranston was nearly not chosen for this episode. Initially, the part of Crump had been assigned to a different actor, but Cranston came prepared to audition for the part. Although the character had already been cast, Millikan allowed him to audition and was very pleased with his performance and chose him for the part instead.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} season with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit [...]285. His 66 stolen bases broke the all-time record for an American League rookie and was the most by a Major League rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season's stolen base count, which led the AL, also broke a {{franchise}} record (previously set by Miguel Diloné in 1980). Indians first base coach Dave Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped {{learn how to be}} successful with bunting. Lofton finished second (to the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million contract. The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season stolen bases' record, recording 70 (which led the MLB). Lofton was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season. His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner to say, [...] "I remember how raw he was, and I've never seen anybody develop into that type of player that fast." [...] Garner, who saw Lofton play in the minors, added, [...] "He went from a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> hardly get the ball past the infield to a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> hit the ball consistently. He always had good speed, but got lousy jumps and didn't run the bases well. He has turned into a dominant player." [...] The regular season was stopped abruptly with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits on the season were highest in the AL and his [...]349 batting average would be a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting. When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox. Indians general manager John Hart said of Lofton, [...] "What a representative for our team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise." [...] Lofton would join fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome to form [...] "the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any." ...|$|E
500|$|The other protagonist, Aoba is {{the third}} {{daughter}} of the Tsukishima family, one year younger than Ko and Wakaba. Aoba {{is seen as a}} tomboy by other characters, one who loves baseball very much. Her father has played catch with Aoba since she was little, thus grooming her into a strong pitcher. She has a poster of Ryota Igarashi, a famous fastball pitcher, on her bedroom wall, and when she was young Aoba told Wakaba she was only interested in a <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> pitch a fastball over [...] She has an excellent pitching form, on which Ko based his own form, and she has a wide variety of pitches. Although as a girl she cannot play in official inter-school games, in practice games she plays center field or replaces Ko as pitcher. Many younger members of the Seishu baseball team are inspired by how much effort she puts into baseball and coaching them, and work hard to not disappoint her. Ko claims she is secretly disappointed that she {{will never be able to}} pitch in an official game, and Yuhei Azuma points out that she is using Ko as her proxy to get to Koshien.|$|E

Also on the DVD, Gary Hart states he was approached by several wrestling fans who told him they knew Kevin Vaughan was not a legitimate Von Erich family member. He also added that it made the von Erichs look like liars to their fans, who normally saw them as good <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> do no wrong. Michael Hayes referred to this as one of the worst moves ever made by Fritz.|$|R
500|$|The {{two were}} tempted to ally {{themselves}} with Steven Spielberg, who produced Used Cars and I Wanna Hold Your Hand, which were both box office bombs. Zemeckis and Gale initially had shown the screenplay to Spielberg, who had [...] "loved" [...] it. Spielberg, however, was {{absent from the}} project during development because Zemeckis felt if he produced another flop under him, {{he would never be}} able to make another film. Gale said [...] "we were afraid that we would get the reputation that we were two <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> only get a job because we were pals with Steven Spielberg." [...] Zemeckis chose to direct Romancing the Stone instead, which was a box office success. Now a high-profile director, Zemeckis reapproached Spielberg with the concept. Agreeing to produce Back to the Future, Spielberg set the project up at his production company, Amblin Entertainment, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joining Spielberg as executive producers on the film.|$|R

500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|R

500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was one of those <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: [...] "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him".|$|R

In another episode in the 4th season Miley reveals to Jesse that she is Hannah. Yet to her surprise he already knows. Jesse can't take the pressure of dating Hannah and Miley and ends it with Miley. In the end of the episode, Jesse comes back to Miley and then she reveals her secret to the whole world.|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's key {{campaign}} man was Jim Karygiannis {{who became}} a living legend within the Liberal Party due to his ruthlessness. Chrétien told Lavelle that what he wanted was [...] "A tough guy. A <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> go on a search-and-destroy mission, who could do a kamikaze raid for our side", and decided that Karygiannis was that man. At a meeting to select Liberal delegates for the Kitchener-Waterloo riding, Martin's supporters attempted to call on the pay phones as many potential Martin supporters as possible {{to come to the}} meeting, which led Karygiannis to put chewed gum into all of the pay phone coin slots, and thereby won Kitchener-Waterloo for Chrétien. At another delegate selection meeting, Karygiannis verbally attacked a pro-Martin Liberal official with such rage that the man was hospitalized for angina. Karygiannis specialised in signing up immigrants to serve as delegates for Chrétien, and personally signed 9,500 immigrants as Chrétien delegates between January and June 1990, leading one pro-Martin official to lament that [...] "We were getting Greeked. And if we weren't getting Greeked, we were getting Sikhed". Karygiannis later boasted in an interview that [...] "I signed up anything that moved". Chrétien is said to have praised Karygiannis with the remark [...] "Whatever it takes to win, Jimmy, whatever it takes to win". In large part because of Karygiannis and his team, by late April 1990 Chrétien had signed up 1,500 delegates to Martin's 500 delegates, making him the clear front-runner.|$|E

5000|$|El Águila was {{introduced}} as a recurring adversary of Power Man and Iron Fist. Power Man and Iron Fist writer Mary Jo Duffy recounted his creation: [...] El Aguila {{was designed by}} Dave Cockrum and he had this big Zorro thing, and Zorro was another one of these characters that I was just crazy about and Power Man and Iron Fist was tricky. These were not <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>could</b> fly. Their superpowers were defensive {{and if they were}} offensive, {{it was going to be}} hands-on, and it’s remarkably tricky inventing a villain for somebody like that ... It seemed to me that someone like Zorro but with one or two powers would be about the right level and since Iron Fist was a little bit easygoing and unworldly, and Power Man was just so cranky and completely grounded in the here and now, giving him somebody with this playful panache would be frustrating. Iron Fist wouldn’t even get it, Power Man would be infuriated by it, and it would give El Aguila a certain amount of charm. So I wasn’t just thinking of the power problem, though it was a problem, but in terms of the characters—it had to interest me. And Power Man and Iron Fist were so well-realized as characters that if a villain wasn’t as equally well-realized, then what was the point in doing it? ...|$|R
