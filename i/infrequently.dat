5|$|Copper sharks only attack humans <b>infrequently,</b> but {{the species}} places tenth {{in the number}} of unprovoked attacks on people.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, {{although}} Hazlitt {{continued to be}} read and his influence was to a degree felt, he was {{throughout most of the}} remainder of the nineteenth century <b>infrequently</b> cited as a critic.|$|E
5|$|The creek whaler feeds {{predominantly}} {{on small}} teleost fishes (including threadfin breams and lizardfishes) and crustaceans (including penaeid prawns and mantis shrimps); cephalopods are also <b>infrequently</b> consumed. Known parasites {{of this species}} include the tapeworm Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, and a nematode in the genus Pulchrascaris.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has no {{economic}} value. It is very <b>infrequently</b> caught in commercial purse seines and bottom trawls targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|A {{generally}} malevolent entity, the boobrie typically preys on livestock being transported on ships, {{but it is}} also fond of otters, {{of which}} it consumes a considerable number. In its manifestation as a water horse the creature is able to gallop across the top of lochs as if on solid ground. During the summer months it is seen <b>infrequently</b> as a large insect, sucking the blood of horses.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so <b>infrequently.</b> The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|After his service, Wensloff {{returned}} to the New York Yankees for the 1947 season. He made his first appearance {{at the start of}} June and pitched despite having a sore arm throughout the season, pitching <b>infrequently.</b> In 11 games with the Yankees, Wensloff compiled a record of 3–1 with a 2.61 ERA and 18 strikeouts in 51⅔ innings pitched, and pitched two innings of one game in the 1947 World Series.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14 in 1904, Kilner {{reached the}} Mitchell Main first team. Although {{selected}} regularly from 1905, Kilner was not particularly successful with the bat. He displayed aggression but often attempted difficult shots and consequently lost his wicket. His bowling was more effective but used <b>infrequently.</b> By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Cardinals who {{simultaneously}} {{were also}} bishops usually {{appear in the}} documents with both titles: cardinalitial and episcopal. The only exceptions are archbishop Uberto Crivelli of Milan, who subscribed papal bulls only as cardinal, and Ruggiero of Benevento, who generally was styled only as archbishop, while his cardinalate was mentioned very <b>infrequently.</b>|$|E
5|$|Djawadi {{said that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the main title music by an early version of the series's computer-animated title sequence. The title music is reprised as a global theme {{in the rest of the}} soundtrack, initially <b>infrequently</b> and as part of the theme of individual characters, then in full towards the end of season 1 during particularly important scenes.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its limited}} {{distribution}} and similarity to other Adiantum species within its range, {{little is known}} of its ecology. It thrives on sunny, disturbed areas where ultramafic rock is covered with thin soil, such as road cuts, talus slopes, and asbestos mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only <b>infrequently</b> reach maturity. It {{is one of four}} species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, <b>infrequently,</b> below) their squad numbers.|$|E
5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is <b>infrequently</b> punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change {{is marked by a}} pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though <b>infrequently</b> encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), {{but it can}} also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has a preference for neutral to calcareous soils.|$|E
5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs {{up and down}} the peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run <b>infrequently</b> and, due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E
5|$|Outside its {{breeding}} season, the russet sparrow is gregarious {{and forms}} flocks to find food, though it <b>infrequently</b> associates with other birds. Wintering flocks tend {{to keep away}} from human habitation. The russet sparrow is also social at night during the winter, and it forms large communal roosts in trees and bushes. In the breeding season, the female roosts in the nests and the male nests in foliage nearby.|$|E
5|$|Raonic {{is often}} {{compared}} to Isner and Karlović. The trio possess statistically dominant serves, leading the ATP in service games won and in aces per match {{in the period}} between 2012 and 2015. They have played each other <b>infrequently,</b> however. Raonic is 1–1 against Karlović and 1–3 against Isner. Karlović holds a 3–2 head-to-head advantage over Isner.|$|E
5|$|The Lebanese Air Force {{operated}} Hawker Hunters from 1958 to 2014. A Lebanese Hunter {{shot down}} an Israeli jet over Kfirmishki {{in the early}} 1960s; its pilot was captured by the Lebanese Armed Forces. One Hunter was shot down {{on the first day}} of the Six-Day War by the Israeli Air Force. They were used <b>infrequently</b> during the Lebanese Civil War, and eventually fell out of usage and went into storage during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores are smooth, elliptical, {{and measure}} 20–26 by 13–18µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical, eight-spored, hyaline (translucent) when mounted in dilute (2%) {{potassium}} hydroxide (KOH), and measure 225–330 by 15–25µm. Paraphyses are cylindrical to capitate or moniliform, measuring 95–250 long by 10–25µm wide, and are septate. Their tips are rounded to somewhat club-shaped or <b>infrequently</b> somewhat fuse-shaped. Elements on the sterile ridges are 50–175 by 12.5–20µm, and septate. The terminal cells are club-shaped or nearly so.|$|E
5|$|The harm {{inflicted by}} cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself {{is too small to}} be of value, and is only <b>infrequently</b> taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} soars for hours effortlessly, only {{flapping}} its wings <b>infrequently.</b> While in flight, its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips, {{and from a}} distance the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of courtship behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Walton's {{only other}} opera, The Bear, {{based on a}} comic {{vaudeville}} by Chekhov, is judged by critics as much more successful. It is, however, a one-act piece, a genre not regularly staged at most opera houses, and so is <b>infrequently</b> seen. Operabase records four productions of the piece worldwide between 2013 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also <b>infrequently</b> enter its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively <b>infrequently</b> involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. <b>Infrequently,</b> polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place <b>infrequently.</b> The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so <b>infrequently,</b> it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the paucity of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{rotation}} of the Earth, tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere tend to move from east to west. This causes tropical cyclones to approach the West Coast of the United States <b>infrequently.</b> Another inhibiting factor for a California landfall is the water temperatures. Because of the water currents, the waters off California are rarely above , which is too cold for hurricanes to sustain themselves. This tropical cyclone was rare enough that only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones brought tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States during the twentieth century. The Long Beach Tropical Storm was the only one to make landfall; the other three hit Mexico before moving north.|$|E
5|$|Encounters with tawny nurse sharks {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers {{are able to}} approach the sharks closely and even touch and play with them without incident. However, this species has been <b>infrequently</b> provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, and extremely powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E
5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise. This is argued to be due, in part, to a more mature reading of the character's lines from Sylvia Anderson, who provided Penelope's voice from the first episode of the Thunderbirds television series. Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham, particularly his reading of Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear <b>infrequently</b> in the film.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver {{is a source}} of vitamin oil, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only <b>infrequently</b> caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only <b>infrequently</b> improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, White Dog was {{edited for}} a direct-to-television {{broadcast}} and made available purchase by cable channels. The following year, NBC bought broadcast rights for $2.5 million and slated {{the film to}} air during the February sweeps, then canceled the broadcast two days later due to pressure from the continuing NAACP campaign and concerns of a negative reaction by both viewers and advertisers. The film was eventually aired on other cable channels such as HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel sporadically and without fanfare. It was also <b>infrequently</b> screened at independent film houses and film festivals.|$|E
5|$|In North American waters, the finetooth shark {{is common}} and found from North Carolina to the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and very occasionally straying {{as far north as}} New York. In Central and South American waters, it is rare, but may occur more widely than presently known, having been reported off Trinidad and Guyana, <b>infrequently</b> from the Caribbean Sea, and off southern Brazil from São Paulo to Santa Catarina. The northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South America populations are distinct, with little interchange between them. Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, but these likely represent misidentifications of spinner sharks (C. brevipinna).|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{continental}} {{margins and}} oceanic waters at depths of , the {{bigeye sand tiger}} may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so <b>infrequently</b> that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Kapadia {{continued}} working <b>infrequently</b> {{through the}} 1990s and the 2000s. She played a minor part in Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and was noted for her {{portrayal of the}} title role in the American production Leela (2002). Some of her later film credits include leading roles in Hum Kaun Hai? (2004), Pyaar Mein Twist (2005), Phir Kabhi (2008) and Tum Milo Toh Sahi (2010), and supporting roles in Being Cyrus (2005), Luck by Chance (2009), Dabangg (2010), Cocktail (2012) and Finding Fanny (2014). Kapadia {{is the mother of}} Twinkle Khanna and Rinke Khanna, both former actresses.|$|E
