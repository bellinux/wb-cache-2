50|$|The <b>guidance</b> <b>antenna</b> on the Atlas {{performed}} poorly, below specifications. When {{the signal}} {{received by the}} rocket became weak and noisy, the rocket lost its lock on the ground guidance signal that supplied steering commands. The possibility had been foreseen; {{in the event that}} radio guidance was lost the internal guidance computer was supposed to reject the spurious signals from the faulty antenna and proceed on its stored program, which would probably have resulted in a successful launch. At this point a second fault took effect. Somehow a hyphen had been dropped from the guidance program loaded aboard the computer, allowing the flawed signals to command the rocket to veer left and nose down. The hyphen had been missing on previous successful flights of the Atlas, but that portion of the equation had not been needed since there was no radio guidance failure.|$|E
50|$|The vernier solo phase, {{which would}} be used on ICBMs to {{fine-tune}} the missile velocity after sustainer cutoff, was eliminated from the guidance program {{in the interest of}} simplicity as well as improved performance and lift capacity. Since orbital flights required an extremely different flight path from missiles, the <b>guidance</b> <b>antennas</b> had to be completely redesigned to ensure maximum signal strength. The posigrade rocket motors {{on the top of the}} Atlas, designed to push the spent missile away from the warhead, were moved to the Mercury capsule itself. This also necessitated adding a fiberglass insulation shield to the LOX tank dome so it wouldn't be ruptured by the rocket motors.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{launcher}} {{system was}} based on two carriages adapted from the 34mm Flab.Kan. 38, a pre-war design that would {{be replaced by the}} famed 35mm KD series gun in the post-war era. One carriage held the radar and <b>guidance</b> radio <b>antenna</b> on a rotating mount, and the other held the missile in a trapeze-like framework of some complexity.|$|R
50|$|Using two top mounted, {{mechanically}} scanned, parabolic {{target acquisition}} radars, the fire control system provides a 360 degree field of view, {{as well as}} IFF. The target engagement radar is a Passive electronically scanned array antenna of the reflection type mounted {{on the front of}} the fire control system with a 60 degree field of view. Much like its land based sibling, the target engagement radar can track and guide eight missiles on up to four targets at once and is effective to a range of 1.5-12 km and an altitude of 10-6000 m. The system has a reaction time of 8-24 seconds, depending on the mode of operation, and is managed by a crew of 13. Additional missile <b>guidance</b> <b>antennae</b> can be seen around the fire control system and the 3K95, like the upgraded Tor launchers, is equipped with a secondary infrared guidance system. The 3R95 can also provide fire control information for the vessels AK-630 close in weapons systems (CIWS) providing a second line of defence should anything penetrate the missile layer.|$|R
50|$|Automatic <b>guidance</b> for the <b>antenna,</b> {{and thus}} any slaved guns or weapons, {{can be added}} to a conical scan radar without too much trouble. The control system has to steer the antenna such that a {{constant}} amplitude return is received from the target.|$|R
40|$|The {{work has}} been devoted to the {{investigation}} of the ways of the accuracy of improvement and the development of the algorithmic ensurance for solving the problem of the program quidance in the ship object with the aid of the ship radiotechnical complexes during the whole period of communication, including the zenith region. For the first time, the <b>antenna</b> <b>guidance</b> control system of the ship radiotechnical complexes (SRTC) is being realized by the CVM means. The method of synthesis of the SRTC antenna quidance contour, the universal structure of the guidance contour, ensuring its optimation in accuracy with the stabilization error to be considered, the method of reduction of the required speeds of the <b>antenna</b> <b>guidance</b> drives, using the unlinear control in the zenith region have been offered.

A physical-optics model is developed to calculate the near-field data at the focal plane. A 70 cm offset reflector antenna comparable to a standard satellite TV set has been our study case. As a starting point in our design process, we have investigated the optimal size of the focal plane array (FPA) for offset reflector antennas and achievable scan ranges. This study gives the <b>guidance</b> to the <b>antenna</b> designer for optimal FPA size, the proper F/DP and the required number of array elements...|$|R
5000|$|Titan was {{originally}} planned for a 1 X 10 (one control center with 10 launchers) [...] "soft" [...] site. In mid-1958 {{it was decided}} that the American Bosh Arma all-inertial guidance system designed for Titan would, because production was insufficient, be assigned to Atlas and the Titan would switch to radio-inertial guidance. The decision was made to deploy Titan squadrons in a [...] "hardened" [...] 3 X 3 (3 sites with one control center and 3 silos each) {{to reduce the number of}} guidance systems required. (radio-inertial guided Atlas D squadrons were similarly sited). The Titan I was first American ICBM based in underground silos, and it gave USAF managers, contractors and missile crews valuable experience building and working in vast complexes containing everything the missiles and crews needed for operation and survival. The complexes were composed of an Entry Portal, Control Center, Powerhouse, Terminal Room, two Antenna Silos for the ATHENA <b>guidance</b> radar <b>antennas,</b> and three launchers each composed of: three Equipment Terminals, three Propellant Terminals, and three missile Silos. All connected by an extensive network of Tunnels. Both Antenna Terminals and all three Launchers were isolated with double door Blast Locks to ensure that if there was an explosion or the site was under attack, that only the exposed antenna and/or missile silo would be damaged.|$|R
50|$|Conical {{scanning}} is {{a system}} used in early radar units to improve their accuracy, as well as {{making it easier to}} steer the antenna properly to point at a target. Conical scanning is similar in concept to the earlier lobe switching concept used on some of the earliest radars, and many examples of lobe switching sets were modified in the field to conical scanning during World War II, notably the German WÃ¼rzburg radar. <b>Antenna</b> <b>guidance</b> can be made entirely automatic, as in the American SCR-584. Potential failure modes and susceptibility to deception jamming led to the replacement of conical scan systems with monopulse radar sets. They are still used by the Deep Space Network for maintaining communications links to space probes. The spin-stabilized Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 probes used onboard conical scanning maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis extends previously developed self-tuning adaptive control algorithms {{to be applied}} to a scenario where multiple vehicles autonomously form a communication chain which maximizes the bandwidth of a wireless sensor network. In the simulated scenario, multiple unmanned aerial vehicles are guided to positions that optimize communication links between multiple ground <b>antennas.</b> <b>Guidance</b> is provided by a self-tuning extremum controller, which uses adaptive techniques to autonomously guide a vehicle to the optimal location with respect to a cost function in an uncertain and noisy environment. In the case of high-bandwidth communication, this optimal location is the point where signal-to-noise ratio is maximized between two antennas. Using UAVs as relay nodes, an optimized communication chain allows for greater communication range and bandwidth across a network. Control system models are developed and tested using computer and hardware-in-the-loop simulations, which will be validated with a flight test at a future date. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of the attitude of unmanned aerial ve-hicles (UAVs) is crucial for their control and displacement. Errors in the attitude estimate may misuse the limited bat-tery energy of UAVs or even cause an accident. For at-titude estimation, proprioceptive sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely applied, but they are susceptible to inertial <b>guidance</b> error. With <b>antenna</b> arrays currently being installed in UAVs for communication with ground base stations, we {{can take advantage of}} the array structure in order to improve the estimates of IMUs. In the state-of-the-art attitude estimation algorithm, the first crucial step is phase delay estimation, which di-rectly affects the attitude estimation performance. In this paper, by exploiting the parallelogram shape of the cross-shaped antenna array, a 2 -D unitary ESPRIT is used for phase delay estimation to achieve high attitude accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Moreover, we relax the known yaw to unknown case by adding an additional pair of antennas along the normal direction of the body-wing plane. The extension from one frequency bin to the case of multiple frequency bins is also included. Simulations show the feasibility of our proposed solution for different SNR levels as well as multipath scenarios...|$|R

Errors in the attitude estimate may misuse the limited battery energy of UAVs or even cause an accident. For attitude estimation, proprioceptive sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely applied, but they are susceptible to inertial <b>guidance</b> error. With <b>antenna</b> arrays currently being installed in UAVs for communication with ground base stations, we {{can take advantage of}} the array structure in order to improve the estimates of IMUs via data fusion. In this paper, we therefore propose an attitude estimation system based on a hexagon-shaped 7 -element electronically steerable parasitic antenna radiator (ESPAR) array. The ESPAR array is well-suited for installment in the UAVs with broad wings and short bodies. Our proposed solution returns an estimation for the pitch and roll based on the inter-element phase delay estimates of the line-of-sight path of the impinging signal over the antenna array. By exploiting the parallel and centrosymmetric structure in the hexagon-shaped ESPAR array, the 3 -dimensional Unitary ESPRIT algorithm is applied for phase delay estimation to achieve high accuracy as well as computational efficiency. We devise an attitude estimation algorithm by exploiting the geometrical relationship between the UAV attitude and the estimated phase delays. An analytical closed-form expression of the attitude estimates are obtained by solving the established simultaneous nonlinear equations. Simulations results show th...|$|R
40|$|The {{ferroelectric}} reflectarray is a {{new type}} of scanning antenna under development for space and ground communications and radar applications at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The reflectarray offers tremendous cost, gain, and efficiency advantages in comparison to the state-of-the-art phased arrays, but there is an inherent intersymbol interference (ISI) problem with digital communication data streams processed through the array {{because of the way the}} reflectarray is operated. This interference stems from the fact that the antenna beam is formed by the superposition of reflected waves from the array elements. The delays from the elements to the observation point of each wave differ. Ferroelectric phase shifters are designed to compensate for the modulo- 2 p phase differences so that the waves will constructively interfere at the sinusoidal carrier level; however, the delays of the integer-number multiple of the carrier period are not compensated for. This lack of compensation causes ISI in digital modulated signals. ISI has not been a problem with analog modulations and low-rate digital modulations since the distortion (or ISI) introduced is negligible. The problem becomes acute when the data rate gets higher, and the electrical size of the array gets bigger. Moreover, there are intrinsic transient effects associated with the phase shifters and the controller that executes the algorithm to direct the beam. That is, phase shifter updates to redirect the beam may be initiated simultaneously, but nonlinearity will cause different settling times. The ISI problem and other effects ultimately limit the size (gain) and data rate of the reflectarray. An ISI analysis was required to prove or disprove the suitability of the reflectarray antenna for high-rate digitally modulated signals and to give <b>guidance</b> for determining <b>antenna</b> parameters. In this research, the nature of the ISI of the reflectarray has been mathematically modeled...|$|R
