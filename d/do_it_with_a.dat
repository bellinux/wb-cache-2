5|$|On September 16, 2007, Thome {{joined the}} 500 home run club by hitting a walk-off home run against Los Angeles Angels pitcher Dustin Moseley. Thome became the 23rd major leaguer {{to reach the}} {{milestone}} and the third in the 2007 MLB season (the others were Frank Thomas and Alex Rodriguez), {{as well as the}} first ever to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> walk-off home run. Several family members including his father were on hand to witness the accomplishment, which occurred at a game during which the White Sox distributed free Thome bobbleheads to fans. Thome celebrated by pointing upward in homage to his late mother as he rounded the bases.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|Second dealing {{can also}} be done when the cards are dealt from a dealing shoe, such as in many casino games. In this case the dealer will push the top card upwards and strike the {{partially}} exposed second card.

And, if it does get out, to the extent it does, he says it's a {{protective}} reaction strike. He is to describe it as protective reaction. And he doesn’t have to spell it out. They struck, that's all he needs, a SAM site. A protective reaction strike against a SAM site.|$|E
500|$|Stoddart {{works as}} a civic-monumentalist for Scotland, and {{described}} the need his work fills thus: [...] "We need serious monuments which don't have the Braveheart touch. If we're to be a nation, we need that. Fletcher of Saltoun is absolutely urgent if we're to show we mean business. We don't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stupid Parliament building {{that looks like a}} Barcelona-inspired cafeteria. It's a bloody outrage." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2012, Scott Weiland {{remarked that}} he would like to reunite {{permanently}} with Velvet Revolver, saying that [...] "if Maynard James Keenan can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>A</b> Perfect Circle and Tool, then there’s no reason why I shouldn’t go and do it with both bands". Further in May in an interview with ABC Radio Weiland said that he had reunited with the band permanently for a tour and an album, which however was denied a few days later by Slash in an interview with 93X.|$|E

500|$|On Memorial Day {{weekend in}} 2006, Cher called into C-SPAN's Washington Journal {{endorsing}} Operation Helmet, {{a group that}} provides helmets to help soldiers avoid head injuries while in the war zone. On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what they think is right. They do what they're told to do. They <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> really good heart. They do the best they can. They don't ask for anything." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Alisha Grauso of Forbes {{discussed}} the series and its ratings, describing {{the show as}} having [...] "never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be...It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within {{the continuity of the}} larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even harder to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the larger world while still being its own thing." [...] Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the Marvel-Netflix shows) or on just being [...] "support and tie-in {{to the world of the}} Avengers". Grauso concluded, [...] "The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world." ...|$|E
500|$|Eckhart's {{next project}} was Thank You for Smoking, {{in which he}} played Nick Naylor, a tobacco {{lobbyist}} whose firm researched the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: [...] "You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{smile on your face}} and have the audience like you. At one point, I'm doing a talk show with a kid who's dying of cancer, and he's going through chemotherapy and the whole thing, and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I'm the good guy, and I'm this guy's best friend. I mean, it's whacked out." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of USA Today wrote that he gave a [...] "standout, whip-smart performance" [...] citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him [...] "likable even in his cynicism." [...] In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of the film, it was reported that [...] "Under his chummy but compassionless smile" [...] Eckhart radiated charm and [...] "Naylor's true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to stylistic touches, the episode established several narrative motifs that stayed with Homicide: Life on the Street throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among them was the white board where detectives kept the names of their open cases in red and their closed cases in black. The names of NBC employees and friends of the Homicide crew were used on the white board. The episode was noted for its deliberate lack of gunplay and car chases in favor of dialogue and story. Levinson and Fontana also allowed humor to be incorporated into the show, particularly through the interactions between the detectives; Levinson said of the first episode, [...] "We have to inform the audience, {{but at the same time}} you want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sense of humor so you don't seem too pretentious, in a way." [...] Several long-standing character traits were established in [...] "Gone for Goode", including Kay Howard's extraordinary streak of solved cases and the antagonism between Felton and Pembleton, which is demonstrated when the two argue loudly after being assigned to a case together. The animosity between Felton and Pembleton is based on the real-life Detective Donald Kincaid, who was the inspiration behind Felton, and the strong dislike Kincaid had for Harry Edgerton, as chronicled in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Howard's perfect streak is based on a similar (although shorter) lucky streak experienced by the real-life Detective Rich Garvey, who is also featured in David Simon's book.|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 1961, {{some months}} after Fidel Castro {{declared}} Cuba a socialist state, Costa Rican President Mario Echandi ended {{diplomatic relations with}} Cuba through Executive Decree Number 2. This freeze lasted 47 years until President Óscar Arias Sánchez re-established normal relations on 18 March 2009, saying, [...] "If {{we have been able}} to turn the page with regimes as profoundly different to our reality as occurred with the USSR or, more recently, with the Republic of China, how would we not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> country that is geographically and culturally much nearer to Costa Rica?" [...] Arias announced that both countries would exchange ambassadors.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, Ryan stated, [...] "It's {{going to}} be a CBS procedural. We're going to solve a case every week, but we're going to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of humor and a lot of fun. And I would say the stealth thing I would like to get in is, in a day and age when income {{inequality}} and class inequities dominate a lot of the country, this is {{going to be}} an opportunity to put a young working-class kid in Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills, you can do a lot of stealth social commentary. My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} {{of the success of the}} Daly, Benson and Asche productions, the play began to be {{performed}} with much more frequency all over the world. A celebrated early twentieth-century Katherina was Margaret Anglin, who first performed the role in 1908 in Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne. Acting opposite Henry Kolker in a production she herself directed, Anglin is generally regarded as the first actress to have performed Katherina's final speech in an ironic manner. The play was a huge success in Australia, and in 1914, Anglin brought it on tour to New York. Of the last scene, Anglin wrote [...] "when I run gaily in to do my lord's bidding in the last act, I <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> twinkle in my eye. I don't play it as Shakespeare wrote that last scene." [...] In a 1909 Max Reinhardt directed production at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, starring Lucie Höflich and Albert Bassermann, the Induction was emphasised and the play was presented as a commedia dell'arte style farce, to the point of the male leads literally wearing clown costumes.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, IGN {{named the}} Xbox 360 the sixth-greatest video game console of all time, {{out of a}} field of 25. Although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar {{to be the most}} influential, by {{emphasizing}} digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live, and by popularizing game achievement awards. PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it [...] "proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space". Five years after the Xbox 360's original debut, the well-received Kinect motion capture camera was released, which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history, and extended the life of the console. Edge ranked Xbox 360 the second-best console of the 1993–2013 period, stating [...] "It had its own social network, cross-game chat, new indie games every week, and the best version of just about every multiformat game...Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza, but it's not about the exclusives—there's nothing to trump Naughty Dog's PS3 output, after all. Rather, it's about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xbox's lifetime. The PC-like architecture meant those early EA Sports titles ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3, Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list, and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer next-generation exclusive. And when developers demo games on PC now they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 360 pad—another industry benchmark, and a critical one." ...|$|E
