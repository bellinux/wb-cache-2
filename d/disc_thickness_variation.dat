40|$|Abstract: An {{analytical}} {{formulation of}} the brake judder problem caused by <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> is described by using a simplified source–path–receiver model. Eigenvalue analysis is first conducted to determine the transfer mechanism from the brake source to the steering-wheel receiver. Calculations show that the peak vibration levels of the steering wheel are seen when the rotational frequency of the tyre coincides with the resonant frequency of the transfer path; in this case, only the first-order <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> is considered. The effects of two key parameters, associated with the source and the path respectively, are analytically and computationally studied. Analysis suggests that the lower pad stiffness and/or the higher bushing stiffness should effectively reduce the vibration levels. Finally, a new vibration control concept is proposed that modulates the actuation pressure; {{it is based on}} an approximate solution for the angular displacement of the disc in the model developed here. Preliminary work indicates that this concept could be very effective in reducing the receiver vibration level without sacrificing the brake performance...|$|E
2500|$|This type of <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> {{has many}} causes, {{but there are}} three primary {{mechanisms}} which contribute the most to the propagation of <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> connected to uneven pad transfer. The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.|$|R

Thermal energy {{generated}} by the friction between the disc and pad is transferred to both components and causes thermal expansion of material of each component, and futher affects the friction contact condition.

This project studied the transient thermal behavior of a disc brake system during the braking phase and the followed releasing period. A three-dimensional finite element model with a moving heat source was developed with COMSOL Multiphysics to predict the temperature distribution in the disc braking system, including two pads, a rotor disc, bolts, and a section of the shaft. The maximum surface temperature on the contact surface has been found to increase in the braking period and then decrease as the rotor slows down and further decrease during the releasing period. The maximum temperature on the contact surface depends on both the car velocity and deceleration rate. The effects of convective and radiative heat transfer are also studied. It is found that heat is mainly dissipated through convective heat transfer at the disc surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Brake judder is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} that typically occurs in vehicles. The judder frequency is {{directly proportional to}} the revolution speed of the wheel and therefore also to the velocity of the vehicle. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and structure floor. Brake judder can be split into two distinct groups – “hot” and “cold” judder, both {{of which can be}} classified as a mechanically induced vibration. Until recently research efforts regarding brake judder have been overshadowed by other brake related issues such as brake noise for example squeal and groan. This research studies the cold judder by using brake judder test rig (half vehicle). After applying three different pressures (5 bar, 10 bar, 16 bar) for each speed (420 rpm, 330 rpm, 250 rpm and 165 rpm), the results show that at 10 bar and 16 bar give a high vibration amplitude that leads to uncomfortable feeling. The result of non-contact displacement sensors show that the <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> (DTV), disc surface waviness and side run-out (SRO) combination is the cause of brake judder. After inserting a 3 mm thick round rubber between the pad and the caliper the magnitude of vibration atthe axial steering direction for velocity of 250 rpm and 420 rpm, and brake pressure of 16 bar changed from fairly uncomfortable region to little uncomfortable region and the magnitude of vibration of brake pedal changed from uncomfortable region to fairly uncomfortable region...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade vehicle judder caused by <b>Disc</b> <b>Thickness</b> <b>Variation</b> (DTV) has become of major concern to {{automobile}} manufacturers worldwide. Judder is usually perceived by the driver as minor to severe vibrations transferred through the chassis during braking [1 - 9]. In this research, DTV is investigated via {{the use of a}} Smart Brake Pad (SBP). The SBP is a tool that will enable engineers to better understand the processes which occur in the harsh and confined environment that exists between the brake pad and disc whilst braking. It is also a tool that will enable engineers to better understand the causes of DTV and stick-slip the initiators of low and high frequency vibration in motor vehicle brakes. Furthermore, the technology can equally be used to solve many other still remaining mysteries in automotive, aerospace, rail or anywhere where two surfaces may come in contact. The SBP consists of sensors embedded into an automotive brake pad enabling it to measure pressure between the brake pad and disc whilst braking. The two sensor technologies investigated were Thick Film (TF) and Fibre Optic (FO) technologies. Each type was tested individually using a Material Testing System (MTS) at room and elevated temperatures. The chosen SBP was then successfully tested in simulated driving conditions. A preliminary mathematical model was developed and tested for the TF sensor and a novel Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model for the FO sensor.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{research efforts}} regarding brake judder has been overshadowed by other brake related {{issues such as}} brake noise for example squeal and groan. Although brake noise still remains a problem for vehicle manufacturers, past research effort {{has led to a}} greater understanding of its mechanism and solutions are now more readily available. This is not the case with brake "judder" as past research has been less focussed towards its occurrence or cause. As brake performance and reduced packaging demands increase then the thermal issues of braking become more of an issue. It is this aspect of thermal judder, rather than cold judder, which is most difficult to investigate as this can manifest itself as high frequency (often referred to as drone) or low frequency excitation, the latter causing excessive vibration in the suspension and steering systems. The focus of this research is the analysis of thermo-elastic instability after both high energy braking and prolonged drag braking. Both types of braking result in high energy input into the brake rotor. The principal issue is that the rise in temperature, under some conditions, is localised with temperatures exceeding 730 ºC. If this is followed by rapid cooling, then a phase change in the brake rotor material results. This phase change in the metallurgical structure of the rotor may be seen {{on the surface of the}} rotor as dark areas which are referred to as "hot spots" or `blue spots´. The resulting increase in grain growth associated with these localised areas causes a further increase in temperature and so the process continues. The disc surface becomes a series of raised areas giving localised <b>disc</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>variation.</b> It is during a subsequent light braking application that judder occurs due to the DTV with a high order of vibration - or "drone". The paper is aimed at detailing the preliminary vehicle testing which has been performed which will allow for accurate validation of dynamometer testing and computational analysis. Promising results have been obtained and are presented and discussed. Conclusions have been drawn with recommendations for further work...|$|E

40|$|Brake judder is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} occurring {{in different types}} of vehicles. The frequency can {{be as high as}} 500 Hz, but usually remains below 100 Hz and often as low as 10 - 20 Hz. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and floor. In the higher frequency range, the structural vibrations are accompanied by a sound. Note that a phenomenological definition (i. e {{forced vibration}}) of brake judder is used. Hence, the low frequency brake vibrations, creep groan (related to stick-slip) and dynamic groan (an instability phenomenon), are not studied in this work. The vibration starts with medium to heavy braking from high speed and remains until low speed, if the brakes are continuously applied. There is a considerable amplification of the judder vibration near certain critical vehicle speeds. This behavior has been successfully simulated by the amplitude function technique, which was developed within the project. The method is specially designed for theoretical analysis of forced vibrations like brake judder. The use of amplitude functions was also found to be valuable when analyzing measured vibrations in a braking vehicle. Brake torque variation (BTV) and brake pressure variation (BPV) are the primary excitation mechanisms for judder vibrations. While BPV causes vibrations mostly in the hydraulic system, BTV is believed to be responsible for vibrations in the vehicle structure. This work concentrates on the vibrations caused by BPV; direct effects of BPV like pedal vibrations are not studied. BTV arises mostly as a result of permanent or reversible, geometrical defects, e. g. DTV (<b>Disc</b> <b>Thickness</b> <b>Variation)</b> of disc brakes and shape deviations of drum brakes. DTV in turn is affected by manufacturing tolerances, disc runout, thermal coning and buckling of the disc, uneven disc wear, uneven friction film generation, uneven heating and Thermo-Elastic Instabilities (TEI). Verifying measurements were made on a street-going vehicle with strong first order DTV on one of its front brakes. The measured vibration variation during braking was predicted almost exactly by a rotor-stator model, exposed to a sinusoidal BTV with a sweeping frequency due to the finite deceleration. However, the maximal measured vibration level was seen to vary considerably compared to the predicted value. A full vehicle model, including the aerodynamic drag etc., combined with a more accurate signal analysis, was found to improve the absolute vibration level prediction, especially at low decelerations. Most of the remaining differences at low deceleration levels are believed to be caused {{by the fact that the}} relative BTV of the calculations was approximated by the measured relative BPV level. At high brake pressure levels, the relative BPV level becomes too low (less than 5 %) to admit a reliable estimation. Besides, the estimation of the correction terms due to aerodynamic drag etc. affects the theoretical vibration level. To avoid all this, one should try to measure the brake torque directly. However, measuring the BPV level is useful if one wishes to estimate the instantaneous DTV level in a braking vehicle. This is possible if a relevant pad compression model is available. It was found that a pad stiffness that increases with the brake pressure was able to explain the measured BPV level dependence on the absolute brake level. For such a pad stiffness characteristic, an increase of the DTV level (whatever reason) by 50 % might result in more than a 100 % increase in the corresponding BPV and BTV levels. Hence, a progressive pad is more sensitive to increases of the DTV level than a linear pad would be...|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} brake-induced {{noises and}} vibrations, hot judder is forced vibration, which is caused by {{unevenness}} of the brake disc due to the thermal mechanical interactions in wheel brakes. Brake disc unevenness is normally described and evaluated as the <b>Disc</b> <b>Thickness</b> <b>Variation</b> (DTV) and the disc’ Lateral Run-Out (LRO). DTV and LRO gener-ate Brake Pressure Variation (BPV) and Brake Torque Variation (BTV) in wheel brakes, which are transmitted to the driver and perceived by the driver as the brake pedal pulsa-tion, the steering wheel oscillation, the car body vibrations, and low-frequency drone noises inside a vehicle. Hot judder is characterized by hot spots on the disc surfaces. The frequency of hot judder {{is dependent on the}} wheel rotational speed, showing order behaviors. The num-ber of hot spots generally corresponds to the dominant order of hot judder. In the last decades, most of the hot judder tests have been carried out with brake dynamometers, and high numbers (typically around 10) of hot spots were found in the majority of the tests. The generation and development mechanisms of the high dominant order have been almost the exclusive focus of current hot judder researches. However, the influ-ences of the vibrations and noises (with higher frequencies compared with the low-order cold judder) caused by high-order hot judder on the driver’s subjective perception have been still not clarified. That is to say, it is still unknown in which form and under which conditions, the high-order hot judder can be transmitted to and perceived by the driver, and thus causing customer complaints. A top-down approach is used in order to investigate the influences of high-order judder on driver’s perception with respect to two aspects: the incidence of high-order hot jud-der in vehicle tests and the drivers’ perception of high-order hot judder. The first aspect is mainly investigated by studying the transferability of dynamometer tests to vehicle tests and by identifying the incidence of high-order hot judder in production brakes. Specifically, identical brakes from one front brake and one rear brake are separately tested with a brake dynamometer and through vehicle tests by means of road tests and chassis dynamometer tests, and all brakes of four production passengers are identified with accelerometers attached on the brake caliper and the caliper bracket. The perception of high-order hot judder is chiefly studied by investigating its transfer behaviors. Global transfer functions from BPV/BTV to the selected driver interface quantities (brake pedal pulsation, steering wheel oscillation, seat track vibrations, and vehicle interior drone noise) are defined, which establish the links between the hot judder intensity in the wheel brake and the intensity at the driver interface. In order to identify the transfer functions with a high signal-noise-ratio and better reproducibility, a novel testing method is adopted: vehicle tests with brake discs that are artificially modi-fied with the desired surface shapes simulating the high-order DTV/LRO. Altogether three vehicles with seven different modified discs are tested. Two critical levels of drone noise (60 and 80 dB(A)) are selected according to the general vehicle total noise level and the human’s perception characteristics of sound. The perception threshold values of the driver interface vibrations are obtained through regression analysis between their subjective ratings and objective measurements. Based on the critical drone noise levels and the threshold values of vibrations, as well as the global transfer functions, threshold values of BPV and BTV for perceiving the high-order judder are computed. Concerning the incidence of high-order judder, both the dominant order and the thermal increases of BTV and BPV for the dominant order showed great discrepancies in differ-ent test types (e. g. brake dynamometer or vehicle, drag braking application with con-stant velocity and constant pressure/torque or stop braking application with decreasing velocity and constant deceleration/pressure). Hot judder behaviors in the brake dyna-mometer test were not transferable to the vehicle tests. Besides, no evident high-order hot judder has been identified in all the brakes of the four passenger cars. Generally, hot judder seems to be more likely to be excited at the brake dynamometer than in the vehi-cles. Therefore, brake dynamometer test is still appropriate for detecting hot judder in the early phase of brake development, and thus preventing its occurrence in the vehicle. Regarding the driver’s perception, the drone noise is the most probable reason leading to customer complaints, since higher than 100 Hz less than 10 Nm BTV is required to perceive the drone noise and 50 Nm BTV can already result in unacceptable drone noise. The driver is less sensitive to the vibrations caused by high-order judder. Roughly at least 20 Nm BTV or 2. 5 bar BPV is needed for perceiving the vibrations, and the perception is most possibly due to the steering wheel oscillation or the vertical vehicle vibration. Moreover, some resonances in the transfer paths {{play a significant role in}} the high-order judder transmission. Although the investigations in this work are limited to three vehicles, the practical significance of high-order hot judder on the driver’s percep-tion is revealed for the first time. With these results, the impact of the measured BTV and BPV of hot judder, e. g. in the brake dynamometer tests, can be assessed. Combining these results, the most effective and efficient way to mitigate the high-order hot judder would be reducing its occurrences in the wheel brakes and diminishing the prominent resonances in the transfer paths...|$|E

40|$|In oxide chemical-mechanical {{polishing}} (CMP) processes, layout pattern dependent {{variation in the}} interlevel dielectric (ILD) thickness can reduce yield and impact circuit performance. Metal-fill patterning practices have emerged as a technique for substantially reducing layout pattern dependent ILD <b>thickness</b> <b>variation.</b> We present a generalizable methodology for selecting an optimal metal-fill patterning practice {{with the goal of}} satisfying a given dielectric <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> specification while minimizing the added interconnect capacitance associated with metal-fill patterning. Data from two industrialbased experiments demonstrate the beneficial impact of metalfill on dielectric <b>thickness</b> <b>variation,</b> a 20 % improvement in uniformity in one case and a 60 % improvement in the other case, and illustrate that pattern density is the key mechanism involved. The pros and cons of two different metal-fill patterning practices [...] -grounded versus floating metal [...] -are explored. Criteria for minimi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the interesting performance for KrF excimer laser lithography at low ki process in Rayleigh criteria. For 0. 15 /Zifi lithography process, the experiments {{have been performed}} by using resolution enhancement teclmiques(RET) such as phase shift masks(PSM), off-axis illumination(OAI), 0. 63 high NA, and high contrast resist. Especially for the gate level CD control, we have investigated the thin film interference effects of oxide, resist and BARC <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> by simulation and experimental. Also, we have experimentally compared the CD control performance and the process window with oxide <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> on actual device wafers, because the oxide <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> enhances thin film interference effects. Finally, we determined the most suitable conditions for providing sufficient protection against reflection by controlling the substrate film thickness. Furthermore, requirements for O. l 5 ILmgate level CD control are discussed...|$|R
