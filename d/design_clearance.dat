40|$|A {{stress relief}} groove is {{introduced}} in the R area and the stress is analyzed using a finite element method (FEM). Then the relief of the stress concentration {{in the vicinity of}} the pressure vessel is measured based on these results. When designing a stress relief groove, the lever must overhang the groove (L > 0). By introducing a stress relief groove to the R area, maximum stress on the lever guide can be reduced by 10 %. This enables the reduction of the maximum stress (Mises stress) to be less than the fatigue strength. Furthermore, the location where maximum stress occurs on the lever guide changes in accordance with the clearance between the lever and lever guide.

40|$|Either {{excessive}} or insufficient cement penetration {{within the}} femoral head after hip resurfacing influences {{the risk of}} femoral failures. However, the factors controlling cement penetration are not yet fully understood. We determined the effect of femoral component design and cementation technique on cement penetration. Six retrieved femoral heads were resurfaced for each implant (BHR®, ASR®, Conserve Plus®, DuROM®, ReCAP®) using the manufacturers’ recommendations for implantation. In addition, the BHR was implanted using the Conserve Plus® high-viscosity cementation technique, “BHR/hvt,” and vice versa for the Conserve, “Conserve/lvt. ” The average cement penetration was highest with BHR (65. 62 % ±  15. 16 %) compared with ASR® (12. 25 % ±  5. 12 %), Conserve Plus® (19. 43 % ±  5. 28 %), DuROM® (17. 73 % ±  3. 96 %), and ReCAP® (26. 09 % ±  5. 20 %). Cement penetration in BHR/hvt remained higher than all other implants equaling 36. 7 % ±  6. 6 %. Greater femoral component <b>design</b> <b>clearance</b> correlated with cement mantle thickness.

The gas force deformation, thermal-structure deformation and thermal-force coupling deformation were carried out by using a finite element simulation method. Results show that the clearance between the bottom of the groove and the top of star wheel is reduced by 0. 066 mm, the clearance between the side of groove and the star wheel is reduced by 0. 015 mm, and the clearance between the cylinder and the rotor is reduced by 0. 01 mm.

40|$|Longwall shearers usually {{suffer from}} {{excessive}} pick and pickholder consumptions and severe wear of the backplate of the clearance ring section of shearer drums. In practice, {{most of the}} drums were seen to be withdrawn from the face due to the abovementioned problems, while vane picks and their holders were intact due to the improper lacing <b>design</b> of the <b>clearance</b> ring picks. However, few underground investigations and their results {{on the effect of}} lacing arrangement of clearance picks on the service life of shearer drums have been published. Nevertheless, the pick consumption characteristics of shearer drums were not investigated in detail, since these are fewer pick consumptions with shearers when compared to roadheaders. This paper is concerned with the comprehensive in situ trials on the effect of lacing of clearance ring picks on the lifespan of shearer drums, and the pick consumption characteristics of longwall shearers at Cayirhan Coal Mine in Turkey. The lifespan of shearer drums employed with shearers in this mine increased 70 per cent, while the consumption rate of clearance ring picks decreased three fold through using an alternative lacing for clearance picks, indicating the significance of utilizing proper <b>design</b> techniques for <b>clearance</b> ring picks for the service life of shearer drums. Statistical analyses carried out, using the raw pick consumption data, implied that the clearance ring picks experienced much higher loads than vane picks, revealing that special attention must be paid to <b>designing</b> <b>clearance</b> ring picks.

40|$|A buckling-restrained brace (BRB) is {{composed}} of a steel core, which resists axial force, and a buckling-restraining system. A carefully <b>designed</b> <b>clearance,</b> often filled with unbonded material, is placed between the steel core and the restraining system to avoid force transfer between the two components through friction.

Although the Three-Piece-Freight-Truck is very simple in its construction, the mathematical model is not simple at all. The model is de nitely nonlinear resulting from the nonlinear kinematic and dynamical contact relations between wheels and rails, the nonlinear suspensions and the nonlinear dry friction damping. For low speeds of the truck the kinematic and dynamical nonlinearities might be linearized, but the very strongly nonlinear suspensions and the dry friction damping can not be linearized at all. The motion of the bolsters are at least two dimensional in the lateral and the vertical directions, so the friction on the surfaces of a wedge should be treated as two-dimensional dry friction, and {{the same is true for}} the dry friction on the surfaces of an adapter. For the motion with dry friction there exist two motion states: stick motion and slip motion, which leads to a discontinuity in the behaviour of the dynamical system and leads to a collapse of the state space, and consequently, change the degrees of freedom of the system repeatedly.

After constructing the mathematical and computational model of such seals, results are obtained for an application involving a rotary vane actuator for aircraft wing control surfaces. Examples are presented for both steady-state and transient conditions (steady and unsteady motion). These are followed by an extensive parametric study to establish the effects of various parameters on sealing performance, such as {{the effects of the}} seal interferences, sealed pressure, speed, <b>design</b> <b>clearances,</b> operating temperature, and the degree of lubricant starvation. Sealing performance is assessed {{on the grounds of the}} mass leakage rate, hydrodynamic friction force and extrusion size during operation. The parametric study resulted in the construction of 144 diagrams with 432 performance curves in total. Based on this, the design and operational seal-ing parameters were optimized to maximize sealing performance, that is, to minimize leakage, friction, and extrusion. There was an excellent agreement between the theoretically derived opti-mum values and those recommended semi-empirically by the seal and actuator manufacturers as initial estimates. The parametric study showed that vane seals are objects of complexmechan-ical behaviour, requiring attention to details in their design and application, not only tomaximize performance, but, primarily, to establish sufficient sealing and avoid premature failure that could prove very costly indeed...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{cryogenic}} pumps {{used for}} propellant loading at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and other NASA Centers have a bellows mechanical seal and oil bath ball bearings, {{both of which}} can be problematic and require high maintenance. Because of the extremely low temperatures, the mechanical seals are made of special materials and design, have wearing surfaces, are subject to improper installation, and commonly are a potential leak path. The ball bearings are non-precision bearings [ABEC- 1 (Annular Bearing Engineering Council) ] and are lubricated using LOX compatible oil. This oil is compatible with the propellant to prevent explosions, but does not have good lubricating properties. Due to the poor lubricity, it has been a goal of the KSC cryogenics community for the last 15 years to develop a magnetically coupled pump, which would eliminate these two potential issues. A number of projects have been attempted, but none of the pumps was a success. An off-the-shelf magnetically coupled pump (typically used with corrosive fluids) was procured that has been used for hypergolic service at KSC. The KSC Cryogenics Test Lab (CTL) operated the pump in cryogenic LN 2 as received to determine a baseline for modifications required. The pump bushing, bearings, and thrust rings failed, and the pump would not flow liquid (this is a typical failure mode that was experienced in the previous attempts). Using the knowledge gained over the years designing and building cryogenic pumps, the CTL determined alternative materials that would be suitable for use under the pump design conditions. The CTL procured alternative materials for the bearings (bronze, aluminum bronze, and glass filled PTFE) and machined new bearing bushings, sleeves, and thrust rings. The <b>designed</b> <b>clearances</b> among the bushings, sleeves, thrust rings, case, and case cover were altered once again using experience gained from previous cryogenic pump rebuilds and designs.

This work is a proof-of-concept/proof-of-operation of the pump only. Other known internal design modifications to the pump should be accomplished for the long-term use of the pump.
