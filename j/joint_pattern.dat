METHOD In Stage 1, seven local experts drafted a preliminary proposal of kinematic patterns for each lower limb joint in the sagittal, coronal, and transverse plane. In Stage 2, 13 experts from eight gait laboratories (four in the USA and four in Europe), participated in a Delphi consensus study. Consensus was defined by a pre-set cut-off point of 75 % agreement among participants. RESULTS After the first stage, 44 <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> were presented in a first survey and 29 patterns reached consensus. Consensus improved to 47 out of 48 patterns in the third survey. Only one pattern, ‘abnormal knee pattern during loading response’, did not reach consensus. The expert panel agreed to define six patterns for the knee during swing, most of them representing characteristics of a stiff knee pattern. INTERPRETATION The defined <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> can support clinical reasoning for children with CP as <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> during gait might be linked to different treatment approaches.

METHOD The experimental group consisted of 82 CP patients (57 boys; uni-/bilateral CP (n= 27 / 55); GMFCS I-III; mean age 9 years, 5 months). Thirty-two clinical raters were divided in an ‘experienced’ and ‘inexperienced’ rater group. In two classification rounds, each rater was asked to classify 3 DGA reports of 27 or 28 patients. Inter- and intrarater agreement on the 49 <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> was estimated using percentage of agreement and kappa statistics. RESULTS Twenty-eight raters completed both classification rounds. Intrarater agreement was ‘substantial’ to ‘almost perfect’ for all joints (0. 64 <ĸ< 0. 91). Interrater agreement reached similar results (0. 63 <ĸ< 0. 86), except for the knee patterns during stance (ĸ= 0. 49, ‘moderate agreement’). Experienced raters performed significantly better on patterns of the knee during stance and ankle during swing.

40|$|During a Delphi {{consensus}} study, a new joint gait {{classification system}} {{was developed for}} children with cerebral palsy (CP). This system, whose reliability and content validity have previously been established, identified 49 distinct <b>joint</b> <b>patterns.</b> The present study aims to provide a first insight toward the construct validity and clinical relevance of this classification system. The retrospective sample of convenience consisted of 286 patients with spastic CP (3 – 18 years old, GMFCS levels I–III, 166 with bilateral CP). Kinematic and kinetic trials from three-dimensional gait analysis were classified according to the definitions of the Delphi study, and one classified trial was randomly selected for each included limb (n = 446). Muscle weakness and spasticity were assessed for different muscle groups acting around the hip, knee, and ankle. Subsequently, PearsonChi square tests, Cramer’s V, and adjusted standardized residuals were calculated to explore the strength {{and direction of the}} associations between the <b>joint</b> <b>patterns,</b> and the different patient-specific characteristics (i. e., age, GMFCS level, and topographical classification) or clinical symptoms (muscle weakness and spasticity). Patient-specific characteristics showed several significant associations with the <b>patterns</b> of different <b>joints,</b> but the strength of most identified associations was weak. Apart from the knee during stance phase and the pelvis in the sagittal plane, the results systematically showed that the patterns with “minor gait deviations” were the most frequently observed. These minor deviations were found significantly more often in limbs with a lower level of spasticity and good muscle strength. Several other pathological <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> were moderately associated with weakness or spasticity, including but not limited to “outtoeing” for weakness and “intoeing” for spasticity. For the joints in the sagittal plane, significantly stronger associationswere foundwithmuscleweakness and spasticity, possibly because most of the evaluated muscles in this study mainly perform sagittal plane motions. Remarkably, the hip patterns in the coronal plane did not associate significantly with any of the investigated variables. Although further validaation is warranted, this study contributes to the construct validity of the <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> of the Delphi consensus study, by demonstrating their ability to distinguish between clinically relevant subgroups in CP. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{shoulder}} (glenohumeral) joint has {{the greatest}} range of motion of all human joints; as a result, it is particularly vulnerable to dislocation and injury. The ability to accurately measure dynamic in-vivo joint kinematics in 6 -Degrees-of-Freedom (6 -DOF) (translations and rotations) and subsequently quantify articular cartilage contact <b>patterns</b> of that <b>joint</b> has been and remains a difficult biomechanics problem. As a result, {{little is known about}} normal in-vivo glenohumeral <b>joint</b> contact <b>patterns</b> or the consequences of surgery on: shoulder joint kinematics, the soft tissue anatomy around the shoulder, and glenohumeral <b>joint</b> contact <b>patterns.</b> Additionally, the effect of quantifying glenohumeral <b>joint</b> contact <b>patterns</b> by means of proximity mapping, both with and without cartilage data is unknown. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis are to (1) describe and validate a noninvasive Dual Fluoroscopic Imaging System (DFIS) to measure dynamic shoulder joint motion; (2) describe a technique to quantify in-vivo glenohumeral <b>joint</b> contact <b>patterns</b> from the measured shoulder motion; (3) quantify normal glenohumeral <b>joint</b> contact <b>patterns</b> in the young healthy adult; (4) compare glenohumeral <b>joint</b> contact <b>patterns</b> determined both with and without articular cartilage data; and (5) demonstrate that the DFIS technique can evaluate the dynamic suprascapular nerve (a soft tissue around the shoulder) anatomy in 6 -DOF in a proof of concept cadaveric model. Our results show that for the shoulder motion tested, glenohumeral joint contact was located on the anterior-inferior glenoid surface, and that the inclusion of articular cartilage data when quantifying in-vivo glenohumeral <b>joint</b> contact <b>patterns</b> has significant effects on the contact centroid location, the contact centroid range of travel, and the total contact path length. As a result, our technique offers an advantage over glenohumeral <b>joint</b> contact <b>pattern</b> measurement techniques that neglect articular cartilage data. Likewise, this technique may be more sensitive than traditional 6 -DOF joint kinematics for the assessment of overall glenohumeral joint health. Lastly, in the proof of concept cadaveric model, we demonstrated that the DFIS technique can evaluate the dynamic suprascapular nerve anatomy in 6 -DOF and that the anatomical course of the nerve may be altered by a rotator cuff tendon tear and subsequent to surgical intervention. by Daniel Frank Massimini.

40|$|Rock {{fracture}} pattern description {{is important in}} civil engineering, engineering geology, and petroleum engineering. Deformability, strength, and stability of a rock mass as well as fluid flow through it are all influenced by fractures. Rock {{fracture pattern}}s normally cannot be observed completely so different approaches {{have been used to}} model them. Geometric models, which use probabilistic processes usually not or only indirectly related to mechanics, are often used for this purpose. Mechanics-based models, on the other hand, can only describe simpler fracture patterns. This research will improve on fracture pattern modeling capabilities, specifically for layer-perpendicular joints in sedimentary rock. Layer-perpendicular joints in sedimentary rock represent relatively simple fracture patterns that are usually confined within a competent layer bounded by ductile non-jointing layers. Field and laboratory studies in the literature suggest that their spacing is related to layer thickness and follows some probability distribution. Laboratory results in the literature also suggest that for a given layer thickness, a limiting joint spacing exists (i. e., joint saturation); this is not apparent in field data. (cont.) Existing models for layer-perpendicular joints in sedimentary rock consider some but not all of these aspects. Two new models are developed to better consider them. The first model (flaw model) is mechanics-based and relies on tensile stress and tensile strength submodels to generate <b>joint</b> <b>patterns.</b> Tensile strength can be correlated or uncorrelated. Compressive stress and interface slip saturation mechanisms are also implemented. The second model (rejection procedure) is a faster and largely probabilistic approach that generates <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> from a continuously updated probability density function but this function is assumed to depend only on tensile stress. For this reason, the flaw model must always be used to evaluate rejection procedure results. Only the compressive stress saturation is considered in the rejection procedure. Comparisons with field data indicate that both models can produce realistic <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> except where there are through-going joints or where strike varies considerably. Also, results indicate that saturation does not always occur in the field. Additionally, it is found that the use of an uncorrelated submodel in the flaw model is adequate for producing realistic <b>joint</b> <b>patterns.</b> by Jean Louis Zuñiga Locsin. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Human {{locomotion}} is {{a rhythmic}} task in which patterns of muscle activity are modulated by state-dependent feedback to accommodate perturbations. Two popular theories {{have been proposed}} for the underlying embodiment of phase in the human pattern generator: a time-dependent internal representation or a time-invariant feedback representation (i. e., reflex mechanisms). In either case the neuromuscular system must update or represent the phase of locomotor patterns based on the system state, which can include measurements of hundreds of variables. However, a much simpler representation of phase has emerged in recent designs for legged robots, which control <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> as functions of a single monotonic mechanical variable, termed a phase variable. We propose that human <b>joint</b> <b>patterns</b> may similarly depend on a physical phase variable, specifically the heel-to-toe movement of the Center of Pressure under the foot.

Three hypotheses stated that: (a) <b>joint</b> motion <b>patterns</b> with ‘no or minor gait deviations’ (n = 11 patterns) do not differ significantly from the gait pattern of typically developing children; (b) all other pathological <b>joint</b> motion <b>patterns</b> (n = 38 patterns) differ from typically developing gait and the locations of difference within the gait cycle, highlighted by statistical parametric mapping, concur with the consensus-based classification rules. (c) all <b>joint</b> motion <b>patterns</b> at the level of each joint (n = 49 patterns) differ from each other during at least one phase of the gait cycle. Results showed that: (a) ten patterns with ‘no or minor gait deviations’ differed somewhat unexpectedly from typically developing gait, but these differences were generally small (≤ 3 °); (b) all other <b>joint</b> motion <b>patterns</b> (n = 38) differed from typically developing gait and the significant locations within the gait cycle that were indicated by the statistical analyses, coincided well with the classification rules; (c) <b>joint</b> motion <b>patterns</b> at the level of each joint significantly differed from each other, apart from two sagittal plane pelvic patterns.
