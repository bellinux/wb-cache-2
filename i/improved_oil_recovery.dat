50|$|Dr. Surguchev {{was widely}} known and {{respected}} throughout the petroleum {{industry as a}} strong advocate for international cooperation and the dissemination of information between scientists and engineers.

5000|$|The {{company offers}} three {{reservoir}} simulation applications. IMEX, a conventional black oil simulator used for primary, secondary and enhanced or <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> processes; GEM, an advanced Equation-of-State (EoS) compositional and unconventional simulator; and STARS a k-value thermal and advanced processes simulator. In addition, CMG offers CMOST, a reservoir engineering tool that conducts automated history matching, sensitivity analysis and optimization of reservoir models.|$|E
50|$|For ongoing {{reservoir}} management, models {{may help}} in <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> by hydraulic fracturing. Highly deviated or horizontal wells {{can also be}} represented.

Also, future improvement in oil recovery with pressure maintenance by re-injection of produced gas or by water injection into an aquifer can be evaluated. Water flooding resulting in the improved displacement of oil is commonly evaluated using reservoir simulation.|$|E

30|$|Wettability can {{be defined}} as the {{preference}} of one fluid to adsorb or spread on a solid surface in the presence of another immiscible fluid. In the case of fractured carbonate reservoirs, any alteration of wettability toward more water-wet state changes capillary forces direction so that spontaneous imbibition of water can occur. Therefore, in these reservoirs wettability alteration <b>improves</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery.</b> In the case of non-fractured carbonate reservoirs, Owens and Archer (1971) based on contact angle measurements showed that changing wettability from oil-wet to more neutral wet or water-wet state <b>improves</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> significantly.|$|R

5000|$|Wavefront Technology Solutions's {{patented}} technology {{was created to}} combat the “path of least resistance”. In this way, the Powerwave and the Primawave share the same scientific principles. This technology, originally penned as [...] "Power Pulse Technology", uses pulses to improve the liquid flow in the ground for <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> (IOR) in the energy sector and groundwater remediation in the environmental sector. These identical processes generate a fluid pulse that momentarily expands the pore structure of rock and soil. Liquid is then able to flow freely and more uniformly.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, Dr. Surguchev {{was invited}} to join the All-Union Oil and Gas Scientific Research Institute (VNIIneft) in Moscow, the main {{research}} institute of the petroleum industry in the country.In 1971 he was appointed Head of the Department of Enhanced Oil Recovery at the VNIIneft Institute; subsequently becoming the Deputy Director, and ultimately the Director. In his years at this Institute, he guided and took part in a range of theoretical and experimental investigations of EOR processes. He was also the project manager {{for the development of the}} giant Samotlor oil field in Western Siberia, and was responsible for initiating a number of <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> projects in reservoirs situated in the Volga-Urals, Western Siberia, and other parts of the country.|$|E
50|$|ONGC {{was founded}} on 14 August 1956 by Government of India, which {{currently}} holds a 68.94% equity stake. It is involved in exploring for and exploiting hydrocarbons in 26 sedimentary basins of India, and owns and operates over 11,000 kilometers of pipelines in the country. Its international subsidiary ONGC Videsh currently has projects in 17 countries. ONGC has discovered 6 of the 7 commercially producing Indian Basins, in the last 50 years, adding over 7.1 billion tonnes of In-place Oil & Gas volume of hydrocarbons in Indian basins. Against a global decline of production from matured fields, ONGC has maintained production from its brownfields like Mumbai High, {{with the help of}} aggressive investments in various IOR (<b>Improved</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>Recovery)</b> and EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) schemes. ONGC has many matured fields with a current recovery factor of 25-33%. Its Reserve Replacement Ratio for between 2005 and 2013, has been more than one. During FY 2012-13, ONGC had to share the highest ever under-recovery of INR 494.2 billion (an increase of INR 49.6 million over the previous financial year) towards the under-recoveries of Oil Marketing Companies (IOC, BPCL and HPCL).|$|E

40|$|Cyclic {{waterflooding}} is {{a recovery}} method {{that increases the}} cumulative oil production in stratified, heterogeneous reservoirs. The process is based on alternated injection rates and alternating waterflood patterns within the reservoir. <b>Improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> is achieved by improved sweep of low permeable layers and previously poor swept areas. The thesis presents the results obtained from analytical evaluations and numerical simulations of a 2 D and 3 D synthetic model. The effect of cyclic injection is controlled by multiple parameters. A sensitivity study related to reservoir pressure, cycle period, injection rate, well spacing, reservoir thickness, wettability, permeability distribution, transmissibility, startup time and waterflood pattern was conducted. From the simulation results, cyclic injection shows promising results related to increased oil production and reduced water production. All the simulated cases produced additional oil {{in the range of}} 2 - 20 % compared to a conventional waterflood. The best case was found to be the more intensive injection schemes with a relative short base period, and startup time at high water cut. <b>Improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> is accompanied by significant decrease in water production. Cyclic water injection can improve a waterflood in terms of <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> and reduced water production at virtually zero additional cost, and is easy to implement. </p...|$|E

40|$|A model, called {{pressure-driven}} growth, is {{analysed for}} propagation of a foam front through an oil reservoir during <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> using foam. Numerical simulations {{of the model}} predict, not only the distance over which the foam front propagates, but also the instantaneous front shape. A particular case is studied here in which the pressure used to drive the foam along is suddenly increased {{at a certain point}} in time. This transiently produces a concave front shape (seen from the domain ahead of the front) : such concavities are known to be delicate to handle numerically. As time proceeds however, the front evolves back towards a convex shape, and this can be predicted by a long-time asymptotic analysis of the model. The increase in driving pressure is shown to be beneficial to the <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> process, because it gives a more uniform sweep of the oil reservoir by the foam...|$|E

Practical knowledge has shown that, at the point when the natural energy in a heavy oil reservoir is nearly or altogether depleted, the recovery factor does not exceed about 20 %. Some heavy oil reservoirs do not produce at all by natural drive mechanisms. This often ne-cessitates adopting a production improvement strategy to augment recovery. Prior to implement-ing an <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> method (either secondary or tertiary) in the field, it is very impor-tant to investigate its potential for success. Reservoir simulation is a part of a continuous learning process used to gain insight into the feasibility and applicability of <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> methods. In this project, GEM compositional reservoir simulator has been used to study the efficiencies of different <b>improved</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> strategies, ranging from waterflooding to solvent injection.

30|$|The {{combination}} of surfactant and low-salinity water {{does not always}} <b>improve</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery.</b> To obtain the highest amount of overall <b>oil</b> <b>recovery,</b> a careful design is needed and surfactant phase behavior parameters such as optimum salinity, C SEU, C SEL, and initial formation brine salinity {{should be taken into}} consideration.|$|R
30|$|A CO 2 {{utilization}} factor of 3 : 1 was evaluated using the base reservoir model for <b>improving</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> in the Middle Bakken Formation.

30|$|As {{depicted}} in Fig.  7, {{a plot of}} the flow resistance index versus pore volumes of injected brine exhibits similar trends as for the non-fractured systems. Similar trends of end-point effective permeabilities are also observed for both systems.
