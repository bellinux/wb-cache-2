25|$|The Staines Moor SSSI also {{includes}} King George VI Reservoir {{which is to}} the east. The reservoir carries nationally important wintering populations of tufted ducks, pochard, <b>goosander</b> and common goldeneye. The moor is separated from Wraysbury Reservoir to the west by the M25 and a footpath-accessible viaduct once used by the short-lived Staines and West Drayton Railway.|$|E
25|$|The lakes provide {{habitat for}} {{large numbers of}} birds. Clumber lake is fringed by alder, sallow and ash trees, with some sedge marsh. It {{was one of the}} first sites in the country used by gadwall for breeding, and also has a winter {{population}} of <b>goosander.</b> Hobbys frequent the reed bed below Clumber Dam in August and September, where they hunt swallows and martins. The upper lake is fringed by oak, yew, beech and Scots pine trees, and provides habitat for willow tits and woodpeckers, with blackcaps visiting in the summer. Mandarin ducks also visit occasionally.|$|E
50|$|Wildfowl numbers peak {{in early}} winter with migrant greylag geese {{roosting}} on the loch. In addition, goldeneyes, mallards, <b>goosanders,</b> wigeons, teals, tufted ducks and great crested grebes {{can also be}} seen.|$|R
50|$|The River Nene {{runs through}} this site, {{which also has}} large areas of open water and grassland. There are nationally {{important}} numbers of <b>goosanders,</b> wigeons and gadwalls in winter, and banded demoiselle damselflies nest on nettles along the river bank.|$|R
50|$|In winter, {{after the}} summer {{migrants}} have gone, the reservoir margins {{are good for}} fieldfares and redwings. On the reservoir itself, Canada geese are always present and are joined during the autumn and winter by <b>goosanders</b> and goldeneye accompanied by mallard, tufted duck and pochard. Whooper swans from Iceland frequently join them.|$|R
6000|$|The {{force of}} the present law is well shewn in those groups, in which, as a general rule, the two sexes and the young are all alike; for when the male in these groups does differ from the female, as with certain parrots, kingfishers, pigeons, &c., the young of both sexes {{resemble}} the adult female.[230] We see the same fact exhibited still more clearly in certain anomalous cases; thus the male of Heliothrix auriculata (one of the humming-birds) differs conspicuously from the female in having a splendid gorget and fine ear-tufts, but the female is remarkable from having a much longer tail {{than that of the}} male; now the young of both sexes resemble (with the exception of the breast being spotted with bronze) the adult female in all respects including the length of her tail, so that the tail of the male actually becomes shorter as he reaches maturity, which is a most unusual circumstance.[231] Again, the plumage of the male <b>goosander</b> (Mergus merganser) is more conspicuously coloured, with the scapular and secondary wing-feathers much longer than in the female, but differently from what occurs, as far as I know, in any other bird, the crest of the adult male, though broader than that of the female, is considerably shorter, being only a little above an inch in length; the crest of the female being two and a half inches long. Now the young of both sexes resemble in all respects the adult female, so that their crests are actually of greater length though narrower than in the adult male.[232] ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would even}} appear that mere novelty, or {{change for the}} sake of change, has {{sometimes}} acted like a charm on female birds, {{in the same manner as}} changes of fashion with us. The Duke of Argyll says,[284]—and I am glad to have the unusual satisfaction of following for even a short distance in his footsteps—“I am more and more convinced that variety, mere variety, must be admitted to be an object and an aim in Nature.” I wish the Duke had explained what he here means by Nature. Is it meant that the Creator of the universe ordained diversified results for His own satisfaction, or for that of man? The former notion seems to me as much wanting in due reverence as the latter in probability. Capriciousness of taste in the birds themselves appears a more fitting explanation. For example; the males of some parrots can hardly be said to be more beautiful, at least according to our taste, than the females, but they differ from them in such points, as the male having a rose-coloured collar instead of, as in the female, “a bright emeraldine narrow green collar;” or in the male having a black collar instead of “a yellow demi-collar in front,” with a pale roseate instead of a plum-blue head.[285] As so many male birds have for their chief ornament elongated tail-feathers or elongated crests, the shortened tail, formerly described in the male of a humming-bird, and the shortened crest of the male <b>goosander</b> almost seem like one of the many opposite changes of fashion which we admire in our own dresses.|$|E
6000|$|The {{force of}} the present law is well shewn in those groups, in which, as a general rule, the two sexes and the young are all alike; for when in these groups the male does differ from the female, as with certain parrots, kingfishers, pigeons, etc., the young of both sexes {{resemble}} the adult female. (2. See, for instance, Mr. Gould's account ('Handbook to the Birds of Australia,' vol. i. p. 133) of Cyanalcyon (one of the Kingfishers), in which, however, the young male, though resembling the adult female, is less brilliantly coloured. In some species of Dacelo the males have blue tails, and the females brown ones; and Mr. R.B. Sharpe informs me that {{the tail of the}} young male of D. gaudichaudi is at first brown. Mr. Gould has described (ibid. vol. ii. pp. 14, 20, 37) the sexes and the young of certain black Cockatoos and of the King Lory, with which the same rule prevails. Also Jerdon ('Birds of India,' vol. i. p. 260) on the Palaeornis rosa, in which the young are more like the female than the male. See Audubon ('Ornithological Biography,' vol. ii. p. 475) on the two sexes and the young of Columba passerina.) We see the same fact exhibited still more clearly in certain anomalous cases; thus the male of Heliothrix auriculata (one of the humming-birds) differs conspicuously from the female in having a splendid gorget and fine ear-tufts, but the female is remarkable from having a much longer tail than that of the male; now the young of both sexes resemble (with the exception of the breast being spotted with bronze) the adult female in all other respects, including the length of her tail, so that the tail of the male actually becomes shorter as he reaches maturity, which is a most unusual circumstance. (3. I owe this information to Mr. Gould, who shewed me the specimens; see also his 'Introduction to the Trochilidae,' 1861, p. 120.) Again, the plumage of the male <b>goosander</b> (Mergus merganser) is more conspicuously coloured than that of the female, with the scapular and secondary wing-feathers much longer; but differently from what occurs, as far as I know, in any other bird, the crest of the adult male, though broader than that of the female, is considerably shorter, being only a little above an inch in length; the crest of the female being two and a half inches long. Now the young of both sexes entirely resemble the adult female, so that their crests are actually of greater length, though narrower, than in the adult male. (4. Macgillivray, 'Hist. Brit. Birds,' vol. v. pp. 207-214.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Towy and {{surrounding}} valley (Dyffryn Tywi) {{are home to}} a very large variety of water and wetland birds. Among the more distinctive species found along the river are sand martins, common sandpipers, little ringed plovers, dippers, kingfishers and grey wagtails. Red kites and buzzards are numerous. <b>Goosanders</b> and cormorants prey on sea trout and salmon.|$|R
50|$|With the Tana River {{flowing through}} wild and {{spectacular}} habitat, the municipality of Tana {{has one of}} the most spectacular gatherings in Norway. As many as 25,000 <b>goosanders</b> can accumulate along the Tana waterway system.

50|$|The south facing {{aspect of}} the garden allows {{for a wide variety}} of plantings, and this, {{combined}} with the riverside, attract a notable variety of wildlife. Notable birds include blackcaps, mute swans, kingfishers, <b>goosanders</b> and in summer, sand martins, whilst teal often over-winter here. There are also a great many insects, including the rare club-tailed dragonfly, banded demoiselle damselflies and white-legged damselflies, plus a range of butterflies, hoverflies and crickets.|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{data from}} 25 years of standardised mid-September counts of waterfowl at eutrophic Lake Tåkern, southern Sweden. For eight species, counts {{were compared with}} a national index constructed from similar counts at numerous lakes and coastal sites. For Crested Grebes and Mute Swans there was a correlation between counts at Lake Tåkern and the national index, suggesting that they simultaneously vary in number over a large geographic area. Indirect gradient analysis (PCA) revealed a strong temporal trend in the data, which was covaried out in a partial PCA to expose residual patterns. This ordination separated Pochards and Tufted Ducks {{at one end of}} the first axis from Cormorants and <b>Goosanders</b> at the other. A direct gradient analysis, with biomass of submerged macrophytes (recorded for 14 of the 25 years) as the soleenvironmental variable, showed that bird species composition varied significantlywith plant biomass. The piscivores, Cormorants and <b>Goosanders,</b> were abundant in years with small amounts of plant biomass, while several species were most abundant in years with large amounts. Our analyses suggest that the abundance of submerged macrophytes is an important determinant of the bird community composition in eutrophic lakes...|$|R

50|$|A single carp can {{lay over}} a million eggs in a year, yet their {{population}} remains the same, so the eggs and young perish in similarly vast numbers. Eggs and fry often fall victim to bacteria, fungi, and the vast array of tiny predators in the pond environment. Carp which survive to juvenile are preyed upon by other fish such as the northern pike and largemouth bass, {{and a number of}} birds (including cormorants, herons, <b>goosanders,</b> and ospreys) and mammals (including otter and mink).|$|R
50|$|Fuller {{information}} {{may be found in}} the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. The River Wye at Lancaut supports a range of wildlife including otters, porpoises, cormorants, <b>goosanders</b> and herons. The woodland contains dormice, the rare lapidary snail, and uncommon plants such as narrow-leaved helleborine and the wild service tree. The narrow tidal banks are a rare example in Britain of a direct transition between natural saltmarsh and woodland. Fishing was historically important in the area, and the river contains traces of several medieval weirs, but salmon numbers have fallen markedly in recent years.|$|R
5|$|As of May 2017, {{there are}} 18 Local Nature Reserves in Northamptonshire, {{and there is}} public access to all sites. Twelve are managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, and two are also Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar internationally {{important}} wetland sites, and Special Protection Areas under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. The largest site is Titchmarsh Nature Reserve at , which has nationally important numbers of <b>goosanders,</b> wigeons and gadwalls in winter.

A colony {{of up to}} 20,000 barnacle geese, over 10,000 greylag geese and thousands of waders stop on the coastal pastures in spring. The most numerous birds of passage (around 1.6 million) are long-tailed ducks. Approximately 35,000—40,000 ducks feed in the reedbeds in spring. In autumn, about 300,000 migratory waterfowl pass Matsalu. The wetland is the biggest autumn stopping ground of common cranes in Europe. The highest recorded number of cranes at the park has been 23,000.|$|R
