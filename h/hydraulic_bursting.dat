40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} {{carbon and}} silicon carbide matrix composites for nozzle inner of solid propellant ramjet were prepared {{by using the}} hybrid process of "chemical vapor infiltration + precursor impregnation pyrolysis (CVI+PIP) ". The microstructure, flexural and anti-ablation properties of the C/C-SiC composites and hydraulic test and rocket motor hot firing test for nozzle inner of solid propellant ramjet were comprehensively investigated. The results show that when the flexural strength of the composite reachs 197 MPa, the fracture damage behavior of the composites presents typical toughness mode. Also the composites has excellent anti-ablative property, i. e., linear ablation rate is only 0. 0063 mm&# 183;s - 1 after 200 s ablation. The C/C-SiC component have excellent integral bearing performance with the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>bursting</b> pressure of 6. 5 MPa, and the high temperature combination property of the C/C-SiC composite nozzle inner is verified through motor hot firing of solid propellant ramjet...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. 8 {{pressure}} vessels of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) have been manufactured {{with in the}} winding technology of same continuous carbon fiberâ€“-amine system, new same flexible formula and same tension system. And the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>bursting</b> tests with the specimens were done in accordance with GB 6058 - 85. The parameters of fiber strength, winding angle, geometric sizes and burst pressure were obtained by the tests. The theoretical analysis was done by conventional design method and reliability design method. The results show that: the theoretical calculating thickness of CFRP pressure vessel with by same parameters is thicker than practical thickness. This shows the performance of CFRP pressure vessel is related not only with fiber strength but also with material properties of resin matrix, tension and solidifying system of winding process. Because of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) have many advantages which are high specific strength, high specific modulus, ablation resistance and low cost. Although the thing that composite materials have been substitutes for metal shell springs up soon, the application is much wide[1 - 6]...|$|E
40|$|The {{efforts of}} this {{research}} were to determine the sensitivity to interfacial gaps in laser transmission welding using various laser welding parameters. Note that the melting of the transparent side of the interface relies mainly on heat conduction from the absorbing side since the laser beam energy is mainly absorbed in the non-transparent material. If a gap exists between the parts at the faying surface, the weld may not form at that location. For this study, interfacial gaps created via manufactured voids were moulded into the components to be welded. After welding, the samples were then assessed using microstructural analysis, fracture surface analysis and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>burst</b> testing. The research has shown laser transmission welding {{has the potential of}} obtaining strong welds, exceeding those of linear vibration welds of similar geometry. Surprisingly, very strong bonds were observed even with a large degree of porosity/voids in the weld...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from one}} article {{published}} by Rabl and Sigrist in 1992 (Rechtsmedizin 2 : 156 - 158), {{there are no}} further reports on secondary skull fractures in shots from captive bolt guns. Up to now, the pertinent literature places particular emphasis on the absence of indirect lesions away from the impact point, when dealing with the wounding capacity of slaughterer's guns. The recent observation of two suicidal head injuries accompanied by skull fractures {{far away from the}} bolt's path gave occasion to experimental studies using simulants (glycerin soap, balls from gelatin) and skull brain models. As far as ballistic soap was concerned, the dimensions of the bolt's channel were assessed by multi-slice computed tomography before cutting the blocks open. The test shots to gelatin balls and to skull-brain models were documented by means of a high-speed motion camera. As expected, the typical temporary cavity effect of bullets fired from conventional guns could not be observed when captive bolt stunners were discharged. Nevertheless, the visualized transfer of kinetic energy justifies the assumption that the secondary fractures seen in thin parts of the skull were caused by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>burst</b> effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{fiber optic}} sensor {{developed}} for the measurement of tendon forces was designed, numerically modeled, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated. The sensor incorporated fiber Bragg gratings and micro-fabricated stainless steel housings. A fiber Bragg grating is an optical device that is spectrally sensitive to axial strain. Stainless steel housings were designed to convert radial forces applied to the housing into axial forces that could be sensed by the fiber Bragg grating. The metal housings were fabricated by several methods including laser micromachining, swaging, and hydroforming. Designs are presented that allow for simultaneous temperature and force measurements {{as well as for}} simultaneous resolution of multi-axis forces. The sensor was experimentally evaluated by hydrostatic loading and in vitro testing. A commercial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>burst</b> tester was used to provide uniform pressures on the sensor in order to establish the linearity, repeatability, and accuracy characteristics of the sensor. The in vitro experiments were performed in excised tendon and in a dynamic gait simulator to simulate biological conditions. In both experimental conditions, the sensor was found to be a sensitive and reliable method for acquiring minimally invasive measurements of soft tissue forces. Our results suggest that this sensor will prove useful in a variety of biomechanical measurements. </p...|$|R
25|$|For {{five years}} the boat lift {{operated}} successfully, the longest closures being during spells of cold weather when the canal froze over. In 1882 a cast iron <b>hydraulic</b> cylinder <b>burst</b> while the caisson it supported was at canal level with a boat in it. The caisson descended rapidly, but water escaping from the burst cylinder slowed the rate of descent and the water-filled dock at river level softened the impact. No-one was hurt {{and there was no}} damage to the lift's superstructure. As a precaution, tests were carried out on the second hydraulic cylinder. During these tests the second cylinder failed too. As a result the boat lift was closed for six months while sections of both cylinders were replaced and the connecting pipework, which was thought to have contributed to their failure, was redesigned.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic systems rely on high {{pressures}} (usually over 7000 kPa) to work properly. If {{a hydraulic}} system loses fluid pressure, (<b>burst</b> <b>hydraulic</b> hose) {{it will become}} inoperative and components such as actuators may collapse. This is an undesirable condition in life-critical systems such as aircraft or heavy machinery, such as forklifts. Hydraulic fuses help guard against catastrophic failure of a hydraulic system (for instance, by line breakage or component failure) by automatically isolating the defective branch.|$|R
5000|$|The shovel {{worked well}} for Arch Coal until September 9, 1991, when a fire {{broke out in the}} lower works of the shovel. It was caused by a <b>burst</b> <b>hydraulic</b> line that was {{spraying}} the hot fluids on an electrical relay panel. This fire caused a great deal of damage to both the lower works and machine house. Afterwards, engineers from both Arch and Marion Power Shovel surveyed the damage and deemed it too great to repair, and the machine was scrapped one year later in the last pit it dug.|$|R
40|$|Fibrin glue {{products}} and collagen patches are frequently {{used as a}} sealing product, preventing surgical side bleedings. This {{is especially true in}} the field of cardiovascular surgery, where increasing numbers of patients are being operated with antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. The aim of this report was, in an in vitro hemodynamic setting, to examine the sealant properties of the TachoSil (Nycomed Pharma, Linz, Austria) patch. Burst pressure and normal force of 15 TachoSil sealed defects were measured. This was determined in a closed <b>hydraulic</b> system. Mean <b>burst</b> pressure load for a 5 -mm defect was 69 +/- 11. 4 mmHg; for a 7 -mm defect was 63 +/- 16 mmHg; and, 62 +/- 16 mmHg for the defect with a diameter of 10 mm (P> 0. 05). The mean calculated normal force was as follows: 0. 91 +/- 0. 15 N for the 5 mm defect, 6. 5 +/- 1. 6 N for the 7 mm, and 8. 1 +/- 0. 75 N for the 10 mm defect. The TachoSil patch has the capability to seal small defects. However, at the larger defects the seal character was significantly reduced. These results suggest that the device may be a good alternative for hemostasis for small defects. The capacity to curtail or stop hemorrhage at the larger defects is unlikely...|$|R
