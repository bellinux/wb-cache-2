5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E

25|$|While usually {{connected}} to a barge, the pushers are also capable of operating independently. However, the low metacentric height of the vessels, only , results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the pushers very uncomfortable in severe weather.

25|$|However, {{for some}} sweet wines, a {{successful}} harvest requires manual work {{and training for}} pickers to pick only clusters where the berries have reached optimum ripeness or {{have been affected by}} noble rot (for the Sélection de Grains Nobles). For sparkling wines hand picking is recommended and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary for white wines from grapes with coloured skin.|$|E
25|$|Removal of the spleen (splenectomy) is {{effective}} in reducing the severity of these complications, but is {{associated with an increased}} risk of overwhelming bacterial septicaemia, and is only performed on those with significant complications. Because many neonates with severe elliptocytosis progress to have only a mild disease, and because this age group is particularly susceptible to pneumococcal infections, a splenectomy is only performed on those under 5 years old when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} this process, {{refer to the}} illustration on the right. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> identical to the earlier illustration even though the circularly polarized light at the top is now considered to be approaching the polarizer from the left. One can observe from the illustration that the leftward horizontal (as observed looking along the direction of travel) component is leading the vertical component and that when the horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength it will be transformed into the linearly polarized light illustrated {{at the bottom and}} it will pass through the linear polarizer.|$|E
25|$|Crayfish {{often find}} {{themselves}} in a conflicting situation where they are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when they suddenly receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, it takes an especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary.|$|E
25|$|Steel is {{classified}} by Det Norske Veritas with a class notation of +1A1 ICE-1A+ Pusher and Pusher/Barge Unit E0. It {{has the highest}} Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, {{which means that the}} pusher is designed to operate in difficult ice conditions both alone and when coupled to a barge mainly without icebreaker assistance. While usually connected to a barge, Steel is also capable of operating independently. However, the low metacentric height of the pusher, only , results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the vessel very uncomfortable in severe weather. For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary.|$|E

25|$|But Steinschneider's {{assumption}} {{can hardly}} be supported. The Mishnat ha-Middot has {{nothing in common with}} the Baraita cited by the old scholars under that name: for the citations leave no doubt that the Baraita, even in its mathematical parts, was founded on the Bible; whereas the Mishnat ha-Middot is a purely secular work, and, possibly, it drew upon the same source as did Mohammed b. Musa, the oldest Arabic mathematician. The plea that the Mishnat ha-Middot has not been preserved in its entirety, and that in its original form there were references to the Bible for special points, is of no weight, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> incomprehensible that haggadic or halakic matter should fit into the frame of the work as it now is.|$|E
25|$|This {{manifesto}} {{is for all}} of you. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> {{necessary for}} us {{to stop at the}} earliest possible time the nameless oppositions being perpetrated on the sons of the country who are now suffering the brutal punishment and tortures in jails, and because of this please let all the brethren know that on Saturday, the 29th of the current month, the revolution shall commence according to our agreement. For this purpose, it is necessary for all towns to rise simultaneously and attack Manila at the same time. Anybody who obstructs this sacred ideal of the people will be considered a traitor and an enemy, except if he is ill; or is not physically fit, in which case he shall be tried according to the regulations we have put in force.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} function {{provided by}} the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the automatic gain control (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called fast attack, slow decay circuit which holds the AGC level {{for a second or}} more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where compression of the audio aids intelligibility. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of whether LeHand and Roosevelt's relationship contained a sexual component was widely discussed among their contemporaries {{and continues to be}} debated by historians. Hazel Rowley argues that [...] "there is no doubt that Franklin's relationship with Missy was romantic", but notes the possibility that the relationship could not have been consummated due to FDR's disability. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin states that [...] "beneath the complexity, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> clear that Franklin was the love of Missy's life, and that he adored her and depended on her for affection and support as well as work". Doug Wead wrote in his work on the parents of presidents, The Raising of a President, [...] "Some Roosevelt historians insist that their relationship was never consummated. Eleanor and the children accepted the relationship, which speaks for its innocence. Sara [...] spoke favorably of Missy's family and upbringing. Years later, only Elliott, of all the children, would declare that it had not been as benign as historians like to believe." ...|$|E
500|$|For much of {{his final}} two decades, Romney {{had been out of}} the {{political}} eye, but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. [...] Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son's house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. [...] Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events. [...] When Kennedy's campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church's past policy on blacks, Romney interrupted Mitt's press conference and said loudly, [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture." [...] The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.|$|E
