5|$|The {{second source}} of over-provisioning {{comes from the}} manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on {{the difference between the}} decimal <b>gigabyte</b> of the physical capacity and the decimal <b>gigabyte</b> of the available space to the user. As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity. This difference is 28%, 7% and 0% respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28% of over-provisioning on their drive. This does not count the additional 7.37% of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary <b>gigabyte.</b>|$|E

25|$|The spacecraft's onboard {{computer}} system was contained in an Integrated Electronics Module (IEM), {{a device that}} combined core avionics into a single box. The computer featured two radiation-hardened IBM RAD6000s, a 25megahertz main processor, and a 10MHz fault protection processor. For redundancy, the spacecraft carried a pair of identical IEMs. For data storage, the spacecraft carried two solid-state recorders able to store up to one <b>gigabyte</b> each. The IBM RAD6000 main processor collected, compressed, and stored data from MESSENGERs instruments for later playback to Earth.|$|E

40|$|This year {{we come to}} TREC with a new {{retrieval}} system Tivra that we have implemented over the last year. Tivra {{is based on the}} vector space model, and is mainly designed to do large-scale web search with limited resources. We run Tivra on a cheap Linux box. It currently indexes around 14 - 15 <b>gigabytes</b> of web data per hour, and allows sub-second web searches for 2 - 3 word queries on a 700 MHz Pentium box. At the time of submissions Tivra was in its early development stages, and was not fully tested. However, we still submitted runs for both the web tracks - 10 <b>gigabytes</b> and 100 <b>gigabytes.</b> The results look quite reasonable for an untested version of the system. For the 10 <b>gigabytes</b> ad-hoc task, our results are above median for majority of the queries. This is specially notable given that we use only the title portion of the queries whereas the results pool contains results based on both long and short queries. Our results are among the top results in the 100 <b>gigabytes</b> task...|$|R
25|$|Particularly {{with the}} advent of USB, {{external}} hard disks have become widely available and inexpensive. External hard disk drives currently cost less per <b>gigabyte</b> than flash drives and are available in larger capacities. Some hard drives support alternative and faster interfaces than USB 2.0 (e.g., IEEE 1394 and eSATA). For consecutive sector writes and reads (for example, from an unfragmented file), most hard drives can provide a much higher sustained data rate than current NAND flash memory, though mechanical latencies seriously impact hard drive performance.|$|E
25|$|Sirius Stiletto 100– {{the first}} {{portable}} Sirius radio that allows subscribers {{to listen to}} live Sirius programming. The Stiletto boasts a 2 <b>gigabyte</b> memory, which is roughly equivalent to 100 hours of recording time. The unit's batteries give the user approximately 30 hours of life. The unit also features Wi-Fi technology, which {{is used as a}} backup to stream music from the Internet when a clear signal strength is not readily available from the built-in antenna. Sirius' partnerships with Napster and Yahoo Music provide additional content for Stiletto users.|$|E
25|$|The {{applications}} of current data tape cartridges hardly overlap those of flash drives: on tape, cost per <b>gigabyte</b> {{is very low}} for large volumes, but the individual drives and media are expensive. Media {{have a very high}} capacity and very fast transfer speeds, but store data sequentially and are very slow for random access of data. While disk-based backup is now the primary medium of choice for most companies, tape backup is still popular for taking data off-site for worst-case scenarios and for very large volumes (more than a few hundreds of TB). See LTO tapes.|$|E

25|$|There remain {{some aspects}} of flash-based SSDs that make them unattractive. The cost per <b>gigabyte</b> of flash memory remains {{significantly}} {{higher than that of}} hard disks. Also flash memory has a finite number of P/Ecycles, but this seems to be currently under control since warranties on flash-based SSDs are approaching those of current hard drives. In addition, deleted files on SSDs can remain for an indefinite period of time before being overwritten by fresh data; erasure or shred techniques or software that work well on magnetic hard disk drives have no effect on SSDs, compromising security and forensic examination.|$|E
25|$|Photonic {{implementations}} are attracting more attention, not {{the least}} {{because they do not}} require extensive cooling. Simultaneous spoken digit and speaker recognition and chaotic time-series prediction were demonstrated at data rates beyond 1 <b>gigabyte</b> per second in 2013. Using non-linear photonics to implement an all-optical linear classifier, a perceptron model was capable of learning the classification boundary iteratively from training data through a feedback rule. A core building block in many learning algorithms is to calculate the distance between two vectors: this was first to experimentally demonstrated up to eight dimensions using entangled qubits in a photonic quantum computer in 2015.|$|E
25|$|A Star Wars: The Clone Wars MP3 {{player was}} {{released}} in August 2008.

One review claimed it improved upon a Darth Vader MP3 player released in July 2008, which featured only 512 megabytes of memory and a dated visual display. A Star Wars iPod iSpeaker (a speaker/dock for iPods, iPhones and MP3 players) was also released. The speaker includes an image of Captain Rex and three other Clone Troopers.|$|E

25|$|Bell Canada usage-based billing: On October 28, 2010, the CRTC {{handed down}} its final {{decision}} on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, Bell {{will be able to}} charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, individual users will be charged per <b>gigabyte,</b> depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell will charge $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per <b>gigabyte.</b> In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market. This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a tweet by Industry Minister Tony Clement, unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.|$|E
