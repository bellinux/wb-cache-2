5|$|From Quaking Aspen {{across the}} Sierra Nevada to Olancha, Caltrans {{has adopted a}} {{proposed}} alignment, but is unlikely to build it, {{in part due to}} two protected wilderness areas— the <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Wilderness and South Sierra Wilderness— along the route. The unconstructed routing heads northeast from Quaking Aspen, cresting a small summit before following Freeman Creek easterly past the Freeman Creek Grove, crossing the Kern River near its forks, and then using the path of Rattlesnake Creek and Beach Creek to the Beach Meadows area. Crossing several ridges to the northeast, SR 190 would make its way to the South Fork Kern River near Monache Mountain, then heading southeast along that waterway to the vicinity of Haiwee Pass. That pass, elevation about 8200 feet (2500 m) above sea level, would take the highway over the Sierra Crest into Inyo County, dropping down the steep Eastern Sierra escarpment for 12.0 miles (19.3km) in a north-northeasterly direction to US 395 at Olancha (elevation 3650 feet/1100 m).|$|E
5|$|In March 1959, Tulare County {{approved}} {{a change in}} location of the proposed highway to Olancha Pass (Haiwee Pass, just to the south, was soon considered for a possible alternate location), and the legislature moved the main line of Route 127 south to that location, crossing US 395 at Olancha, later that year. The old route from southeast of Keeler to Lone Pine remained as a branch, and was still signed as SR 190. Also in 1959, the original routing from Lone Pine through Death Valley to Baker {{was added to the}} proposed California Freeway and Expressway System, though no parts have been upgraded as such. The eastwest piece between Tipton and Death Valley Junction legislatively received the State Route 190 designation in the 1964 renumbering, and the north–south part became State Route 127, as it had been signed; the branch to Lone Pine became a new State Route 136. By the mid-1970s, the environmental movement had essentially killed the planned connection, and the designation of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Wilderness in 1978 and South Sierra Wilderness in 1984 were the final blow, though Caltrans still has an officially adopted alignment designated over Haiwee Pass.|$|E
25|$|The South Fork Kern River, {{designated}} a national Wild and Scenic River since 1987. flows down the South Fork Valley, through the Kern River Preserve {{and then into}} Lake Isabella. The South Fork is the source for irrigation water for agriculture and the rare riparian forests of the valley. The river's upper reaches have populations of <b>golden</b> <b>trout,</b> California's state fish. The <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> is being reviewed by United States Fish and Wildlife Service for listing under the Endangered Species Act.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the range}} of the Kern River <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> of Southern California, hatchery-bred rainbows {{introduced}} into the Kern River have diluted the genetic purity of the Kern River rainbow trout [...] and <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> [...] through intraspecific breeding. [...] The Beardslee trout, , a genetically unique lake-dwelling variety of the coastal rainbow trout that is isolated in Lake Crescent (Washington), is threatened by the loss of its only spawning grounds in the Lyre River to siltation and other types of habitat degradation.|$|E
500|$|Resident {{freshwater}} {{rainbow trout}} adults average between [...] in riverine environments, while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach [...] [...] Coloration varies widely between regions and subspecies. Adult freshwater forms are generally blue-green or olive green with heavy black spotting over {{the length of}} the body. [...] Adult fish have a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most pronounced in breeding males. The caudal fin is squarish and only mildly forked. Lake-dwelling and anadromous forms are usually more silvery in color with the reddish stripe almost completely gone. [...] Juvenile rainbow trout display parr marks (dark vertical bars) typical of most salmonid juveniles. In some redband and <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> forms parr marks are typically retained into adulthood. Some coastal rainbow trout [...] and Columbia River redband trout [...] populations and cutbow hybrids may also display reddish or pink throat markings similar to cutthroat trout. In many regions, hatchery-bred trout can be distinguished from native trout via fin clips. Fin clipping the adipose fin is a management tool used to identify hatchery-reared fish.|$|E

50|$|Both the big {{and little}} Brokenstraw Creeks and their tributaries boast good water quality, {{low levels of}} {{pollution}} and high dissolved oxygen content, making these streams highly sought after for fishermen, especially trout fishermen. Brook trout are native and are commonly caught in the smaller tributaries, while the larger portions of the stream are stocked with Brown trout, Rainbow trout and Palomino (West Virginia <b>Golden</b> trout-Rainbow <b>trout</b> hybrid) trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Many stretches of stream also hold Smallmouth bass and White suckers. Occasionally Walleye and Northern pike are also caught in the creek.|$|R
50|$|At {{the furthest}} western {{point of the}} lake near Tyringham Road, a public boat ramp and parking lot can be found. The town of Monterey makes these {{amenities}} unavailable {{during the period of}} June 15 through September 6 because of swimming season.A 1979 survey recorded a total of 12 species of fish inside Lake Garfield: smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, yellow perch, chain pickerel, rainbow <b>trout,</b> <b>golden</b> shiner, brown bullhead, bluegill, white sucker, rock bass and white perch. Lake Garfield is a popular fishing site for rainbow trout during spring. Due to the dominant yellow and white perch population, gamefish are usually below average size and abundance although a good bass or pickerel may occasionally be produced by the lake.|$|R

5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== Rocks, scree, and glaciers {{are over}} 70% {{of the terrain}} in the reserve. The other 30%, at the lower altitudes, is alpine meadoes and forest. Typical trees on the lower north slopes are beech and {{hornbeam}} (replaced by birch and maple at higher levels), with undergrowth of elderberry, Caucasian bilberry, and Rhododendron. On the south-facing slopes are oak and hazel communities. Alder stands grow along the river bottoms. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 1,383 species of vascular plants, 200 of which are endemic to the Caucasus. [...] The animal life of the reserve reflects the location at the meeting of several different ecozones. Species that are characteristic of the Circumboreal region (mouse, roe deer, brook <b>trout,</b> <b>golden</b> eagle, etc.) are mixed with steppe and alpine species (stone marten, Dagestan goat), {{and a number of}} introduced species (partridge, Jackal, chamois). There is a small herd of bison. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 58 species of mammals, and 208 species of birds.|$|R
5000|$|Local {{folklore}} {{tells of}} an old monk who was fishing late one night at the boat quay in the Rusheen - this is apparently {{the origins of the}} Gillaroo myth. The old monk had fasted for a long period and had nestled on Lough Melvin's rocky shores to seek solace and find himself. Upon completing his period of abstinence he combed the surrounding landscape to quench his appetite. Having acquired a bounty of wild mushrooms from the grassy slopes of the Rusheen he proceeded to seek an adequate complement to his fungal feast. Lough Melvin provided the perfect source for having spent many days gazing upon its vast expanse he had watched in awe at the abundance of wild salmon and various trout like fish that frolicked in pursuit of unsuspecting insect life. After an evening's fishing the only luck he had was an eel which was hardly was worth roasting and a duck egg that he had managed to retrieve from a nest in a nearby reed bed. Becoming ever increasingly desperate and starving the Monk decided to make a cross in the sand and laid his catch within - this is why an eel will not leave a cross of sand if caught in the Lough! It was now that the Monk turned to his spiritual advisor asking him to reward him for his faithful fast - upon opening his eyes he saw that his eel and egg had turned into two of the most beautiful <b>golden</b> bellied <b>trout,</b> a fish so splendid that he simply could not eat, so he turned them free to multiply in the Lough! ...|$|R
40|$|Saratoga NFH, {{established}} in 1911, {{has served as}} an egg-producing station during most of its years of operation. Between 1915 and 1984, various strains of brook, rainbow, brown, <b>golden</b> and cutthroat <b>trout</b> and Dolly Varden eggs were produced. In 1966, Saratoga NFH was formally designated as a broodstock hatchery, and in 1984 the hatchery {{became involved in the}} Great Lakes lake trout recovery program. Today, the hatchery 2 ̆ 7 s broodstock program includes supplying about 5 million eyed Lewis Lake lake trout eggs to the Great Lakes restoration program and 3 to 4 million Plymouth Rock brown trout eggs for Service, State, and Tribal hatcheries nationwide. In 1997, Saratoga NFH adopted a unique role in becoming the first hatchery in the NFHS to become involved in rearing endangered amphibians. The Wyoming toad, found only in southwestern Wyoming, is considered the most endangered amphibian in North America. The hatchery maintains a captive population for breeding, rearing, and refugiá, and progeny from this program will be used for reintroduction efforts...|$|R
5000|$|The California <b>golden</b> <b>trout,</b> {{or simply}} the <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> [...] (Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita), is a {{subspecies}} {{of the rainbow}} trout native to California.

50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as the New Hampshire and Vermont lakes {{developed}} its own steady summer tourism, recreational fishermen {{who sought to}} increase their catches began to introduce new fish species into these lakes, and these eventually overwhelmed the native Sunapee <b>golden</b> <b>trout.</b> Lake trout, a larger char that holds the same ecological niche as Sunapee trout, only better, out-competed the Sunapee <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> and hybridized with it, further accelerating its decline.
