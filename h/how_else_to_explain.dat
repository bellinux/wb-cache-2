500|$|Entertainment Weekly gave a [...] "B+" [...] rating to {{the first}} half of the film and a [...] "C-" [...] rating to the second half, and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "As {{political}} theater, Che moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly ... Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been". James Verniere of The Boston Herald gave the film a B-, describing the work as a new genre of [...] "arthouse guerrilla nostalgia", while lamenting Che as the film version of Alberto Korda’s iconic 1960 photograph Guerrillero Heroico. In Verniere's view, so much information was missing, that he recommended one first see The Motorcycle Diaries to fill in the background. In her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "With its lyrical beauty and strong performances, the film can be riveting. Its excessive length and rambling scenes also make it maddening. It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing". Anthony Lane, in his review for The New Yorker, wrote, [...] "for all the movie’s narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise—of an interest brilliantly explored. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> one’s total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?" [...] Taking a more positive stance, film critic Chris Barsanti compared Che to a [...] "guerrilla take on Patton", calling it [...] "an exceptionally good" [...] war film, which rivaled The Battle of Algiers in its [...] "you-are-there sensibility". Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and addressed the film's length: [...] "You may wonder if the film is too long. I think there's a good reason for its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad".|$|E

The newspaper Metroland reviewed her rendition of the song negatively, and wrote, [...] "we tend to think time is most definitely not on her side [...] - [...] <b>how</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the near-universal apathy to the release of her second album, Harmonium?"

[...] He considered The City of Greyhawk [...] "the most credible attempt at smoothing out the rough spots", and felt that Greyhawk Wars [...] "took another {{step in the right direction}} by shaking things up with a much-needed dose of epic conflict"; he felt that by drawing on these earlier works, [...] "veteran designer Carl Sargent has continued the overhaul with the ambitious From the Ashes.

5000|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine believed Dangerous was [...] "a much sharper, riskier album than 'Bad'." [...] Culture critic Joseph Vogel {{was of the}} opinion that it fulfilled Jackson's creative ambitions and was at once his most socially conscious record, [...] "his most personally revealing", and [...] "a dazzling musical odyssey", comparing it to Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life as [...] "the work of an artist engaging with the world around him-and inside him-as never before." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Vogel argued that the R&B/New jack swing album's music was more groundbreaking than any other pop record of the time. [...] "If indeed it is considered a pop album, Dangerous redefined the parameters of pop. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> an album that mixes R&B, funk, gospel, hip-hop, rock, industrial, and classical; an album that introduces one song ('Will You Be There') with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and another ('Dangerous') with what sounds like the heart of a steel-city factory; an album that can alternately be paranoid, cryptic, sensual, vulnerable, idealistic, bleak, transcendent, and fearful?" [...] In 2007, the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) ranked Dangerous at number 115 on its list of the [...] "Definitive 200 albums of all time developed by the NARM". Chuck Eddy named it the eighth most essential New jack swing album in a list published by Spin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{value of}} the {{opinions}} of physicians, surgeons, veterinarians, optometrists and other signatories of this petition is not clear. Referring {{to the number of}} people on the Scientific Dissent from Darwinism list and their claimed relevance, University of Minnesota biology professor PZ Myers writes, [...] "Not only is the number that they cite pathetically small, but they rely on getting scientists whose expertise isn't relevant." [...] In analogy, {{it can be argued that}} the ‘Physicians’ list represents an insignificant fraction of the total medical profession. Addressing a specific example, Myers says of neurosurgeon Michael Egnor, who signed both lists, that [...] "The Discovery Institute may like to trumpet his expertise in neurosurgery as an indicator of the significance of his dissent from evolutionary biology, but I think I'd rather trumpet his ignorance of evolutionary biology as an indicator of the uselessness of the Discovery Institute's list." [...] Myers continued to state that the signer [...] "is not only wrong, but he's pretty damn arrogant about it — <b>how</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> someone who is proud of the fact that he knows nothing about a subject, and is proud of his inability to find sources that would correct his ignorance, even when they're pointed out to him directly?

5000|$|Jason Lipshutz of Billboard, however, wrote, [...] "Yes, [...] "Einstein" [...] is fun. Yes, Clarkson sounds spectacular. But {{the refrain}} reads, [...] "Dumb plus dumb equals you."

Some of the song's verses are fun just because they're so ostentatiously foolish." [...] But also added, [...] ""Dumb plus dumb equals you," [...] Clarkson bellows. On second thought, I kind of love that performance, in its goofy way. Far better is the kind of crisp vocal work Clarkson brings to a vocal hook worthy of her dramatized agony". Brian Mansfield of USA Today was equivocal on the song's lyrical content. He wrote, [...] "the reliability of the narrator is in question, as she sings, [...] "You say I'm crazy, and that we're happy/Is that supposed to comfort me?" [...] Is the guy a lech who flirts with other women in front of her, or is she just loopy nuts? Your guess is as good as mine." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News referred the chorus of the song as some of the worst lines in pop history. ("I may not be Einstein/but I know that dumb plus dumb equals you").|$|E

5000|$|To {{support the}} album, Carlton {{embarked}} on a North American concert tour, which began on October 21 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and concluded on November 21 in Portland, Oregon; her opening act was pop rock band Low Millions. She said the tour would be [...] "just me and the piano" [...] and [...] "totally stripped down, like an in-your-living room-type of feeling, that type of intimacy." [...] She recorded a cover of the Kai Winding song [...] "Time Is on My Side" [...] (1963) for a Time Warner digital video recorders commercial, which also served as promotion for Harmonium and received heavy rotation on U.S. television during early 2005. The newspaper Metroland wrote, [...] "we tend to think time is most definitely not on her side — <b>how</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the near-universal apathy {{to the release of}} Harmonium?". Harmonium was not re-issued to include the song. Carlton was quoted in a March 2005 interview with Fly Magazine as saying it was [...] "difficult" [...] for someone like her, a singer-songwriter who played the piano, to [...] "reach a lot of people", but that [...] "depending on what happens with the second single, I think it will do really well. I hope the record goes gold and all those things." [...] A second tour, with Cary Brothers and Ari Hest as support acts for many of the shows, ran from March 9 (in Atlanta, Georgia) to April 30 (in Plattsburgh, New York). In April and May 2005, songs from Harmonium were featured on the WB teen soap operas Charmed and One Tree Hill, and Carlton participated in an exclusive performance with Ryan Cabrera.|$|E

40|$|History {{has never}} had a {{convenient}} mechanism of organization. The measurement of time we call the decade, unfortunately, does not work. The sixties, for example, in many ways began in 1955 with the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, and in other ways began in 1963 with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. They did not end on December 31, 1969, as we would have liked them to, because the Black Panthers and the Radical Feminists, as well as many others with sixties sensibilities, would have much to say going into the 1970 s. Further, few could question the fact that the greed that personified the 1980 s remained solely in that decade, or that only the 1920 s “roared. ” Thus, historians, particularly cultural historians, tend to rely on chronology far less than others likely think we should. And because of that, we generally hate to personify the character of a generation, making for a tricky task of defining historical trends while avoiding vulgar generalizations. However, it is a worthy endeavor, for <b>how</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the election of Richard Milhouse Nixon in the visibly revolutionary year of 1968 ? It also proves useful when responding to Joan Digby’s argument that the eighteenth century was an Age of Imitation, considering that the nineteenth century cultural landscape was dominated by the art of minstrelsy, likely the most imitative of performative styles and the forerunner of “mechanical reproduction,” as phrased by Walter Benjamin. 1 Indeed, as cultural critics from the Frankfurt School to Benedict Anderson have theorized, the twentieth century is not so much an age of imitation, but rather a continuation of the reproduction of representations of reality that now permeate our postmodern sensibilities. To specify that any particular age is of particular imitation, and thus that our students follow suit, is to believe that there is an age of authenticity somewhere out there, or an “our culture” in the words of Digby, something that postmodern critique has dispelled and that globalization has rendered obsolete...|$|E
