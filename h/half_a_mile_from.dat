5|$|St. Seiriol {{established}} a cell {{and a community}} on Puffin Island (in Welsh, Ynys Seiriol or Seiriol's Island) <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the coast {{at the same time}} as he founded the monastery. There is a tower of a 12th-century church on Puffin Island still. There is a tradition that St. Seiriol and perhaps Maelgwn Gwynedd (king of Gwynedd in the first half of the 6th century) were buried there. The island once had large numbers of puffins and guillemots. However, rats reduced the bird population to 40 in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The seafront {{stretches}} {{for approximately}} <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the pier to Salthouse Field, and includes ornamental gardens, a Victorian bandstand, a bowling green, tennis courts, crazy golf and other amusements. An {{addition to this}} list is Marine Lake, which was once a Victorian swimming pool, is now used for boating activities, {{as well as a}} small festival once a year where people can try out new sports. The Salthouse Field has a light railway running round the perimeter and is still used for donkey rides during the summer.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the San Joaquin River.|$|E

5|$|The Mud Bay force {{travelled}} in Arunta {{and came}} ashore at 23:00 in the Maclaren King, {{two of the}} ship's launches, the three Japanese landing craft and the two powered whaleboats. A base was established at Mud Bay, where a dressing station was prepared and heavy equipment, including all but one 2-inch mortar per company, was cached. The Australians then {{set out on a}} gruelling march to Kilia, guided by Papuan policemen. As they moved off, a violent thunderstorm broke, and it started to rain heavily. The force pushed on toward Kilia, but made slow progress that night due to the steep terrain and heavy rain. They were still <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> Kilia at 08:30 on 23 October, when they encountered the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The Portway {{was planned}} by the Bristol Corporation in {{response}} to the decline of Bristol Harbour in the late 19th century in favour of Avonmouth Docks, which could handle larger vessels and containers. Construction started in May 1919, engineered by L.S.McKenzie. The southern section connected to the existing road network at Hotwells, and a portion of the new road near Clifton lay partly on the line of the Bristol Port Railway. The new build did not directly connect to Avonmouth Docks, but linked to the existing road via Shirehampton about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the dock gates. The original plan was to build a tramway {{along the length of the}} road, which would have linked Avonmouth to the Bristol Tramway system, but this was abandoned owing to cost.|$|E
5|$|<b>Half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> {{the start}} of the bypass and a short {{distance}} before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US20 and NY5 meet NY21 at a four-way intersection. Like US20 and NY5, NY21 once continued directly into downtown, in this instance via Bristol Street to the east of the junction, but now follows US20 and NY5 along the east–west leg of the bypass. Past Bristol Street, the bypass widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street, where US20, NY5 and NY21 meet the southern terminus of NY332. NY21 departs the bypass, following NY332 into downtown, while US20 and NY5 continue onto the four-laned, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US20 and NY5 bypass of Canandaigua. The roadway acts a center of commerce for the city, sporting restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets along its length within the city limits.|$|E

5|$|In August 1942 No. 3 Commando was {{involved}} in the ill-fated Operation Jubilee, an exploratory raid on Dieppe in France. The plan called for a frontal assault on the port by the Canadian 2nd Division. Before this would take place, however, Troops from No. 3 and 4 Commandos would land at beaches on the eastern and western flanks and neutralise two German artillery batteries that were covering the main anchorage. No. 3 Commando was assigned the task of attacking the Goebbels Battery, landing on the eastern flank, under Durnford-Slater's command. The battery was located near Berneval-le-Grand, about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the sea with steep cliffs in front of it. It was decided that No. 3 Commando would land on two beaches to the east and west of the battery, from which gullies rose towards the battery and which would provide concealment while the Commandos approached the battery.|$|E
5|$|Planning began for {{the third}} U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight {{to build on the}} {{previous}} three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took {{about half an hour}} for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years passed}} {{before the next}} attempt on the Ostend locks. The First Ostend Raid was {{conducted}} {{in tandem with the}} similar Zeebrugge Raid led by Acting Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes on 23 April 1918; a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge. Both attacks largely failed, but while at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to success that it took several months for the British authorities to realise that it had been unsuccessful, at Ostend the attack had ended catastrophically. Both blockships intended to close off the canal had grounded over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties. Thus while Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, Ostend was open wide, nullifying any success that might have been achieved at the other port.|$|E
5|$|Young {{was born}} in Fallowfield, Manchester, where {{he lived with his}} parents and older brother Chris. His house was <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> Manchester City's Maine Road ground, which was visible from the bedroom window. As a schoolboy he played for Manchester Boys, facing opponents who were two years older. After {{catching}} the eye of scout Harry Godwin, Young signed for Manchester City as an apprentice in 1959, turning down the opportunity to join Manchester United. Around this time he was capped by England at youth level. He turned professional in July 1960, and made his first team debut in November 1961, in a 2–1 defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. After breaking into the team for the first time, Young played every match in the remainder of the 1961–62 season. He scored his first goal for the club on 23 December 1961, in a 3–0 home win against Ipswich Town. He finished his first season with 11 goals in 26 appearances.|$|E

5|$|Blacklock {{then went}} to Doncaster, where on 23 September, he started 1/2 {{favourite}} and beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Stakes over four miles. The same day he also walked over for a sweepstakes of 50 guineas each over the St. Leger course. Twenty-four hours later he beat Rasping to win a sweepstakes of 25 guineas each over four miles., {{and then went on}} to beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Club Stakes. This was his fourth race in the space of two days. At Richmond in October he won his second Dundas Stakes, this time beating King Corney. Later in the day Blacklock finished last of four runners behind winner Doctor Syntax in the Richmond Cup over four miles. Doctor Syntax had started in the lead, but was overtaken by Blacklock after only 200 yards. Blacklock held the lead until about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the finish, when Doctor Syntax joined him again. Blacklock then swerved out of line, allowing Doctor Syntax to win easily. By the time The Richmond Cup was run Blacklock was apparently unwell and was coughing repeatedly during the race.|$|E
5|$|Dunster Beach, which {{includes}} {{the mouth of the}} River Avill, is located <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the village, and used to have a significant harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from Saxon times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared, as new land was laid down among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore. During the Second World War, considerable defences were built along the coast as a part of British anti-invasion preparations, though the north coast of Somerset was an unlikely invasion site. Some of the structures remain to this day. Most notable are the pillboxes on the foreshore of Dunster Beach. These are strong buildings made from pebbles taken from the beach and bonded together with concrete. From these, soldiers could have held their ground if the Germans had ever invaded. The beach site has a number of privately owned beach huts (or chalets as some owners call them) along with a small shop, a tennis court and a putting green. The chalets, measuring , can be let out for holidays; some owners live in them all the year round.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{under the}} command of Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, was fully mobilised by late December 1943, with orders to prepare for {{airborne}} operations to be conducted during mid-1944. The division's first airborne operation would also be the first time it saw combat, conducting Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy on the night of 5/6 June, D-Day. It was tasked with guarding the left flank of the British amphibious landings by securing the area east of the city of Caen, capturing a number of bridges that spanned several rivers and canals, and then preventing any Axis forces from advancing on the British beaches. The 3rd Parachute Brigade was given several tasks to accomplish. The 9th Parachute Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, was to assault and destroy the Merville Gun Battery, as well as capturing high ground and setting up roadblocks. The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was to destroy two bridges, and the 8th Parachute Battalion had the task of destroying three bridges. When the operation began, the brigade suffered from a combination of poor navigation by the pilots of their C-47 Dakota transport aircraft, heavy cloud cover and incorrectly marked drop zones, which led to all of its units being scattered over a wide area; Hill himself was dropped with several sticks from the 1st Canadian and 9th Parachute Battalions near the River Dives. He landed in a submerged river rank approximately <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> Cabourg, and was forced to wade through four feet of water and a number of flooded irrigation ditches before reaching dry land; the same flooded areas claimed the lives of a number of paratroopers from his brigade.|$|E
