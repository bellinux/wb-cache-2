However, endemic populations of beetles, beetle infestation in 1988 was not observed in fire-injured trees. However, endemic populations of beetles, upon emergence in 1989, infested large numbers of fire-injured trees.

40|$|Abstract: Associations between root {{diseases}} and <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> (Scolytidae) constitute {{some of the}} most serious pest complexes affecting forests in North America and elsewhere. The interactive functioning of these pests derives from the following relationships: 1) root diseases predispose <b>trees</b> to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation by lowering resistance, and perhaps increasing attractiveness, of trees to the attacking beetles; 2) <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> may be vectors of root disease fungi or may create infection courts for them. Symbioses between <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> and fungi are common in nature, and previous reviewers (e. g., Graham 1967) have identified several types of these symbiotic relationships, some of which appear to be beneficial to both (mutualism), and others which apparently benefit only one (competition, predation, parasitism).

30|$|Levels of <b>bark</b> beetle-caused <b>tree</b> {{mortality}} increased substantially on unburned split plots {{compared to}} burned split plots following our initial survey. For example, in the HiD structure, we observed a 420 % {{increase in the}} number of <b>trees</b> killed by <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> (333 versus 1731) between surveys on unburned split plots compared to a 50 % increase (1139 versus 1718) on burned split plots. Similarly, in the LoD structure, we observed a > 600 % increase (41 versus 301) on unburned split plots compared to a 38 % decrease (998 versus 616) on burned split plots. Trends were similar for all individual <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> species (i.e., WPB, MPB, and FE) except Ips spp. where 96 % of all Ips-caused tree mortality was detected during our initial survey (Fettig et al. 2008). Ips spp. generally colonize slash, saplings, and weakened trees. Outbreaks are often short-lived, but increase in duration and extent when suitable host material is plentiful and populations grow sufficiently to colonize apparently healthy trees (Furniss and Carolin 1977). While concerns regarding Ips-population increases in logging slash and subsequent colonization of trees are important, prescriptions at BMEF included removal and utilization of slash following thinning. Accordingly, little or no slash was left within experimental plots to serve as breeding substrates for Ips beetles (Kegley et al. 1997, DeGomez et al. 2008). The response of Ips spp. to fuel reduction treatments at BMEF appears relatively short-lived and limited to fire-injured trees in the two smallest dbh classes (94 % of all cases) (Fettig et al. 2008). However, the apparent shift in WPB, MPB, and FE activity from burned to unburned split plots three to five years after the application of prescribed fire is concerning, and warrants further monitoring of these plots. The effect is likely due to unburned areas not benefiting from the positive effects of prescribed fire (e.g., on growing space three to five years after treatment) that affect tree vigor and thus susceptibility to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> attack (Fettig et al. 2007). Unburned areas (split plots) were adjacent to burned areas (split plots) that likely served as an important source of beetles once the abundance of fire-injured trees that were highly susceptible to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> attack declined. Interestingly, Fettig et al. (2006) observed a similar effect (albeit on a much smaller spatial scale) in another study examining the effects of chipping of unmerchantable <b>trees</b> on <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> activity in ponderosa pine stands. In that study, chipping following thinning increased plot risk to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> attack in the short-term by the production of large amounts of attractive monoterpenes. In the longer term, it decreased hazard by increasing the amount of growing space allocated to each residual tree. Surveys along the perimeter of chipped plots revealed large numbers of recently attacked trees in untreated areas that did not benefit from the positive effects of thinning, but suffered a similar level of risk associated with high levels of monoterpenes beneath the forest canopy.|$|R

Sensitivity {{analysis in the}} 3 -PG model showed {{that the effect of}} soil clay content on photosynthesis was more pronounced during drier years. Simulations also showed there may have been an effect of large interannual variations in precipitation, causing an imbalance between leaf area and stem growth, with negative impacts on tree vigor.

In this study, we examined the effects of mechanical fuel reduction treatments on the activity of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> in ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Dougl ex. Laws., forests located in Arizona and California, USA. Treatments were applied in both late spring (April–May) and late summer (August–September) and included: (1) thinned biomass chipped and randomly dispersed within each 0. 4 ha plot; (2) thinned biomass chipped, randomly dispersed within each plot and raked 2 m from the base of residual trees; (3) thinned biomass lopped- and-scattered (thinned trees cut into 1 – 2 m lengths) within each plot; (4) an untreated control. The mean percentage of residual <b>trees</b> attacked by <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> ranged from 2. 0 % (untreated control) to 30. 2 % (plots thinned in spring with all biomass chipped). A three-fold increase in the percentage of <b>trees</b> attacked by <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> was observed in chipped versus lopped-and-scattered plots. <b>Bark</b> <b>beetle</b> colonization of residual trees was higher during spring treatments, which corresponded with peak adult beetle flight periods as measured by funnel trap captures. Raking chips away from the base of residual trees did not significantly affect attack rates. Several <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> species were present including the roundheaded pine beetle, Dendroctonus adjunctus Blandford (AZ), western pine beetle, D. brevicomis LeConte (AZ and CA), mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae Hopkins (CA), red turpentine beetle, D. valens LeConte (AZ and CA), Arizona fivespined ips, Ips lecontei Swaine (AZ), California fivespined ips, I. paraconfusus Lanier (CA) and pine engraver, I. pini (Say) (AZ). Dendroctonus valens was the most common <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> infesting residual <b>trees.</b> A significant correlation was found between the number of trees chipped per plot and the percentage of residual trees with D. valens attacks. A significantly higher percentage of residual trees was attacked by D. brevicomis in plots that were chipped in spring compared to the untreated control. In lopped-and-scattered treatments, engraver beetles produced substantial broods in logging debris, but few attacks were observed on standing trees. At present, no significant difference in tree mortality exists among treatments. A few trees appeared to have died solely from D. valens attacks, as no other scolytids were observed in the upper bole. In a laboratory study conducted to provide an explanation for the <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> responses observed in this study, monoterpene elution rates from chip piles declined sharply over time, but were relatively constant in lopped-and-piled treatments. The quantities of b-pinene, 3 -carene, a-pinene and myrcene eluting from chips exceeded those from lopped-and- piled slash during each of 15 sample periods. These laboratory results may, in part, explain the <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> response observed in chipping treatments. The implications of these results to sustainable forest management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Tree-killing <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are widely}} studied at {{epidemic}} population densities {{because of their}} significant impacts on forests. At endemic levels, these species are restricted to poorly defended resources, such as wind-felled, lightning-struck, or suppressed trees. It is poorly understood how these scattered and unpredictable resources are discovered and exploited. In this prospect, the collective foraging shown by most <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> {{in the form of}} independent searching by individual beetles combined with mutual attention to each other's chemical signals, represents an efficient strategy to increase the probability to discover the resources. In order to explore the role of host distribution and collective foraging on the discovery of and settlement on wind-felled <b>trees</b> by <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> at endemic population densities, we developed a spatially explicit foraging model for the major forest pest in Europe, Ips typographus. The model is based on the diffusion of the beetles, the landing of pioneers on wind-felled trees realistically distributed based on field observations in southern Belgium, and the response of flying beetles to pheromones emitted by these pioneers. The results show that social foraging effectively increases the proportion of beetles that landed on wind-felled resources compared to solitary foragers. Furthermore, the model highlights the parameters that influenced the foraging strategy of I. typographus and that need narrower quantification in further experiments. Finally, in the frame of the tested parameters, the model highlights the existence of thresholds in the reproduction rate and {{in the size of the}} starting population under which populations collapse. If confirmed, this prediction would shed new light on the understanding of foraging at low, endemic population levels. SCOPUS: ar. jSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study, {{which is}} part of a {{research}} on resistance factors of spruce against Ips typographus, analyses relationships between the intensity of the <b>bark</b> <b>beetle's</b> attacks and anatomical characteristics of the bark. Bags of synthetic pheromones were hung on 10 healthy trees in each of the two stands of 50 and 70 years old spruce trees. Two months later, these variables and the intensity of the insects attacks were quantified. In the 70 years old stand, the intensity of attacks was hardly related to the anatomical characteristics of the bark. However, for the other stand, 59 % and 83 % of the variability of the attacks at 3 and 6 meters respectively are explained by the anatomical characteristics, mainly due to the thickness of dead parenchyma and phloem of the outer bark. This may be partly due to chemical substances impregnating these tissues. Moreover, {{it would seem that the}} resiniferous system is not a major resistance factor of the <b>tree</b> against the <b>bark</b> <b>beetle.</b> Lastly, the intracellular starch content decreases the most on heavily infested trees...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ecologists {{and fire}} {{scientists}} have recommended reintroducing fire in fire-dependent ecosystems {{to achieve the}} twin goals of restoring pre-settlement forest conditions and reducing catastrophic fire risk (McKelvey 1996, Parsons 1995). Early work by forest entomologists (Miller 1927, Miller 1960; Rasmussen et al. 1996, Salman 1934) established a direct relationship between fire injury and subsequent insect attack in burned-over areas. Initial concern has centered on the primary tree killers Dendroctonus spp. and Scolytus ventralis LeConte. This research is also finding that Dendroctonus valens and Ips pini are causing tree mortality with both fall and spring prescribed burns. Post-burning <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> induced mortality can be quite signifi-cant as demonstrated by two case studies presented here from Lassen Volcanic National Park and Spooner Summit, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit. From these two sites, inferences are made {{on the effect of}} seasonality for predisposing <b>trees</b> to particular <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> In comparing these two populations, {{there was no significant difference}} in the mean number of trees killed by insects in each seasonal window. As case studies, not enough replicates existed to merit a more rigorous analysis. As such, management implications of post-burning <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> response are discussed given the information available on fire-insect interactions during these two seasonal windows...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find factors that influence the occurrence of three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) in Šumava at a time when the <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> gradation caused by Kyrill subside. The research was conducted on five transects. To prove the presence of three-toed woodpecker was opted the method of an acoustic provocation, which reliability was well proven. The hypothesis was that the three-toed woodpecker prefers the <b>trees</b> infested by <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> instead of healthy trees. Surprisingly, however, he also prefered the stands where the main attack took place several years ago. Regardless of their health status the tree- toed woodpecker preferred non-intervention stands instead of the on- going management forest. Among other factors, the exposure was applied (preferred south and west) and elevation (median, minimum altitude of about 1100 m.). Another important result is that Picoides tridactylus prefers for its food stands still alive or just dead spruce trees infested by the <b>bark</b> <b>beetle.</b> Overall, it appears that the three-toed species has narrowly defined biotope demands, which are linked to the natural spruce forest unaffected by people. The results of this study could be used to better understanding of the ecology three-toed woodpecker, eventually can help to create a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tree-killing <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera, Scolytinae) {{are among}} the most {{economically}} and ecologically important forest pests in the northern hemisphere. Induction of terpenoid-based oleoresin has long been considered important in conifer defense against <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> but it has been difficult to demonstrate a direct correlation between terpene levels and resistance to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> colonization. METHODS: To test for inhibitory effects of induced terpenes on colonization by the spruce <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Ips typographus (L.) we inoculated 20 mature Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karsten trees with a virulent fungus associated with the beetle, Ceratocystis polonica (Siem.) C. Moreau, and investigated induced terpene levels and beetle colonization in the bark. RESULTS: Fungal inoculation induced very strong and highly variable terpene accumulation 35 days after inoculation. Trees with high induced terpene levels (n =  7) had only 4. 9 % as many beetle attacks (5. 1 vs. 103. 5 attacks m(- 2)) and 2. 6 % as much gallery length (0. 029 m m(- 2) vs. 1. 11 m m(- 2)) as trees with low terpene levels (n =  6). There was a highly significant rank correlation between terpene levels at day 35 and beetle colonization in individual trees. The relationship between induced terpene levels and beetle colonization was not linear but thresholded: above a low threshold concentration of ∼ 100 mg terpene g(- 1) dry phloem trees suffered only moderate beetle colonization, and above a high threshold of ∼ 200 mg terpene g(- 1) dry phloem trees were virtually unattacked. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study demonstrating a dose-dependent relationship between induced terpenes and <b>tree</b> resistance to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> colonization under field conditions, indicating that terpene induction may be instrumental in tree resistance. This knowledge could be useful for developing management strategies that decrease the impact of tree-killing <b>bark</b> <b>beetles...</b>|$|R
