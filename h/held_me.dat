500|$|Kinsler had a {{physical}} challenge to overcome. [...] "I've had asthma my whole life", Kinsler said. [...] "That was tough when I was younger. I woke {{up a lot}} and couldn't breathe, and {{had to go to}} the hospital in the middle of the night. It kind of <b>held</b> <b>me</b> back from athletics. I still have it, but I control it. Now I use an atomizer or an inhaler. When I was younger, I used this breathing machine… I hated that thing. I always wanted to run around and be active." ...|$|E
500|$|Thorpe's {{comeback}} {{attempt in}} the 200m freestyle {{came to an}} abrupt end on day 2 of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, on 16 March 2012. No longer allowed to wear the full-body racing suit (covering from neck to ankles and wrists) with which he set all of his world records– but are now banned by FINA rule changes– he competed wearing just the [...] "jammer" [...] (hip to thigh) racing shorts. He swam very well in the morning heats, cruising to 1:49.18, a time which placed him equal fifth fastest. However, in the semi-finals that evening he faded over the last 100 meters, finishing in 12th place at 1:49.91. Speaking to reporters immediately afterwards, Thorpe said, [...] "The last 100 was a struggle, I'm not sure why. This was slower than what I swam this morning, probably the inexperience of racing in the last 18 months <b>held</b> <b>me</b> up. The fairytale has turned into a nightmare." [...] In the 100m freestyle on day 3 (17 March), Thorpe won his heat (the 9th of 12) but failed to break 50 seconds and did not advance to the semi-finals with the top 16 sprinters. Thus, his bid to qualify for the London Olympics officially ended.|$|E

[...] "He beat me, <b>held</b> <b>me</b> captive and {{wanted me to be}} in ménages à trois," [...] Silva told People magazine. [...] "I didn’t want that world of drugs and weirdness." [...] Still, she remembers, [...] "He’d write me a song or promise to change, and I’d try again. We were always fighting, then getting back together." ...|$|E

2500|$|We combatted this {{enterprise}} {{by writing}} to Ribbentrop, Himmler, and Hitler, and, thereafter, {{the governments of}} Italy, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and other countries. We succeeded in foiling this initiative, a circumstance that led the Jews to make terrible accusations against me, in which they <b>held</b> <b>me</b> accountable for the liquidation of four hundred thousand Jews who were unable to emigrate to Palestine in this period. They added that I should be tried as a war criminal in Nurenberg.|$|E

Walter White {{was talking}} to his students, I was able to dumb down certain moments of {{description}} and dialogue in the early episodes which <b>held</b> <b>me</b> until we had some help from some honest-to-God chemists," [...] says Gilligan. According to Gilligan, Nelson [...] "vets our scripts {{to make sure our}} chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date. We also have a chemist with the Drug Enforcement Administration based out of Dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us." [...] Nelson spoke of Gilligan's interest in having the science right: [...] " [...] said it made a difference to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Warhol's {{collections}} included airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, {{among other}} eccentricities. It also included significant works of art, such as George Bellows's Miss Bentham. One of his main collections was his wigs. Warhol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hairpieces, which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry {{for that day}} that he wrote: [...] "I don't know what <b>held</b> <b>me</b> back from pushing her over the balcony." ...|$|E

2500|$|Together Haffkine and Silverstein {{produced}} {{a collection of}} scatological renaissance style poetry and satire onto vinyl, six years after its predecessor, Freakin' at the Freakers Ball (1972). The record's adult content aptly demonstrated one of Silverstein's most distinguishing lyrical motifs when dealing with controversial material. [...] The album titles tackle a myriad of social taboos, including homosexual incest ("Father of a Boy Named Sue"), prolific marijuana ("The Smoke Off") and cocaine ("They <b>Held</b> <b>Me</b> Down") use, and even an interspecies love song ("The Cat and the Rat"). [...] Silverstein occasionally accompanies himself on acoustic guitar, with an undeniable quirky melodic style. In 2002, Songs & Stories was issued on CD by laugh.com.|$|E
2500|$|La Toya Jackson ended her estrangement {{with the}} entire Jackson family and {{returned}} home to Hayvenhurst. Jackson forgave her parents for her stifled upbringing reasoning, [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} as we get older, we grow and learn a lot more. And I think that my father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held out his arms and just hugged me. I was crying saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just <b>held</b> <b>me</b> tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E
2500|$|The World's Wife, a {{collection}} of poems by Carol Ann Duffy, features a sonnet entitled Anne Hathaway, based on the passage from Shakespeare's will regarding his [...] "second-best bed". Duffy chooses the view {{that this would be}} their marriage bed, and so a memento of their love, not a slight. Anne remembers their lovemaking as a form of [...] "romance and drama", unlike the [...] "prose" [...] written on the best bed used by guests, [...] "I hold him in the casket of my widow's head/ as he <b>held</b> <b>me</b> upon that next best bed". In Robert Nye's novel Mrs. Shakespeare: the Complete Works, which purports to be Anne's autobiographical reminiscences, Shakespeare buys the best bed with money given to him by the Earl of Southampton. When Anne comes to London, the couple use the bed for wild sexual adventures, in which they engage in role-playing fantasies based on his plays. He refers to the bed he bequeaths her as [...] "the second best" [...] to remind her of the best bed of their memories. The novel was dramatised for BBC radio in 1998 with Maggie Steed playing Hathaway.|$|E

2500|$|Ali {{opened the}} fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, {{beginning}} in the second round—and {{to the consternation of}} his corner—Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the [...] "Rope-a-dope", so violated conventional boxing wisdom—letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will—that at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. In reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: [...] "I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he <b>held</b> <b>me</b> and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was." ...|$|E
2500|$|I told Foster I {{should hold}} {{him for the}} money, and the old man, Van Triplett, said we acted as if we could not trust him, and gave {{some of the money}} back, and then said he would give us a chance to win it , so Foster turned the right card and [...] started to give him the money, but said, ‘Supposing you had bet that in earnest, did you have the money to put up?’ Foster said, ‘No,’ and turning to me said, ‘You have the money,’ and I said no, I did not have any money; that he took it all, but he said, ‘You have some dust,’ and wanted me to get it just to show the old man that we had the money in case the bet had been a real one. Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they <b>held</b> <b>me</b> and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E
