40|$|Clouds {{are still}} one of the largest {{uncertainties}} of the current climate models. While satellites provide suitable global datasets for comparing with cloud properties derived from models, satellite retrievals are inferences of cloud properties, rather than direct measurements, and therefore have errors. Therefore, it is important to evaluate satellite cloud products and gain advanced understanding of the products to accurately interpret the observations. This study investigates Aqua AIRS version 6 Level 2 cloud thermodynamic phase, ice cloud optical thickness, and ice cloud effective diameter, which released in April, 2013 and are available for all 13 years of the AIRS record. A filtering and gridding algorithm is used to create customized globally gridded datasets to evaluate the effects of satellite's viewing zenith angle, effective cloud fraction, cloud layers, cloud top temperature, time of the year, and geographic region. Viewing zenith angle does not strongly affect AIRS ice-phase, but higher viewing zenith angles lead to more water and fewer unknown pixels; the viewing zenith angle dependence is not strongly affected {{by the time of the}} year. Higher effective cloud fraction yields more ice- and water-phase, and less unknown-phase retrievals. Also, higher effective cloud fractions lead to greater values of ice cloud optical thickness. In addition, especially in high latitudes, ice-phase frequency is greater for two-layer clouds than single-layer clouds. On the other hand, water- and unknown-phase frequencies are greater for single layer clouds. Also, higher viewing zenith angles slightly decrease <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> top temperature. Approximately 90 % of ice-phase cases have <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> top temperature values between 210 K and 235 K, ~ 80 % of water-phase cases are found at 243 - 273 K <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> top temperature interval, and ~ 80 % of the unknown cases have <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> top temperature values between 230 and 264 K.

40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} {{the processes of}} development and maintenance of low-level clouds during major synoptic events, the cloudy boundary layer under stormy conditions during the summertime Arctic has been studied using observations from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment and large-eddy simulations (LES). On 29 July 1998, a stable Arctic cloudy boundary-layer event was observed {{after the passage of}} a synoptic low pressure system. The local dynamic and thermodynamic structure of the boundary layer was determined from aircraft measurements including the analysis of turbulence, cloud micro-physics and radiative properties. After the <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> layer advected over the existing cloud layer, the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget indicated that the cloud layer below 200 m was maintained predominantly by shear production. Observations of longwave radiation showed that cloud-top cooling at the lower cloud top has been suppressed by radiative effects of the <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> layer. Our LES results demonstrate the importance of the combination of shear mixing near the surface and radiative cooling at the cloud top in the storm-driven cloudy boundary layer. Once the low-level cloud reaches a certain height, depending on the amount of cloud-top cooling, the two sources of TKE production begin to separate in space under continuous stormy conditions, suggesting one possible mechanism for the cloud layering. The sensitivity tests suggest that the storm-driven cloudy boundary layer is possibly switched to the shear-driven system due to the advection of <b>upper</b> <b>clouds</b> or to the buoyantly driven system {{due to the lack of}} wind shear.

40|$|We {{study the}} Hα and Ca II 8542 Å line spectra of four typical Ellerman bombs (EBs) in active region NOAA 11765 on 2013 June 6, {{observed}} with the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph {{installed at the}} 1. 6 meter New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Considering that EBs may occur in a restricted region in the lower atmosphere, and that their spectral lines show particular features, we propose a two-cloud model to fit the observed line profiles. The lower cloud can account for the wing emission, and the <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> is mainly responsible for the absorption at line center. After choosing carefully the free parameters, we get satisfactory fitting results. As expected, the lower cloud shows an increase of the source function, corresponding to a temperature increase of 400 [...] 1000 K in EBs relative to the quiet Sun. This {{is consistent with previous}} results deduced from semi-empirical models and confirms that a local heating occurs in the lower atmosphere during the appearance of EBs. We also find that the optical depths can increase to some extent in both the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>clouds,</b> which may result from either a direct heating in the lower cloud, or illumination by an enhanced radiation on the <b>upper</b> <b>cloud.</b> The velocities derived from this method, however, are different from those obtained using the traditional bisector method, implying that one should be cautious when interpreting this parameter. The two-cloud model can thus be used as an efficient method to deduce the basic physical parameters of EBs. Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Observations of Neptune {{were made}} in September 2009 with the Gemini-North Telescope in Hawaii, using the NIFS {{instrument}} in the H-band covering the wavelength range 1. 477 - 1. 803 μm. Observations were acquired in adaptive optics mode and have a spatial resolution of approximately 0. 15 - 0. 25 ″. The observations were analysed with a multiple-scattering retrieval algorithm to determine the opacity of clouds at different levels in Neptune's atmosphere. We find that the observed spectra at all locations are very well fit with a model that has two thin cloud layers, one at a pressure level of ∼ 2. bar all over the planet and an <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> whose pressure level varies from 0. 02 to 0. 08. bar in the bright mid-latitude region at 20 - 40 °S to as deep as 0. 2. bar near the equator. The opacity of the <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> is found to vary greatly with position, but the opacity of the lower cloud deck appears remarkably uniform, except for localised bright spots near 60 °S and a possible slight clearing near the equator. A limb-darkening analysis of the observations suggests that the single-scattering albedo of the <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> particles varies from ∼ 0. 4 in regions of low overall albedo to close to 1. 0 in bright regions, while the lower cloud is consistent with particles that have a single-scattering albedo of ∼ 0. 75 at this wavelength, similar to the value determined for the main cloud deck in Uranus' atmosphere. The Henyey-Greenstein scattering particle asymmetry of particles in the <b>upper</b> <b>cloud</b> deck {{are found to be}} in the range g∼ 0. 6 - 0. 7 (i. e. reasonably strongly forward scattering). Numerous bright clouds are seen near Neptune's south pole at a range of pressure levels and at latitudes between 60 and 70 °S. Discrete clouds were seen at the pressure level of the main cloud deck (∼ 2. bar) at 60 °S on three of the six nights observed. Assuming they are the same feature we estimate the rotation rate at this latitude and pressure to be 13. 2 ± 0. 1. h. However, the observations are not entirely consistent with a single non-evolving cloud feature, which suggests that the cloud opacity or albedo may vary very rapidly at this level at a rate not seen in any other giant-planet atmosphere. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
