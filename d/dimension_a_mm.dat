Under various constraints the displacement or deflection of the silicon plate attached to the piezoelectric material plate is obtained from simulation and used for the analysis. For analysis purpose a circular and a square shaped silicon plate/membrane has been taken separately into consideration which are simulated under various size, shape and input excitations and the results are compared to determine the optimum <b>dimension.</b> For <b>a</b> 5 <b>mm</b> diameter/edge length silicon plate, the optimum diameter of circular PZT plate obtained is 4. 6 mm, whereas, it is 4. 1 mm edge length for square PZT plate...|$|R

The {{space between the}} core and jacket is filled with polyethylene, and {{the tip of the}} penetrator is exposed {{at the front of the}} bullet, to achieve better penetration. The penetration range for body armor is specified at up to 40 m.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to report new data for flow of gases, liquids, and liquid mixtures in 11 m long micro-channels. Three test sections of the following <b>dimensions</b> (<b>a)</b> 1. 5 <b>mm</b> deep 0. 75 mm wide (MC 1), (b) 0. 5 mm deep 0. 95 mm wide (MC 2), and (c) 0. 3 mm deep 1. 0 mm wide (MC 3) were cut in a serpentine form on a stainless steel substrate. The gases studied were air, nitrogen, and oxygen. The liquids used were ethanol, methanol, and their mixtures. The measured flow rate and pressure drop were used to evaluate friction factors in the micro-channels. Analysis of friction factor versus Reynolds number relation shows a perceptible dependence on channel dimensions. Transitions to turbulent regime were identified by a change in slope of friction factor versus Reynolds number curve. Transitions were mild and occurred at lower Reynolds numbers than in normal channels. The results are interpreted in terms of a channel geometry parameter...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} a new nuclear medical imaging {{technique}} based on the measurement of the emitter location in the three <b>dimensions</b> with <b>a</b> few <b>mm</b> spatial resolution using β+γ emitters. Such measurement could be realized thanks to {{a new kind of}} radio-nuclides which emit a γ-ray quasi-simultaneously with the β+ decay. The most interesting radio-nuclide candidate, namely 44 Sc, will be potentially produced at the Nantes cyclotron ARRONAX. The principle is to reconstruct the intersection of the classical line of response (obtained with a standard PET camera) with the direction cone defined by the third γ-ray. The emission angle measurement of this additional γ-ray involves the use of a Compton telescope for which a new generation of camera based on a liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chamber is considered. GEANT 3 simulations of a large acceptance LXe Compton telescope combined with a commercial micro-PET (LSO crystals) have been performed and the obtained results will be presented. They demonstrate that a good image can be obtained from the accumulation of each three-dimensional measured position. A spatial resolution of 2. 3 mm has been reached with an injected activity of 0. 5 MBq for a 44 Sc point source emitter...|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of Epoxy to repair of cracks such as Flexural cracks and Shear cracks of various widths {{in the concrete}} were examined. The main focus of research investigation is {{in the areas of}} the concrete Repair and Rehabilitation which have been formulated by injection of Epoxy Resin under high pressure for their behaviour. The bonding characteristics of rehabilitated beams were suitably analyzed for their behaviour. The first stage of experimental programme involves studying the static behaviour of flexural member under two point static loading to obtain the load deflection behaviour having sectional <b>dimensions</b> 150 <b>Ã</b> 230 <b>mm</b> with <b>an</b> effective span of 2000 mm. Three test beam specimens were tested at 100, 70 and 40 of the ultimate loads respectively to create flexural and shear cracks. Energy absorption capacity, toughness index and ductility index were evaluated. The second stage of experimental investigation involves flexural test of rehabilitated failed test specimen after epoxy resin injection. It is experimentally evident that the rehabilitated beams behaved much better with respect to the first crack load, energy absorption capacity, toughness index and ductility index as compared to the beam before rehabilitation. The proposed technique is simple and economical to execute and has resulted in an adhesively bonded joints without any additional effort such as jacketing or shear connectors.

40|$|The {{innovative}} approach presented here will realize so-called e-CUBES® (electronic cubes) [1], i. e. investigate and develop ultra small sensor cubes with <b>dimensions</b> of <b>a</b> few <b>mm</b> 3 which are wirelessly communicating among each other. The fabrication of e-CUBES with {{their need for}} high-level miniaturization (see Fig. 1) can only be realized by system integration technologies, which use the third dimension: 3 D System Integration. In general not only one 3 D integration technology is suitable for the fabrication of the large variety of 3 D integrated systems. Moreover, a single product may need several different technologies for a cost-effective fabrication. Wireless sensor systems represent an excellent example for the need of a suitable mixture. Consisting of MEMS, ASICs, memories, antennas, and power supply modules they can only be fabricated in a cost-effective way by application of 3 D technologies, which are particularly optimized for {{the integration of the}} different sub-modules. The main objective is to achieve extreme miniaturization of wireless sensor nodes. In consequence, all wiring should be realized through the stacked devices. Wire bonds are replaced by through-Si vias combined with electrical and mechanical interconnections between the devices. The removal of long wire bonds is especially beneficial for sensors based on a capacitive sensing principle (rather than i. e. a piezo-resistive sensing principle), since parasitic effects will be reduced...|$|R

When operating at a given frequency the dis-persion nonlinear values may be very {{different from those of the}} linear state, and their correct value must be evaluated starting from a nonlinear model of the structure. The indi-cated dispersion nonlinear behavior is presented as an exam-ple, but the analysis of other different rib structures allow us to generalize the results. Further investigation must be ex-tended in this direction. CONCLUSIONS In a standard rib waveguide the change of parameters has not proved to be very effective in the control of the group velocity dispersion; in particular, no negative dispersion may be obtained in the single-mode region. When a depressed. index layer usually called a notch is interposed between the guiding region and the substrate, a negative GVD may be easily obtained; in a rib guide with a proper choice of other parameters as the width of the loading strip a controlled amount of negative GVD may be obtained and the region of single-mode operation may be extended. Under high optical intensity when a Kerrlike nonlinear behavior in the guiding region must be taken into account, the {{waveguide dispersion}} must be evaluated under a nonlinear model because those nonlinear values may be very different from those of the linear state...|$|R
