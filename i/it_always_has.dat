25|$|When a salt is {{dissolved}} in a solvent, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> {{the effect of}} raising the boiling point of that solvent – that is it decreases the volatility of the solvent. When the salt is readily soluble in one constituent of a mixture but not in another, the volatility of the constituent {{in which it is}} soluble is decreased and the other constituent is unaffected. In this way, for example, it is possible to break the water/ethanol azeotrope by dissolving potassium acetate in it and distilling the result.|$|E
25|$|By the {{government}} decree of July 1998 the polytechnics started {{to offer a}} two-stage curriculum (the first three years conferring a bacharelato degree, the following two years a licenciatura bietápica degree); both are undergraduate degrees, but the universities were offering a single licentiate degree (licenciatura) of four to five years. This was changed with the Bologna process with {{a new system of}} three years for a bachelor's degree (licenciatura). Two additional years grant a master's degree (mestrado) which is conferred by the polytechnic institute under protocols with a partner university or alone when the polytechnic institution is in full compliance with the necessary requirements (proper research activity, doctoral teaching staff, and budget). The doctoral degree (doutoramento) is conferred only by the universities, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> been. By the time of the implementation of the Bologna Process (2006) in Portuguese higher education, 9.5% of the state-run polytechnic teaching staff had a doctorate degree in 2005 - 15% in 2007 after the Bologna Process.|$|E

[...] In the 80s and 90s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis.|$|E

500|$|Galois theory {{concerns}} {{transformations of}} number fields that permute {{the roots of}} an equation. Consider a polynomial equation of a variable x of degree n, in which the coefficients are drawn from some ground field, which might be, for example, the field of real numbers, rational numbers, or the integers modulo7. There {{may or may not}} be choices of x, which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called roots. If the polynomial is x2+1 and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of x makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is extended, however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> a number of roots equal to its degree. Continuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, i and −i, where i is the imaginary unit, that is, [...] More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the splitting field of the polynomial.|$|E

[...] Heather Phares of Allmusic used [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] {{as an example}} of, according to her, a recurring problem on Can't Be Tamed: [...] "too often, Cyrus equates grown-up with joyless". Alexis Petridis of the United Kingdom magazine The Guardian felt the song was a gamely attempt at Lady Gaga. He said the chorus invites the answer: [...] "probably that creepy bloke from the Disney Channel who went on about violating your godliness." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters also found an alternate answer to the song's chorus. [...] "It’s commerce that owns your heart, Miley, and <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> been", he wrote. Mikael Wood of Billboard compared [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] to 2010 singles released by The Black Eyed Peas. Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{said it was a}} post-GaGa Hi-NRG track that was inclined to the generic. However, he said that lyrical references were a large reminder that Cyrus sung the track. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic deemed [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] {{to be one of the}} best tracks from Can't Be Tamed, despite containing a [...] "cheesy ABBA-worthy chorus". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times also perceived the song to be [...] "in the vein of Cascada" [...] and one of the most [...] "exciting" [...] on Can't Be Tamed. He said it was a sound that [...] "Ms. Cyrus hasn’t previously shown any affinity for and may never again. Still, it’s a timely and sharp sound." ...|$|E
