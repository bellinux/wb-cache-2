5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} an interest <b>in</b> <b>science,</b> and liked creating and building things.

That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E

5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers <b>in</b> <b>science</b> and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded <b>in</b> <b>science</b> and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions <b>in</b> <b>science</b> and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E

5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific.

These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E
