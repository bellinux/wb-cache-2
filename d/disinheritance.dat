25|$|In February 1538 Jean de Ferrières {{was given}} two benefices by his father. Less {{than two years}} later, however, he was disinherited by both {{his father and mother}} when they made their joint last wills on 23 December 1539. Although the reason for his <b>disinheritance</b> is unknown, d'Estang {{suggests}} that it may have been due to his abandonment of the Catholic religion.|$|E
25|$|When Marianne recovers, Elinor {{tells her}} of Willoughby's visit. Marianne realises {{that she could}} never have been happy with Willoughby's immoral, erratic, and inconsiderate nature. She values Elinor's conduct in her similar {{situation}} and resolves to model herself after Elinor's courage and good sense. Edward arrives and reveals that, after his <b>disinheritance,</b> Lucy jilted him in favour of his now wealthy brother, Robert. Edward and Elinor soon marry, and later Marianne marries Colonel Brandon, having gradually come to love him.|$|E
25|$|Even though Ranjitsinhji was {{no longer}} heir, Vibhaji {{increased}} his financial allowance but passed the responsibility for his education to the Bombay Presidency. With his fees coming from the allowance, Ranjitsinhji continued his education at the Rajkumar College. Although his material position remained unchanged, comments made at the time by {{the principal of the}} college, Chester Macnaghten, suggest that Ranjitsinhji was bitterly disappointed by his <b>disinheritance.</b> The college was organised and run like an English public school and Ranjitsinhji began to excel.|$|E
25|$|Exile was inflicted for incest with a daughter; <b>disinheritance</b> for incest with a stepmother, or for {{repeated}} unfilial conduct. Sixty {{strokes of}} an ox-hide scourge were awarded for a brutal {{assault on a}} superior, both being amelu. Branding (perhaps the equivalent of degradation to slavery) was the penalty for slander of a married woman or vestal. Permanent deprivation of office fell upon the corrupt judge. Enslavement befell the extravagant wife and unfilial children. Imprisonment was common, but is {{not mentioned in the}} Code.|$|E
25|$|The Steele sisters come to London {{as guests}} of Mrs Jennings {{and after a}} brief {{acquaintance}} {{they are asked to}} stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house. Lucy sees the invitation as a personal compliment, rather than what it is, a slight to Elinor and Marianne who, being family, should have received such invitation first. Too talkative, Anne Steele betrays Lucy's secret. As a result, the Misses Steele are turned out of the house, and Edward is ordered to break off the engagement on pain of <b>disinheritance.</b> Edward refuses to comply and is immediately disinherited in favour of his brother, gaining respect for his conduct, and sympathy from Elinor and Marianne. Colonel Brandon shows his admiration by offering Edward the living of Delaford parsonage, so that he can marry Lucy as soon as he is ordained.|$|E
25|$|The {{peculiar}} {{nature of}} Casaubon's will leads to suspicion that Ladislaw and Dorothea are lovers, creating awkwardness between the two. Ladislaw is secretly {{in love with}} Dorothea but keeps this to himself, having no desire to involve her in scandal or to cause her <b>disinheritance.</b> He remains in Middlemarch, working as a newspaper editor for Mr Brooke. When Brooke's election campaign collapses, he decides to leave the town and visits Dorothea to say his farewell. But Dorothea has also {{fallen in love with}} Ladislaw, whom she had previously seen only as her husband's unfortunate relative. However, the peculiar nature of Casaubon's will has led her to see him in a new light. Renouncing Casaubon's fortune, she shocks her family again by announcing that she will marry Ladislaw. At the same time, Fred, who has been successful in his new career, marries Mary.|$|E
25|$|Andronikos II's {{policies}} were not successful {{in dealing with}} Byzantium's external problems; however, it would be threats from within the Empire {{that led to his}} abdication — in 1320 Andronikos III, the young (in his twenties) grandson of Andronikos II was disinherited by the Emperor. Andronikos III's brother Manuel Palaiologos had been accidentally murdered by Andronikos III's companions over a competitive love affair. His father (Michael IX), the son of Andronikos II, died of shock {{as a result of his}} son's death. Andronikos III did not take his <b>disinheritance</b> lightly — organizing an armed opposition, he succeeded in drawing support with promises of generous tax cuts, even beyond those enacted by Andronikos II. Andronikos II was powerless to stop the young usurper; he granted him Thrace as an appanage in 1321, the title of co-emperor in 1322, and after a small war where the Bulgarians and Serbians played the two sides against each other, Andronikos II was forced to abdicate and retire as a monk to a monastery, where he died in 1332.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after he}} assumed {{the title of}} Dauphin, Charles {{negotiated}} a truce with John in Pouilly. Charles then requested a private meeting with John, on 10 September 1419 at a bridge in Montereau, promising his personal guarantee of protection. The meeting, however, was a ploy to assassinate John, whom Charles [...] "hacked to death" [...] on the bridge. His father, King Charles, immediately disinherited his son. The civil war ended after John's death. The Dauphin's actions fueled more rumor about his legitimacy, and his <b>disinheritance</b> {{set the stage for}} the Treaty of Troyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alida!" [...] {{cried the}} burgher, {{for the fourth}} and last time, [...] "come forth, child; I forgive thee thy idle sport, and all I have said of <b>disinheritance</b> was but a jest. Come forth, my sister's daughter, and kiss thy old uncle!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The dog-cart that Arthur {{had hired}} {{to take him}} away belonged to an old-fashioned inn in the parish of Rewtham, {{situated}} {{about a mile from}} Rewtham House (which had just passed {{into the hands of the}} Bellamys), and two from Bratham Abbey, and thither Arthur had himself driven. His Jehu, known through all the country round as [...] "Old Sam," [...] was an ancient ostler, who had been in the service of the Rewtham [...] "King's Head," [...] man and boy, for over fifty years, and from him Arthur collected a good deal of inaccurate information about the Caresfoot family, including a garbled version of all the death of Angela's mother and Philip's <b>disinheritance.</b>|$|E
60|$|But when {{he thought}} of the marriage, Isaac Worthington ground his teeth. A certain {{sentiment}} which we may call pride was so strong in him that he felt ready to make almost any sacrifice to prevent it. To hinder it he had quarrelled with his son, and driven him away, and threatened <b>disinheritance.</b> The price was indeed heavy--the heaviest he could pay. But the alternative--was not that heavier? To relinquish his dream of power, to sink for a while into a crippled state; for he had spent large sums, and one of those periodical depressions had come in the business of the mills, and those Western investments were not looking so bright now.|$|E
60|$|For {{this same}} reason, {{because it was}} distasteful, she had never said {{anything}} of her contemplated marriage to Pigott, {{and it was quite}} unknown in the neighbourhood. Since the Miss Lee scandal and his consequent <b>disinheritance,</b> nobody had visited Philip Caresfoot, and those who took interest in him or his affairs were few. Indeed the matter had been kept a dead secret. But on the seventh of June, being the day previous to the ceremony, Angela went down to her nurse's cottage and told her what was about to be done, suppressing, however, from various motives, all mention of her agreement with George. It added to her depression to find that Pigott was unaccountably disturbed at the news.|$|E
60|$|It {{was within}} a moon of this funeral {{that the great}} ones of Egypt came to Memphis to name the Prince as Pharaoh, and with them came her Highness, the Queen Userti. I {{was present at the}} ceremony, which to me was very strange. There was the Vizier Nehesi; there was the high-priest Roi and with him many other priests; and there was even the old chamberlain Pambasa, pompous yet grovelling as before, {{although}} he had deserted the household of the Prince after his <b>disinheritance</b> for that of the Pharaoh Amenmeses. His appearance with his wand of office and long white beard, of which he was so proud because it was his own, drew from Seti the only laugh I had heard him utter for many weeks.|$|E
60|$|There was {{yet another}} codicil. It bore the date of June 1840, and was made at Brighton, {{immediately}} after the separation with Lady Monmouth. It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great emergency. He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all right. He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed of, it must principally refer to the <b>disinheritance</b> of Coningsby, secured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer. And then to whom could Lord Monmouth leave his money? However he might cut and carve up his fortunes, Rigby, and especially {{at a moment when}} he had so served him, must come in for a considerable slice.|$|E
60|$|His {{letter was}} {{answered}} in person. Millbank met Henry Sydney and Buckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby. Once more {{they were all}} four together; but under what different circumstances, and with what different prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton! Alone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could not convey. He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but they would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in {{the present state of}} affairs, all was hopeless. In no way did Coningsby ever permit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his <b>disinheritance.</b> He was, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his inmost soul.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} unaccountable errors {{committed}} by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as [...] "the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr. Shuttleworthy." [...] The people had really never thought of this before. They had only remembered certain threats of <b>disinheritance</b> uttered {{a year or two}} previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this <b>disinheritance</b> as a matter that was settled--so single-minded a race of beings were the Rattleburghers; but the remark of [...] "Old Charley" [...] brought them at once to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?--a question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and misconceived. [...] "Cui bono?" [...] in all the crack novels and elsewhere,--in those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of [...] "Cecil,") a lady who quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her learning, [...] "as needed," [...] upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,--in all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little Latin words cui bono are rendered [...] "to what purpose?" [...] or, (as if quo bono,) [...] "to what good." [...] Their true meaning, nevertheless, is [...] "for whose advantage." [...] Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely legal phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deed's accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the question cui bono? very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His uncle had threatened him, after making a will in his favour, with <b>disinheritance.</b> But the threat had not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been altered. Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder {{on the part of the}} suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat to alter remained suspended over the nephew's head, there appears at once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded, very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it is, and I know {{also that}} it is worth your while to pay thirty {{thousand}} pounds to save yourself from the scandal, the chance of <b>disinheritance,</b> and the certainty {{of the loss of}} the woman whom you want to marry. So well do I know it that I have prepared the necessary deeds for your signature, and here they are. Listen, sir," [...] he went on sternly; [...] "refuse to accept my terms and by to-night's post I shall send this letter of instructions. Also I shall send to Mr. Cossey, Senior, and to Mr. de la Molle copies of these two precious epistles," [...] and he pointed to the incriminating documents, [...] "together with a copy of the letter to my agents; and where will you be then? Consent, and I will bind myself not to proceed in any way or form. Now, make your choice." ...|$|E

"I understood," [...] she {{informed}} him, a smile--a cruelly bitter smile--lifting and steadying {{the corner of}} her lately quivering lip, [...] "when he alluded to your lordship's straitened circumstances. He has no <b>disinheritance</b> to fear because he has no inheritance to look for beyond the entail, of which you cannot disinherit him. My Lord Rotherby sets a high value upon himself. He may--I do not know--he may have been in love with me--though not as I know love, which is all sacrifice, all self-denial. But by his lights he may have cared for me; he must have done, by his lights. Had I been a lady of fortune, not a doubt but he would have made me his wife; as it was, he must aim at a more profitable marriage, and meanwhile, to gratify his love for me--base as it was--he would--he would--O God! I cannot say it. You understand, my lord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{my cousin}} and I were in Paris, just before my illness, we met her. She {{was with her}} father then, a gay old man who led a life of pleasure, and was no fit {{guardian}} for a lovely daughter. She knew our story and, having fascinated both, paused to decide which she would accept: Jasper, for his title, or me, for my fortune. This was before my uncle changed his will, and I believed myself his heir; but, before she made her choice, something (don't ask me what, if you please) occurred to send us from Paris. On our return voyage we were wrecked, and then came my illness, <b>disinheritance,</b> and helplessness. Edith Dubarry heard the story, but rumor reported it falsely, and she believed both of us had lost the fortune. Her father died penniless, {{and in a moment}} of despair she married the general, whose wealth surrounds her with the luxury she loves, and whose failing health will soon restore her liberty--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Thomas {{hardly knew}} how to say whether there was or was not an {{objection}} on his part. In the first place he had {{made up his mind}} that the other Ralph was to marry Mary,--that he would do so in spite of that disclaimer which had been made in the first moment of the young man's <b>disinheritance.</b> He, Sir Thomas, however, could have no right to object on that score. Nor could he raise any objection on the score of Clarissa. It did seem to him that all the young people were at cross purposes, that Patience must have been very stupid and Clarissa most addlepated, or else that this Ralph was abominably false; but still, he could say nothing respecting that. No tale had reached his ears which made it even possible for him to refer to Clarissa. But yet he was dissatisfied with the man, and was disposed to show it. [...] "Perhaps I ought to tell you," [...] said Sir Thomas, [...] "that a man calling himself Neefit was with me yesterday." ...|$|E
60|$|The purport of Mr. Scarborough's {{story will}} {{probably}} have been understood by our readers. It was Mr. Scarborough's present intention to make it understood that the scheme intended for the <b>disinheritance</b> of Mountjoy had been false {{from the beginning to}} the end, and had been arranged, not for the injury of Mountjoy, but for the salvation of the estate from the hands of the Jews. Mountjoy would have lost nothing, as the property would have gone entirely to the Jews had Mr. Scarborough then died, and Mountjoy been taken as his legitimate heir. He was not anxious, he had declared, to say anything on the present occasion in defence of his conduct in that respect. He would soon be gone, and he would leave men to judge him who might do so the more honestly when they should have found that he had succeeded in paying even the Jews in full the moneys which they had actually advanced. But now things were again changed, and he was bound {{to go back to the}} correct order of things.|$|E
60|$|Testators should not, {{from the}} snug {{security}} of the grave, utter a perpetual threat of <b>disinheritance</b> or any other uncomfortable fate to deter an American citizen, even {{one of his own}} legatees, from applying to the courts of his country for redress of any wrong from which he might consider himself as suffering. The courts of law ought to be open to any one conceiving himself a victim of injustice, and it should be unlawful to abridge the right of complaint by making its exercise more hazardous than it naturally is. Doubtless the contesting of wills is a nuisance, generally speaking, the contestant conspicuously devoid of moral worth and the verdict singularly unrighteous; but as long as some testators really are daft, or subject to interested suasion, or wantonly sinful, they should be denied the power to stifle dissent by fining the luckless dissenter. The dead have too much to say in this world at the best, and it is monstrous and intolerable tyranny for them to stand {{at the door of the}} Temple of Justice to drive away the suitors that themselves have made.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a fine}} day, and it was by {{no means}} a gloomy walk. Though the two friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and miserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding little {{difference}} in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their habitual tone. As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which he visited for the first time. The name enchanted him. The tombs in the church convinced him that the Crusades were the only career. He would have himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his studies in chain armour. The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the misfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion of his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that maintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much of the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners. Henry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the <b>disinheritance</b> of Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to make him a Lord Chancellor.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} James Short had {{completely}} recovered his nerve, and was, indeed, almost oblivious {{of the fact}} that there was anybody present in the court, except the learned Judge and himself. Going back to the beginning, he detailed the early history of the relationship between Eustace Meeson and his uncle, the publisher, with which this record has nothing to do. Thence he passed to the history of Augusta's relation with the firm of Meeson and Co., which, as nearly everybody in the court, not excepting the Judge, had read [...] "Jemima's Vow," [...] was very interesting to his auditors. Then he went on to the scene between Augusta and the publisher, and detailed how Eustace had interfered, which interference had led to a violent quarrel, resulting in the young man's <b>disinheritance.</b> Passing on, he detailed how the publisher and the published had taken passage in the same vessel, and the tragic occurrences which followed down to Augusta's final rescue and arrival in England, and finally ended his spirited opening by appealing to the Court not to allow its mind to be influenced by the fact that since these events the two chief actors had become engaged to be married, which struck him, he said, as a very fitting climax to so romantic a story.|$|E
60|$|During {{that journey}} Coningsby learned {{something}} of the course of affairs which gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his favour. We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of the circumstances which had occasioned and attended the <b>disinheritance</b> of Coningsby. These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter, afterwards in more detail on her arrival in London. Lady Wallinger had conferred with her husband. She was not surprised at the goodness of Coningsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities. He had ever been the favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in blending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith. Sir Joseph was a judicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but good, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid of them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the right direction. They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby's admirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband should express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison with herself. Sir Joseph spoke to Mr. Millbank, who stared; but Sir Joseph spoke feebly. Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and all her impressions, to Oswald and Edith. The younger Millbank talked with his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest, inveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{to satisfy}} your curiosity, I must bore you with some {{personal}} history. My parents died when I {{was a little}} chap, and my uncle brought me up. He has been immensely good to me, {{but he is a}} bit of a tyrant. Recently he picked out a wife for me--the daughter of an old sweetheart of his. I have never even seen her. But she has arrived in town on a visit to some relatives there. Uncle Dick wrote to me to return home at once and pay my court to the lady; I protested. He wrote again--a letter, short and the reverse of sweet. If I refused to do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me--never speak to me again--cut me off with a quarter. Uncle always means what he says--that is one of our family traits, you understand. I spent some miserable, undecided days. It was not the threat of <b>disinheritance</b> that worried me, although when you have been brought up to regard yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust your vision to a pauper focus. But it was the thought of alienating Uncle Dick. I love the dear, determined old chap like a father. But last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my own man. So I wrote to Uncle Dick, respectfully but firmly declining to become a candidate for Miss Mannering's hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Jordan was {{at present}} fairly {{dazzling}} {{on the subject}} of the way that, in the practice of her fairy art, as she called it, she more than peeped in--she penetrated. There was not a house of the great kind--and it was of course only a question of those, real homes of luxury--in which she was not, at the rate such people now had things, all over the place. The girl felt before the picture the cold breath of <b>disinheritance</b> as much as she had ever felt it in the cage; she knew moreover how much she betrayed this, for the experience of poverty had begun, in her life, too early, and her ignorance of the requirements of homes of luxury had grown, with other active knowledge, a depth of simplification. She had accordingly at first often found that in these colloquies she could only pretend she understood. Educated as she had rapidly been by her chances at Cocker's, there were still strange gaps in her learning--she could never, like Mrs. Jordan, have found her way about one of the [...] "homes." [...] Little by little, however, she had caught on, above all in the light of what Mrs. Jordan's redemption had materially made of that lady, giving her, though the years and the struggles had naturally not straightened a feature, an almost super-eminent air. There were women in and out of Cocker's who were quite nice and who yet didn't look well; whereas Mrs. Jordan looked well and yet, with her extraordinarily protrusive teeth, was by no means quite nice. It would seem, mystifyingly, that it might really come from all the greatness she could live with. It was fine to hear her talk so often of dinners of twenty and of her doing, as she said, exactly as she liked with them. She spoke as if, for that matter, she invited the company. [...] "They simply give me the table--all the rest, all the other effects, come afterwards." ...|$|E
