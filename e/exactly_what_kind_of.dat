The concept of gemba has been widely used in Japanese schools, factories and offices, which can be literally translated to "the real scene" in English. However, the term gemba often suggests a sense of distinction between "we as powerless workers who know better about the situation" and "they as management or outsiders {{who do not know}} what really happens in the scene. " Without referring to the social actors who use this concept under specified situation, {{it is very difficult to}} pinpoint down <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> matter belongs to in a particular gemba. Delineating how this concept was actually used in different social settings, like high school, kindergarten and convenience stores, it suggests that, on the one hand, the concept's intension and the contents it connotes are often ambiguous, on the other hand, its extension often denotes a well-defined and clear boundary of what should be included within a particular gemba. The article thus discusses how the use of this concept may actually relate to group dynamics and thus it may reveal the power structure in contemporary Japanese society...|$|R

Crouching on the grass, I again approached the brook. Gaily flitting above the glassy surface of the water, in all the fancied security of tender youth and innocence, came my yellow fly. Backward and forward over the water he gracefully flew, sometimes rising a little into the air, as if to view the varied scenery of the woods and mountains, and then settling for a moment close to the surface, to better inspect his glittering image as it came up from below, and showing in his every movement his intense enjoyment of summer-time and life.|$|E

However, many questions remain regarding the details <b>of</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> information are processed by the occipito-temporal cortex. Here, we address this question with respect to reading. Ten healthy adult subjects performed a single word reading task. We used whole-head magnetoencephalography to measure the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain responses, and investigated their sensitivity to: (1) lexicality (defined here as the difference between words and consonant strings), (2) word length, and (3) variation in letter position. Analysis revealed that midline occipital activity around 100 msec, consistent with low-level visual feature analysis, was insensitive to lexicality and variation in letter position, but was slightly affected by string length. Bilateral occipito-temporal activations around 150 msec were insensitive to lexicality and reacted to word length only in the timing (and not strength) of activation. However, vertical shifts in letter position revealed a hemispheric imbalance: The right hemisphere activation increased with the shifts, whereas the opposite pattern was evident in the left hemisphere. The results are discussed in the light of Caramazza and Hillis's (1990) model of early reading. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{wraparound}} {{process has}} emerged as perhaps the most frequently implemented comprehensive approach for planning and providing individualized, community-based care for children and adolescents with serious mental health conditions. Providing comprehensive care through the wraparound process necessarily requires {{a high level of}} collaboration across organization and agency boundaries. This need for significant inter-agency or “system-level ” collaboration creates a complex implementation environment for wraparound. It is therefore not surprising that creating and sustaining a hospitable implementation environment has proven to be extremely challenging.

40|$|Object {{correlation}} is {{a semantic}} comparison of exported entities from one system to imported entities of another. Current research in search algorithms and artificial intelligence methods for pattern matching can aid integrators in finding these matches. This thesis proposes a two-stage correlation process for resolving various <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> heterogeneity found in legacy DoD systems to facilitate interoperability. A prototype built using these methods is explained, results compared to current correlation methods, and recommendations made for further improvements. The {{end of the}} Cold War and the Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 began {{a new era of}} unprecedented cooperation among the U. S. military services and our allies. Increasingly dynamic missions have required warfighters to share information quickly and seamlessly while a decreasing defense budget has left few resources to build the infrastructure needed to implement this information exchange in legacy heterogeneous data systems. One possible solution to achieving interoperability of information systems is Young's Federated Interoperability Model. This model allows system designers to advertise the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> information they produce and consume and then automatically provides translation services. Before data and services can be shared, however, integrators must resolve <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> data they are providing so that other systems in the network can decide if that data is appropriate for their use.

40|$|Protein-coding {{genes in}} {{mitochondrial}} genomes have {{varying degrees of}} asymmetric skew in base frequencies at the third codon position. The variation in skew among genes appears {{to be caused by}} varying durations of time that the heavy strand spends in the mutagenic single-strand state during replication (D(ssH)). The primary data used to study skew have been the gene-by-gene base frequencies in individual taxa, which provide little information on <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> mutations are responsible for the base frequency skew. To assess the contribution of individual mutation components to the ancestral vertebrate substitution pattern, here we analyze a large data set of complete vertebrate mitochondrial genomes in a phylogeny-based likelihood context. This also allows us to evaluate the change in skew continuously along the mitochondrial genome and to directly estimate relative substitution rates. Our results indicate that different types of mutation respond differently to the D(ssH) gradient. A primary role for hydrolytic deamination of cytosines in creating variance in skew among genes was not supported, but rather linearly increasing rates of mutation from adenine to hypoxanthine with D(ssH) appear to drive regional differences in skew. Substitutions due to hydrolytic deamination of cytosines, although common, appear to quickly saturate, possibly due to stabilization by the mitochondrial DNA single-strand-binding protein. These results should form the basis of more realistic models of DNA and protein evolution in mitochondria...|$|R

The primary {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effectiveness of knowledge identification, categorisation and prioritisation that contributes to achieving ERP implementation success. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a mixed methods approach; a qualitative phase to identify and categorise knowledge types and sub-types; conducting in-depth interviews with ERP clients and implementation partners; plus a quantitative phase to prioritise knowledge types and sub-types based on their contribution to achieving ERP success for business performance improvement. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based questionnaire was used to collect empirical data for the quantitative phase. Findings: This study has been able to identify, categorise and rank various types of ERP-related knowledge based on in-depth interviews and survey responses from both ERP clients and implementation partners.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the potential impact}} of state tax incentives on the federal production tax credit (PTC) for large-scale wind power projects. While the federal PTC provides critical support to wind plants in the U. S., its so-called "double-dipping" provisions may also diminish the value of - or make ineffectual - certain types of state wind power incentives. In particular, if structured the wrong way, state assistance programs will undercut the value of the federal PTC to wind plant owners. It is therefore critical to determine which state incentives reduce the federal PTC, and the magnitude of this reduction. Such knowledge will help states determine which wind power incentives can be the most effective. This research concludes that certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> state tax incentives are at risk of reducing the value of the federal PTC, but that federal tax law and IRS rulings are not sufficiently clear to specify <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> incentives trigger this offset. State investment tax credits seem most likely to reduce federal PTC payments; the impact of state production tax credits as well as state property and sales tax incentives is more uncertain. Further IRS rulings will be necessary to gain clarity on these issues. State policymakers can seek such guidance from the IRS. While the IRS may not issue a definitive "revenue ruling" on requests from state policymakers, the IRS has in the past been willing to provide general information letters that can provide non-binding clarification on these matters.
