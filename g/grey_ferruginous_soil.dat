50|$|Ferrallitisation is {{the process}} in which rock is changed into a soil {{consisting}} of clay (kaolinite) and sesquioxides, {{in the form of}} hydrated oxides of iron and aluminium. In humid tropical areas, with consistently high temperatures and rainfall for all or most of the year, chemical weathering rapidly breaks down the rock. This at first produces clays which later also break down to form silica. The silica is removed by leaching and the sesquioxides of iron and aluminium remain, giving the characteristic red colour of many tropical soils. Ferrallitisation is the reverse of podsolisation, where silica remains and the iron and aluminum are removed. In tropical rain forests with rain throughout the year, ferrallitic soils develop.

Studies were carried out between 2002 and 2004 in two villages, Somyaga and Ziga in the Yatenga Province. The main objectives were to identify and characterize the soil potentialities and constraints applying the geomorphopedological approach and to assess the possibilities of restoring degraded soils by implementing the zaï technique and incorporating composted manure with natural phosphorus. Soil identification based on representative morpho-sequences has shown the prevalence of leached tropical <b>ferruginous</b> <b>soils.</b> These soils therefore present a weak potentiality and a poor fertility without fertilization and conservation practices. Experiments with the zaï technique and composted manure enriched with burkina phosphorus conducted over three years markedly improved the above mentioned soil parameters and sorghum yields.

40|$|This {{analysis}} of the geographical space focuses on Geomorphology, a science that deals with the genesis and evolution of landforms. This definition includes two basic elements: relief and form. The former results from geological processes, and the latter from morpho-clilmatic processes. This work derives from the need to communicate the features of landform structures located at the northern portion of the Jalisco state, the main attributes of which including block tectonics, arisen from an extensive area affected by volcanic activity during the Mild Cenozoic. Tectonics respond to core movements generated, according to the pilate tectonics theory, during the Upper Tertiary and Pleistocene, and which have affected this area {{as a result of}} the proximity of subduction zones. Lava deposit blocks along with ancient volcanoes have jointly formed wide plateaus denominated riolithic plateaux in the field of structural geomorphology.

40|$|International audienceNon-lateritic {{red soils}} cover vast {{areas of the}} {{semiarid}} region of Northeast Brazil, or “sertão”, whereas laterites remain currently scarce in the landscape and are confined to ancient summit surfaces and/or to more humid areas along the coast. The land cover of the Brazilian drylands is dominated by dry deciduous woodland, or “caatinga”, in areas with mean annual rainfall and temperatures of 400 - 800 mm/y and 24 - 26 °C, respectively. According to morphological descriptions and analytical data, the red soils of semiarid Brazil mainly classify as Luvisols (chromic) in the WRB soil correlation system, and Alfisols in the USDA Soil Taxonomy. In all cases, their formation is strongly controlled by clay illuviation, allowing the diagnosis of a Bt (argic) horizon. Contrary to lateritic soils extending over large tracts of tropical South America, the red soils of NE Brazil are high-activity-clay soils with high cation exchange capacity and moderate to high base saturation ratios. The pedogenic interpretation for their development {{is that of a}} fersiallitic pedogenesis, which involves high contents of free iron and the prevalence of 2 : 1 clays in the soil mineral assemblage. In the regional setting, the red fersiallitic soils typically formed above shallow, grus-type weathering mantles developed from crystalline parent rocks, under pedoclimatic conditions of low, but irregular, deep drainage. In many ways, they are very similar to the red, decalcified fersiallitic soils formed on the crystalline shield of dryland peninsular India, but are very different from tropical <b>ferruginous</b> <b>soils</b> of semiarid West Africa developed from lateritic paleoweathering mantles.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} the differentiation of ferruginous accumulations and the variable water saturation of footslope soil patterns. An analysis of the slope morphology of a typical hill in the forest zone of southern Cameroon and a seasonal survey of the levels of groundwaters, springs and rivers were considered in relation to the petrology of different soil patterns. The study site is a tabular hillock whose slopes present a progressive development from steep to gentle slopes. The variable residence time of water within the soil, creating an alternation of reducing and oxidizing conditions, affects oil chemistry, structure and lateral extension of the <b>soil</b> patterns. The <b>ferruginous</b> <b>soil</b> patterns, being formed on the footslopes, gradually increase in extent with decreasing slope angle and the relative rise of the groundwater level. The steep footslopes, where groundwater has a shorter residence time, show a soft mottled clay pattern, restricted to the bottom part of the slope. The moderate footslopes exhibit a deep permanent and a temporary perched groundwater table. The latter, with its regular capillary fringe, contributes to more reducing conditions within isolated domains in the soil patterns, and thus to the alternation with oxidizing conditions, generating a continuous hard soil pattern (massive carapace). The more gently dipping footslopes exhibit groundwater levels near the surface and also a significant amplitude of groundwater fluctuation. Iron, previously accumulated in moderate footslope patterns, is reduced, remobilized, and leached. The soil patterns formed develop into a variegated carapace, more extended along the slope, containing less iron, but nevertheless more hardened, due to the important fluctuations of the groundwater table. These patterns are limited to the zone of groundwater fluctuation and deteriorate as the water fluctuation zone recedes. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Regions under {{tropical}} rainforest cover, such {{as central}} Africa and Brazil are characterised by degradation and dismantling of old ferricrete structures. In southern Cameroon, these processes are relayed by present-day <b>ferruginous</b> accumulation <b>soil</b> facies, {{situated on the}} middle and {{the lower part of}} hill slopes. These facies become progressively harder towards the surface, containing from bottom to top, mainly kaolinite, kaolinite-goethite and Al-rich goethite-hematite, and are discontinuous to the relictic hematite-dominated ferricrete that exist in {{the upper part of the}} hill slope. These features were investigated in terms of geochemical differentiation of trace elements. It appears that, in contrast to the old ferricrete facies, the current ferruginous accumulations are enriched in transitional trace elements (V, Cr, Co, Y, Sc) and Ph, while alkali-earth elements are less differentiated. This recent chemical accumulation is controlled both by intense weathering of the granodiorite bedrock and by mobilisation of elements previously accumulated in the old ferricrete. The observed processes are clearly linked to the present-day humid climate with rising groundwater tables. They slowly replace the old ferricretes formed during Cretaceous time under more seasonal climatic conditions, representing an instructive case of continuos global change.

Leptic Phaeozems and Leptic Cambisols were then the correct Reference Soil Group (RSG). At elevations from 350 to 900 m asl, without any new information, Brown and Reddish-brown ferrallitic soils, Andic ferrallitic soils, and Brown and Andic brown soils were updated into Haplic Nitisols (Humic, Dystric) and Andic Umbrisols (Humic). The acquisition of new data showed that this update was incorrect because Andic properties and the diagnostic criteria of the Nitic horizons were not met. Over 900 m asl, Pozols were correctly updated, as were the Andosols except from 900 to 1050 m asl where not all the Andic properties were met. Without any new information, incorrect updates were observed for both the determination of RSG and the qualifiers. Despite the field descriptions, the lack of any analytical determinations on the old soil studies was a source of updating errors for the more developed soils formerly qualified as ferrallitic. In order to update limits for Andic properties and Andosols, the systematic use of analytical determinations has to be considered for updating old soil maps, as the diagnostic criteria are more restrictive than in the past.

Soil and water conservation techniques like zaï and stone-rows were tested and adopted in the driest zones of the North. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the possibilities of transferring these technologies in the South- Sudanian area, located between isohyets 900 and 1100 mm to restore a <b>ferruginous</b> degraded <b>soil.</b> A completely randomized Fisher block design was used. Growth and yield of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were measured. Soil samples were taken and analyzed. Infiltration rate was measured with a two double ring infiltrometer. The results show that "zaï" and "zaï combined with stone-rows" are transferable in the South-Sudanian zone. They allowed a better development of the sorghum and grain yield increased by 6 and 4, respectively, compared to the control. Chemical properties of the soil were significantly improved, and the pH reached a value of approximately 6. 5 in the holes of zaï. "Zaï" and "zaï combined with stone-rows" contributed to significantly improve infiltration rate of water in the soil...|$|R
