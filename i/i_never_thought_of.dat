None of them takes place in a normal world. They all take place in an extreme world. Very operatic ... they were all heightened. They don't take place in normal reality.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{investigation}} in Rome, Hussain {{said he was}} motivated {{to participate in the}} attacks after viewing videos of war-torn Iraq. [...] "I am against war," [...] Osman said [...] "I've marched in peace rallies and nobody listened to me. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> killing people." [...] He claimed that the bombs were never meant to detonate or kill anybody, only {{to draw attention to the}} Iraq war.|$|E
2500|$|Hopper's Summer Evening, a {{young couple}} talking in the harsh light of a cottage porch, is inescapably romantic, but Hopper was hurt by one critic's {{suggestion}} that it would do for an illustration in [...] "any woman's magazine." [...] Hopper had the painting {{in the back of}} his head [...] "for 20 years and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> putting the figures in until I actually started last summer. Why any art director would tear the picture apart. The figures were not what interested me; it was the light streaming down, and the night all around." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first episode}} {{attracted}} around 200 complaints after McDonald {{made a joke}} about the late controversial comedian Bernard Manning. In a section called Racist and Dead, McDonald said, [...] "This week it's the turn of incompetent, narrow-minded northerner: Bernard Manning. Personally, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Bernard Manning as a racist comic; just a fat, white bastard." [...] Amongst the people who complained was Jim Bowen, who said the comment was, [...] "Appalling." [...] However, an ITV spokesman defended it as satire, saying, [...] "I'm sure Bernard would find the whole thing hilarious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{has been}} {{referred}} to, along with Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens, {{as one of}} the [...] "new atheists", but he considers the term [...] "atheist" [...] to be problematic. He said, [...] "while I am now one of the public voices of atheism, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> myself as an atheist before being inducted to speak as one [...] I think that 'atheist' is a term that we do not need, {{in the same way that}} we don't need a word for someone who rejects astrology." ...|$|E
2500|$|Poulidor {{has several}} times {{accepted}} that {{his career was}} handicapped {{by a lack of}} ambition and by the psychological domination of Jacques Anquetil. Poulidor {{said in an interview in}} 1992: I knew straight away that I was getting places everywhere. I got all the leaders' jerseys but I used to lose them. Tonin [...] said to me [...] "Raymond, you're always in a daydream!" [...] And was that true? Were you distracted? It was true. I thought what was happening to me was already marvellous enough. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> winning. Never, ever, did I get up in the morning with the idea of winning! ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, {{when asked}} about the {{possibility}} of someone else making Star Wars films, Lucas said, [...] "Probably not, it's my thing." [...] In a 2008 interview in Total Film, Lucas ruled out anybody else making Star Wars films. Asked if he was happy for new Star Wars films to be made after his death, he said: [...] "I've left pretty explicit instructions for there not to be any more features. There will definitely be no Episodes VIIâ€“IX. That's because there isn't any story. I mean, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> anything. And now there have been novels about the events after Episode VI, which isn't at all what I would have done with it. The Star Wars story is really the tragedy of Darth Vader. That is the story. Once Vader dies, he doesn't come back to life, the Emperor doesn't get cloned and Luke doesn't get married..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, a {{technician}} delves {{deeper into the}} anomaly, discovering that something has infiltrated the HQ computer systems and is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. In an ironic twist, the virus is discovered to be the program originally installed in the Element Dolls six years ago, now reaching beyond the DonPachi Corps programming and seeking to annihilate the human race in retaliation for their [...] "enslavement" [...] (after the war, they met a rather cruel demise at the hand of their own human creators) by waging war in the past {{rather than in the}} present: unsettled, the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to fight back the invasion before future changes. However, he states: [...] "Start over from the past... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that", echoing the ideas of mankind's imperfection which has always been a recurring theme in the series.|$|E
2500|$|Enya {{described}} her upbringing as [...] "very quiet and happy." [...] At age three, she {{took part in}} her first singing competition at the annual Feis Ceoil music festival. She took part in pantomimes at Gweedore Theatre and sang with her siblings in her mother's choir at St Mary's church in Derrybeg. She learned English at primary school and began piano lessons at age four. [...] "I had to do school work and then travel to a neighbouring town for piano lessons, and then more school work. I ... remember {{my brothers and sisters}} playing outside ... and I would be inside playing the piano. This one big book of scales, practising them over and over." [...] At eleven, Enya's grandfather paid for her education at a strict convent boarding school in Milford run by nuns of the Loreto order, where she developed a taste for classical music, art, Latin and watercolour painting. [...] "It was devastating to be torn away from such a large family, but it was good for my music." [...] Enya left the school at 17 and studied classical music in college for one year with the aim of becoming [...] "a piano teacher sort of person. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> myself composing or being on stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Thomas began writing and {{performing}} his own songs. He regarded Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller and Gatemouth Moore as musical influences. He made his professional singing debut at the Elks Club on Beale Street, {{filling in for}} another singer at the last minute, and during the 1940s became a regular performer in Memphis nightclubs, such as Currie`s Club Tropicana. As an established performer in Memphis, aged 33 in 1950, Thomas recorded his first 78 rpm single, for Jesse Erickson's small Star Talent label in Dallas, Texas. Thomas said, [...] "I {{just wanted to make}} a record. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> getting rich. I just wanted to be known, be a recording artist.... the record sold five copies and I bought four of them." [...] The record, [...] "I'll Be a Good Boy" [...] backed with [...] "I'm So Worried", gained a Billboard review, which stated that [...] "Thomas shows first class style on a slow blues". [...] He also recorded for the Bullet label in Nashville, Tennessee, when he recorded with Bobby Plater's Orchestra and was credited as [...] "Mr. Swing"; the recordings were not recognised by researchers as being by Thomas until 1996. [...] In 1951 he made his first recordings at Sam Phillips's Sun Studio, for the Chess label, but they were not commercially successful.|$|E
