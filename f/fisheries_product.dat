40|$|INTRODUCTION Arrowtooth {{flounder}} (Atheresthes stomias) {{are currently}} {{the most abundant}} groundfish species in the Gulf of Alaska. Research has been conducted on their commercial utilization (Greene and Babbitt, 1990, Wasson et al., 1992, Porter et al., 1993, Reppond et al., 1993, Cullenberg 1995), however, arrowtooth flounder are currently of low value and most are discarded. In 1990, the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council separated arrowtooth flounder for management purposes from the flatfish assemblage, {{which at the time}} included all flatfish. Although arrowtooth flounder are presently of limited economic importance as a <b>fisheries</b> <b>product,</b> trophic studies (Yang 1993, Hollowed, et al. 1995, Hollowed et al. 2000) suggest they may be an important component in understanding the dynamics of the Gulf of Alaska benthic ecosystem.

The doses given were 0 (negative control) 1. 5; 3 and  6 % of gelatin which was equal to 0, 12, 24 and 48 mg/g of mice body weight. The study had been conducted for 4 weeks and continued for 2 weeks of recovery phase.
