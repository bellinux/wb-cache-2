5000|$|The {{manuscript}} is lavishly decorated. There {{are nine}} diagrams, six miniatures, eight large historiated <b>initials,</b> two smaller historiated <b>initials</b> and three decorated <b>initials,</b> {{all of which}} are painted in colors and feature gold leaf. The larger historiated <b>initials</b> have full borders which are historiated and contain scenes in the base of the page. The smaller historiated <b>initials</b> have partial foliate borders. The decorated <b>initials</b> have extensions into the margins of the page. There are also some smaller decorated <b>initials</b> which include human heads, which are also painted in colors and gold. There are also smaller gold <b>initials</b> on red and blue grounds, smaller gold <b>initials</b> with purple foliate pen flourishes and smaller blue <b>initials</b> with red foliate pen flourishes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Initials</b> {{are made}} up of consonants. Most {{characters}} are preceding finals with <b>initials</b> while some characters are pronounced without <b>initials.</b> There are 19 <b>initials</b> in total.|$|R
50|$|The <b>initial</b> /ʜ/ denotes a voiced {{laryngeal}} onset {{functioning as}} a zero <b>initial.</b> It was almost in complementary distribution with the <b>initial</b> /ŋ/, and the two have merged in most modern dialects as a zero <b>initial,</b> ŋ, ɣ or n.The <b>initial</b> /ʋ/ has also merged with the zero <b>initial</b> and the /w/ medial in the standard language.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Initial</b> Approach Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the <b>initial</b> {{approach}} segment of an instrument approach begins. An instrument approach procedure may have more than one <b>Initial</b> approach fix and <b>initial</b> approach segment. The <b>initial</b> approach fix is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or DME fix. The <b>initial</b> approach fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument approach and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the approach. When <b>initial</b> approach fix, and intermediate fix are combined there is no <b>initial</b> approach segment.|$|R

5000|$|So far ten {{rounds of}} talks {{were held at}} the European External Action Service office in Brussels. Baroness Ashton, the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years. {{followed}} by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighbouring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to <b>initialling</b> a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015.

5000|$|New York Postmaster’s Provisionals {{exist in}} a welter of {{collectible}} varieties which differ widely in value on the philatelic market. In the Scott catalogue, used copies bearing {{the most common form}} of ACM <b>initialling</b> are valued at $500, but this sum rises for the ACM examples in which the letters are connected, or are separated by periods. Unsigned copies fetch still more; those with Morris’s RHM fetch several thousands; and even that amount must be greatly multiplied for the inordinately scarce copies bearing the rarest initials, those of Alonzo’s older brother Marcena (MMJr.). Unused examples also fetch a premium--particularly those with gum, which are quite rare. While most of the stamps were printed on a bluish wove paper, different paper types are occasionally found, and examples on these, too, can be quite costly.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} {{the categories of}} the zhao-series <b>initials</b> of Middle Chinese. Particularly, the present study tries to examine whether the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging {{to one or two}} groups of <b>initials,</b> using both dialectal and historical data. The first part of the thesis is an overview on what is being said about the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> in previous studies. The second part of the thesis discusses the merge and the split of the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> based on their historical development and in conjunction with ancient Chinese and Modern Chinese Phonology. The third part of the thesis uses the data of the distribution of the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> in present day Northern Mandarin to discuss the categories of these two groups of <b>initials</b> in Middle Chinese. Combining the observations made from both dialectal data and historical studies, the conclusion of the present study is that the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging to two different groups of <b>initials,</b> which will be the fourth part of the thesis...|$|R

50|$|To {{enhance their}} relationship, the EU and Georgia began {{negotiating}} an Association Agreement (AA) and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement. In November 2012, EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Stefan Fule {{stated that the}} AA negotiations could be finalized by November 2013. In February 2013, Tamar Beruchachvili, the Deputy State Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Georgia, stated that Georgia {{had no plans to}} join the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, which Fule has warned Ukraine would be incompatible with the agreements with the EU. A ceremony on the <b>initialling</b> of the AA by the Georgian Foreign Minister Maia Panjikidze and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was held at the Eastern Partnership summit on 29 November 2013. It was formally signed on 27 June 2014, and had to be ratified by the EU, Euratom, their member states and Georgia. A second agreement, governing the country's involvement in EU crisis management operations, was also signed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe European Union and the Republic of Moldova {{negotiated}} an Association Agreement (AA) in 2010, and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) in 2012. After {{completion of}} negotiations and <b>initialling</b> of AA, before the full Agreement can enter into force, action {{is needed to}} ensure that the Parties are able to enjoy the full benefits of the Agreement. SMEs play a focal role in the implementation of the future DCFTA. The article describes the economic and political basis for association/integration, outlining the importance of SMEs.

40|$|Progress Music I' is a 9 -channel film-sound {{installation}} that {{explores the}} rhythm of British industrial short film in the postwar period. The structuring of the piece is defined by a chance-based sound score, divided into three movements, which composes the film in real-time from a repository of thousands of film and sound fragments collected by the artist. As a result, each play through of the piece traces a new pathway through the archive. 'Progress Music I' is inspired by the collaborative works of British filmmaker Geoffrey Jones and composer Daphne Oram, and was <b>initialling</b> commissioned by South Kiosk, London. A fixed media single-screen capture of one movement from the work was screened on 24 February 2017 at the Sound and Music in Documentary film symposium at the University of Huddersfield...|$|E

Our empirical evidence shows that the <b>initial</b> abnormal return in the secondary market is significantly positive. This study also finds that 1) the <b>initial</b> return in the primary market is negatively related to the subscription or lottery ratio; 2) the <b>initial</b> return in the secondary market is positively related to the market return, and negatively related to IPO offering prices; 3) the <b>initial</b> turnover is negatively related to the offering size; 4) the <b>initial</b> turnover has {{no impact on the}} <b>initial</b> return in the secondary market but the latter has a significantly positive influence on the <b>initial</b> turnover. ...|$|R
40|$|Following the <b>initialling</b> of the Vilnius Agreement from 28 - 29 November 2013, the Republic of Moldova {{seemed to}} have entered the path towards the European integration. The great failure for the Brussels’ leaders was, by far, the Ukraine’s refuse to sign the Association Agreement, a {{decision}} placed on the account of Moscow’s influence and which proved once more {{the fact that the}} relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation have grown increasingly confrontational over the Eastern Partnership’s countries. In the context of the unrests in Kiev at the beginning of 2014 and subsequently of the pro-Russian movements in the South and East of the Ukrainian state, the Republic of Moldova has acquired a special significance within the geopolitical situation of the region, being regarded as an outpost of what certain analysts already consider to be the “New Cold War”...|$|E
40|$|Between 2009 and 2010, five Western Balkan {{countries}} were granted Schengen visa exemptions by the EU {{for the short}} travel of their citizens to the Schengen area in return for signing readmission agreements. Turkey, in contrast, was only offered a vague promise for the initiation of a visa liberalisation “dialogue” in return for <b>initialling</b> the readmission agreement. Taking this development as a genuine research puzzle the present article asks: What are the domestic dynamics that have driven this differential outcome? This article argues that the EU’s ongoing restrictive visa regime towards Turkey stems from the issue’s securitisation in certain member states (Germany, Austria and the Netherlands). Security-framing practices thereby occurred in both the political (elite-level discourse) and bureaucratic arena (visa-issuing process) {{as part of the}} same security dispositif. Two crucial implications follow from the findings: on the one hand, European visa authorities seem to follow their own visa-issuing policies despite regulations put in force at the EU level (Visa Codex). On the other hand, the purported theoretical divide between the Copenhagen and Paris School’s approaches to securitisation seems empirically rather disadvantageous. Treating these theoretical lenses as distinct may lead researchers to miss out on interrelated securitisation practices...|$|E
40|$|The Vilnius Eastern Partnership Summit on 28 - 29 th November 2013 {{represents}} {{a milestone in}} EU relations not just {{with respect to the}} six Eastern Partnership countries (EaP Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and particularly Ukraine), but also with the EU’s ‘strategic partner’ Russia. The turbulence and numerous speculations regarding expectations about the signature of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement (comprising a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement - AA/DCFTA), as well as progress in <b>initialling</b> similar future agreements with Georgia and Moldova, have been escalating before the summit. The association agreementswould bring EaP signatory countries closer to the EU not really closer to EU membership, but closer to the application of various EU norms and standards (takeover of the ‘acquis communautaire’) and - significantly - out of the Russian orbit, for the beginning at least symbolically. The last minute postponement of the EU-Ukraine AA/DCFTA signature announced by Ukraine’s government just one week before the summit {{represents a}} serious setback for the EU. Though the EU has no ‘Plan B’ and was stunned after Ukraine’s announcement, life will continue after the summit and new initiatives will have to be started. What are the relevant issues and challenges and what is at stake? This note attempts to evaluate the consequences (economic and otherwise) of alternate decisions following the Vilnius Eastern Partnership Summit, reviews some of the disputed arguments and discusses selected relevant economic issues...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{particle}} swarm optimization cannot guarantee convergence to {{the global}} optimum in multi-modal search spaces, so multiple swarms can be useful. The multiple swarms all need <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities for their particles. Several simple strategies to select <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities are presented. A series of experiments isolates {{the effects of these}} selected <b>initial</b> positions and velocities compared to random <b>initial</b> positions and velocities. A first set of experiments shows how locust swarms benefit from 'scouting' for <b>initial</b> positions and the use of <b>initial</b> velocities that 'launch away' from the previous optimum. A second set of experiments show that the performance of WoSP (Waves of Swarm Particles) can be improved by using new search strategies to select the <b>initial</b> positions and <b>initial</b> velocities for the particles in its sub-swarms...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{complete}} dynamic model includes the {{equations of motion}} {{as well as the}} <b>initial</b> conditions, many of the learning dynamics in the literature do not entail a serious theory of <b>initial</b> conditions. This paper explores and evaluates five approaches to complete learning models with a theory of <b>initial</b> conditions. We find that (1) the <b>initial</b> period’s fit is sensitive to the model of <b>initial</b> conditions chosen, with some <b>initial</b> condition models consistently superior to others over games. (2) Looking at periods 2 onward, leading dynamic models are robust to <b>initial</b> condition models according to one-period-ahead goodness-of-fit criteria. (3) Longer horizon measures of fit provide the insight that models of <b>initials</b> conditions with initially high diversity sometimes outperform better specified models of <b>initial</b> conditions Keywords: Adaptive Dynamics; <b>Initial</b> Conditions...|$|R
