5000|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} is {{a disorder}} where normal bone and marrow is replaced with fibrous tissue, resulting in formation of bone that is weak {{and prone to}} expansion.

5000|$|Potassium-aggravated myotonia {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} that affects skeletal muscle. Beginning in childhood or adolescence, people with this condition experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing (myotonia) that prevent muscles from relaxing normally. Myotonia causes muscle stiffness, often painful, that worsens after exercise and may be aggravated by eating potassium-rich foods such as bananas and potatoes. Stiffness occurs in skeletal muscles throughout the body. Potassium-aggravated myotonia ranges in severity from mild episodes of muscle stiffness to severe, <b>disabling</b> <b>disease</b> with frequent attacks. Potassium-aggravated myotonia may, in some cases, also cause paradoxical myotonia, in which myotonia becomes more severe {{at the time of}} movement instead of after movement has ceased. Unlike some other forms of myotonia, potassium-aggravated myotonia is not associated with episodes of muscle weakness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preventable}} <b>disabling</b> <b>disease</b> of silicosis {{has three}} main types, chronic, acute and accelerated. Chronic silicosis {{is the most}} common occurring after 10-20 years of low to moderate exposure of respirable crystalline silica. [...] Current studies have shown workers exposed to silica at the current recommend exposure limits (REL) during a lifetime of work develop chronic silicosis. A chest x-ray is used to diagnose chronic silicosis, which has similar symptoms as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). General symptoms are shortness of breath, productive or nonproductive cough, fatigue, and occasionally respiratory failure. ccelerated silicosis has similar symptoms as chronic silicosis, however it develops rapidly in 5-10 years of high exposure to respirable crystalline silica. Lastly, acute silicosis is less prevalent than the other types, however it is a more severe disease with a high occurrence of disability and death. Acute silicosis develops between several months to years with extreme levels of silica exposure, and severe symptoms include shortness of breath, weakness, cough, fever and weight loss. Setting effective control levels and monitoring the adherence to those levels will be crucial in preventing silicosis.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} application, and identify complications, of the 2 nd generation of Zurich Cementless Total Hip Replacement (ZCTHR). STUDY DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs (n= 60) that had ZCTHR (n= 65). METHODS: Dogs with ZCTHR (2001 - 2003) with a minimum follow-up > or = 6 months were evaluated. Data included signalment, cup position, longest follow-up, complications, management of complications and outcome. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 22. 68 months. Eleven cases (17 %) had postoperative complications: femoral fracture (n= 1; 1. 5 %), prosthesis luxation (7; 11 %), cup loosening (2; 3 %), and implant failure (1; 1. 5 %); 9 cases were successfully revised. Explantation of implants was performed in 1 case because of infection, and 1 dog was euthanatized after reluxation. CONCLUSIONS: ZCTHR can restore function in dogs affected by <b>disabling</b> <b>diseases</b> of the coxofemoral joint. The press-fit fixation of the cup allowed for corrections in cases of incorrect positioning. Cases with aseptic loosening were revised successfully by impacting larger cups. Newer stems of this generation are shot peening treated to increase their resistance to breakage. In our cases, infection is a disastrous event, leading to implant removal. After resolution of complications, a successful final outcome was achieved in 97 % of THR. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: ZCTHR offers a reliable alternative for treating dogs with <b>disabling</b> <b>diseases</b> of the hip joints...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effect of {{eliminating}} a specific disease on the mortality, long-term disability, and overall health status of a population. Primarily, it examines whether elimination leads to a compression of morbidity. The Sullivan method was used to calculate disability-free life expectancy.

Cause-deleted probabilities of dying were derived with the cause-elimination life-table technique, assuming independence among competing causes of death. Eliminating <b>disabling</b> nonfatal <b>diseases</b> such as arthritis/back complaints results in a decline in life expectancy with disability [...] that is, an absolute compression of morbidity.

While eliminating fatal diseases leads to an increase in disability-free life expectancy, life expectancy with disability may increase as well. This represents an increasing burden to society. On the other hand, eliminating nonfatal <b>disabling</b> <b>diseases</b> leads to absolute compression of morbidit...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} {{demographic and}} clinical {{factors associated with}} disabling Crohn&#x 2019;s disease (CD). METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, focusing on the factors that can predict the prognosis of different outcomes of CD was undertaken. PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus were searched to identify studies investigating the above mentioned factors in adult patients with CD. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they describe prognostic factors in CD, with inclusion and exclusion criteria defined as follows. Studies with adult patients and CD, written in English and studying association between clinical factors {{and at least one}} prognosis outcome were included. Meta-analysis of effects was undertaken for the <b>disabling</b> <b>disease</b> outcome, using odds ratio (OR) to assess the effect of the different factors in the outcome. The statistical method used was Mantel-Haenszel for fixed effects. The 16 -item quality assessment tool (QATSDD) was used to assess the quality of the studies (range: 0 - 42). RESULTS: Of the 913 papers initially selected, sixty studies were reviewed and three were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The global QATSDD scores of papers were 18, 21 and 22. Of a total of 1961 patients enrolled, 1332 (78 %) were classified with <b>disabling</b> <b>disease</b> five years after diagnosis. In two studies, age at diagnosis was a factor associated with <b>disabling</b> <b>disease</b> five years after diagnosis. Individuals under 40 years old had a higher risk of developing <b>disabling</b> <b>disease.</b> In two studies, patients who were treated with corticosteroids on the first flare developed <b>disabling</b> <b>disease</b> five years after diagnosis. Further, perianal disease was found to be relevant in all of the studies at two and five years after diagnosis. Finally, one study showed localization as a factor associated with <b>disabling</b> <b>disease</b> five years after diagnosis, with L 3 being a higher risk factor. This meta-analysis showed a significantly higher risk of developing <b>disabling</b> <b>disease</b> at five years after initial diagnosis among patients younger than 40 years of age (OR = 2. 47, 95 %CI: 1. 74 - 3. 51), with initial steroid treatment for first flare (OR = 2. 42, 95 %CI: 1. 87 - 3. 11) and with perianal disease (OR = 2. 00, 95 %CI: 1. 41 - 2. 85). CONCLUSION: Age at diagnosis, perianal disease, initial use of steroids and localization seem to be independent prognostic factors of <b>disabling</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E

Elderly people often have multiple pathologies and reduced physiological reserve, and experience a restrictive environment.
