The researchers tested different age groups including young adults, middle-aged, and elderly; the average age was 25, 48 and 65 for each group respectively. After the study, they concluded that age does not make a difference on how spinal cord injury patients respond to the traumatic events that happened. However, they did mention that age did {{play a role in the}} extent to which the external locus of control was used, and concluded that the young adult group demonstrated more external locus of control characteristics than the other age groups to which they were being compared.|$|E
5000|$|The National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act (1965) {{established}} {{the principle of}} [...] "payment of industrial <b>injury</b> <b>benefit</b> for prescribed industrial diseases or for personal injury following an accident (e.g., acute blast injury to the ear)," [...] and also gave employees the right “to claim damages from an employer where industrial injuries are sustained.” The Redundant Mineworkers Payments Scheme of 1968 was introduced to ensure that redundant mineworkers having to leave the industry {{at or above the}} age of 55 “would have their income supplemented for a period so that they could adjust themselves in their new circumstances.” In 1966, extensions and improvements were made in the allowances payable out of the Industrial Injuries Fund to people who had been injured before 5 July 1948 and who were entitled to weekly payments of worker's compensation. In 1968, various steps were taken to reduce the severity with which the [...] "wage-stop" [...] operated, a regressive mechanism which restricted the amount of assistance payable to an unemployed person. For miners, the Coal Industry Act 1965 introduced aid towards severance payments for miners about to be made redundant or for the vocational retraining of staff, while the Coal Industry Act 1967 provided subsidisation of redundancy and early retirement. Under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) (Amendment) Act 1967, men who were diagnosed as having over 50% disablement through pneumoconiosis “were allowed to have their accompanying bronchitis and emphysema treated as part of the disease,” although only 3,000 men “fell into this category.” In May 1969, adenocarcinoma of the nasal sinuses “in woodworkers in the furniture industry” became a prescribed occupational disease.|$|E

40|$|Since Sri Lanka’s {{independence}} in 1948, social welfare for the country’s fishing populations {{has been the}} responsibility of successive governments. During {{the latter half of}} the last millennium, the State has been channelling huge amounts of public funds into a number of social welfare and social security measures. However, the emphasis has mainly been on promotional welfare measures, such as housing, sanitation, infrastructure and training. Among the common problems in the delivery of such measures are regional disparities in the distribution of benefits (with the southern regions receiving the lion’s share), and expenditure on welfare dwindling with a change of government. If social security measures are defined, as by the ILO, to include medical care, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, old-age benefit, employment <b>injury</b> <b>benefit,</b> family benefit, maternity benefit, invalidity benefit and urvivors’ benefit, then only the Fishermen’s Pension and ocial Security Benefit Scheme provides some kind of social ecurity for Sri Lanka’s fishing populations.

The present study explores {{the effects of}} extending the range of memory aids and including games. For 2 months, 12 people who had sustained brain injury were loaned a pocket computer containing three purpose-designed memory aids: diary, notebook and to-do list. A month later they were given another computer with the same memory aids but a different method of text entry (physical keyboard or touch-screen keyboard). Machine order was counterbalanced across participants. Assessment was by interviews during the loan periods, rating scales, performance tests and computer log files. All participants could use the memory aids and ten people (83 %) found them very useful. Correlations among the three memory aids were not significant, suggesting individual variation in how they were used. Games did not increase use of the memory aids, nor did loan of the preferred pocket computer (with physical keyboard). Significantly more diary entries were made by people who had previously used other memory aids, suggesting that {{a better understanding of}} how to use a range of memory aids could benefit some people with brain injury...|$|E

40|$|Context: Fractures of the femoral shaft {{are common}} and have {{potentially}} serious consequences {{in patients with}} multiple traumatic injuries. The appropriate timing of fracture repair is controversial. Objective: To assess the effect of timing of internal fixation on mortality in multi-system trauma patientsDesign: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Data from public and private Trauma Centers throughout the United States reported to the National Trauma Data Bank (version 5. 0 for 2000 - 2005). Patients: 3069 multi-system trauma patients (Injury Severity Score > 15) who underwent internal fixation of femoral shaft fractures. Intervention: Time to treatment was defined in categories as the time from admission to internal fixation: t 0 3) experienced the greatest benefit from delay of internal fixation beyond 12 hours (RR= 0. 82 for AIS 3, 95 %CI: 0. 13 - 0. 87; p-value for interaction = 0. 09). The results of the logistic regression and multivariate standardized risk ratios agreed with IPTW estimates.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. As {{in-vehicle}} safety technology becomes more prevalent, the corresponding fitment of side airbags in the United Kingdom {{is now more}} commonplace. This study adds {{to the body of}} knowledge on real world impacts by presenting initial cases of deployment from the UK, including examples where there is some suggestion that side airbag deployment may have contributed to injury outcomes. With the introduction of new restraint devices into the vehicle fleet, manufacturers and engineers are not only eager to quantify their benefit and injury mitigation effectiveness but to also consider the performance and application in the real world. Whilst there are presently insufficient numbers of cases to fully evaluate <b>injury</b> <b>benefit</b> in side impacts, individual case evaluations can provide an initial assessment of side airbag field performance. In this study, data from 47 crashes in which the side airbag deployed were available for analysis. Of these, 19 occupants sustained a MAIS ≥ 2 injury. Case reviews have identified 2 occupants where serious (AIS 3) thoracic injuries may have occurred through interaction with the deploying side airbag and a further case involving upper extremity fracture (AIS 3) was also thought to have been associated with side airbag deployment. In these 3 cases, crash severity and compartmental deformation were not considered to be extensive. However in the majority of cases, side airbag deployment did not cause injury to the occupant and a general overview of these cases is given...|$|E
40|$|The {{socio-economic}} {{effect of}} 156 hand injuries was studied prospectively. The average cost injury was IRf 474. 28 {{of the more}} serious injuries utilized two-thirds of the resources and resul in 83 % of the days lost from work. In the working population approximately 50 % of hand injuries occurred at work. In assessing {{the economic impact of}} hand injuries, lahour costs account for to 65 % of costs. Amputation and complicated laceration were the most costly and resulted in more days lost at work. Injuries at work result in greater costs because they involve more serious injuries, and because workers requiring manual skills need a higher level of hand rehabilitation to return to work. Unless the labour costs are taken into account, the true impact of hand injuries is greatly underestimated. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1993) 18 B: 395 - 398 reveal that 20 % of all claims for <b>injury</b> <b>benefit</b> are for hand injuries (Havelin, 1990). Reports from other coun-tries indicate that between 20 % and 50 % of insurance claims are for hand injuries (Leung and Chan, 1981). Comparison of costs between countries proves diffi-cult. In the USA, hospital costs per hand injury amount to $ 22, 000 (Gaul, 1987) compared to 5275 per injured hand in India (Mathur and Sharma, 1988).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{confirm that}} {{patients}} admitted to {{hospital with a}} head <b>injury</b> <b>benefit</b> from a routinely offered early intervention service.  PATIENTS AND METHODS—A mixed rural and urban Health District of 560 000 people with two accident and emergency departments provided the setting. Existing routine services for most patients with head injury are minimal. All patients aged 16 - 65 years admitted to hospital after a head injury of any severity, with or without other injuries entered the trial. Prospective randomisation, with a block randomisation procedure was used to allocate all eligible patients to either: a group offered an additional service by a specialist team; or a group receiving existing standard services. Patients were assessed at follow up six months after injury. The primary outcome measure was the Rivermead head injury follow up questionnaire, a validated and reliable measure of social disability. The Rivermead post-concussion symptoms questionnaire was used to estimate severity of post-concussion symptoms. Each patient in the trial group was contacted 7 - 10 days after injury, and offered assessment and interventions as needed. These initially focused on the provision of information, support, and advice. Forty six per cent of patients in the trial group also received further outpatient intervention or additional support by telephone.  RESULTS— 314 patients were registered: 184 were randomised into the trial group, 130 into the control group. For prognostic data, the groups were comparable at randomisation, and remained comparable when assessed at six months. 132 trial and 86 control patients were followed up at six months after injury. Patients' post-traumatic amnesia ranged from mild (n= 79, 40 %), and moderate (n= 62, 32 %), to severe (n= 38, 19 %) and very severe (n= 17, 9 %). The trial group patients had significantly less social disability (p= 0. 01) and significantly less severe post-concussion symptoms (p= 0. 02) at follow up at six months after injury {{than the control group}} patients.  CONCLUSIONS—The early interventions offered by a specialist service significantly reduced social morbidity and severity of post-concussion symptoms in trial group patients at six months after head injury. Recommendations about how specialist services should be targeted are made both in the light of these results and those from a previous randomised controlled trial. ...|$|E
