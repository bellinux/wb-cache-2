40|$|The {{prototype}} of time <b>digitizing</b> {{system for the}} upgrade of BESIII endcap TOF (ETOF) is introduced in this paper. The ETOF readout electronics has a formation of distributed architecture that hit signal from multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC) is signaled as LVDS by front-end electronics (FEE) {{and sent to the}} back-end time <b>digitizing</b> system via long shield differential twisted pair cables. The ETOF <b>digitizing</b> system consists of 2 VME crates each of which contains modules of time <b>digitizing,</b> clock, trigger and fast control etc. The time <b>digitizing</b> module (TDIG) of this prototype can support up to 72 electrical channels of hit information measurement. The fast control (FCTL) module can operate at barrel or endcap mode. The barrel FCTL fans fast control signals from the trigger system out to endcap FCTLs, merges data from endcaps and transfers to the trigger system. Without modifying the barrel TOF structure, this time <b>digitizing</b> architecture benefits for improving ETOF performance without degrading barrel TOF measuring. Lab experiments show that the time resolution of this <b>digitizing</b> system can be less than 20 ps, and the data throughput to DAQ can be about 92 Mbps. Beam experiments show that the complete time resolution can be less than 45 ps...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{computer-aided}} design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) process chain for dental restorations starts with taking {{an impression of}} the clinical situation. For this purpose, either extraoral digitization of gypsum models or intraoral digitization can be used. Despite {{the increasing use of}} dental <b>digitizing</b> systems, there are only few studies on their accuracy. Objective This study compared the accuracy of various intraoral and extraoral <b>digitizing</b> systems for dental CAD/CAM technology. Material and Methods An experimental setup for three-dimensional analysis based on 2 prepared ceramic master dies and their corresponding virtual CAD-models was used to assess the accuracy of 10 extraoral and 4 intraoral optical non-contact dental <b>digitizing</b> systems. Depending on the clinical procedure, 10 optical measurements of either 10 duplicate gypsum dies (extraoral <b>digitizing)</b> or directly of the ceramic master dies (intraoral <b>digitizing)</b> were made and compared with the corresponding CAD-models. Results The <b>digitizing</b> systems showed differences in accuracy. However, all topical systems were well within the benchmark of ¬± 20 ¬µm. These results apply to single tooth measurements. Conclusions Study results are limited, since only single teeth were used for comparison. The different preparations represent various angles and steep and parallel opposing tooth surfaces (incisors). For most <b>digitizing</b> systems, the latter are generally the most difficult to capture. Using CAD/CAM technologies, the preparation angles should not be too steep to reduce <b>digitizing</b> errors. Older systems might be limited to a certain height or taper of the prepared tooth, whereas newer systems (extraoral as well as intraoral digitization) do not have these limitations...|$|R
