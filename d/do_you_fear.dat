2500|$|Two {{years later}} in 217, Cao Cao {{personally}} led an army, claimed to be 400,000 strong, to attack Sun Quan's garrison at Ruxu (濡須). Sun Quan led about 70,000 troops to counter the enemy. Gan Ning commanded the 3,000-strong vanguard. Sun Quan gave a secret order for Gan Ning to attack the enemy {{under the cover of}} nightfall, so Gan selected 100 elite soldiers. Before the battle, Sun Quan sent wine and various dishes to Gan Ning, who gave them to his men. After the feast, Gan Ning poured wine into a silver bowl and drank two bowls before offering it to an officer. The officer knelt down and did not dare to take the bowl, so Gan Ning drew his sword, placed it on his lap and said, [...] "You respect our lord but not me? I don't fear death. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> death?" [...] The officer saw that Gan Ning was very stern so he obliged and drank from it and then ordered each soldier to drink one bowl of wine." ...|$|E

Then I have seen you conquer the desire, and you run away, as though afraid of it. Why? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> that I shall seek to compromise you?--is not that the English word? Do you think that I want you to marry me? Is it because you dare not, that you--you do not offer to take my hand, even? Tell me now! Why is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Butler {{addressed}} them in {{the best}} French he could command: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear?</b> Why do you flee? We are friends--English soldiers, seeking quarters for the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it the custom,' I {{answered}} sternly, 'to barricade up {{your door}} {{when you are}} sleeping under the roof-tree of an honest man? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear,</b> that <b>you</b> should take such a precaution?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{said that}} and more, great jeddak," [...] {{answered}} the major-domo. [...] "They said {{that not only}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> to enter the chambers of O-Mai, but that <b>you</b> <b>feared</b> the slave Turan, and they blame you for your treatment of A-Kor, whom they all believe to have been murdered at your command. They were fond of A-Kor {{and there are many}} now who say aloud that A-Kor would have made a wondrous jeddak." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>fear</b> {{the grave}} reproof [...] In good Creed Haymond's eye? Will Stephen Gage not stand aloof [...] And pass you coldly by? ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a dead, still pause. It {{was broken}} by the denouncing tone of the father, 'Cowards! <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> a single arm? Strike him dead! spare not the traitress!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] {{broke in}} Margaret in an anxious voice, [...] "why {{do you speak}} of the future thus?--I mean, as though you had no share in it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> aught?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought you'd {{be glad to}} {{see your}} old friends once more," [...] growled the negro; [...] "you were never afraid of a living man, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> from the dead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Knowing so much, {{you must}} also know that I do not like strangers. Your {{presence}} here in my home annoys me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>fear</b> my anger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} sorry, indeed, to go," [...] Oswald said, [...] "but I see that if {{troubles}} <b>do,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>fear,</b> break {{out at the}} conclusion of the peace, a fortnight hence--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are strangely foolish, nephew,' {{he said at}} length. 'For {{the most}} part youth fails through rashness, but you err by over-caution. By over-caution in your fence you lost your chance last night, and so by over-caution in hiding this tale from me you have lost a far greater opportunity. What, have you not seen me give counsel in many such matters, and have you ever known me to betray the {{confidence}} even of the veriest stranger? Why then <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> for yours?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Highness, how can I {{say to the}} Prince--'So much shall {{you love}} this or that woman and no more?' Moreover, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> that which has not and may never come about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe that," [...] replied Inga, {{looking at}} the {{beautiful}} pearls with much awe. [...] "But tell me, my father, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> the warriors of Regos and Coregos when these marvelous powers are yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Life is ours, Rachel, {{and love}} is ours, {{and that which}} saved us through many a danger and brought me back to you, will surely keep us safe. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> to pass the desert at my side?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] {{she said}} thoughtfully, [...] "if {{this is really}} the secret of your mistrust? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> indeed <b>fear</b> that I have no other {{interest}} in life save to serve Saxe Leinitzer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{noted the}} aptness of the description; but, indeed, Felipe had {{sometimes}} a strange felicity in rendering into words the sensations of the body. 'And your mother, too,' said I; 'she seems {{to feel this}} weather much. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>fear</b> she may be unwell?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor can he, or you, or any man deny it," [...] flung back Andre-Louis. [...] "Yourself, monsieur, {{you made}} {{confession}} when {{you gave me}} now the reason why you killed him. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> it because <b>you</b> <b>feared</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You who listen," [...] I cried, {{pointing}} now to Moreau {{and shouting}} past {{him to the}} Beast Men,--"You who listen! Do you not see these men still fear you, go in dread of you? Why, then, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> them? You are many--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet it {{will find}} you out before all is done, or so I think. Look you, pagan blood still runs in me, and, Christian though I am, I would not dare {{one of the great}} gods of Greece and Rome. I'd leave that to the priests. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> nothing, Olaf?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{detained}} her gently. [...] "Just a moment. Remember I {{have not}} {{said a word}} of all this to her, and your alarm may be quite groundless. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> if your 'guides' are so wise and powerful? Where is your proselyting zeal? Am I not worthy of being converted? Why not let Viola influence me towards your path?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{noted the}} aptness of the description; but, indeed, Felipe had {{sometimes}} a strange felicity in rendering into words the sensations of the body.

6000|$|... "But I <b>fear</b> <b>you</b> won't. I <b>do</b> so <b>fear</b> <b>you</b> won't. And yet you can't {{but think}} I am the most {{fortunate}} woman living on God's earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Devil," [...] I exclaimed, [...] "do {{you dare}} {{approach}} me? And <b>do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> the fierce vengeance {{of my arm}} wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I forgot," [...] said Sinan. [...] "So I decreed, {{and that}} will be a fight I wish to see. If he kills you then your brother shall meet him. And if he kills you both, then perhaps I, Sinan, will meet him--in my own fashion. Sweet lady, knowing where the course is laid, say, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> to see this fray?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> {{the force}} of the wind, [...] The slash of the rain? [...] Go face them and fight them, [...] Be savage again. [...] Go hungry and cold like the wolf, [...] Go wade like the crane. [...] The palms of your hands will thicken, [...] The skin of your cheek will tan, [...] You'll grow ragged and weary and swarthy, [...] But you'll walk like a man! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are clever," [...] growled the Augustus. [...] "Well, {{keep the}} cup; you've earned it. Yet drain it first, man. You have scarce wet your lips. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> {{that it is}} poisoned, as you say yonder fruits are?" [...] And {{he pointed to a}} side-table, where stood a jar of glass in which were those very figs that had been sent to the princes in the prison.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean, Francisco? <b>You</b> <b>do</b> {{not mean}} to fight--they are vastly {{stronger}} than you are--and yet <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>fear</b> them. <b>You</b> are not given to speak in riddles; but you have puzzled me this time." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Windu holds Palpatine at blade point, {{he tells}} his {{opponent}} why the Sith always lose: because they are always defeated by their own fear. Palpatine counters by screaming [...] "Fool! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think the <b>fear</b> <b>you</b> feel is MINE?" [...] instead of [...] "No! No!! NO!!! YOU WILL DIE!!!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some going-about body. They often tak' bilbie in toom houses, {{and that}} door is without a lock; it's keepit close wi' {{slipping}} a stick aneath it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> mind how <b>feared</b> {{we used to}} be at that house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The whole {{tenor of}} your quiet and reproachless life {{since you were}} last here,' {{returned}} Mr Haredale, mildly, 'shall bear witness for you. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>fear</b> to awaken such a suspicion? You do not speak to strangers. You have not to claim our interest or consideration for the first time. Be more yourself. Take heart. Any advice or assistance that I can give you, you know is yours of right, and freely yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucille," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are very}} foolish. It {{is not much}} I ask of you, but that little I will have or I pledge my word to it that things shall go ill {{with you and your}} husband. There is plain speech for you. Do not be absurd.

6000|$|Such are we now. Ah! {{wherefore}} {{should we}} turn [...] To what our fathers were, unless to mourn?

6000|$|... "As a King--as a Christian, it is true!" [...] said Louis. [...] "Here, my boy! Wherefore {{shrink from}} me? What have I <b>done,</b> that <b>you</b> should <b>fear</b> me? <b>You</b> have been {{listening}} to evil tales of me, my child. Come hither." ...|$|R
50|$|Once someone {{questioned}} Imam 'Ali ibne Musa al-Ridha: “What is {{the extent}} of 'tawakkul'? He (a.s.) replied: That <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>fear</b> anyone once <b>you</b> have relied on Allah!”.|$|R
