The data from 300 livestock farmers (100 from each district) was collected by using multi-stage sampling technique. Descriptive statistics, stochastic frontier production function and cost function were used for determination of economic efficiency. Major determinants impacting economic efficiency of milking animals i. e herd size, <b>dry</b> <b>fodder,</b> <b>green</b> <b>fodder,</b> use of concentrate/oil seed cake, hired labor, permanent labor, medicine and vaccination cost and fees were studied. The results of descriptive statistics show that the average yield per day in case of buffalo, cow and goat were 6. 71, 6. 02 and 1. 16 liters respectively. The average cost of milk production per annum per buffalo, cow and goat was found to be Rs. 20017, Rs. 16092 and Rs. 1321 respectively, while the revenue obtained by an average milk producer per buffalo, cow and goat was estimated as Rs. 26700, Rs. 23067 and Rs. 631.

40|$|The {{availability}} and {{efficient use of}} the feed resources in India are the primary drivers to maximize productivity of Indian livestock. Feed security {{is vital to the}} livestock management, extent of use, conservation and productivity enhancement. Assessment and forecasting of livestock feed resources are most important for effective planning and policy making. In the present study, 40 years of data on crop production, land use pattern, rainfall, its deviation from normal, area under crop and yield of crop were collected and modeled to forecast the likely production of feed resources for the next 20 years. The higher order auto-regressive (AR) models were used to develop efficient forecasting models. Use of climatic variables (actual rainfall and its deviation from normal) in combination with non-climatic factors like area under each crop, yield of crop, lag period etc., increased the efficiency of forecasting models. From the best fitting models, the current total dry matter (DM) availability in India was estimated to be 510. 6 million tonnes (mt) comprising of 47. 2 mt from concentrates, 319. 6 mt from crop residues and 143. 8 mt from greens.

40|$|Kolhapur {{district}} {{is located in}} the Western part of India and is well known for buffalo rearing. Buffaloes are mainly fed on crop residues and local grasses and need to be supplemented with deficient minerals for proper production and reproduction functions. In view of this, area specific mineral mixture was developed for the district by testing feeds and fodders for macro and micro minerals. The average calcium (Ca) content in straws of groundnut, ragi and soybean was high (0. 97 %), whereas, straws of sorghum and paddy had low (0. 23 %) level. Ca content in <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> was 0. 38 percent. Concentrate ingredients were particularly low (0. 22 %) in Ca. The phosphorus (P) content in crop residues and <b>green</b> <b>fodders</b> was 0. 14 and 0. 19 per cent, respectively, which was low, but higher (0. 67 %) in concentrate ingredients. The magnesium (Mg) content in roughages and concentrate ingredients was 0. 38 and 0. 32 percent, respectively. The sulphur (S) content was deficient in concentrate ingredients (0. 13 %) and crop residues (0. 12 %).

40|$|Dairy {{farmers in}} Bihar are mostly smallholders having {{one or two}} local-bred milch animals, which are raised on crop {{residues}} and natural pastures with under-employed family labour. Feeding grains, oil cakes and <b>green</b> nutritious <b>fodder</b> are limited to crossbred cattle. Feed and fodder deficiencies are major limiting factors in raising livestock productivity. Fodder markets are important for communities, which have limited ability to produce their own fodder, but need quality fodder at reasonable prices to produce milk at competitive cost and trading is an important livelihood activity for poor who engaged in it. The study tries find {{ways to improve the}} livelihoods of resource-poor livestock producers by alleviating fodder scarcity. Livestock being an important source of livelihood in Bihar, the study has a direct poverty relevance for state. The findings indicate a huge gap between demand and supply of both <b>dry</b> and <b>green</b> <b>fodder.</b> South Bihar is fodder surplus area because of irrigated cultivation of paddy and wheat, while north Bihar is fodder deficit and depend on fodder surplus regions. There are no dedicated market places so, trading takes place along roadsides and without legal credentials. Fodder being a bulky item, makes its trading and handling difficult. Some traders do use compressing machines to make fodder blocks. Development of technology for cost-effective and nutritive feed requires urgent attention and here public sector R&D can play an effective role which can also be done in public-private partnership mode. ...|$|R

Goats suddenly became ill with symptoms of knuckling of the fetlocks of the pelvic limbs, with no apparent ataxia or flexor weakness. Weight bearing was possible while the digits were extended, but with knuckling, weight was supported on the dorsal surface of the foot. The more severely affected goats were paraplegic and recumbent. Anorexia, apathy, diarrhea and ruminal stasis, flaccid posterior paralysis,hindlegs stretched forward both side of abdomin,paralysis of all four legs, head bented to sides, aimlessly head and rear shaking. On clinical examination based on history these goats were provisionally diagnosed as Dhakeri-Bange as being called locally and Endemic Mycotic polyneuropathy syndrome as seen first time in Nepal due to moldy forage/fodder poisoning in natural pasture were treated with Antidegnala liquor(sr). On mycological and microbiological examination of tissue samples from post-mortem of dead goat and forage/fodder samples from pasture and goats feeding stalls on respective medium revealed the growth of fungal pathogens like Aspergillus and Penicillium spp with E. coli.

NIFA- 88. Date of cutting included i. e. Nov 29, Dec 14, Dec 29, Jan 13 and Jan 28 including control both the year respectively. All the cutting treatments reduced the seed yield significantly with the production of <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> as compared to un-cut check crop. Cutting at ground level produced maximum <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> but lowest seed yield. Also plant height, number of pods per plant were gradually reduced and the maturity was delayed by cutting as compared to control (un-cut) crop. It has been concluded from the results obtained that cutting reduced the yield components, seed yield and delayed the maturity of chickpea crop by effecting its physiological growth of the plant under arid condition of D.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the effect of open grazing system and feeding <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> at the stall (cut and carry system) on the growth of male buffalo calves. Twelve male buffalo calves (of Nili Ravi breed) were either grazed (n = 5) on natural pasture or were offered seasonal <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> ad lib in the manger (n = 7). The calves were kept on these treatments for 9 months. Live body weight of the calves was recorded at the start of trial and then fortnightly. The overall weight gain per day over nine months of feeding period did not differ significantly between open grazing (0. 415 ± 0. 028 kg) and stall fed groups (0. 433 ± 0. 056 kg) (P > 0. 05). It is concluded that grazing on natural pasture may result in growth of male buffalo calves comparable to that after feeding them cultivated <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> at the manger...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum and Pennisetum {{are two of}} {{the gifted}} genera of the {{tropical}} regions that provide food, feed, stover (dry straw) and fuel to millions of poor farmer families and their livestocks. Single-cut sorghum and multi-cut pearl millet varieties are also cultivated for <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> (forage). In addition, the interspecific sorghum × sudangrass annual multi-cut hybrids are grown for <b>green</b> <b>fodder.</b> The interspecific pearl millet × napiergrass hybrids are perennial and yield <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> throughout the year. Pearl millet uses less water per unit of forage production, tolerates both lower and higher soil pH and higher aluminium concentration, and is rich in minerals as compared to sorghum. However, sorghum has a wider range of adaptability and is more widely grown. Geographical preferences, limited market demand, variable prices, and lack of private industry and institutional research support have led to limited pearl millet forage research and cultivar adoption. Forage quality is paramount to palatability or acceptability and animal intake. Plant morphology, anatomical components, digestibility, protein...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to observe the effect of supplementation of concentrate mixture alongwith <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> on growth rate and age of maturity in growing buffalo heifers. Twenty seven heifers of Nili-Ravi buffalo, with 18 - 21 months of age and on an average 280. 0 Kg body weight, were randomly divided into three groups A, B and C, with 9 animals in each group. All the groups were given chaffed <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> ad lib. on group feeding basis. In addition, heifers of groups A and B were given 2. 0 and 4. 0 kg of concentrate mixture per head per day, while the group C received no concentrate and was kept as control. Daily <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> consumption was 32. 5, 30. 00 and 37. 50 Kg, with a growth rate of 0. 558, 0. 659 and 0. 354 Kg in groups A, B and C, respectively. The age at maturity averaged 774, 728 and 993 days, while body weights were 411, 431 and 388 Kg in respective groups. The results revealed that the maturity age was significantly reduced (P< 0. 01) by concentrate supplementation compared with fodder alone. Cost of rearing of buffalo heifers up to age of maturity was 5829. 00, 6862. 00 and 8747. 00 rupees in respective groups. Rearing of buffalo heifers on <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> ad lib. alongwith supplementation of 2 Kg of concentrate mixture was economical...|$|R
