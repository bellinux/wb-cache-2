50|$|A tenancy <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> {{is created}} when a tenant wrongfully holds over past {{the end of}} the {{duration}} period of the tenancy (for example, a tenant who stays past the expiration of his or her lease). In this case, the landlord can hold over the tenant to a new tenancy, and collect rent for the period the tenant has held over.A tenancy <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> (sometimes called a holdover tenancy) may exist when a tenant remains in possession of property even after {{the end of the}} lease, until the landlord acts to eject the tenant. The occupant may legally be a trespasser at this point, and the possession of this type may not be a true estate in land, even if authorities recognize the condition to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may be able to evict such tenant at any time, without notice. Action to evict will terminate a tenancy <b>at</b> <b>sufferance,</b> because the tenant no longer enjoys possession. Some jurisdictions impose an irrevocable election whereby the landlord treats the holdover as either a trespasser, or as a tenant <b>at</b> <b>sufferance.</b> A trespasser is not in possession; but a tenant <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> continues to enjoy possession of the real property.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{leasehold}} estates {{can take}} one of four formsthe fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years, the periodic tenancy, the tenancy at will, and the tenancy <b>at</b> <b>sufferance,</b> all discussed below. Forms no longer used include socage and burgage.|$|R
50|$|Simply leaving {{property}} {{behind on}} the premises does not constitute possession and thus, a tenancy <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> cannot be established. E.g., Nathan Lane Assocs. v. Merchants Wholesale, 698 N.W.2d 136 (Iowa 2005); Brown v. Music, Inc., 359 P.2d 295 (Alaska 1961).|$|R
40|$|The rule is {{that the}} {{necessity}} of a notice to quit is based on the relation of landlord and tenant, and where that relation does not exist, the notice to quit is not necessary. Therefore, it has been held that a mortgagor in possession, is not entitled to notice to quit, as he is 2 ̆ 2 at most a tenant <b>at</b> <b>sufferance,</b> and may be treated either as a tenant or trespasser, at the election of the mortgagee. 2 ̆ 2 And no notice to quit is necessary where one has taken possession under an adverse claim. So, where the tenant going into possession of the premises under the title of the landlord, afterwards disclaims, he has no right to insist on a notice to quit. At common law, a tenant <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> was not entitled to notice to quit. But it has been provided by statute in some of the States, that it shall be necessary to serve him with notice to quit. It is so provided in Missouri, where one month 2 ̆ 7 s notice is required, and in Wisconsin. But in Michigan, and in Oregon, the statute requires a notice of three months. This provision, requiring notice to be given to tenants <b>at</b> <b>sufferance,</b> has given rise to some troublesome questions...|$|R
50|$|A tenancy <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> (sometimes {{called a}} {{holdover}} tenancy) exists when a tenant remains {{in possession of}} a property after the expiration of a lease, and until the landlord acts to eject the tenant from the property. Although the tenant is technically a trespasser at this point, and possession of this type is not a true estate in land, authorities recognize the condition in order to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may evict such a tenant at any time, and without notice.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fixed term}} tenancy {{comes to an}} end {{automatically}} when the fixed term runs out or, {{in the case of a}} tenancy that ends on the happening of an event, when the event occurs. If a holdover tenant remains on the property after the termination of the lease, s/he may become a tenant <b>at</b> <b>sufferance</b> because the lessor/landlord has suffered (or allowed) the tenant to remain as a tenant instead of evicting him or her. Such a tenancy is generally [...] "at will," [...] meaning the tenant or the landlord may terminate it at any time, upon the providing of proper statutory notice.|$|R
50|$|Concerted {{efforts were}} made under Henry VII of England to reform cestui que. A change in the laws made feoffees the {{absolute}} owners of the property of {{which they had been}} enfeoffed, and they became subject to all the liabilities of ownership. They were the only ones who could take proceedings against those who interfered with their ownership. If a trespass had been committed with the license of the cestui que use they could take proceedings against him, for he was at law only a tenant <b>at</b> <b>sufferance.</b> Similarly, feoffees were the only ones who could take the proceedings against tenants of the land to compel them to perform their obligations.|$|R
