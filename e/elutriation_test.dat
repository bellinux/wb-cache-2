40|$|For the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, powder segregation {{can occur in}} many processes such as blending and compression solid dose unit operations. Yet {{it is important that}} the high quality standards of drug product manufacture are maintained throughout the whole processes. Powder segregation has been identified by {{the pharmaceutical}} industry as a potential issue, and in some cases it may cause variability in tablet assay and uniformity throughout a compression run. Early studies suggested for certain Direct Compression (DC) products, the separation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) from excipients could arise due to air-induced segregation of the powders discharging from an Intermediate Bulk Container (IBC) to the tablet press via a vertical chute. Segregation tests were carried out on trial powder blend materials supplied by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), using a laboratory-scale air <b>elutriation</b> <b>test</b> facility at The Wolfson Centre. Particle size analysis of the virgin and segregated sub-samples clearly indicated that powder segregation occurred as a result of aerodynamic effects. Subsequent chemical assay results concurred with the particle size results. Flowability testing of the powder blends indicated them to be free-flowing materials; this in addition to the presence of large particle size differentials within the powder blends is the likely cause of the susceptibility to air-induced segregation...|$|E
40|$|Management of sediments from coastal areas, {{contaminated}} with heavy metals and organic substances, {{is a very}} critical issue. Management decisions are usually based on total pollutant concentrations and various guidelines that are used by different countries. Heavy metals can be mobilized from polluted sediments if {{they are exposed to}} changing environmental conditions that occur during excavation, disposal at sea, or disposal in confined facilities. This paper examines the changes in heavy metals partitioning to binding phases in contaminated marine sediments and the release of metals to the environment. Environmental conditions are simulated by submitting sediments to a modified <b>elutriation</b> <b>test</b> with oxygenated and deoxygenated seawater. A sequential extraction procedure is used to determine the binding fractions of heavy metals in the sediments. Fractionation analysis of excavated marine sediments from the port of Piraeus, Greece showed that copper is primarily associated with organic matter, whereas lead and zinc are primarily associated with iron oxides. Under anoxic conditions, the metals bound to the various binding fractions remain practically stable. On the other hand, under oxic conditions, an increase in the concentration of metals associated with carbonates and a decrease in the concentration of metals associated with organic matter and iron oxides were observed. Both under oxic and anoxic conditions, actual metal mobility was very low and less than 0. 5 % of total metal mass was found in the dissolved phase. Copyright © 2009 by ASTM International...|$|E
40|$|To address {{concerns}} expressed {{about the}} possible effect of drilling mud discharges on shallow, low-energy estuarine ecosystems, a 12 month {{study was designed to}} detect alterations in water quality and sediment geochemistry. Each drilling mud used in the study and sediments from the study site were analyzed in the laboratory for chemical and physical characteristics. Potential water quality impacts were simulated by the EPA-COE <b>elutriation</b> <b>test</b> procedure. Mud toxicity was measured by acute and chronic bioassays with Mysidopsis bahia, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Nereis virens. ^ For the field study, a relatively pristine, shallow (1. 2 m) estuary (Christmas Bay, TX) without any drilling activity for the last 30 years was chosen for the study site. After a three month baseline study, three stations were selected. Station 1 was an external control. At each treatment station (2, 3), mesocosms were constructed to enclose a 3. 5 m 3 water column. Each treatment station included an internal control site also. Each in situ mesocosm, except the controls, was successively dosed at a mesocosm-specific dose (1 : 100; 1 : 1, 000; or 1 : 10, 000 v/v) with 4 field collected drilling muds (spud, nondispersed, lightly-treated, and heavily-treated lignosulfonate) in sequential order over 1. 5 months. Twenty-four hours after each dose, water exchange was allowed until the next treatment. Station 3 was destroyed by a winter storm. After the last treatment, the enclosures were removed and the remaining sites monitored for 6 months. One additional site was similarly dosed (1 : 100 v/v) with clean dredged sediment from Christmas Bay for comparison between dredged sediments and drilling muds. ^ Results of the analysis of the water samples and field measurements showed that water quality was impacted during the discharges, primarily at the highest dose (1 : 100 v/v), but that elevated levels of C, Cr (T,F), Cr+ 3 (T, F), N, Pb, and Zn returned to ambient levels {{before the end of the}} 24 hour exposure period or immediately after water exchange was allowed (Al, Ba(T), Chlorophyll ABC, SS,...|$|E
40|$|Project # 5601201 As {{part of the}} University of Minnesota’s ongoing {{support for}} the {{development}} of ilmenite deposits located within the Duluth complex, the University’s Permanent Trust Fund sponsored a project by the Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory to determine if valued added products could be produced from the ilmenite deposits and to determine if ilmenite recovery could be increased. A previous study sponsored by the Minerals Coordinating Committee indicated that using high pressure rolls in place of a rod mill to grind the ilmenite increases TiO 2 recovery by about 10 percent. The major loss of TiO 2 (about 25 %) was associated with the removal of magnetite by magnetic separation after spiral concentration. The objective of this program was to determine if the magnetic portion of the spiral concentrate could be upgraded to make a concentrate suitable for either blast furnace pellet feed or DRI feed. During upgrading of the magnetic portion, non-magnetic materials should contain the bulk of the ilmenite, and they would also be upgraded to determine the potential for additional ilmenite recovery. Initial liberation grinds and Davis tube tests on the spiral magnetic concentrate indicated that grinding and magnetic separation alone could not upgrade the material sufficiently. Standard silica flotation on the ground and magnetically separated material did not provide significant upgrading. The best concentrate produced contained 58. 84 percent iron, 6. 66 percent TiO 2, and 5. 74 percent silica. Perhaps this material could be used in the iron nugget process. Amine flotation, fatty acid flotation and WHIMS were used to recover TiO 2 from the non-magnetic portion of the reground spiral magnetic concentrate. Only fatty acid flotation of the ilmenite showed any potential for recovering additional ilmenite at grade. Additional test work on the use of silicate depressants is needed. <b>Elutriation</b> <b>tests</b> on size fractions indicated that grinding to finer than 200 mesh is needed for liberation of the ilmenite from the silicate gangue. While the previous test work showed increased TiO 2 recovery in the spiral nonmagnetic fraction, no work was conducted on upgrading that material to determine if the increased recovery could be carried through to a final concentrate. Therefore, bench scale electrostatic separator tests were run on the spiral non-magnetic fraction produced in the previous project. The electrostatic tests indicated that both grade and recovery could be obtained.

40|$|Laboratory {{tests were}} {{performed}} to examine the efficacy of leach treatments for decontaminating organic ion exchange resins (OIER), which {{have been found in}} a number of samples retrieved from K East Basin sludge. Based on process records, the OIER found in the K Basins is a mixed-bet strong acid/strong base material marketed as Purolite{trademark} NRW- 037. Radionuclides sorbed or associated with the OIER can restrict its disposal to the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility (ERDF). The need for testing to support development of a treatment process for K Basin sludge has been described in Section 4. 2 of ''Testing Strategy to Support the Development of K Basins Sludge Treatment Process'' (Flament 1998). To help understand the effects of anticipated OIER <b>elutriation</b> and washing, <b>tests</b> were performed with well-rinsed OIER material from K East Basin floor sludge (sample H- 08 BEAD G) and with well-rinsed OIER having approximately 5 % added K East canister composite sludge (sample KECOMP). The rinsed resin-bearing material also contained the inorganic ion exchanger Zeolon- 900 {trademark}, a zeolite primarily composed of the mineral mordenite. The zeolite was estimated to comprise 27 weight percent of the dry H- 08 BEAD G material...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) funded Technology Development and Deployment (TDD) {{to solve}} {{technical}} {{problems associated with}} waste tank closure for sites such as Hanford Site and Savannah River Site (SRS). One of the tasks supported by this funding at Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNNL) was In-Tank Elutriation. Elutriation is the process whereby physical separation occurs based on particle size and density. This report satisfies {{the first phase of}} Task WP_ 1. 3. 1. 1 In-Tank Elutriation, which is to assess the feasibility of this method of separation in waste tanks at Hanford Site and SRS. This report includes an analysis of scoping tests performed in the Engineering Development Laboratory of SRNL, analysis of Hanford's inadvertent elutriation, the viability of separation methods such as elutriation and hydrocyclones and recommendations for a path forward. This report will demonstrate that the retrieval of Hanford salt waste tank S- 112 very successfully decreased the tank's inventories of radionuclides. Analyses of samples collected from the tank showed that concentrations of the major radionuclides Cs- 136 and Sr- 90 were decreased by factors of 250 and 6 and their total curie tank inventories decreased by factors of 60, 000 and 2000. The total tank curie loading decreased from 300, 000 Ci to 55 Ci. The remaining heel was nearly all innocuous gibbsite, Al(OH) {sub 3 }. However, in the process of tank retrieval approximately 85 % of the tank gibbsite was also removed. Significant amounts of money and processing time could be saved if more gibbsite could be left in tanks while still removing nearly all of the radionuclides. There were factors which helped to make the elutriation of Tank S- 112 successful which would not necessarily be present in all salt tanks. 1. The gibbsite particles in the tank were surprisingly large, as much as 200 {micro}m. The gibbsite crystals had probably grown in size over a period of decades. 2. The radionuclides were apparently either in the form of soluble compounds, like cesium, or micrometer sized particles of actinide oxides or hydroxides. 3. After the initial tank retrieval the tank contained cobble which is not conducive to elutriation. Only after the tank contents were treated with thousands of gallons of 50 wt% caustic, were the solids converted to sand which is compatible with elutriation. Discussions between SRNL and PNNL resulted in plans to <b>test</b> <b>elutriation</b> in two phases; in Phase 1 particles would be separated by differences in settling velocity in an existing scaled tank with its associated hardware and in Phase 2 additional hardware, such as a hydrocyclone, would be added downstream to separate slow settling partciels from liquid. Phase 1 of in-tank <b>elutriation</b> was <b>tested</b> for Proof of Principle in theEngineering Development Laboratory of SRNL in a 41 " diameter, 87 gallon tank. The tank had been previously used as a 1 / 22 scale model of Hanford Waste Tank AY- 102. The objective of the testing was to determine which tank operating parameters achieved the best separation between fast- and slow-settling particles. For Phase 1 testing a simulated waste tank supernatant, slow-settling particles and fast-settling particles were loaded to the scaled tank. Because this was a Proof of Principle test, readily available solids particles were used that represented fast-settling and slow-settling particles. The tank contents were agitated using rotating mixer jet pumps (MJP) which suspended solids while liquids and solids were drawn out of the tank with a suction tube. The goal was to determine the optimum hydraulic operating conditions to achieve clean separation in which the residual solids in the tank were nearly all fast-settling particles and the solids transferred out of the tank were nearly all slow-settling particles. Tests were conducted at different pump jet velocities, suction tube diameters and suction tube elevations. Testing revealed that the most important variable was jet velocity which translates to a downstream fluid velocity {{in the vicinity of the}} suction tube which can suspend particles and potentially allow their removal from the tank. The optimum jet velocity in the vicinity of the sucti 9 on tube was between 1. 5 and 2 ft/s (4 - 5 gpm). During testing at lower velocities a significant amount of slow-settling particles remained in the tank. At higher velocities a significant amount of fast-settling particles were elutriated from the tank. It should be noted that this range of velocities is appropriate for this particular geometry and particles. However, the principle of In-Tank Elutriation was proved. In-tank elutriation has the potential to save much money in tank closure. However, more work, both analytical and experimental, must be done before an improved version of the process could be applied to actual waste tanks. It is recommended that testing with more prototypic simulants be conducted. Also, scale-up criteria for elutriation and the resulting size of pilot scale test equipment require investigation during future research. In addition, it is recommended that the use of hydrocyclones be pursued in Phase 2 testing. Hydrocyclones are a precise and efficient separation tool that are frequently used in industry...|$|R
