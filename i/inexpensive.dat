5|$|The post-War period saw {{changes in}} the {{production}} of Christmas tree ornaments. Shiny Brite and other ornament companies began mass-producing <b>inexpensive</b> glass ornaments. Bubble lights were introduced during the period, and <b>inexpensive,</b> lit-from-within tree toppers were another option for the tree.|$|E
5|$|As a dense, <b>inexpensive,</b> easily worked material, zinc {{is used as}} a lead replacement. In {{the wake}} of lead concerns, zinc appears in weights for various {{applications}} ranging from fishing to tire balances and flywheels.|$|E
5|$|Listeners use <b>inexpensive</b> {{portable}} world band receivers {{to access}} the shortwave bands, and some advanced hobbyists employ specialized shortwave communications receivers featuring digital technology designed for optimum reception of shortwave signals, along with outdoor antennas to enhance performance.|$|E
5|$|Their single story Great River Station on the Long Island Rail Road, {{expressed}} Raymond's {{fondness for}} <b>inexpensive,</b> simple materials. It had fieldstone retaining {{walls and a}} flat roof supported in each corner with a redwood post. The wide expanse of glazing created a modernist pavilion.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While {{the procedure is}} <b>inexpensive</b> and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which functions {{in the same manner}} is being looked at. A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.|$|E
5|$|After {{their success}} {{in the first month}} of the war, mass {{production}} was ordered and the development of other models proceeded. The Katyusha was <b>inexpensive</b> and could be manufactured in light industrial installations which did not have the heavy equipment to build conventional artillery gun barrels. By the end of 1942, 3,237 Katyusha launchers of all types had been built, {{and by the end of}} the war total production reached about 10,000.|$|E
5|$|An Arkansas {{resident}} {{most of his}} life, Pierce {{made his}} directorial debut with Boggy Creek, a faux documentary-style film inspired by {{the legend of the}} Bigfoot-like Fouke Monster. The low-budget film grossed roughly $25 million, and Pierce followed that success with several <b>inexpensive,</b> regional films set in the southern United States, including The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on the true story of the Phantom Killer murders in Texarkana.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cost}} of solar {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an <b>inexpensive,</b> low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|But they {{overlooked}} that <b>inexpensive</b> aspirin {{had become}} available in India {{and other places}} after October 1918, when the Bayer patent expired. In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|E
5|$|Dairy farming {{has been}} a major sector of Israeli {{agriculture}} since the founding of the state, and the yield of local milk cows is amongst the highest in the world. Initially, the moshavim (farming cooperatives) and kibbutzim produced mainly soft white cheese as it was <b>inexpensive</b> and nutritious. It became an important staple in the years of austerity and gained a popularity that it enjoys until today.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with medication in about 70% of cases. <b>Inexpensive</b> options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E
5|$|Fight Club {{was filmed}} mostly {{at night and}} Fincher {{purposely}} filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with <b>inexpensive</b> work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes {{in the basement and}} instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E
5|$|Glittery {{bands of}} mica {{decorated}} some balls {{while others were}} silk screened with seasonal motifs such as snowy scenes, sleigh rides, carolers, and poinsettias. Some balls featured silvery indents on their surfaces that reflected the surrounding light. In the early 1950s, clear glass balls appeared decorated with bands of color or glittering sparkles. Molded plastic Santa Clauses, angels, snowmen, and other holiday icons were <b>inexpensive,</b> mass-produced, and readily available.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation <b>inexpensive,</b> so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. <b>Inexpensive</b> digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1886 Ohio-native Charles Martin Hall helped pioneer the Hall–Héroult process, {{which made}} {{aluminum}} <b>inexpensive</b> to produce. He sold his share in 1888 to the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, {{known today as}} Alcoa. Alcoa has operations in the state, including facilities in Cleveland which manufacture aluminum wheels for Automobili Lamborghini.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the wood}} pigeon is {{commonly}} shot {{as a game}} bird, while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities. The extinction of the passenger pigeon in North America was at least partly due to shooting for use as food. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management contains recipes for roast pigeon and pigeon pie, a popular, <b>inexpensive</b> food in Victorian industrial Britain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inexpensive</b> {{powdered}} S.luteus fruit {{bodies are}} sometimes {{added to the}} more expensive B.edulis mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice {{that is difficult to}} detect with microscopy because the tissues are no longer intact. This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol. The practice can also be determined with a DNA-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of S.luteus to B.edulis powder.|$|E
5|$|Interest in mermaid costuming {{has grown}} {{alongside}} {{the popularity of}} fantasy cosplay {{as well as the}} availability of <b>inexpensive</b> monofins used in the construction of mermaid costumes. These costumes are typically designed to be used while swimming, in an activity known as mermaiding. Mermaid fandom conventions have also been held.|$|E
5|$|Mouthpieces are {{generally}} made of hard rubber, although some <b>inexpensive</b> mouthpieces {{may be made}} of plastic. Other materials such as crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used. Ligatures are often made of metal and plated in nickel, silver, or gold. Other materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.|$|E
5|$|Other {{companies}} {{followed with}} their own bubble light versions and other lighting novelties. In 1946, Sylvania introduced fluorescent pastel lights. In 1955, NOMA manufactured flashing lights. In 1958, GE launched Lighted Ice Bulbs, blue bulbs covered with 'ice' crystals. Fairy Lights were imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually morphed into the <b>inexpensive</b> mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{employed}} low-fidelity recording equipment, {{which allowed}} him to retain creative control and keep costs low on recording Illinois. Typically, his process involved recording to 32kHz 8-track tape using <b>inexpensive</b> microphones such as the Shure SM57 and AKG C1000. He then employed Pro Tools for mixing and other production tasks.|$|E
5|$|Substitutes, {{such as the}} wheat-based rice substitute, ptitim, were introduced, and {{versatile}} vegetables such as eggplant were used as alternatives to meat. Additional flavor and nutrition was provided from <b>inexpensive</b> canned tomato paste and puree, hummus, tahina, and mayonnaise in tubes. Meat was scarce, {{and it was not}} until the late 1950s that herds of beef cattle were introduced into the agricultural economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively <b>inexpensive</b> and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{industry}} would ultimately {{prove to be}} a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively <b>inexpensive</b> to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{stewardship}} of Richard Assheton Cross, the Home Secretary, Disraeli's new government enacted many reforms, including the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875, which made <b>inexpensive</b> loans available to {{towns and cities}} to construct working-class housing. Also enacted were the Public Health Act 1875, modernising sanitary codes through the nation, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876).|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{serves as}} a simple, <b>inexpensive,</b> and {{critical}} tool for treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes {{for as long as}} three months.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2018 {{edition of}} R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, only the pieces from 1882 to 1887 catalog {{for more than}} $100 in worn Good-4 condition; common dates list for $15 to $20 in that condition. The highest value listed is for the 1877, struck only in proof with a mintage of 900, at $2,000. David F. Fanning, in his 2001 article on the three-cent pieces, {{suggested}} that rarer specimens of the nickel three-cent piece are relatively <b>inexpensive</b> compared with coins of similar mintage in more popular series, such as the Morgan dollar.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} an apprenticeship, Evans {{went into}} business for himself. By the early 1850s, he {{had established a}} reputation as a printer of covers for a type of cheap novels known as yellow-backs. In the early 1860s, he began to print children's toy books and picture books in association with the printing house Routledge and Warne. His intention was to produce books for children that were beautiful and <b>inexpensive.</b> For three decades he produced multiple volumes each year, first illustrated by Crane, and later by Caldecott and Greenaway.|$|E
5|$|After her World War I service ended, Siboney was {{returned}} to the Ward Line and placed in New York–Cuba–Spain transatlantic service; the liner ran aground at Vigo, Spain in September 1920. Despite considerable damage, she was repaired and placed back in service. In late 1921, Siboney was switched to New York–Cuba–Mexico routes, which were a popular and <b>inexpensive</b> way for Americans to escape Prohibition. In late 1940, she was chartered to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing Europe {{at the outset of}} World War II, making seven roundtrips from Jersey City, New Jersey, to Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by <b>inexpensive</b> natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and <b>inexpensive</b> film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive The Merry Widow {{in order to prevent}} von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the more profitable film. The Merry Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than Greed had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is <b>inexpensive,</b> easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Before Game of Thrones both Benioff and Weiss {{worked in}} film, and were {{unfamiliar}} with {{working on a}} television show. This resulted in several first-season episodes being about 10 minutes too short for HBO, forcing them to write another 100 pages of scripts in two weeks. Due to lack of budget the new scenes were designed to be <b>inexpensive</b> to film, such as two actors conversing in one room. Benioff and Weiss noted {{that some of their}} favorite scenes from the first season were the results of the dilemma, including one between Robert and Cersei Baratheon discussing their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for <b>inexpensive</b> serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and colour printer in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
