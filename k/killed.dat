The 25th Infantry Division suffered 650 <b>killed,</b> 1,866 wounded, four captured and 10 missing. With other non-divisional units, the US Army's total casualty count for {{the battle was}} 3,390 <b>killed,</b> 9,326 wounded, 97 captured (9 of whom died in captivity) and 174 missing, adding up to 12,987 casualties.

5|$|Furthermore, a {{significant}} number of Serbs were <b>killed</b> by the Ustaše on the territory of the NDH during the war. According to Midlarsky, the number of Serbs <b>killed</b> by the regime was at least half a million, but the figure is contradicted by Bogoljub Kočović and Vladimir Žerjavić. Kočović estimated total number of Serbs <b>killed</b> throughout Yugoslav territory in various circumstances at 487,000, while Žerjavić put the figure at 530,000. Žerjavić indicated that 320,000 Serbs were <b>killed</b> in the NDH, including 82,000 <b>killed</b> among the Yugoslav Partisans, 23,000 <b>killed</b> as Axis collaborators, 25,000 victims of typhoid epidemic, 45,000 <b>killed</b> by Germans and 15,000 by Italians. Kočović's and Žerjavić's total Yugoslav losses are in agreement with estimates made by Mayers and Campbell of the United States Census Bureau. The number of Croats <b>killed</b> in the NDH is estimated to be approximately 200,000, either by the Croatian fascist regime, as members of the armed resistance, or as Axis collaborators. Several thousand of these were <b>killed</b> by the Chetniks; most Croatian historians place the number of Croats <b>killed</b> by the Chetniks on the territory of modern-day Croatia at between 3,000 and 3,500. Croatian estimates for the number of Croats <b>killed</b> by Chetniks in the whole of Yugoslavia range from 18,000 to 32,000 (both combatants and civilians).|$|E
