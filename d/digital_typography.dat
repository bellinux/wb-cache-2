40|$|As {{a hybrid}} of <b>typography</b> and <b>digital</b> animation, kinetic <b>typography</b> has arisen from two {{distinct}} histories. Studies of typography take for granted the fixed identity of the printed sign, whereas digital animation frequently features kineticism leading to transformation. It is perhaps {{for this reason that}} studies of kinetic typography do not offer adequate exploration of typographic forms that transform and change identity. Though texts on temporal typography offer thorough analysis of temporal typography that moves or is serially presented over time, these studies do not allow for examples such as MPC???s Channel 4 logos, in which pictorial objects transform into a numerical character, or the typographic animation of Komninos Zervos and Dan Waber, in which forms morph between alternative typographic poles. This article will propose that, in order to address the current lack of understanding of transforming type, it is necessary to look beyond the fields of <b>digital</b> animation and <b>typography,</b> to the holographic poetry of Eduardo Kac. Kac identifies, in his holopoetry, forms that escape ???constancy of meaning??? as they appear to transform between linguistic and pictorial poles. Kac???s terminology may be applied in the examination of ???fluid??? forms in temporal typography, leading {{to an understanding of the}} ways in which transformative behaviours differ from simple motion or elasticity...|$|R

25|$|By the mid-1970s, all of {{the major}} {{typeface}} technologies and all their fonts were in use: letterpress; continuous casting machines; phototypositors; computer-controlled phototypesetters; and the earliest digital typesetters – bulky machines with primitive processors and CRT outputs. From the mid-1980s, as <b>digital</b> <b>typography</b> has grown, users have almost universally adopted the American spelling font, which has come to primarily refer to a computer file containing scalable outline letterforms (digital font), in one of several common formats. Some typefaces, such as Verdana, are designed primarily for use on computer screens.|$|E

5000|$|Typography is {{the work}} of typesetters (also known as compositors), typographers, graphic designers, art directors, manga artists, comic book artists, {{graffiti}} artists, and, now, anyone who arranges words, letters, numbers, and symbols for publication, display, or distribution, from clerical workers and newsletter writers to anyone self-publishing materials. Until the <b>Digital</b> Age, <b>typography</b> was a specialized occupation. Digitization opened up typography to new generations of previously unrelated designers and lay users, and David Jury, head of graphic design at Colchester Institute in England, states that [...] "typography is now something everybody does." [...] As the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished. So at a time when scientific techniques can support the proven traditions (e.g., greater legibility with the use of serifs, upper and lower case, contrast, etc.) through understanding the limitations of human vision, typography as often encountered may fail to achieve its principal objective: effective communication.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} Alien Letter Forms, a software environment for letters {{to live in}} and evolve into larger texts. Alien Letter Forms builds on technical and conceptual approaches borrowed from research around artificial life systems to create a digital ecology in which text agents live, reproduce, evolve, mutate and die in response to their virtual environment. Individual letters are treated as autonomous agents, where contact between individuals produce offspring composed of new letter combinations {{up to and including}} whole words. Evolution is driven further by how well new combinations of letters fit into a set of pre-existing reference texts. The Alien Letter Forms environment is designed to produce a continuously evolving collection of letters that has local stabilities that produce readable text.

40|$|VFlib is a {{font library}} written in C which {{provides}} several functions for obtaining bitmaps of characters (i. e. a rasterizer). VFlib hides the font format of font files {{and provides a}} unified API for all supported font formats. Thus, programmers of application software need not worry about font file formats. Instead, any software using VFlib can support various font file formats immediately. In addition to this, when a new font format is supported by VFlib, application software need not be modified to use such new fonts. VFlib has been developed not only for Latin fonts but also Asian scripts such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Since it is designed as a general font module, {{it can be used}} in DVI drivers for T E X and L A T E X. In this paper we explain the API of VFlib, a font database file called vflibcap, and the internal structure of VFlib.

2500|$|When {{the first}} paper volume of Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming was {{published}} in 1968, it was typeset using hot metal typesetting set by a Monotype Corporation typecaster. This method, {{dating back to the}} 19th century, produced a [...] "good classic style" [...] appreciated by Knuth. When the second edition of the second volume was published, in 1976, the whole book had to be typeset again because the Monotype technology had been largely replaced by phototypesetting, and the original fonts were no longer available. When Knuth received the galley proofs of the new book on 30 March 1977, he found them awful. Around that time, Knuth saw {{for the first time the}} output of a high-quality digital typesetting system, and became interested in <b>digital</b> <b>typography.</b> The disappointing galley proofs gave him the final motivation to solve the problem at hand once and for all by designing his own typesetting system.

40|$|Typefaces [...] -commonly called 'fonts' [...] -are {{essential}} to a designer's ability to communicate visually. The {{end of the twentieth}} century was the age of the desktop computer, font design software and page layout programs and the new <b>digital</b> technology removed <b>typography</b> from the exclusive area of the specialist type designer, type foundry and typesetting company and placed it in the hands of graphic designers and non-specialists. This democratisation also led to an exponential growth in the number of typefaces available to users of type. This paper explores the extraordinary breadth evident in the intentions behind the design of a typeface; the reasons someone decides to create a new set of letterforms;and the associations and connotations which typefaces accrue as they are used by designers as components of visual culture. Reflecting the place of typefaces within a cultural and sociological context, it is the diversity of approaches and outcomes which are discussed in this paper. It addresses the cultural significance and meaning of typefaces by showing the role of personal interpretation and a search for appropriateness in the use of the vast resource of an estimated 100, 000 Western typefaces...|$|R
40|$|A {{coffee table}} book on {{computer}} applications? Well, yes, {{because it does}} deal largely with matters of graphic design in architecture, fashion and textiles, painting, and photography, {{but it also has}} items which might be of interest in its sections on <b>digital</b> publication, <b>typography,</b> and electronic communication in general. It also seeks to discuss the way in which these applications may force us {{to change the way we}} think. Robin Baker writes in an unfortunately stiff and abstract manner about the impact computer programmes have had on the world of art and design, but the graphic images and extended picture captions help to keep the reader awake - even though the main text sometimes disappears for two or three double page spreads on end. There are also smatterings of pretentious art-world-speak about'solving certain spatial problems'(in the design of curtain fabrics or teapots) and the introduction (inevitable?) of new jargon:'shape grammar'(a list of so-called shape'rules'),'repurposing'(putting somebody else's work to new use) and'genetic algorithms'(sculptural designs based on re-processed organic shapes - most of which look like stomach tumours). In his favour, Baker very generously credits students and commercial designers who have produced the effects he describes and illustrates so well. For writers, he sketches in the possibilities of Hypertext and Hypermedia and points to the future of Hyper publishing which he (and Rupert Murdoch) believes will be with us before the end of the century. He seems to have a good oversight of what is possible and practicable - though one wonders how up-to-date the view is when his book may have begun its life anything up to three years ago. He usefully points out that much new technology exists in or drags along with it the forms of earlier periods - so that in an age of electronic communication we still have printed books as a dominant cultural form. Maybe this is as it should be - but Baker makes a persuasive case for the claim that All This is Going to Change. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some of {{the underlying}} poetries of page and material media, within our collaborative project Poetry of Unknown Words, using process notes to consider material affects. As makers, it is the ‘stuff’ of our practice to be curious and open to what a poetic text could be and {{how it should be}} formed. Our interest comes from doing and making – choices of technologies, texts, cuts and pastes, plagiarism or quotation, taking a position that includes ambiguity and mistake. In this work we appropriate the format of Iliazd’s Poésie de mots inconnus (published Paris, Le Degré 41, 1949) using sheets of paper with the fold/pli as a work in movement that is read. We pay particular attention to means of production (<b>digital,</b> letterpress, experimental <b>typography</b> and hand made mark) reworking the poetics of ‘thingness’ and ‘text’. It is unbound, unnumbered - a changing set of connections or readings across sheets. Poetry of Unknown Words is a series of ‘transcriptions’ referencing extant works by women writers and makers. Our sense of 'unknown' addresses the library, archive and feminist notions of hidden from history creating new texts. In exposing our process in this paper, we address ways in which emotion exits within our choices – the lyric of manure notes from Sissinghurst, the reconfiguring of Constance Spry’s floral prose, etcetera...|$|R
