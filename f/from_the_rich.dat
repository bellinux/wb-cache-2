5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda {{was adapted}} from a lenong (a Betawi oral {{tradition}} similar to a stage play) popular with ethnic Chinese and native audiences of the time. The Ronda stories follow the Betawi bandit of the same name, who is skilled at silat (traditional martial arts) and reputed to take <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> {{to give to the}} poor. The Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because of its potential action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.|$|E

5|$|The Monkland Canal was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of the 18th century initially to transport coal to Glasgow <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> local deposits.

The new advances meant that iron could be produced with two thirds less fuel. Summerlee Iron Works was one of the first iron works to use this technology. By the mid 19th century there were numerous hot blast furnaces in operation in Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} motions to glorify Vasil Levski as a saint of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. However, {{historian}} Stefan Chureshki has emphasised that while Levski's post-monastical life {{was one of}} a martyr, it was incompatible with the Orthodox concept of sainthood. Chureshki makes reference to Levski's correspondences, which show that Levski threatened wealthy Bulgarians (чорбаджии, chorbadzhii) and traitors with death, endorsed theft <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> for pragmatic revolutionary purposes and voluntarily gave up his religious office to devote himself to the secular struggle for liberation.|$|E

Determining whether oat consumption is safe is critical because people with poorly controlled celiac disease may develop multiple severe health complications, including cancers.|$|E
