5|$|The {{walls were}} largely {{maintained}} intact <b>during</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman period, until sections {{began to be}} dismantled in the 19th century, as the city outgrew its medieval boundaries.

5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. <b>During</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

5|$|British {{businessman}} Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham <b>during</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s, {{and later}} became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the 2010 Formula One season using the Brabham name.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, {{the penny}} {{was a small}} silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic {{shortage}} of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E

By the 12th century, however, the influence of France and the various military orders was encouraging the development of square keeps in Christian castles across the region, and by {{the second half of}} the century this practice was spread across into the Islamic kingdoms.|$|E

5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area <b>during</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at higher elevations until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
