5|$|Sergei Kirov, {{head of the}} Party {{organisation}} in Leningrad, {{was killed}} in 1934; some believed Stalin ordered his death. Kirov's death triggered a second crisis, the Great Purge. In 1938, out of the 28 People's Commissars in Molotov's Government, 20 were executed on the orders of Molotov and Stalin. The purges were carried out by Stalin's successive police chiefs, Nikolai Yezhov was the chief organiser and Kliment Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich and Molotov were <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> in the processes. Stalin frequently required Molotov and other Politburo members to sign the death warrants of prominent purge victims, and Molotov always did so without question.|$|E
5|$|The German-speaking {{scientists}} who isolated and described vitaminK (in addition to naming it as such) {{did so because}} the vitamin is <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> in the coagulation of blood following wounding (from the German word Koagulation). At the time, most (but not all) of the letters from F through to J were already designated, so {{the use of the}} letter K was considered quite reasonable. The table nomenclature of reclassified vitamins lists chemicals that had previously been classified as vitamins, as well as the earlier names of vitamins that later became part of the B-complex.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi regime {{promoted}} a liberal {{code of conduct}} regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock. Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> with several women simultaneously. The same {{was the case for}} married women, who liaised with soldiers, civilians or slave labourers. For example, sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain better work from a foreign labourer. Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.|$|E

5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E
5|$|The King lent {{support to}} Fisher, {{in part because}} he disliked Beresford, and {{eventually}} Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained. The King was <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, who had retired in 1907. Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} the cabal's formation, the other team members started {{detailed}} game development, and within another month, began playtesting through Sierra. The cabal were <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting, as to take the player's feedback, including any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzle, into action items to be fixed on the next iteration of a game. Later, {{with most of the}} main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions which they then collected and interpreted statistically to further fine-tune levels. Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for Half-Lifes success, and was reused for Team Fortress 2 from the start.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{metastasis}} of cancers <b>intimately</b> <b>involve</b> the vasculature {{and in particular}} the endothelial cell layer. Tumours require new blood vessel formation via angiogenesis to support growth. In addition, inflammation, coagulation, and platelet activation are common signals in the growth and metastasis of tumour cells. The endothelium plays {{a central role in the}} homeostatic control of inflammatory cell recruitment, regulating platelet activation and coagulation pathways. PPAR, -/, and - are all expressed in endothelial cells. This review will discuss the roles of PPARs in endothelial cells in relation to angiogenesis, inflammation, coagulation, and platelet control pathways.

40|$|This report {{looks at}} pension reform {{recently}} undertaken in Poland, but draws conclusions with wider applicability. It examines {{the motivation for}} reform, the struggle of progressively minded experts and politicians to advance the reform agenda, {{the architecture of the}} new system, and issues arising during the transition. The final section offers tentative conclusions and lessons for other countries while highlighting the factors leading to the reform's successful launch (it is too early yet to determine the pension system's success). Factors included enlisting broad popular support for the contents of the reform package; shielding the office for pension reform from political fights, enabling it to focus on its professional tasks; <b>intimately</b> <b>involving</b> the trade unions through several consultations; and lastly, moving quickly to grasp opportunities, that is, taking advantage of the public consensus for pension reform.

40|$|A {{particular}} {{strength of}} agile approaches {{is that they}} move away from ‘introverted’ development and <b>intimately</b> <b>involve</b> the customer {{in all areas of}} development, supposedly leading {{to the development of a}} more innovative and hence more valuable information system. However, we argue that a single customer representative is too narrow a focus to adopt and that involvement of stakeholders beyond the software development itself is still often quite weak and in some cases non-existent. In response, we argue that current thinking regarding innovation in agile development needs to be extended to include multiple stakeholders outside the business unit. This paper explores the intra-organisational applicability and implications of open innovation in agile systems development. Additionally, it argues for a different perspective of project management that includes collaboration and knowledge-sharing with other business units, customers, partners, and other relevant stakeholders pertinent to the business success of an organisation, thus embracing open innovation principles...|$|R
40|$|Around {{the world}} young {{children}} are taught that they must attend school to learn and to procure an education that {{will prove to be}} beneficial to them later in life. This contrasts with Dewey’s precept that for children to absorb what they were acquiring they must have experienced it. Experience per Dewey (1997) <b>intimately</b> <b>involves</b> interaction and continuity. There is limited research into how children understand of why they go to school and how they conceptualize learning. Through this phenomenological research study the researcher hopes to ascertain how {{children between the ages of}} five and eight years old construct their beliefs on schooling, their understanding of it, and their characterizations of learning. Semi-structured interviews were used to guide the participants as they create a visual representation of their best learning experiences. Participants were recruited from a private pre-k - 5 th grade school localized in Miami Lakes, Florida.

40|$|A crucial goal in post-genomic {{research}} is unravelling the regulatory network of transcription factors and their target genes. This {{is especially important}} in the human genome where many TFs are involved in disease progression. Similarly to our previous work in the yeast genome, machine learning methods {{can be applied to}} known examples of target genes to create decision rules that aid in the identification of new targets. Using targets in publicly available databases as training examples, classifiers have been built and tested for 153 human TFs. These classifiers base their decisions upon the integration of three types of sequence information: composition, conservation, and overrepresentation. Overall, 33 TF classifiers achieve a precision greater than 60 %. Many high confidence predictions are made for all TFs, and all targets are made available for download on our web server and as supplementary information. To highlight the power of this method we briefly discuss the regulator Oct 4, a known marker for stem cells. Results for the TF Wt 1 are then discussed in detail, showing that many of the predictions share functions with the known targets. Since Wt 1 and its targets are <b>intimately</b> <b>involve...</b>|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the nationwide production of Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics graduates qualified for employment in the aerospace enterprise is insufficient to meet current and future demand. A unique program at the Space Science and Engineering Laboratory (SSEL) at Montana State University (MSU) has been training {{a new generation of}} engineers and scientists through direct hands-on immersion in small satellite design and development. This program jump-starts the college to workplace transition by <b>intimately</b> <b>involving</b> undergraduate (and graduate) students in the hands-on design, development, test, and flight and operations of space flight systems.

40|$|Objective - Fibrosis is {{believed}} to occur through normal tissue remodeling failing to terminate. Tissue repair <b>intimately</b> <b>involves</b> the ability of fibroblasts to contract extracellular matrix (ECM), and enhanced ECM contraction is a hallmark of fibrotic cells in various conditions, including scleroderma. Some fibrogenic transcriptional responses to transforming growth factor ? (TGF?), including -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) expression and ECM contraction, require focal adhesion kinase/Src (FAK/Src). The present study was undertaken to assess whether TGF?-activated kinase 1 (TAK 1) acts downstream of FAK/Src to mediate fibrogenic responses in fibroblasts. Methods - We used microarray, real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and collagen gel contraction assays to assess the ability of wild-type and TAK 1 -knockout fibroblasts to respond to TGF? 1. Results - The ability of TGF to induce TAK 1 was blocked by the FAK/Src inhibitor PP 2. JNK phosphorylation in response to TGF? 1 was impaired {{in the absence of}} TAK 1. TGF? could not induce matrix contraction or expression of a group of fibrotic genes, including -SMA, in the absence of TAK 1. Conclusion - These results suggest that TAK 1 operates downstream of FAK/Src in mediating fibrogenic responses and that targeting of TAK 1 may be a viable antifibrotic strategy in the treatment of certain disorders, including scleroderma. ...|$|R
40|$|Membrane fusion is {{a process}} that <b>intimately</b> <b>involves</b> both {{proteins}} and lipids. Although the SNARE proteins, which ultimately overcome the energy barrier for fusion, have been extensively studied, regulation of the energy barrier itself, determined by specific membrane lipids, has been largely overlooked. Our findings reveal a novel function for SNARE proteins in reducing the energy barrier for fusion, by directly binding and sequestering fusogenic lipids to sites of fusion. We demonstrate a specific interaction between Syntaxin 1 A and the fusogenic lipid phosphatidic acid, in addition to multiple polyphosphoinositide lipids, and define a polybasic juxtamembrane region within Syntaxin 1 A as its lipid-binding domain. In PC- 12 cells, Syntaxin 1 A mutations that progressively reduced lipid binding resulted in a progressive reduction in evoked secretion. Moreover, amperometric analysis of fusion events driven by a lipid-binding–deficient Syntaxin 1 A mutant (5 RK/A) demonstrated alterations in fusion pore dynamics, suggestive of an energetic defect in secretion. Overexpression of the phosphatidic acid–generating enzyme, phospholipase D 1, completely rescued the secretory defect seen with the 5 RK/A mutant. Moreover, knockdown of phospholipase D 1 activity drastically reduced control secretion, while leaving 5 RK/A-mediated secretion relatively unaffected. Altogether, these data suggest that Syntaxin 1 A–lipid interactions are a critical determinant of the energetics of SNARE-catalyzed fusion events...|$|R
40|$|Asf 1 is a conserved histone H 3 /H 4 {{chaperone}} {{that can}} assemble and disassemble nucleosomes and promote histone acetylation. Set 2 is an H 3 K 36 methyltransferase. The functions of these proteins intersect {{in the context}} of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II: both contribute to the establishment of repressive chromatin structures that inhibit spurious intragenic transcription. Here we characterize further interactions between budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Asf 1 and Set 2 using assays of intragenic transcription, H 3 /H 4 posttranslational modification, coding region cross-linking of Asf 1 and Set 2, and cooccurrence of Asf 1 and Set 2 in protein complexes. We find that at some genes Asf 1 and Set 2 control chromatin metabolism as components of separate pathways. However, the existence of a low-abundance complex containing both proteins suggests that Asf 1 and Set 2 can more directly collaborate in chromatin regulation. Consistent with this possibility, we show that Asf 1 stimulates Set 2 occupancy of the coding region of a highly transcribed gene by a mechanism that depends on Asf 1 binding to H 3 /H 4. This function of Asf 1 promotes the switch from di- to trimethylation of H 3 K 36 at that gene. These results support the view that Set 2 function in chromatin metabolism can <b>intimately</b> <b>involve</b> histone chaperone Asf 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between tectonic environment and human activity {{has a long}} history that <b>intimately</b> <b>involves</b> the Ancient Near East and Levant. Texts from the third millennium onward attest to earthquake imagery while records of actual earthquakes cluster in two periods in the Middle and Neo-Assyrian periods. The research first examines the {{relationship between}} the tectonic environment and earthquake imagery that is found amidst Storm-god imagery. Next, close attention is paid to the textual and archaeoseismic evaluation of earthquakes recorded in Middle and Neo-Assyrian texts {{and the extent to which}} historical information from these texts can inform a reconstruction of the earthquake's effects. Within the Levant, a detailed archaeoseismic evaluation of Iron IIB sites with purported mid-eighth century seismic damage suggests better methodological controls are needed to identify seismic damage in the archaeological record. A number of interdisciplinary approaches, including post-disaster housing, earthquake eyewitness accounts, and gender and vulnerability studies are applied to Amos in order to provide a fresh perspective on identifying earthquake imagery within the book. These approaches help reconstruct the socioeconomic, political, and religious effects of the earthquake mentioned in Amos and illustrate how his oracles and prophetic validity would have been authenticated through the earthquake. These approaches also shed new light on "social justice" texts within Amos and how the aftermath of an earthquake would have underscored, anew, the gap between the rich and poor...|$|R
