50|$|In 1910 {{he began}} {{teaching}} at the technical high school in Delft. He became Director of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines</b> (DSM).|$|E
5000|$|DSM {{was formed}} by the Dutch State in 1902 to [...] in {{southern}} Limburg and although the company had diversified into commodity chemicals and petrochemicals by 1973 when the last mine closed, DSM retains a link to its origins by continuing to use the initials of the original ‘Nederlandse Staatsmijnen’ (<b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines)</b> to this day.|$|E
50|$|The Staatsmijn Wilhelmina was {{the first}} and the {{smallest}} of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> owned <b>mines.</b> It produced coal for domestic use, as its near neighbours, the Laura Mine, Oranje Nassau II, Willem-Sophia, and Domaniale Mijn.|$|R

50|$|On 30 June 1818 King William I of the Netherlands and Prince Frederik {{visited the}} orrery. King William I bought the orrery for the <b>Dutch</b> <b>state.</b> In 1859 the orrery was {{donated by the}} <b>Dutch</b> <b>state</b> {{to the city of}} Franeker.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959 (some {{sources say}} 1962), Bestbox started making simple diecast cars in Limburg {{province}} (Bickford 2009). The Dutch Wiki site reports {{that in the}} 1960s, the coal mines in Limburg closed. Some significant post-mining industries where workers relocated were automobile producers DAF and Nedcar in Born. After the closure, [...] DSM (The <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines)</b> tried providing new employment to out-of-work or disabled miners in different shops or factories. These 'WIM' workshops (Workshop for Disabled Miners) were backed by a national Fund for Social Institutions (FSI).|$|E
50|$|Visman studied mining {{engineering}} at the Delft University of Technology, and was employed at the <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines</b> during the Second World War. He surfaced after the war with a massive amount of test results determined in samples selected from heterogeneous sampling units of coal. In fact, he had gathered so much valuable information that he was encouraged to write a PhD thesis on the sampling of coal. Jan Visman defended his PhD thesis titled “De Monsterneming van Heterogene Binomiale Korrelmengsels, in het Bijzonder Steenkool” at the Technical University of Delft on December 17, 1947.|$|E
50|$|From its {{inception}} in 1947 until 2009 Stamicarbon was a subsidiary of DSM (formerly <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines).</b> In 2009 it was sold to Maire Tecnimont. DSM created Stamicarbon {{for the purpose of}} managing its patent portfolio and licensing its technology. In 1947 DSM was primarily a coal mining company and initially Stamicarbon was responsible for selling coal preparation plant technology. The company’s name reflects its origin: ‘Stami’ (from ‘State Mines’) and ‘carbon’(coal). In the succeeding years, reflecting the progressive shift of DSM’s activities from coal mining to chemicals derived from coal and, later, from natural gas, Stamicarbon’s technology portfolio grew to include a number of other products, including urea and the urea derivative melamine, caprolactam, polyethylene, phenol, and EPDM rubber.|$|E

50|$|He {{began work}} {{into the design}} of cooling towers. Previously, designs of cooling towers were more-or-less the same as chimneys, in {{octagonal}} planform. On 12 February 1915, the <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines</b> decided {{to build a new}} concrete cooling tower. This led to his work producing the hyperboloid design of cooling towers at the Staatsmijn Emma in 1918; the towers were demolished on 26 June 1985. This design of cooling towers was the world's first, and nearly all cooling towers now follow this hyperboloid design, with concrete structure. On 16 August 1916, he took out the UK patent (108,863) for Improved Construction of Cooling Towers of Reinforced Concrete; the patent was filed on 9 August 1917, and published on 11 April 1918.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} works, {{owned by}} Nypro UK (a {{joint venture between}} <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines</b> (DSM) and the British National Coal Board (NCB)) had originally produced fertiliser from by-products of the coke ovens of a nearby steelworks. Since 1967, it had instead produced caprolactam, a chemical used {{in the manufacture of}} nylon 6. The caprolactam was produced from cyclohexanone. This was originally produced by hydrogenation of phenol, but in 1972 additional capacity was added built to a DSM design in which hot liquid cyclohexane was partially oxidised by compressed air. The plant was intended to produce 70,000 tpa (tons per annum) of caprolactam but was reaching a rate of only 47,000 tpa in early 1974. Government controls on the price of caprolactam put further financial pressure on the plant.|$|E
50|$|Separating, sorting, and jig {{technology}} {{continued to}} {{advance in the}} 20th century. The first compressed air sorter for fine coal (pea and smaller) was installed in the U.S. in 1916. Major innovations in the pneumatic cleaning of coal were made in 1924, 1932, and 1941. In 1935, the first dense-media separator was introduced. In these wet separators, a very dense medium (such as magnetite) is introduced into an agitated mixture of coal and water. The dense media drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, sending water and the lighter material (such as coal) over the top for collection and drying. The first coal processing plant to utilize dense-medium separation widely was established by <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines</b> in 1945, and by 1950 the technology was in wide use in the U.S.|$|E

50|$|When, at {{the start}} of World War II Shell stopped {{employing}} new scientists, soon Professor Waterman, who was a Jew, was forced to retire from Shell. Yet he managed to help Dirk van Krevelen to obtain a research position in the newly created Central Laboratory of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines</b> (DSM) starting from 1940. The Central Laboratory was headed by Gerrit Berkhoff. van Krevelen began his research activities in DSM’s physical chemistry department. In 1943, van Krevelen became a department manager, as head of the newly created research department on chemical engineering. In 1948, he was promoted to the position of research leader of the Central Laboratory of DSM, a position where he was responsible for directing the research activities. In 1955, van Krevelen became head of the Central Laboratory.|$|E
50|$|In 1929 Berkhoff {{started his}} career as a {{research}} chemist at DSM (<b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines).</b> During the nineteen thirties, he supervised the development of fertilizers for the Nitrogen Fixation Plant (Stikstofbindings Bedrijf (SBB)). His publications on the crystallisation of ammonium nitrate date from this period. His visionary and social talents led to the changing from incremental research (responding to the competition) to innovative research (taking the initiative). This resulted in 1940 in the foundation of the Central Laboratory (Centraal Laboratorium (CL)), of which he became Director. His journeys to the USA, immediately after WW2, meant to look at diversification options, enabled DSM to start the production of caprolactam, the raw material needed for the enkalon or nylon 6 textile fibre of the AKU, now part of AkzoNobel. Until his departure in 1961, he was CEO of all DSM's Research and Development Divisions, which under his supervision became highly successful.|$|E
50|$|The Juliana Canal was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and 1930s, and opened in 1935. It was important {{for the development of}} coal mining in southern Limburg (terminated in the 1970s), since it is suited for larger ships than the older Zuid-Willemsvaart, which runs from 's-Hertogenbosch to Maastricht, partly through Belgium. The Juliana Canal runs parallel to the Meuse, at maximum 3 km east of the river. Between Maasbracht and Maastricht, the canal gains approximately 25 m of elevation. There are locks at Limmel (near Maastricht), Born, and Maasbracht. Until 1965, there used to be another lock near Roosteren. When the locks of Born and Maasbracht were modernized, these became unnecessary and were destroyed. There are ports at Maastricht, Stein, Born and Maasbracht. The port at Stein used to be the second large inland port in Europe, after Duisburg in Germany. This was because of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines.</b> All the coal mines the Netherlands had were in this area. Today, DSM still owns a part of the port.|$|E

5000|$|In 1953, a new {{shop was}} opened across the Bongerd, the Markthal (Market Hall), which {{was of a}} {{different}} type, with selfservice, a new phenomenon, and with bargain prices. In 1954 a new branch was opened in nearby Geleen (at the Rijksweg), the future industrial centre of the region when the <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines</b> (DSM) moved there as a petrochemical industry. Expansion reached even further, with the firm buying clothes shop chain Wassen, with three shops in the Holland region (Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam) and in 1948 Peter's oldest son Pierre had started a clothes factory on the Caribbean island Bonaire (see under 'Spin-offs' below). But the biggest change took place in Heerlen. In 1964 the main store moved to another, huge, building at the newly established Promenade (see next section). The Glaspaleis became specialised in interior decoration textiles. In the process the entrances were improved and the lifts renovated. It was kept in use by Schunck for a few years, but then rented out to the ABP state pension fund, that needed a temporary housing until its own was completed. In 1973, the Glaspaleis was sold. For details on how the Glaspaleis fared after that see Glaspaleis - Decay and Renovation. In the previous 2 decades, Schunck had already boughtseveral houses around the Glaspaleis because it was growing much {{too small for the}} amount of business it saw. To the South, at the Emmaplein, connecting to the Glaspaleis (though the old shop) and housing the administration in a former bank. To the East, former Hotel Cloot, where Arnold Schunck stayed when he decided to set up shop in Heerlen, and which now housed Schunck's baby shop. Schunck had bought these to expand around the Glaspaleis because. But the City had plans to start a shopping centre to the West, at the new Promenade and convinced Schunck to build there instead. And finally to the North, two more former hotels had been bought and renovated, first the former Limburgia Hotel, at {{the opposite side of the}} Bongerd, and then the former Neerlandia Hotel at the Saroleastraat, which now housed the 'Market Halls'. At the Limburgia Hotel, a shop had been opened for mattresses and blankets. This merchandise was now moved to the Glaspaleis. This freed it up for renovation, merging it with the Market Hall, which would be turned into a self-service discount textile shop.|$|E
40|$|Before World War II, <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines,</b> the national, {{state owned}} coal corporation, {{was confronted with}} major challenges, {{specifically}} that foreign coal was sold at dumping prices in the home market. At the same time, coal cleaning needed to be improved in order to offer higher quality coal against lower coal processing costs. In this paper we illustrate how State Mines relied on its innovative capacity in order to overcome the economic, technological and market changes. The coal cleaning innovations at State Mines show how absorptive capacity was of prime importance for the firm's innovative capacity. External knowledge acquisition as well as internal knowledge building proved to be relevant, although the balance changed over time. While initially acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge (potential absorptive capacity) were essential to improve the existing coal cleaning processes, internal knowledge building was needed to come to real improvements in coal cleaning. The establishment of a licensing company was essential to exploit this knowledge. An important feature was that State Mines was always well aware of its lack of capabilities and knowledge and open to search for and learn from knowledge outside its firm boundaries. Moreover, expectations determined the search for external knowledge. innovation, knowledge, absorptive capacity, expectations, <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines,</b> coal cleaning, hydrocyclone, Tromp system, loess washing system, Barvoys system,...|$|E
40|$|In November 1945 the {{recovery}} of Maria Geene in Delft's Bethel Hospital signaled {{the success of the}} secret wartime research on penicillin at NV Nederlandsche Gist- en Spiritusfabriek (NG&SF) in Delft, the Netherlands. Fifty years later, Gist-Brocades, of which NG&SF was the forerunner, had become one of the world's largest producers of bulk penicillin. By the year 2005, GistBrocades was part of <b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines</b> and market forces required that all production of penicillin in Delft stop. While the historiography of the Netherlands during its years of occupation is well documented, little has been recorded of the wartime research with penicillin at NG&SF. Also, little has been documented of NG&SF's determination, {{at the end of the}} war, to continue penicillin production, a time when the whole of the Netherlands required reconstruction. By 1950 the continued success ofNG&SF was highlighted by the gift of the predicate Koninklijke (Royal). It is known that it was information on the success of Allied penicillin that stimulated the wartime research ofNG&SF. This thesis, therefore, begins with a general history of penicillin production in Britain, the United States and Canada. This is offset by the unsuccessful experiences of France, Germany and Japan. For the Netherlands, Nazi occupation meant that, from May 1940, the whole country was cut off from the outside world. In fact, this occupation occurred three months before Florey and his associates first published on penicillin in Lancet. Also, from 1943 there was an Allied embargo on publications regarding penicillin. How, therefore, did knowledge of Allied penicillin reach the Netherlands? Was NG&SF the only Dutch company interested in penicillin? Why were they successful? How, at the end of the war, could NG&SF consider financing such a new venture? It is the remit of this thesis to bring these questions to the fore...|$|E

40|$|Dense medium {{cyclones}} {{are used}} {{extensively in the}} mineral processing industry to beneficiate various minerals including coal, diamonds and iron ore, amongst others. According to Reeves (2002),. the cyclone has been installed in over one-quarter of the coal preparation plants worldwide [...] Dense medium cyclones {{have the ability to}} achieve high capacities, and simultaneously obtain sharp separations and high separation efficiencies. However, this piece of equipment does have a shortcoming in that its capacity is constrained by the solids carrying capacity of the spigot. This is termed the spigot capacity. There is uncertainty on whether the spigot capacities specified by DSM (<b>Dutch</b> <b>State</b> <b>Mines),</b> the original developers of the dense medium cyclone, can be increased or not, and how these capacities were determined. The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish a methodology to determine the spigot capacities of dense medium cyclones, and determine the parameters that influence these capacities. In order to illustrate the significance of increasing the capacity of dense medium cyclones, the following coal example is used: In 2005, South Africa produced about 245 Mt of coal valued at R 35. 86 billion. A significant proportion of this coal is beneficiated through dense medium cyclones. Therefore, an increase in the cyclone capacity, even if relatively small, represents a large number in terms of tonnages of coal produced or monetary gains. It has been established clearly in this investigation that the maximum spigot capacity is reached at the onset of roping. A critical sinks ore concentration at which spigot overloading occurs has been observed. The simplest and best indicator of possible spigot overloading has been established to be the sinks ore concentration, measurement of this parameter could, however, prove challenging on most industrial cyclones. Further, spigot overloading of a dense medium cyclone can be detected visually by observing the discharge type at the sinks and monitoring particle misplacement to the floats stream. A regression model that quantifies the spigot capacity, in terms of ore and slurry, has been developed. Various parameters were considered in the model, these include: cyclone geometry, feed head, medium density, and medium grade. Parameters that influence the spigot capacity of dense medium cyclones have been established, and their effect on the spigot capacity has been quantified. The spigot capacity values obtained in this investigation were compared with those specified by DSM, and it was concluded that there is large potential to increase the. spigot capacities. specified by DSM.
