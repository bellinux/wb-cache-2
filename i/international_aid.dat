5|$|Because {{there were}} no deaths and only 65 people had been {{directly}} affected by Cyclone Daman, the Fijian government, {{with the help of}} the Red Cross, decided not to request any <b>International</b> <b>Aid</b> or any external assistance. The Fijian Government, on January 15, 2008, allocated $530,000 2008FJD for the relief and rehabilitation programme of Cikobia. By August 2008, all work rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone Daman had been completed.|$|E

5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E

40|$|<b>International</b> {{development}} <b>aid</b> {{is part of}} {{a complex}} system where multiple organisations are providing aid over multiple issues through multiple relationships, driven by multiple motivations. There are so many intertwined factors playing important roles in this system that it makes the study of it very difficult, as it will be impossible to capture all the factors or describe them accurately in any model. Due to its importance in <b>international</b> development <b>aid</b> and data availability, this chapter focuses on Official Development Assistance (ODA) for the first instance and here the author explores further the definition of ODA. The chapter discusses four features of the complex system of <b>international</b> development <b>aid</b> that demonstrates the characteristics of a complex system. There are many sources of the complexity in the <b>international</b> development <b>aid</b> system. The chapter examines four such sources: organizations, topics/issues, data and research methods...|$|R

5|$|Recovery {{efforts were}} {{extensive}} following the storm's passage. The Government of India allocated ₹3 billion (US$69.3 million) to the Odishan state government, supplementing earlier contributions made towards {{relief from the}} earlier cyclone. Various branches of the Indian Armed Forces were dispatched to aid the recovery efforts. Contributions from foreign governments amounted to nearly US$13million, with a majority allocated by the United States. Alongside foreign and domestic government contributions, between 12–14 <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> agencies concurrently participated in relief efforts in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at St Gallen University credit rating {{agencies}} have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their judgments, on average rating Portugal, Ireland, and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek <b>international</b> <b>aid.</b> On a side note: as of end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Although the South Korean {{government}} did not request <b>international</b> <b>aid,</b> several countries sent aid to the country.

5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the governor of Nueva Ecija requested then-Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to declare his province a disaster area. Additionally, UNICEF was asked to provide water-purifying tablets. The Philippine Red Cross, Philippine government, local authorities and civic organizations provided relief assistance {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the storm. Despite private appeals for up to $1.4million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for <b>international</b> <b>aid.</b> However, by October 25, eight non-government relief agencies provided relief, which totaled $1.15million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061worth of aid.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, a special mobile force was {{dispatched}} by officials to assist in relief operations. Red Cross distribution centers were set up on Mauritius and served food and clothing to more than 500 by January 25. Despite the severity of damage, government officials declined to appeal for <b>international</b> <b>aid.</b> Although no requests for aid were made, the Government of Norway provided US$10,000 worth of funds to the nation. Owing to the effects of Cyclone Dina and several other meteorological factors, the economy of Mauritius suffered significantly in 2002 as a whole. Annual growth dropped to about 1.9 percent from approximately 5 percent in 2001. The sugarcane industry suffered greatly from the storm, experiencing a 19.3 percent decrease.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{increased to}} about 20,000 as Serb refugees {{from other parts}} of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities. They initially lived without water or electricity, in damaged buildings patched up with plastic sheeting and wooden boards. Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves. The main sources of income were war profiteering and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia's revived oil industry. Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of <b>international</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several countries along its path, Waka left {{the most significant}} losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, {{and much of the}} nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185km/h (115mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every tree on the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population {{due to the lack of}} fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33years.|$|E
5|$|Despite growing {{protests and}} the {{increasing}} death toll, President Zedillo did not initially request for <b>international</b> <b>aid,</b> believing that the country had the necessary resources, although by October15 he changed his position. The office of Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan issued a statement of condolences to those affected by the tragedy. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) donated $100,000 on October13. The European Commission approved €1million (1999euros) in aid to be distributed through the German and Spanish Red Cross agencies.

The American Red Cross donated about $100,000 to its Mexican counterpart. Direct Relief International sent two loads of medicine and blankets to Oaxaca. Adventist Development and Relief Agency provided food for about 25,000people.|$|E
5|$|Following the cyclone's passage, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began {{dispatching}} relief teams, food, {{and other}} supplies to impacted areas. The Bangladesh Army and non-governmental organizations participated in both air- and water-borne relief operations, though inclement weather initially forced the suspension of several planned helicopter flights. Both the Bangladesh Navy and Indian Navy convened in the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal {{to search for the}} thousands of fishermen and islanders that went missing during the tropical cyclone's landfall. Due to the wide scope of the disaster, the Bangladeshi government appealed for <b>international</b> <b>aid,</b> particularly from Japan and Canada as those countries had played large roles in the relief efforts of past Bangladeshi disasters. The Government of the Netherlands donated US$370,000for use in the relief efforts following the storm. Lord Glenarthur, then British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, toured effected areas in Bangladesh for three days before announcing a ₤200,000grant (US$370,000) to voluntary relief agencies assisting in cyclone relief operations. Then-Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad also visited the worst impacted districts, including Khulna and Bagerhat. Following these visits, Ershad's administration established a national disaster committee composed of relief specialists to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts.|$|E
