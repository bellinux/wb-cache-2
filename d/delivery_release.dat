40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} an {{integrated}} production and outbound distribution scheduling model with one manufacturer and one customer. The manufacturer has to process {{a set of}} jobs on a single machine and deliver them in batches to the customer. Each job has a release date and a delivery deadline. The objective {{of the problem is}} to issue a feasible integrated production and distribution schedule minimizing the transportation cost subject to the delivery deadline constraints. We consider three problems with different ways how a job can be produced and delivered: non-splittable production and delivery (NSP-NSD) problem, splittable production and non-splittable delivery (SP-NSD) problem and splittable production and delivery (SP-SD) problem. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that solves two special cases of SP-NSD and SP-SD problems. Solving these problems allows us to compute a lower bound for the NP-hard problem NSP-NSD, which we use in a branch and bound (B&B) algorithm to solve problem NSP-NSD. The computational results show that the B&B algorithm outperforms a MILP formulation of the problem implemented on a commercial solver. keywords: single machine scheduling production and <b>delivery</b> <b>release</b> dates deadlines transportation costs branch and bound...|$|E

30|$|PAMAM (polyamidoamine) and PPI (polypropylene imine) dendrimers {{are known}} to be ion- or pH- {{responsive}} in an aqueous environment, due to the charge repulsion of the multiple amine groups [53, 87, 88]. Biocompatible acetylated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers were used for drug delivery, with dexamethasone 21 -phosphate (Dp 21) as the model drug [89]. Cationic (non-acetylated) and acetylated (acetylation is a convenient strategy to neutralize the peripheral amine group) dendrimers exhibited different pH-dependent micellization, complexation, and encapsulation behaviour. The acetylated dendrimer encapsulated the Dp 21 under acidic conditions (pH =  3.0), while the cationic dendrimer encapsulated the drug under both acidic (pH =  3 and pH =  5.0) and neutral conditions (pH =  7.4). In addition, pH-responsive release was different for an acetylated- and a non-acetylated dendritic matrix. Non-acetylated dendrimers showed a much slower release rate than acetylated dendrimers under conditions of lower pH and a much faster release rate from non-acetylated dendrimer as pH values decreased. Degradable 1, 3, 5 -triazaadamantane (TAA) dendrimers were able to be triggered by the addition of HCl [90]. TAAs units are stable under basic conditions but hydrolyze rapidly under acidic conditions to yield basic by-products [tris(amino-methyl)-ethane].

40|$|A novel {{budesonide}} (BUD) colon <b>delivery</b> <b>release</b> {{system was}} developed by using a natural polysaccharide, guar gum. The rigidity of the microspheres was induced by a chemical cross-linking method utilizing glutaraldehyde as the cross-linker. The mean particle size of the microspheres prepared {{was found to be}} 15. 21 ± 1. 32 µm. The drug loading and entrapment efficiency of the formulation were 17. 78 % ± 2. 31 % and 81. 6 % ± 5. 42 %, respectively. The microspheres were spherical in shape with a smooth surface, and the size was uniform. The in vitro release profiles indicated that the release of BUD from the microspheres exhibited a sustained release behavior. The model that fitted best for BUD released from the microspheres was the Higuchi kinetic model with a correlation coefficient r = 0. 9993. A similar phenomenon was also observed in a pharmacokinetic study. The prolongation of the half-life (t 1 / 2), enhanced residence time (mean residence time, MRT) and decreased total clearance (CL) indicated that BUD microspheres could prolong the acting time of BUD in vivo. In addition, BUD guar gum microspheres are thought to have the potential to maintain BUD concentration within target ranges for a long time, decreasing the side effects caused by concentration fluctuation, ensuring the efficiency of treatment and improving patient compliance by reducing dosing frequency. None of the severe signs, like the appearance of epithelial necrosis and the sloughing of epithelial cells, were detected...|$|E

How many times will a director say: "I don't want this rehearsal {{to be about the}} accent"? However the reality is that what the director really means is that s/he does not want the actors worried about getting the accent right. One of the arguments we make in this paper is that until the actor engages with the technical demands of the form, they cannot fully access the meaning of the text.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the duration of the throw and the official throwing distance in a group of elite male discus throwers. The time analysis of the technique phases (i. e. preparation, entry, flight, transition, <b>delivery,</b> <b>release)</b> of the participants in a top international athletics competition was used in order to conduct the study. Data were retrieved after recording seven right-handed throwers (age: 28. 8 ± 4. 1 years, body height: 1. 94 ± 0. 09 m, body mass: 119. 4 ± 11. 6 kg) with a Casio EX-FX 1 (Casio Computer Co. Ltd) digital video camera (sampling frequency: 300 fps) and analyzing the captured throws with the V 1 Home 2. 02. 54 software (Interactive Frontiers Inc.). The relationships among the duration of the technique phases of the throw and the official throwing distance were examined with Pearson Correlation Analysis using the SPSS 10. 0. 1 software (SPSS Inc.). Results revealed that no significant correlation (p > 0. 05) existed among the average official throwing distance (63. 04 ± 6. 09 m) and the duration of the discus throw or the duration of each technique phase. The temporal and correlation analyses were in agreement with previous studies. The dominant style of release was the release with no support on the ground. The majority of the throwers spent a larger percentage of the delivery turn (transition, delivery and release phases) being in single than in double support. It was noted that a short duration of the transition phase, combined with lower values of the ratio of the time spent for the starting turn compared to the time spent for the delivery turn might be favorable regarding the achievement of a larger throwing distance...|$|E
