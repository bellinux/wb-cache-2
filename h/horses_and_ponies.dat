5|$|Ponies are taxonomically {{the same}} animals as horses. The {{distinction}} between a horse and pony is commonly drawn {{on the basis of}} height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> <b>ponies</b> may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Finnhorse's {{image as}} a working farm horse, the breed {{was used as a}} cavalry mount from the 17thcentury until the end of World War II. After the {{mechanisation}} of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it was not clear if the Finnhorse would make the transition into a riding horse, even though the long use of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the job. The Finnhorse had a strong {{image as a}} harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> <b>ponies</b> were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time.|$|E
5|$|The American Quarter Pony Association {{was begun}} in 1964 with {{the ideals of}} a {{registry}} which would register small <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> <b>ponies</b> of western type, whose breeding could be unknown but which were desirable for breeding purposes. Crossbred and purebred animals are eligible for registration, as are animals registered with other registries that meet the entry requirements. In 1975, the National Quarter Pony Association was begun to preserve the smaller, stockier type Quarter Horse when breeding trends were leaning towards taller, leaner animals. The AQPA now registers horses in several foreign countries, {{as well as all}} US states and Canadian provinces. The International Quarter Pony Association, begun in the 1970s, also registers Quarter Ponies, and is a worldwide association for ponies of Quarter Horse type. The Quarter Pony Association is an association affiliated with the International Quarter Pony Association, with the goal of promoting the Quarter Pony. In 2005, the IQPA and the QPA became one organization, with the IQPA acting as the registry and the QPA as the membership branch. As of 2005, there were an estimated 3,000 Quarter Ponies registered with all registering organizations. Registries say that registrations of adult animals outnumber those for foals every year, as many owners wait until the pony is old enough to be shown under saddle before registering them.|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of methanogen compositions in the feces of <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> <b>pony</b> {{was carried out}} by constructing the α-subunit of methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) gene and 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) clone libraries. The mcrA clone library analysis indicated that Methanomicrobiales was predominant in both <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> <b>pony.</b> Furthermore, most of the clones of the 16 S rRNA gene library showed that Methanomicrobiales was also predominant in <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> <b>pony,</b> but the LIBSHUFF analysis showed that the <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> <b>pony</b> libraries were significantly different (P< 0. 05). Most of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed low similarity to the identified methanogens in both the mcrA and the 16 S rRNA clone libraries. The results suggest that <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> <b>pony</b> harbor unidentified <b>and</b> novel methanogens in their hindgut. The methanogen population was higher in horse than in pony; however, the anaerobic fungal population was similar in <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> <b>pony.</b> The methanogen diversity was different between two breeds of Equus caballus...|$|R

25|$|These {{two events}} helped create {{an idea about}} North among the Pawnee Scouts as having supernatural powers and being invulnerable to harm. The scouts served distinctively in the Battle of the Tongue River on August 29. In the fight, about 200 United States {{soldiers}} and 70 Indian Scouts (including 30 of the Pawnee) captured an Arapaho village containing about 500 people, mostly women and children, under Medicine Man. The few Arapaho warriors counterattacked but were repulsed by the soldiers' repeating carbine's and mountain howitzer's fire. Sixty-three Arapahos, mostly unarmed noncombatants were killed and eighteen {{women and children were}} captured and later released. Additionally, hundreds of Arapaho <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> <b>ponies</b> were shot after the battle. Five U.S. soldiers and Indian Scouts were killed or mortally wounded and an additional two were wounded in the battle.|$|E
500|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>and</b> <b>ponies</b> {{began to}} be used in Britain's mining pits in the 18th century, to haul [...] "tubs" [...] of coal and ore from the working face to the lifts, in deep mines, or to the surface in {{shallower}} mines. Many of these ponies were Shetlands, as their small size was combined with great strength. A stud farm {{for the sole purpose of}} breeding ponies for the pits was established in 1870 by colliery owner Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry, and the Shetland Pony Stud Book Society was formed in 1890 to stop the use of the best stallions in the pits. By 1984, only 55pit ponies were being used by the National Coal Board in Britain, chiefly at the modern pit in Ellington, Northumberland. A horse called [...] "Robbie", probably the last to work underground in a British coal mine, was retired from a mine at Pant y Gasseg, near Pontypool, in May 1999.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>and</b> <b>ponies</b> need annual vaccinations {{to protect}} against any number of sicknesses, though the precise {{vaccines}} required varies depending {{on the part of}} the world where the horse lives and the uses to which the animal is put. [...] In most nations, rabies and tetanus shots are commonly given, and in many places, various forms of equine encephalitis are a concern as well as West Nile Virus. Horses that travel or are exposed to other horses that travel are often recommended to receive equine influenza vaccines, since the disease is highly communicable. In the United States, many people also vaccinate against Equine Herpes Virus strains 1 and 4. Many additional vaccines may be needed, depending on local conditions and risk, including Rhodococcus equi (strangles), Botulism, or Potomac Horse Fever.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Horses</b> <b>and</b> <b>ponies</b> require routine {{hoof care}} by a {{professional}} farrier on average every six to eight weeks, depending on the animal, the work it performs and, in some areas, climate conditions. Hooves usually grow faster {{in the spring and}} fall than in summer or winter. They also appear to grow faster in warm, moist weather than in cold or dry weather. [...] In damp climates, the hooves tend to spread out more and wear down less than in dry climates, though more lush, growing forage may also be a factor. [...] Thus, a horse kept in a climate such as that of Ireland may need to have its feet trimmed more frequently than a horse kept in a drier climate such as Arizona, in the southwestern United States.|$|E

40|$|Lymphocyte {{stimulation}} {{was observed}} in whole equine blood {{in the presence of}} phytohaemagglutinin and M protein extracted from a typical strain of Streptococcus equi. Blood samples were collected from several healthy <b>horses</b> <b>and</b> <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> <b>pony</b> foals <b>and</b> cultured in vitro with varying concentrations of phytohaemagglutinin and M protein for several days. Phytohaemagglutinin was found to induce lymphocyte stimulation in these animals. Highest mean stimulation indices in horse foals (49. 3 +/- 24. 4) <b>and</b> <b>pony</b> foals (54. 7 +/- 32. 0) were observed with 0. 625 and 1. 25 micrograms/mL phytohaemagglutinin, respectively, at either 72 or 96 hours of incubation. Significantly higher radioactive counts per minute in <b>horse</b> <b>and</b> <b>pony</b> foals were recorded in blood cultures incubated with 0. 625 and 1. 25 micrograms/mL phytohaemagglutinin. M protein induced a dose related stimulation response in adult horses. Maximum stimulation indices were observed against 125 micrograms/mL M protein at 96 hours. These stimulation indices were higher in adult horses (40. 0 +/- 2. 2) than observed in pony foals (14. 4 +/- 15. 7). Higher stimulation levels in adult horses indicated either nonspecific stimulation against M protein or previous exposure of these animals to S. equi...|$|R
