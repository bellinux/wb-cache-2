40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} changes in aroma {{volatiles}} associated with fruit senescence based on the climacteric or non-climacteric behavior found {{in a collection of}} near-isogenic lines (NILs) of melon (Cucumis melo L.). Data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methodologies. In general, senescence led to a decrease in complexity of the aroma profile, but total area Counts increased compared with harvest levels. The quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that induced climacteric behavior in the NILs strongly affected the aroma profile during senescence. In senescent climacteric fruit, the relative contributions of acetate and non-acetate esters to the overall aroma profile increased in relation to harvest levels, particularly propyl acetate, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> methyl 2 -methylbutanoate, ethyl butanoate, hexyl acetate and benzyl acetate. In the senescent non-climacteric NILs, 15 - 17 volatiles of the profile were undetectable. particularly some aldehydes, while other aldehydes Were reduced, esters did not change from harvest to senescence and sulfur-derived compounds increased. Methyl propanoate decreased with senescence irrespective of the climacteric behavior The climacteric senescent fruit of the NILs could be discriminated from the non-climacteric fruit by 11 compounds of the profile, mainly benzyl acetate, hexanal and pentanal among others (ethyl acetate, propan- 2 -yl acetate, nonanal, 2 -ethylhexan- 1 -ol, methyldisulfanyl-methane, acetone and 2 -ethylfuran). The grouping of senescent climacteric NILs was mainly attributable to high relative values of ethyl acetate, methyl butyrate and propyl acetate.

40|$|Volatile aroma-active esters are {{responsible}} for the fruity character of fermented alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. Esters are produced by fermenting yeast cells in an enzyme-catalyzed intracellular reaction. In order to investigate and compare the roles of the known Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol acetyltransferases, Atf 1 p, Atf 2 p and Lg-Atf 1 p, in volatile ester production, the respective genes were either deleted or overexpressed in a laboratory strain and a commercial brewing strain. Subsequently, the ester formation of the transformants was monitored by headspace gas chromatography and gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Analysis of the fermentation products confirmed that the expression levels of ATF 1 and ATF 2 greatly affect the production of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. GC-MS analysis revealed that Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p are also responsible for the formation of a broad range of less volatile esters, such as propyl acetate, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> pentyl acetate, hexyl acetate, heptyl acetate, octyl acetate, and phenyl ethyl acetate. With respect to the esters analyzed in this study, Atf 2 p seemed to play only a minor role compared to Atf 1 p. The atf 1 ? atf 2 ? double deletion strain did not form any isoamyl acetate, showing that together, Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p {{are responsible}} for the total cellular isoamyl alcohol acetyltransferase activity. However, the double deletion strain still produced considerable amounts of certain other esters, such as ethyl acetate (50 % of the wild-type strain), propyl acetate (50 %), and <b>isobutyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (40 %), which provides evidence for the existence of additional, as-yet-unknown ester synthases in the yeast proteome. Interestingly, overexpression of different alleles of ATF 1 and ATF 2 led to different ester production rates, indicating that differences in the aroma profiles of yeast strains may be partially due to mutations in their ATF genes. 10 page(s...|$|E
