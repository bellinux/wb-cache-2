5|$|Johnson's wife Shelly {{is having}} breakfast with her lover Bobby Briggs; the two roleplay {{the idea of}} {{shooting}} Johnson, while they toy with Shelly's pistol. When Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) arrives to enquire about Johnson, Briggs hides and Shelly attempts to make Johnson seem deeply involved in Laura's death and Renault's disappearance. Elsewhere, lovers Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) meet to discuss their spouses. Jennings' husband Hank (Chris Mulkey) has been released from prison, while Hurley's volatile wife Nadine is increasingly becoming mentally unwell. Jennings leaves, feeling that things are <b>going</b> <b>nowhere,</b> leaving Hurley crestfallen. Meanwhile, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) is interviewed for a job at her father's department store and blackmails the interviewer into giving her a position at the shop's perfume counter—where Laura and Ronette Pulaski worked before their abduction.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{finished}} {{just five}} points above the Second Division relegation {{zone in the}} 1960–61 season and Taylor resigned; his replacement, Don Revie, was promoted from the United first team, and initially he was not fond of Charlton. Revie played Charlton up front {{at the start of}} the 1961–62 season, but he soon moved him back to centre-half after he proved ineffective as a centre-forward. He soon became frustrated and difficult to manage, feeling in limbo playing for a club seemingly <b>going</b> <b>nowhere</b> whilst his younger brother was enjoying great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared to let him go in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly failed to meet the £30,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially willing to pay the fee he eventually decided to instead try an untested youngster at centre-half. During these discussions Charlton refused to sign a new contract at Leeds, but felt frustrated by Busby's hesitance and so signed a new contract with Leeds whilst making a promise to Revie to be more professional in his approach.|$|E

5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, <b>going</b> <b>nowhere</b> and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E
25|$|Former Prime Minister Panagiotis Kanellopoulos was {{originally}} suggested {{as the head}} of the new interim government. He was the interim Prime Minister originally deposed by the dictatorship in 1967 and a distinguished politician who had repeatedly criticized Papadopoulos and his successor. Raging battles were still taking place in Cyprus' north when Greeks took to the streets in all the major cities, celebrating the junta's decision to relinquish power before the war in Cyprus could spill all over the Aegean.

25|$|But {{they could}} not make further progress. They met heavy Konbaung {{resistance}} at Kyaukmyaung, and lost many men trying to take a heavily fortified Ava. Two months into the invasion, the invasion was <b>going</b> <b>nowhere.</b> The Hanthawaddy forces had lost many men and boats, and were short on ammunition and supplies. In May, Alaungpaya personally led his armies (10,000 men, 1000 cavalry, 100 elephants) in the Konbaung counterattack, and pushed back the invaders to Sagaing, {{on the west bank}} of the Irrawaddy, opposite Ava. On the east bank, Hsinbyushin also broke the siege of Ava. With the rainy season just a few weeks away, the Hanthawaddy command decided to retreat.|$|E
5000|$|During one {{recording}} session, Mike Rutherford first {{created the}} main riff {{of the song}} he called [...] "Heavy A Flat", to which Phil Collins suddenly improvised [...] "I Can't Dance!" [...] The riff was actually inspired by a Levi Strauss & Co. TV commercial (in the studio, the song was created under the working title [...] "Blue Jeans") using The Clash song [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go". Originally the band {{did not think of}} it as anything more than a joke, because the song was too simple, too bluesy and completely unlike Genesis' style. Tony Banks said in an interview [...] "It was one of those bits you thought was <b>going</b> to go <b>nowhere.</b> It sounded fun, but wasn't really special".|$|R
25|$|By late 1754, {{the siege}} of Prome was <b>going</b> <b>nowhere</b> for Talaban's men. The besiegers {{had been able to}} fight off Konbaung {{attempts}} to lift the siege but they could not take the fortified city either. At Pegu, some of the Hanthawaddy commanders now feared Alaungpaya's full-scale invasion of the south, and looked for an alternative. Preferring the loose rule of a weak king, they attempted to free the captive king, Mahadhammaraza Dipati on the throne of Hanthawaddy. The plot was discovered by Binnya Dala, who executed not only the conspirators but also the former king himself and other captives from Ava in October 1754. This shortsighted action removed the only possible rival to Alaungpaya, and allowed those who had stayed loyal to the former king to join Alaungpaya with an easy conscience.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam {{repeatedly}} said in interviews {{that the character}} of Parnassus was meant autobiographically, a tale of an aging man with a vivid imagination {{in a world that}} doesn't listen any more. Still being caught in depression over the disruption of his last self-written project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, his constant struggle with the established studio system, as well as becoming aware of his progressing age, worried that he was <b>going</b> <b>nowhere</b> with his latest projects and that he might not have much time left, Gilliam put a number of references to sudden, tragic, and premature death into his script before the loss of Ledger became a reality. In fact, Gilliam felt compelled to emphasise time and again that upon the film's release many things might be mistaken as references to Ledger's fate but that the script wasn't changed apart from re-casting Tony with Depp, Farrell, and Law.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} {{dealt with the}} practice's {{financial}} troubles. Naomi reveals to Addison {{that they are in}} danger of losing the practice due to unpaid debt causing Addison to tell Sam. This in turn causes a shift within the practice making Addison the new boss. Adding to the drama was the competition of a new practice, Pacific Wellcare. This new practice, located within the same building as Oceanside Wellness, was run by Charlotte causing turmoil for her and Cooper. Another happening within this season is the dynamic between Sam and Naomi who by the finale realize they can no longer be friends as well as the deepening romantic relationship of Cooper and Charlotte. Addison was romantically linked with Kevin Nelson (played by David Sutcliffe), a police officer, but later realized their relationship was <b>going</b> <b>nowhere.</b> Towards the end of the season, Addison falls in love with cardiovascular surgeon Noah Barnes, who as it turns out, is married and is expecting his first child. Matters become more complicated when Addison realizes that Noah's wife is one of her patients. Archer Montgomery (Grant Show), Addison's playboy brother, also made sporadic appearances causing trouble for her and Naomi. Archer was found to be with an aggressive brain tumor which was later diagnosed as parasites. Addison sought the professional help of her ex-husband, neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). After Derek successfully saved Archer, Addison discovered Archer was back to his old tricks cheating on Naomi. Violet stirred some of her own drama when she began dating Sheldon (Brian Benben), who works for Pacific Wellcare, and Pete. During {{the latter half of the}} season, Violet was found to be pregnant although she did not know who the father of her baby was. Furthermore, Violet found herself and her unborn baby at the mercy of a psychotic patient bent on taking Violet's baby by any means necessary in the closing moments of the season finale. Meanwhile, Dell struggled with his own issues caused by his former girlfriend's drug habits and the fight for custody of his daughter Betsey. Some of the medical cases that caused a stir and tension among the doctors at Private Practice was the issue of abortion (a first for the practice), the sex reassignment of a newborn, the sexual activity of a 12-year-old, the switching of embryos for two mothers-to-be and a young couple who later discovered they were siblings.|$|E

500|$|When {{those plans}} fell through, McLaren, Rhodes {{and the band}} began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties. As {{described}} by Matlock, [...] "Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so {{what we used to}} do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer." [...] Among those they approached was Midge Ure, who was involved with his own band, Slik. Kevin Rowland—who would co-found Dexys Midnight Runners three years later—auditioned, but apart from Matlock, no one was impressed. With the search <b>going</b> <b>nowhere,</b> McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation.|$|E
500|$|At Stoke, Matthews {{found himself}} playing Second Division {{football}} {{for the first}} time in 28 years. Despite Stoke being strapped for cash, Tony Waddington gave him a two-year contract at £50 a week – this was double the wages he received at Blackpool. The signing was broadcast live on Sportsweek, as Waddington whispered in his ear [...] "Welcome home, Stan. For years this club has been <b>going</b> <b>nowhere.</b> Now we're on our way". Waddington delayed his return debut until 24 October 1961, when Stoke played Huddersfield Town at the Victoria Ground, the attendance was 35,974 – more than treble the previous home game – and Matthews set up one of City's goals in a 3–0 win. He went on to score three goals in 21 games in the rest of the 1961–62 campaign.|$|E
500|$|At this time, Klein and Eisen, {{now using}} the stage names Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, decided {{that one of}} the reasons for Wicked Lester's lack of success was their lack of a {{singular}} image and musical vision. They made the decision to move forward and start a new band. Wicked Lester began auditioning for a drummer. Tony Zarrella recorded all the Wicked Lester drum tracks at Electric Lady Studio produced by Ron Johsen. [...] After completion, Tony Zarrella left the group. Ostrander, feeling that the band was <b>going</b> <b>nowhere,</b> quit. He went on to teach music at Missisquoi Valley Union High School in Swanton, Vermont. Ostrander died on September 3, 2011 from cancer. For a short time, Ron Leejack continued on with the new version of Wicked Lester.|$|E

Jones was again linked with {{high-profile}} clubs on 21 December 2007, including Chelsea and Liverpool, but Sunderland manager Roy Keane {{insisted that he}} would be <b>going</b> <b>nowhere.</b> Jones scored his fifth goal at the Stadium of Light, with a header from the near post off a corner kick, in Sunderland's 3–1 win over Bolton Wanderers on 29 December.Chelsea captain John Terry praised Jones, saying: [...] "Jones was fantastic and I have played against him twice now. He is a very good player, very hard working and probably the best in the air in the entire Premier League, he really is that good" [...] after Chelsea had won the match 1–0 on 15 March 2008.|$|E
500|$|In the Kingdom of Holland, the British {{launched}} the Walcheren Campaign {{to open up}} a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the Austrians. The British army only landed at Walcheren on 30 July, by which point the Austrians had already been defeated. The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed [...] "Walcheren Fever". Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809. The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians. Emperor Francis wanted to wait and see how the British performed in their theater before entering into negotiations with Napoleon. Once it became apparent that the British were <b>going</b> <b>nowhere,</b> the Austrians agreed to peace talks.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Brockmann argues {{the fact}} that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because [...] "there is no access to a natural world {{beyond the realm of}} the {{tortured}} human psyche". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be <b>going</b> <b>nowhere,</b> such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they {{are the only ones who}} truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.|$|E
500|$|U2 {{found that}} they were neither {{prepared}} nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and {{felt that they were}} not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of [...] "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and held it out to Bono, saying, [...] "You tell me what to play and I'll play it. You want to play it yourself? Go ahead." [...] With a sense of <b>going</b> <b>nowhere,</b> the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' [...] "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song [...] "One". While working on [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became [...] "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing [...] "blank page approach" [...] to writing and recording together.|$|E

2500|$|French Prime Minister and {{chairman}} of the Paris Peace Conference Georges Clemenceau commented that the Klaipėda Region was not attached to Lithuania because it had not yet received de jure recognition. The Lithuanians seized this statement and further campaigned for their rights in the region believing that once they received international recognition, the region should be theirs. As the mediation of the Polish–Lithuanian conflict over the Vilnius Region by the League of Nations was <b>going</b> <b>nowhere,</b> the Klaipėda Region became a major bargaining chip. Already in 1921, implicit [...] "Klaipėda-for-Vilnius" [...] offers were made. In March 1922, the British made a concrete and explicit offer: in exchange for recognition of Polish claims to Vilnius, Lithuania would receive de jure recognition, Klaipėda Region, and economic aid. The Lithuanians rejected the proposal as they were not ready to give up on Vilnius. After the rejection, the French and British attitudes turned against Lithuania and they now favored the free city solution (Freistaat like the Free City of Danzig). Thus the Lithuanians could wait for an unfavorable decision or they could seize the region and present a fait accompli.|$|E
