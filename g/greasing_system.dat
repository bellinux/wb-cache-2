30|$|Typically, {{metal oxides}} have lower heat {{transfer}} capacities than corresponding metals {{with few exceptions}} such as CuO with a reasonable thermal conductivity [14]. CuO particles, hence, have provided a promising place in thermal conductivity enhancement of composites [15] and nanofluids [16 - 18]. The studies [16 - 18] showed that the CuO particles could be effective fillers for thermal conductivity improvement in nanofluid systems. According to the theories based on effective medium theory of thermal conductivity of composite, the size, shape, and thermal conductivity of filler have a great influence on thermal conductivity enhancement of polymer composites and nanofluids [19, 20], but {{the influence of the}} shape of CuO particles on thermal conductivity improvement in thermal <b>grease</b> <b>system</b> has been overlooked.|$|R

40|$|Kinetic runs {{were carried}} out on 2 -chloroethyltrinethyl- -silane in both <b>greased</b> and grease-free <b>systems.</b> It was found that to obtain a {{possible}} homogeneous decomposition in the <b>greased</b> <b>system</b> {{the surface of the}} reaction vessel had to be coated with carbon by decomposing allyl bromide in the reaction vessel. The products were then found to be 96 % ethylene and trimethylchloro- -silane, 2 % hydrogen chloride and vinyltrimethylsilane and 2 % vinyl chloride and trimethylsilane. The reactions were:- Me 3 SiCH 2 CH 2 Cl ? C 2 H 4 + Me 3 SiCl Me 3 SiCH 2 CH 2 Cl ? HCl + Me 3 SiCH=CH 2 Me 3 SiCH 2 CH 2 Cl ?

A heterogeneous dehydration appeared to be the major reaction as the major products wore water and vinylteimethylsilane i. e. Me 3 SiCH 2 CH 2 OH ? Me 3 SiCH=CH 2 + H 2 O Some preliminary runs were done on 1, 2 -dichloroethyl-trimethylsilane which was found to be even more sensitive to surface than 2 -chloroethyltrimethylsilane and to be more complex in its decomposition. The main products were found to be vinyl chloride and trimethylchlorosilane but there was also an appreciable amount of hydrogen chloride and a chlorovinyltrimethylsilane.

5000|$|Modern {{commercial}} {{rolling cutter}} bits usually employ three cones {{to contain the}} cutting elements, although two cone or (rarely) four cone arrangements are sometimes seen. These bits mainly fall into two classes depending on the manufacture of the cutting elements or [...] "teeth". Steel-tooth bits have cones that have wedge-shaped teeth milled directly in the cone steel itself. Extremely hard tungsten carbide material is often applied to the surfaces of the teeth by a welding process to improve durability. Tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bits have shaped teeth of sintered tungsten carbide press-fit into drilled holes in the cones. Some types of steel-tooth bits also have TCI elements {{in addition to the}} milled teeth. The cones rotate on roller or journal bearings that are usually sealed from the hostile down-hole drilling fluid environment by different arrangements of o-ring or metal face seals. These bits usually also have pressure compensated <b>grease</b> lubrication <b>systems</b> for the bearings.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program to}} determine the loss-of-lubrication (LOL) characteristics of spur gears in an aerospace simulation test facility has been completed. Tests were conducted using two different emergency lubricant types: (1) an oil mist system (two different misted lubricants) and (2) a <b>grease</b> injection <b>system</b> (two different <b>grease</b> types). Tests were conducted using a NASA Glenn test facility normally used for conducting contact fatigue. Tests were run at rotational speeds up to 10000 rpm using two different gear designs and two different gear materials. For the tests conducted using an air-oil misting system, a minimum lubricant injection rate was determined to permit the gear mesh to operate without failure for at least 1 hr. The tests allowed an elevated steady state temperature to be established. A basic 2 -D heat transfer simulation has been developed to investigate temperatures of a simulated gear {{as a function of}} frictional behavior. The friction (heat generation source) between the meshing surfaces is related to the position in the meshing cycle, the load applied, and the amount of lubricant in the contact.

40|$|We posit that export {{performance}} of firms in emerging economies depends both on their firm-specific resource endowments {{and on the}} institutional environments within which they operate. Specifically, we argue that firms will be likely to export when political instability is high, they face more informal competitors, {{and are able to}} <b>grease</b> the regulatory <b>system</b> via bribes. Furthermore, firm export intensity will depend on access to critical resources such as skilled workforce, managerial talent and product quality. We test these conjectures using a dataset of 5, 600 firms in the four largest emerging market economies (Brazil, Russia, China and India). Our results confirm that the institutional environments affect export propensity through political instability and bribery, whilst the export intensity of firms depends on the availability of skilled workers and adherence to international quality standards.

The box girder of the bridge should be repaired, reinforced and the degree of inclination of the pylons be regularly measured. Anti-corrosion measures should be taken on the various components of stay cable <b>systems.</b> <b>Grease</b> should be filled in the anchorage components.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} changes in {{domestic}} wastewater inputs on sewer performance have been debated {{since the dawn of}} the great sewer construction movement in the 1850 s. Nowadays, typical household wastewater that enters sewers can generally be divided into streams from the WC, shower and/or bathtub, kitchen sink, washing machine and dishwasher. Changes in thecomposition of domestic wastewater entering a sewer will depend on inter alia the properties of the appliances used in the households and householders’ residential habits. Recent such changes with a potentially detrimental impact on sewer performance are increased levels of fat, oil and grease used in kitchen practices; the introduction of kitchen sink food waste disposers;and the installation of domestic water efficient appliances. The overall aim of this thesis was, from an historical perspective, to explore how recent changes to inputs in domestic wastewater can impact performance of sewer systems and how this relates to sewers as future carriers of domestic wastewater. Various methods to examine the aim have been employed. Two questionnaire surveys were distributed. The first was sent out to sewer operators/managers employed at Scandinavian public water utilities to explore their views on the extent of fat, oil and <b>grease</b> in sewer <b>systems.</b> The second was sent to sewer/operators managers employed at public water utilities in Northern Sweden to explore the extent of monitoring of incidents of blockages. Two field studies have also been undertaken. One entailed the investigation of long term impacts on sewer performance from the introduction of food waste disposers in housing areas. The other evaluated which parameters of domestic wastewater could be used to estimate levels of infiltration/ inflow into sewers. In addition, a case analysis was undertaken to assess future impacts on self-cleansing regimes in sewer networks when rural subarctic villages are retrofitted with water efficient appliances. A literature review was performed to identify and analyse studies examining changes to domestic wastewater the impact these changes may have on sewer systems,and their implications for sewer management. Responses from the first questionnaire survey suggested that an increase in blockages due tofat, oil and grease, in particular at pumping stations, was the most reported problem. Responses from the second questionnaire survey indicated that the extent of monitoring reoccurring blockage locations was found to be low, although two water utilities possessed GIS-systems which supported such endeavours. The first field study indicated that the level of in-sewerdeposition was observed to be increased when a pipe received high input of effluents from the kitchen sink disposers. This was observed to a further degree when a pipe had a gentle inclination combined with significant sagging along its length. From the second field study it was found that among compounds normally sampled to determine wastewater characteristic, the parameters Tot-N and Tot-P provided the closest fit to estimated levels of infiltration/inflowbased on water consumption rates. The case analysis indicated that the decrease in in-pipe velocities when all households are retrofitted with water saving appliances could be counteracted by sewer relining when water consumption rates did not drop below 130 l/hd. d. The impacts on sewer performance from these changes seemed to be dictated by many factors,e. g. household practices and the status of separate pipes. Therefore {{there is a need to}} put the changes to inputs in the context of larger societal trends to properly understand their full implications regarding future objectives when relying on the sewer as a carrier of domestic wastewater.
