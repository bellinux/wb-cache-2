25|$|After the {{procedure}} is complete, the patient is typically asked to lie flat for 5–10 minutes to provide pressure over {{the procedure}} site. After that, assuming no bleeding is observed, the patient can <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> about their normal activities. Paracetamol (aka acetaminophen) or other simple analgesics {{can be used to}} ease soreness, which is common for 2–3 days after the procedure. Any worsening pain, redness, fever, bleeding or swelling may suggest a complication. Patients are also advised to avoid washing the procedure site for at least 24 hours after {{the procedure is}} completed.|$|E
25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging him to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to work. As Mildred tries {{to care for}} her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: {{over the course of several}} decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E

Every step he takes is to our advantage" [...] Broadcaster Graham McNamee, who was calling the game on the radio, said during Roy's wrong way run: [...] "What am I seeing? What's wrong with me? Am I crazy? Am I crazy? Am I crazy?" [...] After the play, Riegels was so distraught that he had to be talked into {{returning}} to the game by coach Nibs Price for the second half. Roy said [...] "Coach, I can't do it. I've ruined you, I've ruined myself, I've ruined the University of California. I couldn't face that crowd to save my life."

Riegels did play on; he turned in a strong second-half performance, {{including}} blocking a Georgia Tech punt. Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, but that was not enough. Georgia Tech won the game and its second national championship 8–7. Its starting lineup was Waddey (left end), Speer (left tackle), Drennon (left guard), Pund (center), Westbrook (right guard), Maree (right tackle), Jones (right end), Durant (quarterback), Thomason (left halfback), Mizell (right halfback), and Lumpkin (fullback).|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|The war's end {{swung the}} {{pendulum}} back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed {{it after the}} war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide {{but over the years}} adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now under a European Community directive summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016). The U.S. was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few U.S. cities retained DST locally thereafter, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a [...] "deception". Reasoning that people should instead <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to work earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.|$|E
