40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} the <b>feeding</b> <b>value</b> of grain sorghum relative to corn and various grain processing methods for grain sorghum. It {{has been widely}} recognized that grain sorghum (milo) must be processed to be efficiently used by finishing cattle.

Dry ground or rolled grain sorghum has a relative <b>feeding</b> <b>value</b> of 85 % to 95 % (avg 90 %) of dry rolled corn. Processing grain sorghum by more sophisticated methods (early harvesting, steam-flaking, etc.) greatly enhances its <b>feeding</b> <b>value.</b> Chemical composition suggests {{that there should be}} less difference in the <b>feeding</b> <b>value</b> of grain sorghum compared with corn than what actually exists. Starch, which represents 70 % of the dry matter, and protein appear to be less digestible in grain sorghum than in other grains.

40|$|In the tropics, {{numerous}} {{organizations have}} promoted multipurpose fodder trees (MPFT) {{with an emphasis}} on exotic species. These species have generally been selected and recommended by the research system through the conventional nutritional and agronomic experimentation for use as animal feed and soil conservation. In Ethiopia, the introduction of exotic MPFT started in the 1970 s. However, despite its apparent benefits, the adoption of exotic MPFT by smallholder farmers has been slow and in some cases farmers ceased using exotic MPFT in their farming systems. The objectives of the present study were to assess farmers' preference criteria, compare their preference between exotic and local MPFT, and evaluate the relationship of farmers' knowledge of <b>feed</b> <b>value</b> assessment with laboratory indicators. Focus group discussions and preference ranking and scoring by a total of 40 farmers were conducted in two districts representing two production systems (cereal and coffee-based livestock production systems) in the Ethiopian highlands. The comparison between exotic and local MPFT for their benefits and desired tree characteristics showed that farmers preferred local MPFT to exotics for biomass production, multi-functionality, life span, and compatibility to the cropping system. In terms of <b>feed</b> <b>value,</b> ease of propagation, and growth potential local MPFT were ranked lower than or comparable to exotics. There was also a strong correlation between farmers' <b>feed</b> <b>value</b> score and laboratory results. Farmers were able to discriminate effectively MPFT species that had high and low protein and fibre content using their indigenous <b>feed</b> <b>value</b> indicator system for all pairwise comparisons. We concluded from this study that farmers' preference criteria encompass multiple objectives beyond <b>feed</b> <b>value</b> and soil rehabilitation. The different merits that farmers associate with exotic and local MPFT could provide the opportunity to use both MPFT types and to improve farm bio-diversity. Hence, incorporating locally available MPFT, farmers' indigenous knowledge and preference criteria at the research inception process is vital to maximize the likelihood of farmers' adopting and maintaining these technologies...|$|R

Gas production was measured with a computerized system and an exponential model was fitted to the data. The impact {{of the variation in}} composition and kinetics on the <b>feed</b> <b>value</b> of grains in feedlot rations was assessed with the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). Fractional gas rates were significantly different between grains (P< 0. 001), with a mean and S.

As expected, forage dry matter (DM) yields were higher at the dough stage then boot stage, and silage yields tended {{to be higher than}} those for hay. In Trials 2 and 3 (1986 - 87), barley and rye forage yields were lower than wheat yields. In all three years, wet weather conditions made hay-making difficult.

Analysis of <b>feed</b> <b>value</b> have highlighted that there is a significant variation between varieties as well as due to an environmental variation between regions and the harvest year. The chemical analysis is, however, time-consuming and costly, and it is therefore desirable to have a rapid and less expensive method, which makes it possible to carry out more analyses in-situ. Near infra-red reflection spectroscopy (NIRS) is appropriate as a standard analysis of dry matter, total N and starch in grains, since it is rapid (approximately 1 minute per measurement of a ground test) and cheap. NIRS is therefore appropriate as a quick method for the determination of EDOM, EDOMi, FEso and FEsv. The outcome of a successful NIRS calibration will be a relatively cheap tool to monitor, diversify and evaluate the quality of cereals for animal feed, a possible tool to assess the <b>feed</b> <b>value</b> of new varieties in the variety testing and a useful, cheap and rapid tool for cereal breeders. A collection of 1213 grain samples of wheat, triticale, barley and rye, and related chemical reference analyses to describe the <b>feed</b> <b>value</b> have been established. The samples originate from available field trials over a three-year period. The chemical reference analyses are dry matter, crude protein, crude ash, crude oils and fats, EDOM, EDOMi, FEso and FEsv. All samples were ground on a laboratory mill and scans were obtained using a QFA-Flex 400 FT-NIR instrument (Q-interline, Roskilde, Denmark). The samples were packed in glass vials with a height of 6 cm and a diameter of 2. 6 cm and measured using a rotating sample device. The sample was rotated with a speed of three rounds per minute, with a measuring sample window at the rotating sample device has a diameter of 6 mm and the analysis surface is 510 mm 2. NIR measurements in the range from 800 to 2500 nm with data collection at every 2 nm were performed on grounded and dried aliquots.
