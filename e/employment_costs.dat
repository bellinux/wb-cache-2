[...] North dispatched Robert Harvey to Chile with equipment and engineers to begin construction of the mines whilst North remained in Britain to manage the financial side of the enterprise. [...] The mines were operation by 1884 and producing 3,000 short tons of nitrates per month. [...] The company turned large profits and was able to pay dividends in excess of 20% each year until 1886 when it was liquidated by North and his partners in order to found other companies. [...] As a result of his fantastic profits North became known as [...] "The King Of Nitrates" [...] and was a well known public figure in England.|$|E
