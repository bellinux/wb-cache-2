500|$|One biographer of Cosby, Linda Etkin, said, [...] "Cosby {{comes across}} as a father figure, a teacher, and a friend" [...] in his advertisements. William Turner, in 1982 the {{marketing}} manager for Texas Instruments' consumer products group, said Cosby [...] "represents comfort, and people trust him". In 2014, one educator asked for comment said he remembered Cosby as a [...] "black male authority figure, {{one of those people who}} <b>folks</b> <b>that</b> don't live on the edges of the country think of as a good black guy; they trust that guy".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some {{lamented the}} use of poor white Southerners, and {{one-dimensional}} black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book [...] "melodramatic and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, [...] "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the <b>folks</b> <b>that</b> are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is." [...] Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: [...] "Well, honey, one thing {{we know is that}} she's been poaching on my literary preserves." ...|$|E

In a 2001 poll, Biography magazine ranked her as their third favorite leading actress of all time, behind Audrey Hepburn and Katharine Hepburn. She was featured on the [...] "100 Greatest Movie Stars of our Time" [...] list compiled by People.

2500|$|The {{eye-witness}} Richard Clough, a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, saw: [...] "all the churches, chapels {{and houses}} of religion utterly defaced, and {{no kind of}} thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few <b>folks</b> <b>that</b> {{it is to be}} marvelled at." [...] The Church of Our Lady in Antwerp, later made the cathedral (illustrated at top): [...] "looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine , I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed." ...|$|E

50|$|Progressive folk was {{originally}} {{a type of}} American <b>folk</b> music <b>that</b> pursued a progressive political agenda, but in the United Kingdom the term became attached to a musical subgenre. The latter describes a substyle of contemporary <b>folk</b> <b>that</b> draws from post-Bob Dylan folk music and adds new layers of musical and lyrical complexity, often incorporating various ethnic influences.|$|R

2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with <b>folks</b> <b>that</b> are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeger {{enrolled}} at Harvard College on a partial scholarship, {{but as he}} became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He {{dropped out of college}} in 1938. He dreamed of a career in journalism and took courses in art, as well. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the Dalton School, where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York State with The Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling puppet theater [...] "inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico". One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An article in the October 2, 1939, Daily Worker reported on the Puppeteers' six-week tour this way:During the entire trip the group never ate once in a restaurant. They slept out at night under the stars and cooked their own meals in the open, very often they were the guests of farmers. At rural affairs and union meetings, the farm women would bring [...] "suppers" [...] and would vie with each other to see who could feed the troupe most, and after the affair the farmers would have earnest discussions about who would have the honor of taking them home for the night."They fed us too well," [...] the girls reported. [...] "And we could live the entire winter just by taking advantage of all the offers to spend a week on the farm."In the farmers' homes they talked about politics and the farmers’ problems, about antisemitism and Unionism, about war and peace and social security—"and always," [...] the puppeteers report, [...] "the farmers wanted to know {{what can be done to}} create a stronger unity between themselves and city workers. They felt the need of this more strongly than ever before, and the support of the CIO in their milk strike has given them a new understanding and a new respect for the power that lies in solidarity. One summer has convinced us that a minimum of organized effort on the part of city organizations—unions, consumers' bodies, the American Labor Party and similar groups—can not only reach the farmers but weld them into a pretty solid front with city <b>folks</b> <b>that</b> will be one of the best guarantees for progress. That fall Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting Alan Lomax, a friend of his father's, at the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress. Seeger's job was to help Lomax sift through commercial [...] "race" [...] and [...] "hillbilly" [...] music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the Organization of American States), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (1938–53). Lomax also encouraged Seeger's folk singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and Nicholas Ray's weekly Columbia Broadcasting show Back Where I Come From (1940–41) alongside Josh White, Burl Ives, Lead Belly, and Woody Guthrie (whom he had first met at Will Geer's Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for migrant workers on March 3, 1940). Back Where I Come From was unique in having a racially integrated cast, which made news when it performed in March 1941 at a command performance at the White House organized by Eleanor Roosevelt called [...] "An Evening of Songs for American Soldiers," [...] before an audience that included the Secretaries of War, Treasury, and the Navy, among other notables. The show was a success but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast. During the war, Seeger also performed on nationwide radio broadcasts by Norman Corwin.|$|E
