25|$|<b>Facility</b> <b>management</b> {{includes}} using disinfectants and {{ambient temperature}} to control viruses in the environment. They {{are unlikely to}} survive outside living cells {{for more than two}} weeks, except in cold (but above freezing) conditions, and are readily inactivated by disinfectants. Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months, and can be recovered from them between outbreaks. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be quarantined. After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{processes}} in <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> are {{responsive to the}} quality of information flow across various levels and stages of design, procurement and construction processes. Considerable empirical evidence from industry reports shows how construction and <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> processes could be jeopardized by some of the limitations of conventional design and procurement processes. To address these limitations, there are promising indications showing that the potential of Building Information Modelling (BIM) will trigger major improvements in both construction and <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> systems. This study reviews some of the capabilities of BIM which may revolutionize conventional practices in <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> processes. Specific platforms for this include, integrated analysis and simulation of project variables in virtual environments, effective communication between project stakeholders and project teams and multi-disciplinary collaboration. Others are interoperability, project visualization, value intelligence and other digital <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> applications. In the study it is argued that BIM capabilities such as project visualization, simulation, auto-alert and value intelligence could stimulate major improvements in <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> processes.

When Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport needed upgrading in the early 1990s, LOT Polish Airlines was unable to afford the cost, so a complex financing arrangement was established whereby a bank would pay Hochtief {{two thirds of the}} costs to upgrade the airport, while the airline assigned to the bank the revenues from aircraft using Polish airspace for a period.

40|$|Whole {{life cycle}} costing (WLCC) {{can provide a}} {{valuable}} insight into the economic efficiency of National Health Service (NHS) acute care hospital buildings. The costs of the <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> function form {{an integral part of}} that process. However, the nature of <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> cost data collated by NHS Estates informs the analyst little about the relationship between the physical characteristics of hospital buildings and the <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> costs. The data can only be used to benchmark trusts total <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> spending, but what the NHS now requires is a way of being able to model the <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> costs for particular buildings. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate, using a case study, a methodology for modelling stochastically the <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> costs in NHS acute care hospital buildings. The data used in this research were obtained from NHS Estates on the <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> costs of over 450 acute care NHS Trusts in England and Wales. The data were analysed to obtain the parameters of the theoretical distributions that best describe the <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> costs for a ward block building in a large university acute care teaching hospital. The accuracy of these distributions was then validated using various hypotheses and goodness-of-fit tests. The result of this work provides analysts with a framework whereby the <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> costs in acute care hospital buildings can be modelled as stochastic assumptions in the modelling of WLCC. The paper also reveals that for acute care hospital buildings with a similar gross floor area to that of the building used in the case study (that is approximately 20 % of the entire acute care hospital estate), the underlying distribution of costs is likely to belong to the loglogistic distributionWhole Life Cycle Costing, Probability Density Functions, <b>Facilities</b> <b>Management</b> Costs, National Health Service, Acute Care Hospital Buildings,...|$|R

40|$|The term <b>Facilities</b> <b>Management</b> {{has become}} global but fraught with {{confusion}} {{as to what}} the term signifies. For some, notably in the USA, <b>Facilities</b> <b>Management</b> remains a discipline of human ecology. Elsewhere the term has become conflated with an alternative meaning: providing or outsourcing the provision of various services essential to the operation of particular buildings. This volume redresses that imbalance to remind <b>Facilities</b> <b>Management</b> of its roots, presenting evidence of <b>Facilities</b> <b>Management</b> success stories that engage the wider objectives of the organizations they serve, and engaging students, scholars and critical practitioners of general management with an appreciation of the power and influence of physical space and its place in the theory and practice of organizations. This book includes management perspectives from outside the field to ensure that the issues raised are seen in an organizational and management context, informing debate within the <b>Facilities</b> <b>Management</b> fraternity. It draws on human ecology and the perspective of the firm as, itself, an intra-organizational ecology of social constructs. The ecology of a firm is not restricted to the firm’s boundaries.
