40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper was to {{evaluate}} the uncertainty of <b>feed</b> <b>analysis</b> results based on inter-laboratory comparisons (ILC) and proficiency testing (PT), {{as well as to}} use the obtained uncertainties to create an interpretation system for <b>feed</b> <b>analysis</b> results and feed quality evaluation. The ILC and PT were conducted with the participation of Polish laboratories, including laboratories for feed control and supervision (Regional Veterinary Laboratories). The results of four PTs and seven ILCs performed in 2004 - 2007 were evaluated. The expanded uncertainty was calculated as a double standard deviation of reproducibility. The expanded uncertainty for method analysis of nutrients (moisture, crude ash, crude protein, crude fat, crude fat after acidic hydrolysis, crude fiber, starch and sugar), minerals (chlorides, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium), some feed additives (iron, manganese, zinc, copper, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin E, tryptophan and ethoxyquin) were calculated. The obtained expanded uncertainties were in most cases similar to those used by German laboratories in feed control and supervision.

We cover several of the most common specialised methods for analysing brown adipose tissue function in vivo, including assessment of maximal thermogenic capacity by indirect calorimetry and the measurement of sympathetic tone to brown adipose tissue. While these techniques are powerful, they are not readily available to all laboratories; therefore we also cover several simple measurements that, particularly in combination, can be used to determine if a mouse model is likely to have alterations in brown adipose tissue function.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} model for the prediction of dry matter intake by lactating Holstein Friesian dairy cows. To estimate the model parameters, a calibration dataset was compiled with the data from 32 feeding experiments conducted at 9 different sites. The database contained weekly information on 1507 lactating Holstein Friesian dairy cows regarding their diet composition and <b>feed</b> <b>analysis,</b> together with their individual voluntary feed intake, milk yield (MY), milk composition, parity, days in lactation and days pregnant. Dry matter intake was predicted from feed and animal characteristics. The feed chemical composition and digestibility can be related to feed degradation, bulk volume, intake rate, palatability and other factors influencing feed intake. Therefore, the data of standard <b>feed</b> <b>analysis</b> were used to estimate the satiety value of numerous commonly used feeds and forages. The satiety value is the measure {{of the extent to which}} a feed limits intake. The cows' ability to process the intake-limiting satiety value-units is expressed as the feed intake capacity, which is predicted from parity, days in milk and days of pregnancy which are indicators of the size and physiological state of the cow. This study shows that feed intake can be predicted using a limited number of easy-to-measure inputs that are available on commercial farms, yet reasonably biologically sound. Because the model inputs are not related to animal output (milk yield or body weight), future extension of the intake model with models for the prediction of animal performance is possible...|$|E

40|$|This NebGuide {{provides}} {{tips on how}} {{to determine}} feeds you should analyze and nutrients to measure. It tells how to interpret the results of <b>feed</b> <b>analysis.</b> Why Test Feeds? Nutrient concentration can vary considerably in feeds, especially forages. Protein in alfalfa hay can range from 10 to 25 {{percent or more of the}} dry matter; grass hay will contain between four and 18 percent protein. Use feed tests to target specific feeds to different livestock. Feed high quality forage to the most productive livestock or when nutrient needs are highest. Feed lower quality forage to animals with lower nutrient needs. Feed tests can help establish the dollar value of a forage, in the cash market or in personal use inventories. Use these tests to establish the value of your forage and to help determine what forages to feed, buy, or sell. Forage tests are useful to evaluate production practices like fertilization, time of harvest, method of harvest, etc., that may influence forage quality. Management skills can improve by learning how changes in production practices affect the quality of your forages. Livestock are most productive when fed a ration balanced according to their nutrient needs. Unfortunately, many rations are balanced using average values for each feedstuff. These so-called 2 ̆ 2 book values 2 ̆ 2 often result in over- or under-feeding certain nutrients. More economical and better balanced rations can be formulated using nutrient concentrations determined from <b>feed</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|E
