60|$|The first {{lieutenant}} {{was compelled}} to report both men drowned. The captain was in earnest conversation with an official in plain dark livery. The boat of the <b>harbour</b> <b>police</b> was already waiting below. The whole particulars of the affair were scanty enough. Mr. Sabin and Mr. Watson were seen {{to emerge from the}} gangway together, engaged in animated conversation. They had at first turned to the left, but seeing {{the main body of the}} passengers assembled there, had stepped back again and emerged on the starboard side which was quite deserted. After then, no one except the captain had even a momentary glimpse of them, and his was so brief that it could scarcely be called more than an impression. He had been attracted by a slight cry, he believed from Mr. Sabin, and had seen both men struggling together in the act of disappearing in the water. He had seen none of the details of the fight; he could not even say whether Mr. Sabin or Mr. Watson had been the aggressor, although on that subject there was only one opinion. Mrs. Watson was absolutely overcome, and unable to answer any questions, but as regards the final quarrel and struggle between the two men, it was impossible for her to have seen anything of it, as she was sitting in a steamer chair on the opposite side of the boat. There was at present absolutely no further light to be thrown upon the affair. The sergeant of police signalled for his boat and went off to make his report. The Calipha at half-speed steamed slowly for the dock.|$|E
