5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the <b>informal</b> <b>economy.</b> Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the <b>informal</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to lack {{of skills}} and {{education}} as well as competitive job markets, many slum dwellers face high rates of unemployment. The limit of job opportunities causes many of them to employ themselves in the <b>informal</b> <b>economy,</b> inside the slum or in developed urban areas near the slum. This can sometimes be licit <b>informal</b> <b>economy</b> or illicit <b>informal</b> <b>economy</b> without working contract or any social security.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the labour process within the minibus taxi {{industry}} in East London, South Africa. This industry is structurally situated within the <b>informal</b> sector or <b>economy</b> but is marked by contradictory processes of formalisation and in-formalisation. Though the taxi industry seems to straddle the formal and <b>informal</b> <b>economies</b> in South Africa, the study is conceptually framed {{in terms of the}} informal sector but in a critically-engaged fashion. The very distinction between formal and <b>informal</b> <b>economies,</b> whether in South Africa or elsewhere, is open to dispute; and, even if accepted, there are differing conceptualisations {{of the relationship between the}} ‘two’ economies. Also, the conceptual clarity of the term ‘informal economy’ has been subject to scrutiny, given the vast range of activities it is said to incorporate. While the distinction between formal and <b>informal</b> <b>economies</b> may be a useful conceptual starting-point, this thesis demonstrates that it is analytically useful to speak of degrees and forms of formalisation and in-formalisation along a continuum, rather than to dichotomize economies. The thesis therefore analyses in depth the competing and tension-riddled processes of formalisation and in-formalisation in the minibus taxi industry, and with a specific focus on the labour process...|$|R

40|$|In 2011 author Robert Neuwirth {{identified}} the global <b>informal</b> sector <b>economy</b> {{as having a}} combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that {{is equivalent to the}} second largest economy in the world behind the United States of America (USA). Studies have shown that the <b>informal</b> sector <b>economy</b> is prevalent in Africa and India which are both considered to be emerging market economies with potential for exponential growth. The GDP of a country is calculated using a total of a countries production of goods and services; however production in the <b>informal</b> sector <b>economy</b> is unaccounted for. The inclusion of their production could potentially boost the economic growth of these emerging market economies. This study aims to observe whether the <b>informal</b> sector <b>economy</b> should be formalized or left as it is in its current state. Despite the ‘problem statement’ in the previous paragraph, which appears to be in favour of formalization, there are advantages and disadvantages for both formalizing the <b>informal</b> sector <b>economy</b> and leaving it in its current state.

While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the <b>informal</b> <b>economy</b> in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.|$|E

Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying <b>informal</b> <b>economy</b> rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of <b>informal</b> <b>economy,</b> inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the <b>informal</b> <b>economies</b> of post {{socialism}} as they are practiced in two rural communities {{on either side of}} the Ukrainian-Romanian border, which are now dependent on migrant worker remittances, cross-border small trading and consumption and a wide range of non-market economic practices for not only daily but also long-term survival or social reproduction. As informal economic practices have been sustained and even proliferated in the region, the thesis responds to a need to understand how local communities produce, embed and give meaning to these everyday, routinised practices in the borderlands. The thesis therefore addresses two key questions: How are <b>informal</b> <b>economies</b> in the Ukrainian-Romanian borderlands practiced?; How do communities construct and embed meanings for these practices? The themes of language, citizenship, gender and marriage enable us to understand the processes through which the practices are discursively and performatively given meaning...|$|R

40|$|Roland Barthel {{once said}} that 'myth has the task of giving an {{historical}} intention a natural justification, and making contingency appear eternal. There is a certain myth associated with <b>informal</b> <b>economies</b> that posits these as productive and even natural {{in the same way}} as other enterprises, except that they fall outside the law. The fascinating, subtle and complex chapter by Lobato, Thomas and Hunter put forward a number of examples in constructing this myth. Law in this history develops, in turn, its own myth as an oppressive regulator to be avoided and circumvented if possible - or overlooked or ignored as in the 'Happy Birthday' example. Our purpose is not to contest this account directly but rather to suggest it is not the only possible account. Thus we point to some historical examples thar can be used to construct an alternative myth of <b>informal</b> <b>economies</b> - showing law in a more benign light, as offering a degree of accommodation to economies which are 'informal' in the sense that they are not based around formalised institutional structures and may draw to a substantial extent on amateur contributions. In the end, we suggest that neither myth gives a complete account since both are, in fact, contingent on the role that law selects for itself. As lawyers, we argue that the task for legal policy-makers is to insist on a role for law in regulating <b>informal</b> <b>economies</b> for productive purposes rather than simply supporting the status quo...|$|R
