50|$|This {{operational}} cycle is {{a modification of}} the traditional <b>expander</b> <b>cycle.</b> In the bleed (or open) cycle, instead of routing heated propellant through the turbine and sending it back to be combusted, {{only a small portion}} of the propellant is heated and used to drive the turbine and is then bled off, being vented overboard without going through the combustion chamber. Bleeding off the turbine exhaust allows for a higher turbopump output by decreasing backpressure and maximizing the pressure drop through the turbine. Compared with a standard <b>expander</b> <b>cycle,</b> this leads to higher engine thrust at the cost of sacrificing some efficiency due to essentially wasting the bled propellant by not combusting it.|$|R

In the present study, hot-gas side heat transfer enhancement due to ribbed walls in an <b>expander</b> <b>cycle</b> engine thrust chamber is analyzed by means of a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations solver. As a validation of the solver, a ribbed wall experimental test case is reproduced to assess the capability of the solver to properly capture thermal boundary layer and heat transfer enhancement. In this test case, heat enhancement is quantified by measuring water coolant temperature increase along the duct. Then a simplified coupling procedure is adopted to compare numerical simulation against experimental data. Finally an <b>expander</b> <b>cycle</b> engine thrust chamber is studied focusing on heat transfer enhancement due to ribbed walls, compared to the smooth wall case. In this study the capability of the solver to be employed as a design tool for wall ribbed thrust chambers is shown. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc...|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{necessary}} phase change, the <b>expander</b> <b>cycle</b> is thrust limited by the square-cube rule. As {{the size of a}} bell-shaped nozzle increases with increasing thrust, the nozzle surface area (from which heat can be extracted to expand the fuel) increases as the square of the radius. However, the volume of fuel that must be heated increases as the cube of the radius. Thus there exists a maximum engine size of approximately 300 kN of thrust beyond which there is no longer enough nozzle area to heat enough fuel to drive the turbines and hence the fuel pumps. Higher thrust levels can be achieved using a bypass <b>expander</b> <b>cycle</b> where a portion of the fuel bypasses the turbine and or thrust chamber cooling passages and goes directly to the main chamber injector. Non-toroidal aerospike engines do not suffer from the same limitations because the linear shape of the engine is not subject to the square-cube law. As the width of the engine increases, both the volume of fuel to be heated and the available thermal energy increase linearly, allowing arbitrarily wide engines to be constructed. All <b>expander</b> <b>cycle</b> engines need to use a cryogenic fuel such as hydrogen, methane, or propane that easily reach their boiling points.|$|R
