40|$|Measurement over pins is an {{effective}} way to gauge and control the quality for the manufacture of gears. However, the conventional calculation process for the dimension of over pins is not convenient and accurate enough to meet the requirement of current engineering design. In this paper, with the help of MATLAB, different algorithms are compared and presented. It is found that the matrix method is not accurate and the computer system is easy to crash. The convergence speed of Bisection method is slow and precision level is not accurate enough. The Newton&# 039;s method and Secant method are better approaches for the reverse computation of <b>involute</b> <b>function.</b> Compared with the conventional calculation method and the simulation of SOLIDWORKS, it is confirmed that the Newton&# 039;s method and Secant method are correct. All in all, the methods proposed in this paper enhance the efficiency and accuracy level for the calculation of gear system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract of this article, {{the neural}} {{networks}} {{were applied to}} determine the control template of the gears size circle <b>involute</b> <b>function</b> angle. Neural networks are appropriate for the diagnosis of complex Alvezaawih systems and control because {{of its ability to}} handle data input and output without the need for analytical details of the system. First, we must know the angle to wipe the edge of a tooth surface, with a coordinate measuring machine. We acquire the points entered in standard path of the tooth. Then we execute the neurons on these points to determine the weights is the step that is called learning networks. That last request 94. 41 s. So it becomes all models of the gear standard with the same characteristics. So, if we wanted a control gear of the same module, it will be only a few points seized by CMMs. On the other hand, is looking for the model of the wheel to control the proper starting weight calculated from previous models. His duration of control esteem 1, 6 s. Moreover, we can evaluate the deformities of gear compared to model neurons and the points entered. Finally, the role of this work is the set of model control equipment; we know it contains multiple paths and multivariate parametric complex. So, it's not easy have the control. However, ours, we can know all the deformities of the gears in about 1. 60 s instead of 45 min at least by the test bench, accordingly, we can say that we achieve gear control the automation...|$|E
