5|$|The {{study of}} the {{classification}} or taxonomy of any insect is called systematic <b>entomology.</b> If one works with a more specific order or even a family, the term may also be made specific to that order or family, for example systematic dipterology.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{began to}} quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's {{dramatic}} {{improvement of the}} microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in <b>entomology</b> and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E
5|$|Forensic <b>entomology</b> {{makes use}} of scorpionflies' habit of feeding on human corpses. Scorpionflies were the first insects {{to arrive at a}} donated human cadaver, and {{remained}} on the corpse for one and a half days. The presence of scorpionflies thus indicates that a body must be fresh.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s through the mid-1990s the {{laboratory}} was rededicated to medical and urban <b>entomology,</b> with Professor John Edman running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron Prokopy focusing on orchard pest control. In 1982, the wintering cellar {{in the basement}} of the lab was converted into laboratories, and the workshop was relocated to the garage adjacent to the building that was constructed that same year.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Natural and Exact Sciences was {{established}} in February, 1966, it offers the degree of Bachelor of Science with emphasis in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics, and the Associate of Science in Chemical Technology. It also offers the graduate diplomas in Chemical Technology, <b>Entomology,</b> and Ethnobiology; the graduate degrees by research of Master and Doctor of Science with emphasis in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} of <b>entomology</b> has done several studies in apiculture, chemical ecology, horticultural pollination, {{and the behavior}} of honeybee and bumblebee colonies. Although some research {{was done in the}} apiary yards, the majority of data had to be collected with higher numbers of colonies at different experimental stations.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Thomas {{developed}} {{an interest in}} archaeology, <b>entomology,</b> and ornithology, as well as drawing. In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill {{as a result of a}} flu pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.|$|E
5|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1970s the {{laboratory}} was used mainly for faculty and graduate research, with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced beekeeping {{as well as}} a single course offered to the public in the summers. There was a brief time in the spring semesters of 2001 and 2002 that an introductory course in beekeeping was offered, however, with the reorganization of the department of <b>entomology</b> these classes have since ceased.|$|E
5|$|Research, in 2008, by {{scientists}} from Pennsylvania State University found {{high levels of}} the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals {{have been used to}} try to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. Researchers from Washington State University, under <b>entomology</b> professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, the micro-world of biology was just {{beginning}} to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude microscopes since the late 16th century, and Robert Hooke published the seminal Micrographia based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in <b>entomology</b> and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} that Gates was there, {{research}} focused mainly on honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities {{from day to day}} as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical <b>entomology</b> research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E
5|$|John S. Clark {{was born}} on 21 March 1885 in Glasgow, Scotland, to parents James Souttar Clark, a coach-painter, and Maggie Clark (née Scott). At an early age, Clark had an {{interest}} in <b>entomology</b> throughout his years in Glasgow and adult life in Australia. Clark migrated to Australia in 1905 with little formal education but found himself working for the state railways in Queensland. There, he found an interest in ants and made his first collection of specimens in North Queensland. In May 1908, Clark married his first wife, Maggie Forbes, at the Cairns Presbyterian Church. After their marriage, they moved to Geraldton in Western Australia, where Clark worked for the railways as a wheelwright. He had one son and three daughters with Forbes; Forbes would later die from heart disease in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Research at Simla {{formally}} {{began in}} 1950. Beebe's research at Simla combined elements {{of many different}} earlier stages of his research, including observations of the life cycles of the area's birds, detailed analyses of every plant and animal in small areas of forest, and studies of insect behavior. Insects were {{the focus of the}} scientific papers he produced during this period, marking a transition from his past areas of study into the field of <b>entomology.</b> Local children periodically brought animal specimens to Beebe at Simla and asked him to classify them. Remembering the early studies of his own childhood, in which he had brought specimens to the American Museum of Natural History, he was happy working with them.|$|E
5|$|Song Ci {{also shared}} his opinion that having the accused suspect {{of the murder}} present at the autopsy of his victim, in close {{proximity}} to the grieving relatives of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions. In the earliest known case of forensic <b>entomology,</b> a villager was hacked to death with a sickle, which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to lay down their sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which sickle still had unseen remnants of the victim's blood; when it became apparent which sickle was used as the murder weapon, the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot.|$|E
5|$|The banker Charles Rothschild devoted much of {{his time}} to <b>entomology,</b> {{creating}} a large collection of fleas now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum, London. He discovered and named the plague vector flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, also known as the oriental rat flea, in 1903. Using what was probably the world's most complete collection of fleas of about 260,000 specimens (representing some 73% of the 2,587 species and subspecies so far described), he described around 500 species and subspecies of Siphonaptera. He was followed in this interest by his daughter Miriam Rothschild, who helped to catalogue his enormous collection of the insects in seven volumes.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of <b>Entomology</b> in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
5|$|Forensic entomology: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{forensic}} science book Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer Song Ci in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic <b>entomology.</b> In {{a murder case}} of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a sickle; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved. The local magistrate had the villagers assemble {{in the town square}} where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.|$|E
5|$|Outside urban areas, the redback is {{more often}} found in drier {{habitats}} ranging from sclerophyll forest to desert, even as harsh as the Simpson Desert. It became much more common in urban areas {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, and is now found in all but the most inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Perth and Alice Springs. The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences. Webs are usually built in dry, dark, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, tree hollows, shrubs, old tyres, sheds, outhouses, empty tins and boxes, children's toys or under rubbish or litter. Letterboxes and the undersurface of toilet seats are common sites. Populations can be controlled by clearing these habitats, squashing the spiders and their egg sacs, and using pesticide in outhouses. The CSIRO Division of <b>Entomology</b> recommends against the use of spider pesticides due to their toxicity, and because redbacks are rapid recolonists anyway.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{there have}} been several {{accounts}} of applications for, and experimentation with, forensic <b>entomology.</b> The concept of forensic <b>entomology</b> dates back to at least the 13th century. However, only in the last 30 years has forensic <b>entomology</b> been systematically explored as a feasible source for evidence in criminal investigations. Through their own experiments and interest in arthropods and death, Sung Tzu, Francesco Redi, Bergeret d’Arbois, Jean Pierre Mégnin and the physiologist Hermann Reinhard have helped to lay the foundations for today's modern forensic <b>entomology.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{case that}} shaped Canadian {{judicial}} history and brought forensic <b>entomology</b> into the headlines was the exoneration of Steven Truscott forty-eight years after being indicted for murder. Forensic <b>entomology</b> {{also played a}} role in the investigation of the 1993 raid on David Koresh and the Branch Davidians. Due to the publicity given to these cases, forensic <b>entomology</b> was able to seep further into popular culture.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Louis François Etienne Bergeret (1814–1893) was a French {{hospital}} physician, and was {{the first}} to apply forensic <b>entomology</b> to a case. In a case report published in 1855 he stated a general life cycle for insects and made many assumptions about their mating habits. Nevertheless, these assumptions led him to the first application of forensic <b>entomology</b> in an estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI). His report used forensic <b>entomology</b> as tool to prove his hypothesis on how and when the person had died.|$|E

25|$|The first {{systematic}} {{study in}} forensic <b>entomology</b> {{was conducted in}} 1881 by Hermann Reinhard, a German medical doctor who played {{a vital role in}} the history of forensic <b>entomology.</b> He exhumed many bodies and demonstrated that the development of many different types of insect species could be tied to buried bodies. Reinhard conducted his first study in east Germany, and collected many Phorid flies from this initial study. He also concluded that the development of only some of the insects living with corpses underground were associated with them, since there were 15-year-old beetles who had little direct contact with them. Reinhard's works and studies were used extensively in further forensic <b>entomology</b> studies.|$|E
