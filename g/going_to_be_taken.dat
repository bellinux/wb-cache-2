500|$|In January 1900, Southern Cross returned, {{picked up}} the shore party and, {{following}} the route which Ross had taken 60years previously, sailed southward to the Great Ice Barrier, which they discovered had retreated some [...] south {{since the days of}} Ross. A party consisting of Borchgrevink, William Colbeck and a Sami named Per Savio landed with sledges and dogs. This party ascended the Barrier and made the first sledge journey on the barrier surface; on 16 February 1900 they extended the Farthest South record to 78°50'S. On its return to England later in 1900, Borchgrevink's expedition was received without enthusiasm, despite its new southern record. Historian David Crane commented that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his contribution to Antarctic knowledge might have been better received, but [...] "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> seriously".|$|E

What's fantastic about [...] was I was able to plan it while I was on another tour that was on a much smaller scale, opening for the Dolls. This is going to be, like, the ultimate creative orgasm for me 'cause I'm ready to move on. I'm not restricted to a certain structure for my show anymore. No limitations. I'm free. [...] I {{want to have a}} clear schedule of the dimensions for each venue so that we can properly execute all the technology and visuals. I need to mentally prepare days in advance if things are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> out; otherwise, I won't have a good show...Every show's gonna be an A show by the time I'm done screaming at everyone– 'Hang it! Hang everything! Find a place to hang it!' That's gonna be my motto." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{geographical}} establishments in Britain {{and abroad}} {{were slow to}} give formal recognition to the expedition. The Royal Geographical Society gave Borchgrevink a fellowship, and other medals and honours eventually followed from Norway, Denmark and the United States, but the expedition's achievements were not widely recognised. Markham persisted in his attacks on Borchgrevink, describing him as cunning and unprincipled; Amundsen's warm tribute was a lone approving voice. Scott's biographer David Crane surmises that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his expedition would have been treated differently in Britain, but [...] "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> seriously". A belated recognition came in 1930, long after Markham's death, when the Royal Geographical Society presented Borchgrevink with its Patron's Medal. It admitted that [...] "justice had not been done {{at the time to}} the pioneer work of the Southern Cross expedition", and that the magnitude of the difficulties it had overcome had previously been underestimated. After the expedition, Borchgrevink lived quietly, largely out of the public eye. He died in Oslo on 21 April 1934.|$|E

500|$|Arthur R. Marshall led {{the efforts}} to undo the damage. According to Douglas, Marshall was {{successful}} in portraying the Everglades from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes to Florida Bayincluding the atmosphere, climate, and limestoneas a single organism. Rather than remaining the preserve of conservation organizations, the cause of restoring the Everglades became a priority for politicians. Douglas observed, [...] "Marshall accomplished the extraordinary magic of taking the Everglades out of the bleeding-hearts category forever". At the insistent urging of Marshall, newly elected Governor Bob Graham announced {{the formation of the}} [...] "Save Our Everglades" [...] campaign in 1983, and in 1985 Graham lifted the first shovel of backfill for a portion of the C-38 canal. Within a year the area was covered with water returning to its original state. Graham declared that by the year 2000, the Everglades would resemble its predrainage state as much as possible. The Kissimmee River Restoration Project was approved by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992. The project was estimated to cost $578million to convert only [...] of the canal; the cost was designed to be divided between the state of Florida and the U.S. government, with the state being responsible for purchasing land to be restored. A project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers explained in 2002, [...] "What we're doing on this scale is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to a larger scale when we do the restoration of the Everglades". The entire project is estimated to be completed by 2011.|$|E

2500|$|After {{recording}} {{her third}} studio album, As I Am, Keys began to [...] "find {{the way to}} totally be myself and what that meant; figuring out what choices I wanted to make and not make in order to truly honor myself". She described The Element of Freedom as diverse, but noted {{that there is a}} [...] "balance". She explained that [...] "one side is strong and one side is vulnerable", which she pointed to as the theme of the album. The album has a [...] "strong, edgy feel", but is also [...] "intimate and vulnerable and delicate". While on BET's 106 & Park, she described the album: [...] "The way that the songs progress [...] are gonna take you on a natural high. I just want you to feel a sense of freedom, I want you to feel out-of-the-box, feel inspired, You're definitely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> on a trip, I know you're going to be shocked, you're going to hear things that you probably didn't think that I would sound like. It's a journey." [...] Keys revealed to The Times that in the period she was recording the album, she listened to artists such as Genesis, Tears for Fears, Fleetwood Mac and The Police.|$|E

60|$|Kit was tired, for he {{had been}} on the moor since morning and had not eaten much. It was an awkward matter to find the sheep, and then the men and dogs had some {{difficulty}} to keep the ewes moving, because the Herdwick never willingly leaves the neighborhood where it was born and will, if possible, return. The lambs, now grown large and fat, gave less trouble, and when they sometimes stopped irresolutely while the ewes tried to break away Kit understood their hesitation. Two instincts were at work: it was natural to follow their dams, but Mireside was their native heath and they knew they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> home.|$|E

How she had done it was not quite known to Phyllis herself. In those days unequal marriages were regarded rather {{as a violation of}} the laws of nature than as a mere infringement of convention, the more modern view, and hence when Phyllis, of the watering- place bourgeoisie, was chosen by such a gentlemanly fellow, {{it was as if she}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to heaven, though perhaps the uninformed would have seen no great difference in the respective positions of the pair, the said Gould being as poor as a crow.|$|E

No: he walked at once from the counter to the door--turned round there, and asked where Joanna Grice lived. The young man answered, the second turning to the right, down a street, which ended in a lane of cottages. Miss Grice's was the last cottage on the left hand; but he could assure the gentleman that it would be quite useless to go there, for she let nobody in.
