50|$|The {{avalanche}} {{mechanism is}} shown in the accompanying diagram. The electric field is applied across a gaseous medium; initial ions are created with ionising radiation (for example, cosmic rays). An original ionisation event produces an ion pair; the positive ion accelerates towards the cathode while the free electron accelerates towards the anode. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron can gain sufficient velocity (energy) to liberate another electron when it next collides with a molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause further <b>impact</b> <b>ionisations,</b> and so on. This process is effectively a chain reaction that generates free electrons. The total number of electrons reaching the anode is equal to the number of collisions, plus the single initiating free electron. Initially, the number of collisions grows exponentially. The limit to the multiplication in an electron avalanche is known as the Raether limit.|$|R

The large orbital velocities of dust particles in interplanetary space (typically 10-40 km/s) make intact particle capture problematic. Instead, in-situ dust detectors are generally devised to measure parameters associated with the high-velocity impact of dust particles on the instrument, and then derive physical properties of the particles (usually mass and velocity) through laboratory calibration (i.e. impacting accelerated particles with known properties onto a laboratory replica of the dust detector).

50|$|A speedy {{switching}} device is an NPN avalanche transistor {{fitted with a}} coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its collector-base junction. This voltage is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by <b>impact</b> <b>ionisation,</b> but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the emitter-base junction is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely fired, voltages everywhere drop, each switch avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base-emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge carriers to drain out of its collector-base junction.|$|E

Hyphenating gas chromatography with high resolution TOF-MS technology with soft atmospheric pressure ionisation (APCI) can preserve the molecular ion information and delivers accurate mass and isotopic pattern information. This data enables a sum formula generation for known and unknown target compounds. Additionally, optionally acquired MS/ MS data can extend the capabilities for structural elucidation. Mass accuracy, resolution and isotopic fidelity are independent of the TOFMS acquisition rate. Therefore, these instruments can be coupled to gas chromatography, which typically delivers narrow peak width requiring fast MS scan speeds.

The case of high electric field strength, which results in high-energy, non-thermal electrons, is analysed in detail at sub-breakdown conditions. The rates of inelastic collisions and the energy exchange between electrons and neutrals in the reaction zone of the flame are characterised quantitatively. The analysis includes attachment, <b>ionisation,</b> <b>impact</b> dissociation, and vibrational and electronic excitation processes. Our results suggest that Townsend breakdown occurs for E/N = 140 Td. Vibrational excitation is the dominant process up to breakdown, despite important rates of electronic excitation of CO, CO 2 and N 2 as well as impact dissociation of O 2 being apparent from 50 Td onwards.

The observed trends are largely independent of equivalence ratio. In the non-thermal regime, electron transport coefficients are insensitive to mixture composition and approximately constant across the flame, but are highly dependent on the electric field strength.
