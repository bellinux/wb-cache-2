40|$|BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron supplementation is used {{widely in}} {{haemodialysis}} patients. However, nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which increases after intravenous supplementation of <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate,</b> {{has been suggested}} {{to act as a}} catalytic agent in oxygen radical formation in vitro and may thus contribute to endothelial impairment in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 20 healthy volunteers the effect of 100 mg <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate</b> infusion was investigated. Vascular ultrasound was used to assess endothelium-dependent vasodilatation at baseline, and 10 and 240 min after <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate</b> infusion. Whole blood was collected to measure NTBI and in vivo radical formation was assessed by electron spin resonance. A time-control study was performed using saline infusion. RESULTS: Infusion of <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate</b> induces a greater than fourfold increase in NTBI, as well as a transient, significant (P < 0. 01) reduction of flow-mediated dilatation 10 min after infusion of <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate,</b> when compared with saline. The generation of superoxide in whole blood increased significantly 10 and 240 min after infusion of <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate</b> by, respectively, 70 and 53 %. CONCLUSIONS: Iron infusion at a currently used therapeutic dose for intravenous iron supplementation leads to increased oxygen radical stress and acute endothelial dysfunctio...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{appears to}} play a major role in {{catalysing}} free radical production, leading to lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. We, therefore, investigated the effect of colloidal iron deposited in the peritoneum. Wistar male rats were given either <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate,</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate</b> and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), NTA or saline. NTA was shown previously to 'free ' iron to promote lipid peroxidation and an iron chelate of NTA is known to be carcinogenic to the kidney. Iron at a dose of 5 mg kg- ' day-', and saline at a dose of 0. 5 ml day-' were injected i. p. for 3 months. NTA at a dose of 83. 5 mg kg- ' day- ' was give i. p for 5 months. All the rats were killed about a year later for histological examination. In nine of the 19 rats treated with <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate,</b> mesothelial tumors were induced in the serosa of the tunica vaginalis or the length of the spermatic cord. Among rats treated with <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate</b> and NTA, seven had localised mesotheliomas in the above locations and six had wide-spread peritoneal mesotheliomas. No mesothelial tumors developed in either NTA treated or saline treated rats. No pleural mesotheliomas were found in any group. These findings add to the evidence that iron is involved in some carcinogenic processes. In our previous reports, we demonstrated that an iron chelate, ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA), causes severe acute and subacute nephrotoxicity by lipid peroxidation (Hamazak...|$|E
40|$|About {{a fourth}} {{of the people in}} the world suffer from anemia. The most major and {{effective}} ways of reducing anemia and iron deficiency in the society are iron fortification of food and improving the iron absorption. In this method a certain amount of iron in the form of capsulation is added to the food ingredients which are the main food of the people and are eaten every day. Encapsulation will decrease undesirable changes and iron interaction with the other food ingredients, moreover can usefully affects the bioavailability of iron. The present study describes iron fortification of hydrated and dehydrated food products in which <b>ferric</b> <b>saccharate</b> is as a core and calcium alginate is as a capsule coating. To evaluate the performance range, time and size of the microcapsules, the dispersion method was compared in three ways of extrusion with nozzle, extrusion with needle and emulsion. After studying the experiments and their results, it was observed that microsized capsules can be produced using the extrusion with needle and extrusion with nozzle methods also nanosized capsules can be obtained using the emulsification and spray methods...|$|E

40|$|Morphological {{changes of}} the liver of the rats which had {{sustained}} common bile duct ligation for twenty-four to seventy two hours were studied by staining with hematoxylin-eosin and Periodic acid Schiff reaction. Histochemical stainings for enzymatic activity such as acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, 5 '-nucleotidase and adenosintriphosphatase were also applied. In other rats, <b>saccharated</b> <b>ferric</b> oxide was injected in the common bile duct at various intervals after common bile duct ligation and then liver sections were stained with iron reaction. Following results were obtained. 1) In the normal liver, canalicular-sinusoidal connections were more numerous in the central area than in the peripheral zone of the lobule. The number of the connections ranged from several to some dozen per 5 micron section of a lodule. 2) The width of canalicular-sinusoidal connections was increased after 24 hours of common bile duct ligation and both the number and width of the connections showed increase after 48 hours of ligation. 3) Under conditions of common bile duct ligation and administration of <b>saccharated</b> <b>ferric</b> oxide by intrabiliary injection, iron reaction-positive granules were found in canalicular-sinusoidal connections as a linear deposit. 4) Main route for the regurgitation of biliary contents at the early stage of obstructive jaundie is presumed to be canalicular-sinusoidal connections...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a case of}} insufficiency fracture of medial proximal tibia caused by long-term administration of <b>saccharated</b> <b>ferric</b> oxide (SFO) in a 77 -year-old female. In this case, 2 -year administration of SFO for iron deficit anemia induced hypophosphatemic osteomalacia and finally resulted in an insufficiency fracture of medial proximal tibia. Hypophosphatemia and pain due to the insufficiency fracture were recovered promptly by withdrawing SFO administration and rest. This case represented varus deformity of the knee associated with osteoarthritis, which may also cause the insufficiency fracture of medial proximal tibia in addition to osteomalacia due to long-term administration of SFO. Long-term SFO administration should be avoided because of a definitive risk of osteomalacia and fragile fracture...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{that a high}} hematocrit value and high hemoglobin concentration {{are the most important}} conditions which have to be fulfilled in order to achieve top racing results has resulted in a massive use of iron preparations in healthy horses. This specially implies in racing horses during intensive training aiming at the prevention of the so-called racing anemia. By studying the effects of the most commonly used iron preparations in Serbia and Montenegro (Fedex®, as the representative of dextrane iron preparations; Hippirion ® as a well known representative of iron complexed to saccharate and Hemo ® 15 which is a representative of complex iron preparations which contain other hemantics) the expected changes in erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit value were recorded. However, the recorded changes in hematological values did differ between used iron preparations. The best effects were exhibited by Hemo® 15, the application of which resulted in a prompt and significant increase in erythrocyte count, MCH, MCHC and hemoglobin concentration.

40|$|The {{injection}} {{into the}} cerebrospinal fluid of cats of 52 to 208 gamma of copper {{in the form}} of an albumin complex or as cupric sulfate, was followed by small elevations in the content of metal in the neural tissues, but regularly and promptly produced persistent quadriplegia and conspicuous histologic changes. Smaller amounts of copper caused less, or no, neurologic manifestations or histologic alterations. The earliest lesions were essentially unaccompanied by inflammation and were initially characterized by hydropic swelling of the myelin sheaths. They progressed rapidly to focal necrosis of all parenchymal components with marked degeneration of myelin and axis cylinders in the peripheral margins of the spinal cord, brain stem, mid-brain, and cerebrum. These histologic changes did not occur in neural tissues incubated in vitro in solutions of the copper-albumin complex. They did not appear in animals injected intraventricularly with <b>ferric</b> sulfate or <b>saccharated</b> iron. Considered together, the findings make it clear that copper in concentrations comparable to those present in the neural tissues of patients with Wilson's disease has the property of profoundly altering neural function and causing conspicuous morphologic alterations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Oxidative {{stress and}} smoking {{contribute}} to endothelial dysfunction. Iron might {{also play a}} role in oxidative stress generation and endothelial dysfunction. However, the involvement of iron in smoking-induced endothelial dysfunction in healthy smokers remains unclear. Therefore, we examined here whether (1) intravenous iron infusion impaired endothelial function evaluated by flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) in non-smokers, and (2) deferoxamine, a potent iron chelator, ameliorated endothelial dysfunction in healthy smokers. METHODS: Eight healthy young male non-smokers (23 ± 4 years old) received intravenous injection of <b>saccharated</b> <b>ferric</b> oxide (0. 7 mg/kg body weight), while 10 age-matched healthy male smokers received deferoxamine mesylate (8. 3 mg/kg body weight). At baseline, 5 and 20 minutes after treatment with iron or deferoxamine, biochemical variables were measured, including serum iron and marondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid oxidation, and endothelial function was simultaneously evaluated by FMD. RESULTS: Compared with non-smokers, FMD was significantly lower in smokers. Iron and MDA levels were significantly increased, whereas FMD was impaired by iron infusion in non-smokers. Conversely, deferoxamine treatment significantly decreased iron and MDA levels and restored the decreased FMD in smokers. Baseline serum iron and MDA levels in all 18 subjects (non-smokers and smokers) were correlated with each other. There was a significant inverse correlation between the changes in MDA values and FMD from baseline in 18 men. Endothelium-independent vasodilation by glyceryl trinitrate was unaltered by either treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our present study suggests that iron-evoked oxidative stress might play a role in endothelial dysfunction in healthy smokers...|$|R
40|$|Intravenous iron {{administration}} induces oxidation of {{serum albumin}} in hemodialysis patients. BackgroundIntravenous iron administration (IVIR) is effective for correcting anemia in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, {{it may also}} enhance the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Recently, plasma proteins have been demonstrated to be extremely susceptible to oxidative stress. Therefore, we investigated the effect of IVIR on the oxidative status of albumin, a major plasma protein, in HD patients. MethodsEleven hemodialysis (HD) patients were treated with 40 mg of <b>saccharated</b> <b>ferric</b> oxide intravenously after every dialysis session for four weeks, and 11 age-/gender-matched HD patients were treated with vehicle. We performed high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of serum albumin and determined the levels of reduced and oxidized albumin. Carbonyl formation of plasma proteins were also measured using an anti- 2, 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine antibody in patients with or without IVIR. ResultsIVIR resulted {{in an increase in}} both disulfide form (f(HNA- 1)) and oxidized form (f(HNA- 2)) of albumin in HD patients (36. 0 ± 6. 03 vs. 41. 7 ± 6. 27; 5. 46 ± 1. 50 vs. 8. 7 ± 2. 22, respectively, P < 0. 05). The findings here also show that IVIR substantially increased plasma protein carbonyl content by oxidizing albumin. In addition, we found a strong correlationbetween plasma carbonyl content and the levels of oxidized albumin (f(HNA- 1) and f(HNA- 2)) in HD patients (R = 0. 674 and R = 0. 724, respectively, P < 0. 01). ConclusionThe results {{of this study indicate that}} the HPLC analysis of serum albumin represents a potentially useful method for the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of oxidative stress in HD patients, and strongly suggest the possibility that oxidative stress, generated by IVIR, enhances the oxidation of albumin in those patients...|$|R
