We should indeed be ungrateful were we to deplore {{the absence of}} all those things flowers, or landscape, or faces whose mere {{reflection}} it might have been. Nevertheless, let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; not yet, at all events. An art cannot be raised {{to the level of}} a pure effusion at the first step.This is understood by the cubist painters, who indefatigably study pictorial form and the space which it engenders.This space we have negligently confounded with pure visual space or with Euclidian space. Euclid, in one of his postulates, speaks of the <b>indeformability</b> of figures in movement, so we need notinsist upon this point.If we wished to relate the space of the Cubist painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.As for visual space, we know that it results from the agreement of the sensations of convergence and [...] "accommodation" [...] in the eye.|$|E
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{model of}} plane circular arches with rigid sections is introduced. Suitable strain measures are deﬁned as diﬀerences from rigid displacements. If the arch is thin, constitutive arguments make the shearing strain negligible. Hence, the shearing <b>indeformability</b> will be assumed as inner constraint. By {{means of a}} formal power series expansion of the exact measures of deformation, it is shown that the shearing <b>indeformability</b> implies some constraints on the axial strain. In particular, the ﬁrst-order axial strain must vanish {{in the case of}} inﬁnitesimal displacements. The same procedure is applied to the pure ﬂexible arch, in order to compare the two sets of results. It is shown that the hypothesis of ﬁnite pure ﬂexibility is not compatible with small deformations of the arch. An example is provided to evaluate the eﬀects of the two constraints at the ﬁrst non-linear step of the perturbation expansions...|$|E
40|$|A direct {{one-dimensional}} {{beam model}} has the kinematics {{described by the}} axis displacement, {{the rotation of the}} cross-sections and an average measure of warping. Mechanical actions on the beam are the dual of the velocities. Balancing external and internal power yields local balance equations for the mechanical actions. Shear <b>indeformability</b> and a linear relationship between twist and warping are assumed as inner constraints; non-linear hyperelastic constitutive relations are formulated. Field equations in terms of displacements are obtained, and the possibilities of buckling in a two-bar frame are examined. The critical load is found for both the in- and the out-of-plane bifurcation. In the latter case, the post-buckling path is investigated...|$|E
40|$|A direct {{one-dimensional}} {{beam model}} is kinematical ly {{described by the}} axis displacement, {{the rotation of the}} cross-sections and an average measure of their warping. The mechanical power is introduced as a linear functional of the kinematic descriptors and their ﬁrst derivatives: the mechanical actions natural ly result as duals of the former ones. By means of the balance between external and internal power, the local balance equations for the mechanical actions are obtained. Inner constraints of shear <b>indeformability</b> and of a linear relationship between twist and warping are assumed, and non-linear hyperelastic constitutive relations are formulated. Thus, ﬁeld equations in terms of displacements are obtained, and the various possibilities of buckling in a two-bar frame are examined. The critical value of the load multiplier is found for both the in-plane (single) and the out-of-plane (coupled) bifurcations...|$|E
40|$|A direct {{one-dimensional}} {{beam model}} is adopted. Kinematics {{is described by}} axis displacement, rigid rotation of the cross-section and an average measure of warping. Mechanical power is introduced as a linear functional of the kinematic descriptors and their first derivatives, hence mechanical actions naturally result as their duals. In particular, the bi-shear and bi-moment {{turn out to be}} quantities spending power on the warping and on its first derivative, respectively. Assuming as basic postulate the balance between external and internal power, local equilibrium equations for the mechanical actions are obtained. In addition to the standard inner constraint of shear <b>indeformability,</b> a linear relationship between twist and warping is assumed. To obtain field equations in terms of displacements, non-linear hyperelastic constitutive relations are formulated. Two coupled bifurcations for axially loaded beams are examined: in the first case no coupling occurs, in the second the beam can be sensitive to initial imperfections. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.
