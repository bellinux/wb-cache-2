Milwaukee folk-rockers The Violent Femmes imagined the president as [...] "Old Mother Reagan", a dangerously senile grandmother who tries in vain to enter heaven {{in one of the}} group's most fiercely political songs. The same year jam band Phish made their own overt case against the president, sung as a letter to the first lady. Originally titled [...] "Memo to Ronnie Reagan", the song [...] "Dear Mrs. Reagan" [...] mimics Bob Dylan's protest music of the 1960s but rails against Mrs. Reagan's <b>Just</b> <b>Say</b> <b>No</b> anti-drug campaign. The band continued to perform it until Reagan left office in January 1989.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing his {{commentary}} on government indifference toward AIDS, Kramer wrote <b>Just</b> <b>Say</b> <b>No,</b> A Play about a Farce in 1988. [...] He highlights the sexual hypocrisy in the Reagan and Koch administrations that allowed AIDS {{to become an}} epidemic; it concerns a First Lady, her gay son, and the closeted gay mayor of America's [...] "largest northeastern city". Its New York production, starring Kathleen Chalfant, Tonya Pinkens, and David Margulies, was prized by the few who came to see it after its negative review by The New York Times. Social critic and writer Susan Sontag wrote of the piece, [...] "Larry Kramer is one of America's most valuable troublemakers. I hope he never lowers his voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, stress {{over the}} closing of his play <b>Just</b> <b>Say</b> <b>No,</b> {{only a few weeks}} after its opening, forced Kramer into the {{hospital}} after it aggravated a congenital hernia. While in surgery, doctors discovered liver damage due to Hepatitis B, prompting Kramer to learn that he was HIV positive. In 2001, at the age 66, Kramer was in dire need of a liver transplant, but he was turned down by Mount Sinai Hospital's organ transplant list. People living with HIV were routinely considered inappropriate candidates for organ transplants because of complications from HIV and perceived short lifespans. Out of the 4,954 liver transplants performed in the United States, only 11 were for HIV-positive people. The news prompted Newsweek to announce Kramer was dying in June 2001, and the Associated Press in December of the same year to claim Kramer had died. Kramer became a symbol for infected people who had new leases on life due to advances in medicine. [...] "We shouldn't face a death sentence because of who we are or who we love", he said in an interview. In May 2001, the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute at the University of Pittsburgh– which had performed more transplants for HIV positive patients than any other facility in the world– accepted Kramer on its list. Kramer received a new liver on December 21, 2001.|$|E

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} general {{background}} explained above, there are other similar and unique courting practices adhered to by Filipinos in other {{different regions of the}} Philippine archipelago. In the island of Luzon, the Ilocanos also perform serenading, known to them as tapat (literally, [...] "to be in front of" [...] the home of the courted woman), which is similar to the harana and also to the balagtasan of the Tagalogs. The suitor begins singing a romantic song, then the courted lady responds by singing too. In reality, Harana is a musical exchange of messages which can be about waiting or loving or <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>no.</b> The suitor initiates, the lady responds. As the Pamamaalam stage sets in, the suitor sings one last song and the haranistas disappear in the night.|$|R

Dawkins writes that he is not so much bewildered by their belief in a cosmic lawgiver, but by their beliefs in the minutiae of Christianity, such as the resurrection and forgiveness of sins, and that such scientists, in Britain and in the U.S., are the subject of bemused bafflement among their peers. Polkinghorne responded that [...] "debating with Dawkins is hopeless, because there's no give and take. He doesn't give you an inch.

40|$|The {{research}} {{focused on}} the Youth Awareness Program (YAP), which provides information, advice, and counseling to young people, {{with a focus on}} drug education workshops provided in schools and youth clubs. YAP employs young people, many of whom have direct experience of drug abuse, to other young people. Results revealed that the workshops had an important role in consolidating antidrug opinions and reinforcing decisions not to use drugs for participants who had not used drugs. The workshops also appeared to discourage participants who already misused drugs from developing and extending their drug repertoires. Findings also indicated that youths' reliance on informal sources of information about drugs makes it vital to provide them with accurate information and advice that they can obtain with minimal effort. Findings also indicated that the acceptability of drug use to young people has been greatly overstated, that youth are active agents in the educational process, and that the central involvement of formal drug users is a crucial part of providing credible drug information to young people. Finally, peer education projects that are based around former drug users and that avoid approaches involving <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> <b>no</b> can be effective in imparting harm reduction information to young people, can reinforce the decisions of nonusers, and can reduce drug use among current users.
