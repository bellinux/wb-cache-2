The criteria {{set out in}} this document relate to compliance {{with the requirements of}} the providers of Air Traffic Services. It details common criteria with the aim of harmonising the maximum exploitation of the capabilities of RNAV equipment. The document covers the requirements for the initial implementation of Basic Area Navigation as well as the requirements for longer-term application of systems meeting the RNP Minimum Aviation System Performance for RNP Area Navigation. The document covers the requirements for both en-route and in the Terminal Airspace...|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the transition from legacy protocols to this new <b>standard</b> <b>EUROCONTROL</b> launched a project called ECG (European or EATM Communications Gateway) to develop a gateway between AFTN and AMHS. The ECG {{was developed by the}} French manufacturer THALES and the German manufacturer COMSOFT. Meanwhile, nearly all AMHS systems in Europe are derived from the ECG (see table below).|$|R
40|$|According to the Single European Sky (SES) regulation, each change {{carried out}} at the Air Navigation Services (ANS) or each new system {{implemented}} in these services must come {{with the development of}} a Safety Assessment. There is need to demonstrate that the change intended to be implemented is safe. This is what is being sought with the development of this project. On one hand, to perform a conceptual design of an instrument approach procedure for helicopters based on satellite navigation in uncontrolled airspace in the United Kingdom. This first task implies the implementation of a new system in the Airspace, first requirement to perform a Safety Assessment. The results of this activity are gathered in this document by {{a brief description of the}} methodology applied for the development of the procedure, as well as the navigation charts belonging to the results obtained. On the other hand, and as the main pillar of this project, an assessment on the safety consequences because of a possible application of the procedure designed has been developed. This second section of the project seeks to determine whether this change in the airspace infrastructure involve a risk for the users or conversely, it is a safe procedure. In order to determine and document the impact of this new procedure in the Air Navigation Services it has been applied a methodology developed by Eurocontrol also known as the Safety Assessment Methodology. Results of this evaluation will be described according to <b>Eurocontrol</b> <b>standards.</b> In addition, this project intends to go one step further in the implementation of satellite-based procedures, and the approach to the heliport will be located at an uncontrolled helipad. This is also a challenge from the safety point of view. Finally, it has been concluded that it is possible to implement this procedure despite being located in uncontrolled airspace as long as the mitigation means proposed in this project are applied...|$|R
