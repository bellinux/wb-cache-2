25|$|Sandstone slip gate piers {{are found}} at the bottom entry point to the Buchans field beside the {{pedestrian}} footpath. Such slip gates were built {{with a series of}} <b>downward</b> <b>facing</b> 'L'-shaped grooves {{on one side and a}} matching concavity on the other gatepost. Wood bars could then be inserted across and parallel, giving a gate without a hinge. These are sometimes still found in the countryside at large, but they are almost always adapted to carry metal hinged gates. In some areas wood rather than stone was used to construct this type of hinge-less gatepost.|$|E
500|$|The strict {{definition}} {{requires that}} a plant must possess morphological adaptations that attract prey through scent or visual cues, capture and retain prey (e.g., the waxy scales of Brocchinia reducta or <b>downward</b> <b>facing</b> hairs of Heliamphora prevent escape), digest the dead prey through enzymes {{produced by the}} plant, and [...] the products of digestion through specialized structures. The presence of commensals is also listed as strong evidence of a long evolutionary history of carnivory. By this definition, many sun pitcher plants (Heliamphora) and the cobra lily (Darlingtonia californica)s apparent lack of proteolytic enzymes. Ellison and Farnsworth (2005) also notes that Darlingtonia instead relies on [...] "a food web of bacteria, protozoa, mites, and fly larvae" [...] to break down captured prey (Naeem, 1988; Nielsen, 1990). would not be included on a roster of carnivorous plants because they rely on symbiotic bacteria and other organisms to produce the necessary proteolytic enzymes.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of merely}} {{reinforcing}} the {{sound like a}} traditional public address system, the sound system on the trellis system seeks to replicate the acoustics of a concert hall, and create a clearly defined concert space. Noise from city disturbances is masked by sound arriving directly from lateral sources. <b>Downward</b> <b>facing</b> acoustic enhancement speakers simulate sound reflection similar to indoor concert hall wall and ceiling effects. While Chicago Tribune music critic John von Rhein felt the inaugural concert's sound quality was [...] "a work in progress" [...] that varied with the listener's location in the pavilion, critics Kevin Nance and Wayne Delacoma of the Chicago Sun-Times said that even on the opening weekend {{it was clear that}} the acousticians, Talaske Group, and Gehry had solved many of the problems and mysteries of the outdoor presentation of classical music. John von Rhein subsequently noted in 2005 [...] "the system has been fine-tuned over the past two summers and now delivers a warm, even approximation of concert-hall sound to listeners at even the farthest reaches of the lawn.|$|E

2500|$|The Berlin U-Bahn uses 750-volt DC {{electric}} trains {{that run}} on standard gauge ( [...] ) tracks. [...] The first trains were based on trams; they have a width of , and take their power from an upward facing third rail. [...] To accommodate greater passenger numbers without lengthening the trains—which would require costly extended platforms—trains that ran on lines built after World War I were required to be wider. [...] The original trains and lines, which continued to operate, were designated Kleinprofil (small profile), and the newer, wider trains and lines were designated Großprofil (large profile). [...] Großprofil trains are [...] wide, and take their power from a <b>downward</b> <b>facing</b> third rail. This is related to New York City's A Division and B Division systems, where the B Division trains are wider than A Division trains.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the problem of}} outdoor autonomous robot localization for agricultural operations. Vision based outdoor localization system is developed entirely of offthe- shelf components that can accurately guide a field robot in small agricultural fields. Visual odometry using <b>downward</b> <b>faced</b> camera is proposed as a high resolution relative localization system. A stereo vision based range measurement system is also developed and field tested as an absolute localization system that can bound the incremental error caused by the visual odometry system. The extended Kalman filter with measurement gating is implemented using both visual odometry and stereo range measurement data. Field tests demonstrated proposed system is capable of localization of two wheel tractor at a very low cost with acceptable accuracy in small agricultural fields...|$|R

The d20 System {{includes a}} four-sided tetrahedral die among other dice with 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20 faces. Tetrahedral dice are peculiar {{in that there}} is no topmost face when a die comes to rest. There are several common ways of indicating the value rolled. On some tetrahedral dice, three numbers are shown on each face. The number rolled is indicated by the number shown upright at all three visible faces—either near the midpoints of the sides around the base or near the angles around the apex. Another configuration places only one number on each face, and the rolled number is taken from the <b>downward</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R

40|$|Position {{estimation}} using wheel odometric systems {{tends to}} give rather poor performances for an outdoor fourwheel skid steered mobile robot. Therefore autonomous control of these vehicles is extremely challenging in outdoor environments. This paper describes an outdoor localization {{system based on}} visual odometry for skid steered vehicle using forward faced camera and a <b>downward</b> <b>faced</b> camera. Optical flow field data is statistically analyzed to correctly estimate {{the position of the}} robot. Kalman Filtering is used to fuse data from two cameras for optimum performance. Also real-time Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR) detection using optical flow field data is proposed to calculate the heading angle. Two consumer grade cameras were used and algorithm was tested using open source image processing libraries. The proposed system yielded an acceptable positioning accuracy on short runs in typical outdoor terrains...|$|R

It is recognized that low-energy heating of such portable devices {{is of utmost}} importance for molecular recognition. This work focuses on screen-printed microheaters based on on Joule effect, which constitute an interesting solution for low-energy heating. An experimental study of the natural convection phenomena occurring with such microheaters is conducted.

A total Nusselt number and a total convective heat transfer coefficient have been used to describe the natural convection around these microheaters.
