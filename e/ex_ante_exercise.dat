Besides the standard Minnesota prior, we also use additional priors that constrain the sum of coefficients of the VAR models. We compare 1 - to 24 -months-ahead forecasts of the large-scale models over an out-of-sample horizon of 1995 : 01 – 2009 : 03, based on an insample of 1968 : 02 – 1994 : 12, relative to a random walk model, a small-scale VAR model comprising just the five real house price growth rates and a medium- scale VAR model containing 36 of the 145 fundamental variables besides the five real house price growth rates. In addition to the forecast comparison exercise across small-, medium- and large-scale models, we also look at {{the ability of the}} ‘optimal’ model (i. e. the model that produces the minimum average mean squared forecast error) for a specific region in predicting <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> real house prices (in levels) over the period of 2009 : 04 till 2012 : 02. Factor-based models (classical or Bayesian) perform the best for the North East, Mid-West, West census regions and the aggregate US economy and equally well to a small-scale VAR for the South region. The ‘optimal’ factor models also tend to predict the downward trend in the data when we conduct an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> forecasting <b>exercise.</b> Our results highlight the importance of information content in large number of fundamentals in predicting house prices accurately.
