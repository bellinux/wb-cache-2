5000|$|The pyrolytic release (PR) {{experiment}} (PI: Norman Horowitz, Caltech) {{consisted of}} the use of light, water, and a carbon-containing atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), simulating that on Mars. The carbon-bearing gases were made with carbon-14 (14C), a heavy, radioactive isotope of carbon. If there were photosynthetic organisms present, it was believed that they would incorporate some of the carbon as biomass through the process of carbon fixation, just as plants and cyanobacteria on earth do. After several days of incubation, the experiment removed the gases, baked the remaining soil at 650 °C (1200 °F), and collected the products in a device which counted radioactivity. If any of the 14C had been converted to biomass, it would be vaporized during heating and the radioactivity counter would detect it as evidence for life. Should a positive response be obtained, a <b>duplicate</b> <b>sample</b> of the same soil would be heated to [...] "sterilize" [...] it. It would then be tested as a control and should it still show activity similar to the first response, that was evidence that the activity was chemical in nature. However, a nil, or greatly diminished response, was evidence for biology. This same control was to be used for any of the three life detection experiments that showed a positive initial result.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Adrenal vein {{sampling}} (AVS) is {{the preferred}} test for subtyping primary aldosteronism. However, the procedure is technically demanding and costly. In AVS it is common practice to take duplicate blood samples at each location. In this paper we explore whether a single sample procedure leads to a different conclusion concerning the location of adrenal aldosterone secretion than a <b>duplicate</b> <b>sample</b> procedure. METHODS: AVS procedures with duplicate measurements performed in our university medical center between 2005 and 2010 were evaluated retrospectively. We compared the conclusions regarding selectivity and lateralization based on the first sample taken (A) to the conclusions based on the average of duplicate samples (AB). We also calculated the number needed to be sampled in duplicate to prevent one misclassification. RESULTS: Ninety-six AVS procedures of 82 patients were included. The concordance in AVS conclusions between samples A and AB was 98 - 100 %, depending on the criteria used for selectivity and lateralization. With permissive and strict criteria the number needed to be sampled in duplicate were infinite and 48, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental benefit of duplicate sampling compared to single sampling is low. Therefore, {{in the case of}} technical difficulties during AVS, conclusions can also be reliably drawn from a single blood sample...|$|E

40|$|Background: World Health Organization {{guidelines}} now recommend routine use of viral load testing, where available, {{for patients}} receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). However, its use {{has not been}} routinely implemented in many resource-limited settings due to cost, availability and accessibility. Viral load testing is complex, making its application in resource-limited settings challenging. We describe the issues encountered by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) when using routine viral load testing in a large HIV programme in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Between October 2005 and August 2006, more than 1200 patients on ART had viral load tests at baseline and at three-month intervals performed by a local reference laboratory that was quality assured by an experienced international institution. Concerns with reliability of results halted testing. The quality control measures instituted with a second laboratory and outcomes of these were documented. Results: In 2005 and 2006, only 178 of 334 (53 %) previously ART-naïve patients tested after six to 12 months of treatment had viral loads of less than 1000 copies/mL. Similar MSF programmes elsewhere demonstrated virological suppression rates of more than 85 %, and duplicate testing showed unacceptable discordance. Laboratory problems encountered included: disregarded quality control; time delays; requirement for retesting; and <b>duplicate</b> <b>sample</b> variations.

40|$|Flow cytometry (FCM) was {{successfully}} used to enumerate viruses in seawater after staining with the nucleic acid-specific dye SYBR Green-I. The technique was first optimized {{by using the}} Phaeocystis lytic virus PpV- 01. Then {{it was used to}} analyze natural samples from different oceanic locations. Virus samples were fixed with 0. 5 % glutaraldehyde and deep frozen for delayed analysis. The samples were then diluted in Tris-EDTA buffer and analyzed in the presence of SYBR Green-I. A <b>duplicate</b> <b>sample</b> was heated at 80 °C in the presence of detergent before analysis. Virus counts obtained by FCM were highly correlated to, although slightly higher than, those obtained by epifluorescence microscopy or by transmission electron microscopy (r = 0. 937, n = 14, and r = 0. 96, n = 8, respectively). Analysis of a depth profile from the Mediterranean Sea revealed that the abundance of viruses displayed the same vertical trend as that of planktonic cells. FCM permits us to distinguish between at least two and sometimes three virus populations in natural samples.

Based on a combined risk analysis of Sanitary Hazard Score (SHS) and FC counts, more than 57. 7 % of the study wells were classified as at very high (FC: 100 to> 1000 cfu/ 100 ml; and SHS: ≥ 9) microbial health risk.
