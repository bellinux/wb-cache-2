25|$|Philip Opas {{produced}} a human skeleton {{as a visual}} aid to explain the trajectory of the fatal bullet, Opas argued that the ballistics evidence indicated that the fatal bullet entered Hodson's (chest) body in a downward trajectory. He also got a Monash University mathematics professor Terry Speed, to explain that Ryan 5 feet 8inches (1.73 m) tall {{would have had to}} have been 8 feet 3inches (2.55 m) tall to have fired the shot. These calculations were based on Ryan being twenty feet from Hodson and Hodson was standing perfectly upright. The bullet would enter Hodson's body 62inches from the ground and exit 61inches from the ground. If the shot was in a downward angle the bullet would have hit the road forty feet from where Hodson was hit, it also suggested that Hodson could have been shot from another elevated point and possibly by another prison officer. It would cast doubt that Ryan had fired the fatal shot. But the prosecution argued that Hodson 6 feet 1inch (1.85 m) tall could have been running in a stooped position, thus accounting for the bullet's fatal angle of <b>entry.</b> <b>No</b> witnesses saw or testified seeing Hodson running in a stooped position.|$|E
