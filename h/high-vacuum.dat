5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal <b>high-vacuum</b> seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in <b>high-vacuum</b> equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E
25|$|Photoelectron {{spectroscopy}} {{is usually}} {{done in a}} <b>high-vacuum</b> environment, since the electrons would be scattered by gas molecules if they were present. However, some companies are now selling products that allow photoemission in air. The light source can be a laser, a discharge tube, or a synchrotron radiation source.|$|E
25|$|Irving Langmuir at the General Electric {{research}} laboratory (Schenectady, New York) had improved Wolfgang Gaede's <b>high-vacuum</b> diffusion pump {{and used it}} to settle the question of thermionic emission and conduction in a vacuum. Consequently, General Electric started producing hard vacuum triodes (which were branded Pliotrons) in 1915. Langmuir patented the hard vacuum triode, but De Forest and AT successfully asserted priority and invalidated the patent.|$|E
25|$|The Braun tube {{was known}} in 1897, and in 1899 Jonathan Zenneck {{equipped}} it with beam-forming plates and a magnetic field for sweeping the trace. Early cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements {{as early as the}} 1920s, but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the cathode emitters. V.K.Zworykin described a permanently sealed, <b>high-vacuum</b> cathode ray tube with a thermionic emitter in 1931. This stable and reproducible component allowed General Radio to manufacture an oscilloscope that was usable outside a laboratory setting.|$|E
25|$|The 2600s {{shared the}} engines and {{transmission}} of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles {{of the two}} bogies via fluid flywheels and Self-Changing Gears five-speed preselector gearboxes, with cardan shafts driving forward/reverse gearboxes {{on the ends of}} the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core jumper cables. The cars were fitted with two parallel vacuum brake systems—a conventional system and a second <b>high-vacuum,</b> quick-release system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops. Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus-type heating system that utilised the engines' cooling water.|$|E
25|$|His initial {{contributions}} to science {{came from his}} study of light bulbs (a continuation of his Ph.D. work). His first major development was {{the improvement of the}} diffusion pump, which ultimately led to the invention of the <b>high-vacuum</b> rectifier and amplifier tubes. A year later, he and colleague Lewi Tonks discovered that the lifetime of a tungsten filament could be greatly lengthened by filling the bulb with an inert gas, such as argon, the critical factor (overlooked by other researchers) being the need for extreme cleanliness in all stages of the process. He also discovered that twisting the filament into a tight coil improved its efficiency. These were important developments {{in the history of the}} incandescent light bulb. His work in surface chemistry began at this point, when he discovered that molecular hydrogen introduced into a tungsten-filament bulb dissociated into atomic hydrogen and formed a layer one atom thick on the surface of the bulb.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and {{were made by}} lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the vacuum pumps required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the diffusion pump in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir {{led to the development}} of <b>high-vacuum</b> tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull red heat (around 700°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.|$|E
2500|$|De Forest's {{original}} {{device was}} made with conventional vacuum technology. The vacuum was not a [...] "hard vacuum" [...] but rather left a very small amount of residual gas. The physics behind the device's operation was also not settled. The residual gas would cause a blue glow (visible ionization) when the plate voltage was high (above about 60 volts). In 1912, De Forest brought the Audion to Harold Arnold in AT's engineering department. Arnold recommended that AT purchase the patent, and AT followed his recommendation. Arnold developed <b>high-vacuum</b> tubes which were tested {{in the summer of}} 1913 on AT's long distance network. The <b>high-vacuum</b> tubes could operate at high plate voltages without a blue glow.|$|E

They constructed a Type T4A mercury ion thruster and a <b>high-vacuum</b> test facility. [...] Grid life testing totalling over 2000 hours was successfully completed.|$|E
2500|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopes {{operating in}} conventional <b>high-vacuum</b> mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore non-conductive materials require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.). The low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible {{the observation of}} non-conductive specimens without coating. [...] Non-conductive materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or environmental) scanning electron microscope.|$|E
2500|$|Gas-filled tubes such as {{discharge}} {{tubes and}} cold cathode tubes are not hard vacuum tubes, though are always filled with gas {{at less than}} sea-level atmospheric pressure. Types such as the voltage-regulator tube and thyratron resemble hard vacuum tubes and fit in sockets designed for vacuum tubes. Their distinctive orange, red, or purple glow during operation indicates the presence of gas; electrons flowing in a vacuum do not produce light within that region. These types may still {{be referred to as}} [...] "electron tubes" [...] as they do perform electronic functions. High-power rectifiers use mercury vapor to achieve a lower forward voltage drop than <b>high-vacuum</b> tubes.|$|E
2500|$|Nonconductive {{specimens}} collect charge when scanned by {{the electron}} beam, {{and especially in}} secondary electron imaging mode, this causes scanning faults and other image artifacts. For conventional imaging in the SEM, specimens must be electrically conductive, {{at least at the}} surface, and electrically grounded to prevent the accumulation of electrostatic charge. Metal objects require little special preparation for SEM except for cleaning and conductively mounting to a specimen stub. [...] Non-conducting materials are usually coated with an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited on the sample either by low-vacuum sputter coating or by <b>high-vacuum</b> evaporation. Conductive materials in current use for specimen coating include gold, gold/palladium alloy, platinum, iridium, tungsten, chromium, osmium, and graphite. Coating with heavy metals may increase signal/noise ratio for samples of low atomic number (Z). The improvement arises because secondary electron emission for high-Z materials is enhanced.|$|E
2500|$|In all phases, the {{interstellar}} medium is extremely tenuous by terrestrial standards. In cool, dense regions of the ISM, matter is primarily in molecular form, and reaches number densities of 106 molecules per cm3 (1 million molecules per cm3). In hot, diffuse regions of the ISM, matter is primarily ionized, and the density may be as low as 10−4 ions per cm3. Compare this with a number density of roughly 1019 molecules per cm3 for air at sea level, and 1010 molecules per cm3 (10 billion molecules per cm3) for a laboratory <b>high-vacuum</b> chamber. By mass, 99% of the ISM is gas in any form, and 1% is dust. Of the gas in the ISM, by number 91% of atoms are hydrogen and 9% are helium, with 0.1% being atoms of elements heavier than hydrogen or helium, known as [...] "metals" [...] in astronomical parlance. By mass this amounts to 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements. The hydrogen and helium are primarily a result of primordial nucleosynthesis, while the heavier elements in the ISM are mostly a result of enrichment {{in the process of}} stellar evolution.|$|E
