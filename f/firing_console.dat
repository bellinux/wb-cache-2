40|$|The project, {{being the}} {{development}} of resource management applications, consisted entirely of my own effort. From deliverable requirements provided by my mentor, and some functional requirement additions generated through design reviews, It was my responsibility to implement the requested features as well as possible, given the resources available. For the most part development work consisted of database programming and functional testing using real resource data. Additional projects I worked on included some <b>firing</b> room <b>console</b> training, configuring the new NE-A microcontroller development lab network, mentoring high school CubeSat students, and managing the NE interns' component of the mentor appreciation ceremony...|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, Seacrest was {{monitoring}} the ship's <b>fire</b> control <b>console,</b> which graphically displayed the relative position, bearing, {{and speed of}} any sonar contacts in the area. [...] Seacrest had been monitoring three contacts on his screens, S-12, S-13 (Ehime Maru), and S-14. [...] Absorbed {{in trying to get}} a clearer picture on S-14's location, Seacrest failed to report the bearing and range of S-13 (Ehime Maru) to Waddle during Waddle's periscope search, which Seacrest's monitors now showed was about [...] away and closing. [...] During Waddle's periscope search, Seacrest was busy operating other control room instruments and did not actively monitor his fire control displays. [...] After the periscope search was over, and hearing Waddle's report of no visual contacts, Seacrest decided that his information for S-13 was incorrect and manually respotted the S-13 contact on his screen to a distance of [...] away.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to new pipe work, voice work, new wind chests, Schantz built two new identical four-manual consoles: {{one for the}} Gallery {{and one for the}} Chancel allowing the organist to control both organs from either location. The chancel console can be moved around the sanctuary to suit various needs. In the original Moller installation, the Great Gallery organ console had four-manuals and could control over both the Gallery and Sanctuary organs. The Sanctuary organ console was two manuals, had complete control over the Sanctuary organ and the Gallery organ through [...] "blind" [...] controls. The Sanctuary console was replaced in 1974 due to a <b>fire</b> in the <b>console</b> which caused smoke damage to both organs' pipework. After the renovations, the Great Gallery organ holds 100 ranks and the Sanctuary organ holds 27.|$|R
5000|$|During {{communications}} for a countdown, the launch team uses acronyms to keep channels open {{as much as}} possible. All <b>Firing</b> Room <b>console</b> positions are assigned unique 'call signs' that are used by the team for quick and positive identification of who is talking. For example, dialogue heard during the launch of a Delta II rocket carrying the Kepler Space Telescope on March 8, 2009, included:Time: T minus 3 minutes. Launch Control (LC): OSM, third stage S&A arm permit to close. OSM: Closed. LC: SSC, third stage S&A armed. SSC: Armed. LC: Prop 1, vehicle fuel tank press open. Prop 1: Open. LC: Fuel umbilical purge to open. Prop 1: Open. LC: SSC, vent 1 heater control exit. SSC: Exit. LC: SSC, vent 2 heater control exit. SSC: Exit. LC: NSC reports spacecraft is go. Mission Director: Kepler spacecraft is go. LC: SSC - FTS bat one and two heater controls heaters off. SSC: Off. LC: Prop 1, pressurized first stage LOX tanks to relief. Prop 1: Pressurized.

5000|$|Breath of <b>Fire</b> IIs Virtual <b>Console</b> {{release in}} 2007 met with mixed response. GameSpot called {{attention}} to the title's [...] "pleasing visual presentation" [...] and breadth of content, but found the game's localization to be [...] "terrible" [...] along with unpolished gameplay mechanics that made it appear to be a [...] "hasty, careless effort". The game's pacing was also said to be poor, with too many [...] "mundane tasks" [...] laden throughout the story, recommending it to players who could look past its [...] "rough edges". IGN called the game's translation [...] "average at best" [...] with the lack of adequate spacing in text fields still present, yet ultimately calling it a [...] "solid, enjoyable RPG experience...though not a role-playing masterpiece on the level of Final Fantasy VI or Chrono Trigger". Eurogamer {{called attention to}} the game's high rate of random battles, but nonetheless called the game [...] "a beautifully crafted and impeccably produced adventure".|$|R

Joystiq's Ludwig Kietzmann says: [...] "It's rare {{for a game}} to forge a {{connection}} so strong, and even rarer for you to become the connective tissue." [...] Official Xbox Magazine UK praised the game and its touching story and inventive controls. They gave it a review score of 9/10. The Digital Fix also praised the game and gave it 10/10, with Rob Kershaw writing [...] "Brothers {{is nothing short of}} a triumph, glowing brightly in the embers of the dying <b>fire</b> of this <b>console</b> generation and reminding us all why we started playing games in the first place."GameTrailers rated the game 8.8/10 in their positive review, writing [...] "A Tale of Two Sons rubs elbows with Ico and Journey, though the setting and style are a bit more traditional." [...] Sweden's biggest gaming site FZ.se honored the game with 5/5 in its review, describing it as a masterpiece with a very touching story, extremely beautiful landscapes and inventive, well implemented controls.|$|R
40|$|The Master Console {{oversees the}} {{function}} of Computer Systems in Firing room 1 (FR 1). Master Console Operators, MCOs' for short, are our customer. I was integrated into the System Monitoring and Control (SMC) software team that is {{under the guidance of}} David Slaiman, who is the product group lead. I have been brought up to speed with System Monitoring and Control. The initial time spent reading SMC software design description and understanding how it works. The current <b>Firing</b> Room 1 <b>Console</b> Display is a floor layout giving the MCO two essential pieces of information which are Health and Status. When an issue arises, the MCO has to look on the display to find which console is affected and then the MCO must use the Reference designator from the display to manually search for the Portal Workstation (PWS) installed in the console using the hardware map; which is a long process to lookup a PWS if an issue is present. My project is to make the FR 1 Console Display easier for the MCO's to pinpoint PWS's without having to lookup additional resources in the process. My project also includes updating <b>Firing</b> Room 1 <b>Console</b> Display to include the F 1 R Non-Redundant Set. The display does not have good use of space and functionality. PWS numbers were not present in the previous design and are the critical component in efficient understanding and administration of the consoles. Part of the process includes getting feedback from the customer, instead of just emailing them with a question, we made a proposal with changes so they could respond and give us their input; which proved to be an effective method for engaging them. In order to do this I had to use the Display Editor (DE) tool developed by NASA, Paint. Net and Visio. The process I have been using has been Visio to alter the floor layout of Firing Room and take advantage of the white areas, and then I take the altered floor plan into Paint. Net. Once in Paint. Net I put the new floor plan as a background to the standard console display. Paint. Net also serves as a tool to create the new service state bars for the new background; finally I used the DE to assemble everything and setup the right CUI's for each PWS...|$|R
