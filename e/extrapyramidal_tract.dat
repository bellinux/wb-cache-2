50|$|In humans, the tectospinal tract (also {{known as}} colliculospinal tract) is a nerve pathway that {{coordinates}} head and eye movements.

50|$|Physical {{disorders}} {{can result}} in abnormally low (hypotonia) or high (hypertonia) muscle tone. Another form of hypertonia is paratonia, which is associated with dementia. Hypotonia is seen in lower motor neuron disease like poliomyelitis. Hypotonia can present clinically as muscle flaccidity, where the limbs appear floppy, stretch reflex responses are decreased, and the limb's resistance to passive movement is also decreased. Hypertonia is seen in upper motor neuron diseases like lesions in pyramidal tract and <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>tract.</b> Hypertonia can present clinically as either spasticity or rigidity. While spasticity is velocity-dependent resistance to passive stretch (i.e. passively moving an elbow quickly will elicit increased muscle tone, but passively moving elbow slowly may not elicit increased muscle tone), rigidity is velocity-independent resistance to passive stretch (i.e. there is uniform increased tone whether the elbow is passively moved quickly or slowly).Spasticity {{can be in the}} form of the clasp-knife response, in which there is increased resistance only at the beginning or at the end of the movement. Rigidity can be of the leadpipe type, in which there is resistance throughout to passive movement, or it may be of cogwheel type, in which the resistance to passive movement is in a jerky manner.|$|E

The results were as follows: 1) The efferent fibres from each part of motor cortex and from the premoter cortex are intricated underneath the cortex. 2) The area for fore-limb contains 17 % of Betz's cells for hind-limb; the area for hind-limb contains 9 % of Betz's cells fore-limb, and the mixed area for bothlimbs contains 44 % of Betz's cells for fore-limb and 56 % of Betz's cells for hind-limb; that is to say, the Betz's cells for hind-limb extended much more into the area for fore-limb than those for fore-limb into the area for hind-limb. 3) One of the Neurons from the area 6 aα of premotor cortex pass through the homolateral Nucleus caudatus terminated into the homolateral Nucleus lentiformis. 4) The motor cortex of dogs contains many <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>tracts.</b> The area for forelimb contains them {{much more than the}} area for hind-limb, {{and in the midst of}} two areas the mixed area for both limbs is situated...|$|R
25|$|The reticulospinal tracts, {{also known}} as the {{descending}} or anterior reticulospinal <b>tracts,</b> are <b>extrapyramidal</b> motor <b>tracts</b> that descend from the reticular formation in two tracts to act on the motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. The reticulospinal tracts are involved mainly in locomotion and postural control, although they do have other functions as well. The descending reticulospinal tracts are one of four major cortical pathways to the spinal cord for musculoskeletal activity. The reticulospinal tracts works with the other three pathways to give a coordinated control of movement, including delicate manipulations. The four pathways can be grouped into two main system pathways – a medial system and a lateral system. The medial system includes the reticulospinal pathway and the vestibulospinal pathway, and this system provides control of posture. The corticospinal and the rubrospinal tract pathways belong to the lateral system which provides fine control of movement.|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the human tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa evokes two kinds of action potentials : the M-wave and the H-wave in the calf muscle. The M-wave has a short response time and is derived from an impulse descending through the efferent nerve. The H-wave has a long response time and is derived from a reflex impulse monosynaptically transmitted through the afferent nerve which originates from muscle spindle. As the stimulus strength applied to the nerve is increased, gradually the H-wave appears first and gets larger, then the M-wave appears. By further increasing the stimulus strength, the H-wave decreases in its amplitude while the M-wave gets larger and finally the H-wave disappears. Although the stimulus strength is strictly defined and repeatedly applied the effect of each stimulus is not always constant, and the amplitude of the H-wave fluctuates. The greatest H-wave which is not accompanied by the M-wave is least variable. After measurement of such H-wave in succession, {{it is found that}} the distribution curve of the amplitude of the H-wave is in accord with the normal distribution. The mean value, the standard deviation and then the variation coefficient were calculated. In 36 normal cases, the average of the variation coefficient was 7. 31. Patients were classified in three groups according to the grade of tendon reflex regardless of clinical entities, then the variation coefficient was calculated in each group. In 37 cases, the reflex activities were accelerated and the variation coefficient was 4. 71 on an average. In 22 cases, the reflex activities were normal and the variation coefficient averaged 9. 14. In 15 cases, the reflex 2 ̆ 7 activities were reduced and the coefficient was 14. 07 on an average. It is concluded that the fluctuation of the H-wave is small in the group of the accelerated reflex activity and large in the group of the reduced reflex activity. In cases of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease and a few others, the amplitude of the H-wave is so variable that it is not in accord with a normal distribution curve.

40|$|The {{functional}} specialization and {{the regulation}} of the contraction in Musculus deltoideus, Musculus biceps brachii and Musculus extensor digitorum communis was studied electromyographically. The fibers of the muscles are devided in two neuromuscular units (NMU) functionally; the kinetic NMU and tonic NMU. The former {{is concerned with the}} pyramidal tract and the latter with <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>tract.</b> By these both, the contraction is regulated, and each muscle has its own and fixed ratio of the content of these both NMU. Before the excision of area 6 of cerebral cortex in the epileptics, {{the regulation of}} contraction was almost similar in the normal side, but in the focal side, it was myographically rather insufficient. But the ratio of content of these both NMU had no remarkable difference from those of the normal. After the operation, the regulation of contraction became more insufficient and the tonic NMU became less. As time elapsed, they approached to the state before the operation and about 21 days after the operation the majority of them became almost as same as before the operation. In the patients who had a lesion in the area 6 of cerebral cortex, almost similar results to the epilepties were obtained, while in those who were not affected in the area 6. almost similar results to the normal were seen. But in all cases there was found no change of the content ratio of both NMU. Acetylcholine effected to disturb the regulation of contraction in normal skeletal muscles, but in abnormal muscles it did to correct the regulation of contraction, while it did not influence the content ratio of the both NMU. On the contrary, strychnine nitrate did not influence at all...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Parkinsonism {{describes}} Parkinson's {{disease and}} other associated degenerative {{changes in the}} brain resulting in movement disorders. The motor cortex, <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>tracts</b> and nigrostriatal tract are brain regions forming part of the motor neural system and are primary targets for drug or chemotoxins induced Parkinsonism. The cause of Parkinsonism {{has been described as}} wide and elusive, however, environmental toxins and drugs accounts for large percentage of spontaneous cases in humans. A common mechanism in the cause and progression of drug/chemotoxin induced Parkinsonism involves calcium signalling in; oxidative stress, autophagy, cytoskeletal instability and excitotoxicity. Aim: This study sets to investigate the effect of targeting calcium controlling receptors, specifically activation of Vitamin D 3 receptor (VDR) and inhibition of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) in the motor cortex of mice model of drug induced Parkinsonism. Also we demonstrated how these interventions improved neural activity, cytoskeleton, glia/neuron count and motor-cognitive functions in vivo. Methods: Adult mice were separated into six groups of n[*]=[*] 5 animals each. Body weight (5 [*]mg/kg) of haloperidol was administered intraperitoneally for 7 days to block dopaminergic D 2 receptors and induce degeneration in the motor cortex following which an intervention of VDR agonist (VDRA), and (or) NMDAR inhibitor was administered for 7 days. A set of control animals received normal saline while a separate group of control animals received the combined intervention of VDRA and NMDAR inhibitor without prior treatment with haloperidol. Behavioral tests for motor and cognitive functions were carried {{out at the end of}} the treatment and intervention periods. Subsequently, neural activity in the motor cortex was recorded in vivo using unilateral wire electrodes. We also employed immunohistochemistry to demonstrate neuron, glia, neurofilament and proliferation in the motor cortex after haloperidol treatment and the intervention. Result/Discussion: We observed a decline in motor function and memory index in the haloperidol treatment group when compared with the control. Similarly, there was a decline in neural activity in the motor cortex (a reduced depolarization peak frequency). General cell loss (neuron and glia) and depletion of neurofilament were characteristic anatomical changes seen in the motor cortex of this group. However, Vitamin D 3 intervention facilitated an improvement in motor-cognitive function, neural activity, glia/neuron survival and neurofilament expression. NMDAR inhibition and the combined intervention improved motor-cognitive functions but not as significant as values observed in VDRA intervention. Interestingly, animals treated with the combined intervention without prior haloperidol treatment showed a decline in motor function and neural activity. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that calcium mediated toxicity is primary to the cause and progression of Parkinsonism and targeting receptors that primarily modulates calcium reduces the morphological and behavioral deficits in drug induced Parkinsonism. VDR activation was more effective than NMDAR inhibition and a combined intervention. We conclude that targeting VDR is key for controlling calcium toxicity in drug/chemotoxin induced Parkinsonism...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} motor and extramotor cerebral cortical regions {{in patients with}} amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using 1 H MRS, but none have evaluated the thalamus or basal ganglia. The objective of this exploratory study was to evaluate the subclinical involvement of the basal ganglia and thalamus in patients with ALS using 1 H MRS. Fourteen patients (52 ± 7 years) with sporadic definite ALS and 17 age-matched controls were studied using volumetric MRSI on a 3 -T scanner. The concentration of the metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and their ratio (NAA/Cho) were obtained bilaterally from the basal ganglia (lentiform nucleus, caudate) and thalamus. The maximum rates of finger and foot tap and lip and tongue movements were obtained to assess <b>extrapyramidal</b> and pyramidal <b>tract</b> function. In patients with ALS, relative to controls, the NAA concentration was significantly lower (p < 0. 02) in the basal ganglia and thalamus, and the Cho concentration was higher (p < 0. 01) in these structures, except in the caudate (p = 0. 04). Correspondingly, the NAA/Cho ratio was significantly lower (p < 0. 01) in these structures, except in the caudate (p = 0. 03), in patients than in controls. There were mild to strong correlations (r = 0. 4 – 0. 7) between the metabolites of the basal ganglia and finger tap, foot tap and lip and tongue movement rates. In conclusion, decreased NAA in the basal ganglia and thalamus and increased Cho and decreased NAA/Cho in the lentiform nucleus and thalamus are indicative of neuronal loss or dysfunction and alterations in choline-containing membranes in these structures...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Dysarthria affects {{linguistic}} domains such as respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance and prosody due {{to upper}} motor neuron, lower motor neuron, cerebellar or <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>tract</b> lesions. Although Bengali {{is one of}} the major languages globally, dysarthric Bengali speech has not been subjected to neurolinguistic analysis. We attempted such an analysis with the goal of identifying the speech defects in native Bengali speakers in various types of dysarthria encountered in neurological disorders. Settings and Design: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted with 66 dysarthric subjects, predominantly middle-aged males, attending the Neuromedicine OPD of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Kolkata. Materials and Methods: After neurological examination, an instrument comprising commonly used Bengali words and a text block covering all Bengali vowels and consonants were used to carry out perceptual analysis of dysarthric speech. From recorded speech, 24 parameters pertaining to five linguistic domains were assessed. The Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, Chi-square test and Fisher&#x 2032;s exact test were used for analysis. Results: The dysarthria types were spastic (15 subjects), flaccid (10), mixed (12), hypokinetic (12), hyperkinetic (9) and ataxic (8). Of the 24 parameters assessed, 15 were found to occur in one or more types with a prevalence of at least 25 &#x 0025;. Imprecise consonant was the most frequently occurring defect in most dysarthrias. The spectrum of defects in each type was identified. Some parameters were capable of distinguishing between types. Conclusions: This perceptual analysis has defined linguistic defects likely to be encountered in dysarthric Bengali speech in neurological disorders. The speech distortion can be described and distinguished by a limited number of parameters. This may be of importance to the speech therapist and neurologist in planning rehabilitation and further management...|$|E
