40|$|The production, {{interfacial}} properties, {{effect of}} modification and functionality of polymer-based microgel particles as colloidal stabilizers and flavor release agents were evaluated. Microgels were fabricated from β-lactoglobulin {{with and without}} pectin by thermal treatment under mildly acidic conditions. The influence of fabrication conditions, including pH, ionic strength, anion type and reducing agents on microgel properties were examined. Low pH and high concentrations of reducing agents increased thermal aggregation of β-lactoglobulin, resulting {{in the formation of}} larger microgels. Increased ionic strength also increased thermal aggregation irrespective of anion type, though particle agglomeration was promoted. In contrast, thermal aggregation and size of β-lactoglobulin/pectin microgels were affected by anion type, with thiocyanate anions promoting aggregation to the greatest extent followed by chloride and sulfate anions. The adsorption of β-lactoglobulin microgels to oil-water interfaces was influenced by bulk concentration and particle size, with higher concentration and smaller particles associated with faster adsorption. Microgel adsorption produced dominantly elastic interfaces, with smaller microgels increasing interfacial elasticity faster. As the interface was compressed, surface pressure increased but elasticity did not, potentially due to disruption of interactions within the microgel layer. Monolayer images indicated the presence of small, discrete aggregates at the interface, possibly due to microgel disruption at low interfacial concentrations. Cross-linking and reducing agent treatment had limited impact on the physical and chemical properties of microgels, except for increased chemical stability following glutaraldehyde treatment. Larger microgels were generally able to stabilize flavor oil emulsions to coalescence and flocculation, but not creaming, while smaller microgels generated emulsions susceptible to creaming and flocculation. Release of flavor compounds during storage resulted in the formation on non-spherical droplets, indicating a rigid, irreversibly adsorbed interfacial layer. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking greatly decreased emulsion stability, leading to the formation of large droplet flocs and rapid loss of flavor compounds. Larger microgels were able to slow flavor release from oil droplets, however smaller microgels were not. Overall, monodisperse β-lactoglobulin microgels can be produced by simple processing methods and demonstrate great stability over a wide range of conditions found in food and related products. Larger microgels appear to have greater functionality as interfacial stabilizers due to the formation of a thicker interfacial layer compared to smaller microgels, despite their slower diffusion and less efficient interfacial packing. While β-lactoglobulin microgels showed great promise for preventing coalescence in emulsion systems, their instability to creaming and in some cases <b>flocculation</b> <b>limit</b> their functionality as sole stabilizers in low viscosity, low oil phase systems. β-lactoglobulin microgels may have more value in food systems when employed as controlled release agents, texture modifiers or as structural components of films, or when used in conjunction with other stabilizers or biopolymers. ...|$|E
40|$|Phytoplankton such as diatom and dinoflagellate in {{seawater}} secrete microbial extracellular polymers (ECP). These materials allow phytoplankton {{cells to}} align and form large flocs. The resultant algal aggregates enhance the vertical transport of biomass in the ocean. Therefore, algal flocculation may regulate {{the termination of}} algal blooms {{as well as the}} circulation of organic materials in the natural environment. However, information from previous research about the role of ECP in algal <b>flocculation</b> is <b>limited</b> and often contradictory. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of nutrient status on the bioflocculation and sedimentation of phytoplankton blooms with an emphasis on the role of ECP. The preliminary results indicate that blooms of phytoplankton can be produced under laboratory conditions. ECP production is shown to be positively correlated to the nitrate consumption. Results also demonstrated to various extents that ECP production affects the flocculation of diatom and dinoflagellate population...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Settling {{velocity}} of sediment increases if flocculating occurred, and this enlarges deposition in reservoirs. According to water environmental {{factors in the}} Three Gorges reservoir, potential energy and forces between particles are evaluated based on DLVO theory. The critical water dynamics conditions were obtained by comparing extremum in synthetic potential curve and kinetic energy caused by relative velocity between particles. It is found that sediment flocculating is apt to happen when water level is high according to flow dynamics in the Three Gorges reservoir. The flocs are relatively loose and which is prone to be broken by water shear force. So the settling {{velocity of}} the <b>flocculation</b> is <b>limited</b> and the critical diameter of sediment is 0. 019 mm under which the sediments are affected by flocculating, and the settling velocity should be revised according to the limited settling velocity of flocculation when sediments are smaller than the critical diameter...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} summarizes a {{three year}} Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program {{effort to improve}} our understanding of algal flocculation with a key to overcoming harvesting as a techno-economic barrier to algal biofuels. <b>Flocculation</b> is <b>limited</b> by the concentrations of deprotonated functional groups on the algal cell surface. Favorable charged groups on the surfaces of precipitates that form in solution and the interaction of both with ions in the water can favor flocculation. Measurements of algae cell-surface functional groups are reported and related to the quantity of flocculant required. Deprotonation of surface groups and complexation of surface groups with ions from the growth media are predicted {{in the context of}} PHREEQC. The understanding of surface chemistry is linked to boundaries of effective flocculation. We show that the phase-space of effective flocculation can be expanded by more frequent alga-alga or floc-floc collisions. The collision frequency is dependent on the floc structure, described in the fractal sense. The fractal floc structure is shown to depend on the rate of shear mixing. We present both experimental measurements of the floc structure variation and simulations using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). Both show a densification of the flocs with increasing shear. The LAMMPS results show a combined change in the fractal dimension and a change in the coordination number leading to stronger flocs...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{polymeric}} architectures {{and analytical}} methods {{were designed for}} the synthesis, characterization, and applications of metallic nanocatalysts. Four main research areas were investigated, namely: i) palladium nanocatalysts, ii) metal content analysis by a novel microplasma-based technique, iii) polyion complex micelle-metal hybrid structures, and iv) nickel nanocatalysts. The solution and solid-state properties of dendrigraft (arborescent) polystyrene-graft-poly(2 -vinylpyridine) copolymers were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The unimolecular micelles exhibited good colloidal stability and narrow size distributions in organic solvents, and a fried egg morphology when deposited onto mica substrates. The preparation of stable colloidal Pd nanoparticles within the dendritic templates was reported for the first time. The diameter of the nanoparticles varied from 0. 7 to 3. 4 nm depending on the loading level, reduction time, and arborescent copolymer generation used. The catalytic activity of the colloidal Pd nanoparticles was evaluated in the Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) cross-coupling reaction under green conditions. Good catalytic activity and a positive dendritic effect were evidenced, although air-sensitivity and <b>flocculation</b> <b>limited</b> the activity and recyclability of the catalysts. To determine the concentration of Pd in the copolymers, a novel microplasma-based technique was applied in organic solvents for the first time. Metal quantification by microplasma-optical emission spectrometry revealed stoichiometric complexation of the Pd salt by the pyridine groups, and kinetic aggregation studies highlighted {{the benefits of the}} polymer for colloidal stability. To obtain Pd nanoparticles dispersible in high water content solutions, polyion complex micelles were synthesized from arborescent copolymers and double-hydrophilic block copolymers. The latter, viz. poly(acrylic acid) -block-poly(2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate), were obtained by hydrolysis of poly(tert-butyl acrylate) -block-poly(2 -trimethylsilyloxyethyl acrylate), synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization. The self-assembled complexes formed supramolecular aggregates with hydrodynamic diameters of 132 to 354 nm and narrow size distributions. The assemblies exhibited thermo-responsive properties in ethanol, dissociating above ca. 35 °C and reforming upon cooling. The polyion complexes, with hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 110 to 306 nm, were stable in water and were used for the solubilization of Pd nanocatalysts for aqueous Suzuki-Miyaura reactions. Lastly, the properties of nickel nanoparticles prepared at Vale-Inco by a novel thermal decomposition method were investigated. The specific surface area of the bare nanopowders ranged from 6. 4 to 97. 2 m 2 ∙g- 1, and their catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of adiponitrile and mesityl oxide was higher than for commercial catalysts in some cases. Treatment of the nanoparticles with diethylenetriamine further improved their catalytic activity. Polymeric stabilizers were designed to maximize the dispersibility and catalytic activity of the nanopowders. The structures investigated included triblock copolymers of polystyrene with poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(2 -vinylpyridine), and telechelic poly(ethylene glycol). Application of the polymer-stabilized nickel catalysts in hydrogenation yielded up to 15 -fold increases in specific catalytic activity as compared to the bare particles. The polymer was also effective at preventing oxidation by air under storage...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{was to investigate the}} functional properties of milk powders following exopolysaccharide (EPS) addition to milk solutions and their subsequent spray-drying. The aim was to replace some of the milk proteins with polysaccharide in dairy products while maintaining or improving the functional characteristics. Both commercial xanthan EPS and ferment xanthan EPS were incorporated into whole milk powder (WMP), skim milk powder (SMP), and milk protein concentrate (MPC). Ferment EPS was produced from a by-product of the dairy industry, milk permeate, through the hydrolysis of the lactose and fermentation with a strain of Xanthomonas campestris. Ferment EPS had a characteristic and unpleasant odour. The main compound responsible for this odour was p-cresol which, in milk, is largely bound in the conjugate form. Xanthomonas campestris hydrolyses these conjugates releasing the odour compounds. Ultrafiltration (UF) of the ferment or passing the ferment through a bed of activated carbon was effective in reducing the odour. UF was proven to reduce the levels of p-cresol in the ferment from 138 ppb to less than 5 ppb after 98 concentration factors. Milk powders made with UF ferment were more acceptable to the consumer sensory panel than those made with untreated ferment. The incorporation of EPS into milk powders has beneficial effects on the product with small additions increasing the viscosity of reconstituted SMP and WMP considerably. The EPS addition could result in a thickened milk product or alternatively, substitute for some of the milk solids. Sensory testing showed that 13. 3 % WMP solution, containing 0. 02 % commercial EPS, was not detectably different from a 15 % WMP solution. The addition of both commercial and ferment EPS into milk powders leads to the formation of separate flocculated casein and polysaccharide phases with reconstituted milk. Confocal microscopy showed that casein flocculation occurred at all EPS concentrations tested, but this only resulted in sedimentation at intermediate EPS concentrations. At high EPS concentrations of approximately 0. 2 % the high viscosity <b>limited</b> <b>flocculation</b> and prevented sedimentation. At low EPS concentrations of approximately 0. 05 % flocculation was insufficient to overcome Brownian motion. Fresh cheese (Panela) made from MPC containing either ferment or commercial EPS showed greatly decreased whey loss. This was attributed to (i) the increased viscosity of the continuous phase limiting the flow of liquid through the pores of the cheese, and (ii) diminished casein interaction in the presence of EPS leading to a looser curd and lower contraction forces. For example the incorporation of 0. 161 % ferment EPS decreased the whey lost by approximately 75 %. Negative effects were also apparent. The addition of EPS led to a granular appearance, which became more apparent with increasing EPS concentration. Cheese firmness was also decreased by approximately 40 % by the addition of the ferment EPS at 0. 161 %. This could also be attributed to the localised aggregation of protein during renneting and the increased heterogeneity of the network. Sensory testing of cheeses made with 15. 6 % MPC + 0. 045 % commercial EPS compared with cheese made with 17. 37 % MPC alone showed that the consumers had no significant preference for one cheese over the other, but did notice a difference in texture. For reasons of safety and health, the sensory testing of milk and cheese in this research was confined to commercial xanthan. Future sensory testing of milk and cheese should be conducted with ferment EPS after odour removal rather than commercial EPS, and use consumers familiar with these cheese and milk products. For commercial production of dairy powders containing UF ferment EPS it is vital that either the xanthan or casein micelle structure be altered to prevent casein flocculation. If this is not feasible then an alternative use of the product may need to be found. A potential option involves the addition of the powder containing UF ferment EPS into food products as a minor food constituent. This may limit the occurrence of phase separation while improving the functionality of the product. Commercialisation is also limited by the increasing costs caused by ferment EPS purification and the lower solids concentrations required for spray-drying. As such the viability of the powder production must be determined...|$|R
