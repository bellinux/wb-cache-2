5|$|During {{the peak}} {{popularity}} of the breed, three main types could be distinguished. All three are now considered extinct, having disappeared or been merged back into the main Canadian horse population. The first, the Canadian Heavy Draft or St. Lawrence, which disappeared by the late 1700s, probably developed from Shire and Clydesdale crosses. They were probably a popular <b>export</b> <b>to</b> New England, which bred large numbers of horses for Caribbean plantations. The second, the Frencher, sometimes also called the St. Lawrence, was a trotting horse known for its power and speed, resulting from crosses with Thoroughbreds. Mixed with French trotting lines, they {{played a role in}} the development of the US trotting horses.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The <b>export</b> <b>to</b> Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E
5000|$|The GE 44-ton {{switcher}} is a 4-axle {{diesel-electric locomotive}} built by General Electric between 1940 and 1956. It {{was designed for}} industrial and light switching duties, often replacing steam locomotives {{that had previously been}} assigned these chores. This locomotive's specific 44-short ton weight was directly related to one of the efficiencies the new diesel locomotives offered compared to their steam counterparts: reduced labor intensity. In the 1940s, the steam to diesel transition was in its infancy in North America, and railroad unions were trying to protect the locomotive fireman jobs that were redundant with diesel units. One measure taken to this end was the 1937 so-called [...] "90,000 Pound Rule" [...] : a stipulation that locomotives weighing 90000 lb [...] - [...] 45 short tons [...] - [...] or more required a fireman in addition to an engineer on common carrier railroads. Industrial and military railroads had no such stipulation. The 44-ton locomotive was born to skirt this requirement. Other manufacturers also built 44-ton switchers of center-cab configuration. 276 examples of this locomotive were built for U. S. railroads and industrial concerns, four were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Australia in 1944, 10 were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Canada, 10 were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Cuba, one was <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> the Dominican Republic, five were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> France, three were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> India, six were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Mexico, five were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Saudi Arabia, one was <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Sweden, two were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Trinidad, 10 were <b>exported</b> <b>to</b> Uruguay, and 57 were built for the U. S. Military. Many remain, in service and in museums.|$|R

5|$|Faced with a poor {{economy in}} 1974, Filipino President, Ferdinand Marcos {{implemented}} a labour code which began his country's export of labour {{in the form}} of overseas workers. The Philippine government encouraged this labour <b>export</b> <b>to</b> reduce the unemployment rate and enrich its treasury with the workers' remittances. The economy of the Philippines became increasingly dependent on labour export; in 1978 labour-export recruiting agencies were privatised, and became a cornerstone of the economy.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector.

The final list of Korea's potential <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> the African market is carefully derived and we find that competing with Japanese exports rather than Chinese ones is a more appropriate strategy for amending Korea's record of underperforming <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> Africa...|$|R

5|$|The Masons {{lived in}} a colonial Virginia that had few roads, as most {{commerce}} was carried on Chesapeake Bay or along the waters of its tributaries, such as the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. Most settlement took place near the rivers, through which planters could trade with the world. Thus, colonial Virginia initially developed few towns, since estates were largely self-sufficient, and could get what they needed without the need to purchase locally. Even the capital, Williamsburg, saw little activity when the legislature was not in session. Local politics was dominated by large landowners like the Masons. The Virginia economy rose and fell with tobacco, the main crop, which was raised mostly for <b>export</b> <b>to</b> Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{beginning}} of Szabó’s career {{coincided with the}} {{beginning of}} a “new wave” in Hungarian cinema, one of several new wave cinemas that occurred around this time throughout Western and Eastern Europe. The Eastern European new waves were caused by political liberalization, the decentralization of film industries, and the emergence of films as valuable commodities for <b>export</b> <b>to</b> Western European markets. The resulting films were more formally experimental, politically anti-establishment, and, {{especially in the case of}} Szabó, psychologically probing than the films of the previous generation. Hungarian filmmakers in particular experienced a significant increase in freedom of expression due to the reforms of the Kádár government.|$|E
5|$|The {{slave trade}} and the {{consequent}} demand for cheap brass ware for <b>export</b> <b>to</b> Africa caused a boom in the copper and brass manufacturing industries of the Avon valley, which in turn encouraged {{the progress of the}} Industrial Revolution in the area.

Water power from tributaries of the Avon drove the hammers in the brass batteries, until the development of steam power in the later 18th century.

5|$|Although the Norman {{invasion}} {{caused some}} damage as soldiers looted {{the countryside and}} land was confiscated for castle building, the English economy was not greatly affected. Taxes were increased, however, and the Normans established extensive forests that were exploited for their natural resources and protected by royal laws. The next two centuries saw huge growth in the English economy, driven {{in part by the}} increase in the population from around 1.5million in 1086 to between 4and 5million in 1300. More land, much of it {{at the expense of the}} royal forests, was brought into production to feed the growing population and to produce wool for <b>export</b> <b>to</b> Europe. Many hundreds of new towns, some of them planned communities, were built across England, supporting the creation of guilds, charter fairs and other medieval institutions which governed the growing trade. Jewish financiers played a significant role in funding the growing economy, along with the new Cistercian and Augustinian religious orders that emerged as major players in the wool trade of the north. Mining increased in England, with a silver boom in the 12th century helping to fuel the expansion of the money supply.|$|E
5|$|During {{periods of}} low demand gas {{is taken from}} the National Transmission System (NTS) at Beltoft, North Lincolnshire and {{transferred}} via a 12-inch diameter 15km pipeline to the Lindholme Compression Site.

The sandstone reservoir has a capacity of about 4.1 billion cubic feet (116 million cubic metres). During periods of high demand gas is withdrawn from the reservoir and through the 16-inch pipeline to the Lindholme site.

Another finding is that Korean exports of raw materials do not respond very sensitively relative <b>to</b> the other <b>export</b> types. These findings are almost same as those for Korean <b>exports</b> <b>to</b> China in terms of response to GDP shocks.
