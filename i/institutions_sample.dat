The primary purpose of the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in Great Britain, 1999 survey was to produce prevalence rates of three main categories of mental disorder: conduct disorder; hyperactivity; emotional disorders (and their comorbidity); based on ICD- 10 (International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision) and DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth revision) criteria. Where there were sufficient numbers, the survey also aimed to provide prevalence rates of type of problem (e. g., separation anxiety, social phobia etc.) and to investigate the comorbidity or co-occurrence of disorders. Main Topics : The data contain Information about 10, 438 children from up to 3 sources: Parent/primary care giver; Young person (11 - 15 year olds) themselves; Teacher (nominated by parent/child); Clinical assessment variables assigned to each case based on ICD- 10 and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.

Further information about the series and links to publications can be found on the Department of Health Mental Health Surveys web page. The Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity among Prisoners in England and Wales was commissioned by the Department of Health in 1997. It aimed to provide up-to-date baseline information about the prevalence of psychiatric problems among male and female remand and sentenced prisoners in order to inform policy decisions about services. Wherever possible, the survey utilised similar assessment instruments to those used in earlier surveys to allow comparison with corresponding data from the OPCS/ONS surveys of individuals resident in private household, institutions catering for people with mental health problems, and homeless people (see SNs 3560, 3585 and 3642 respectively). In addition the survey aimed to examine the varying use of services and the receipt of care in relation to mental disorder and to establish key, current and lifetime factors which may be associated with mental disorders of prisoners. Main Topics : The dataset contains the data from interviews with 3, 142 prisoners aged 16 to 64 years from all prisons in England and Wales. These interviews included assessments of neurosis, psychosis, personality disorder, alcohol and drug dependence, deliberate self-harm, post-traumatic stress and intellectual functioning. In addition they included information on use of services before and in prison, key life events, social and economic functioning and a range of socio-demographic information. Separate samples of male remand, male sentenced, and female prisoners were selected. Information was also collected from prison records (the Local Inmates Directory System - LIDS) and medical records if permission was granted by the respondent. A sub-sample of 505 respondents also undertook a second clinical interview, and these data are included in their records on the SPSS file.

40|$|Objective – To {{discover}} how library Web teams’ staffing, backgrounds, tools, {{and professional development}} differ among various types of academic libraries. Design – Survey. Setting – Academic libraries in the United States. Subjects – Academic library Web team members. Methods – A systematic sample of every twelfth institution on The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education list was used to establish a sample group. A Web search was carriedout to identify each institution’s library Web site and contact information for the Web site designer or most appropriate alternative person. Institutions {{were excluded from the}} sample if they had no Web site at all, had no library Web site, had a Web site that did not mention a library, or had a Spanish language Web site. In September 2006 an e-mail was sent to the contact for each institution in the sample group asking them to participate in an online survey. A follow up e-mail was sent two weeks later and the survey closed after one month. The survey respondents were asked to identify their institutions so that analysis of the results in relation to the sizeand type of institution could be carried out. The researchers used a simplified version of the Carnegie classification to sort the responding institutions into five main groups. Main Results – The systematic sample consisted of 288 <b>institutions</b> (<b>sample</b> size 6. 5 %). The profile of the responding institutions was as follows: associate’s colleges (35. 5 %), baccalaureate colleges (18. 2 %), master’s colleges and universities (20. 9 %), doctorate-granting universities (9 %) and special focus institutions (15. 5 %). A total of 110 institutions completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 38. 19 %, although not all respondents answered all the survey questions. The final sample of 110 was 2. 5 % of the total 4384 institutions on the Carnegielist. Seventy-one per cent of institutions with multiple libraries shared Web teams, with two-year colleges more likely (91. 7 %) to share a Web team than four-year or above institutions (60. 9 %). The majority of responding institutions (94. 4 %) used in-house library Web site design, with only 5. 6 % of respondents outsourcing this task. Nearly half (49 %) of respondents indicated that library Web design was done by one person and even the larger libraries did not necessarily have larger Web teams. Very few Web team members (4. 9 %) had Web design as their primary role; the majority (83. 5 %) indicated that it was just one component of their job. Web team members from master’s- and doctorate-granting institutions {{were more likely to have}} taught themselves Web design, while those from associate, baccalaureate and special focus colleges were more likely to have taken Web design courses. For all respondents, the most commonly listed quality for selection to the Web team was an interest in Web design and the most valued skill for library Web designers was the ability to organise information effectively. Knowledge of Web authoring software and basic HTML coding were the most commonly listed knowledge requirements for Web team members. A significant number of respondents indicated that they or other Web team members did not have access to Web authoring (36. 9 %) and image editing (52 %) software. Generally (except for two very large institutions), the larger institutions were more likely to use database-driven systems for their library Web sites and the smaller institutions were more likely to use content management systems. Associate’s and special focus colleges were less likely than other types of institutions to use either database driven or content management systems. Associate’s institutions were more likely to achieve ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) Web accessibility compliance. Only 48. 6 % of respondents utilised usability testing during Web site design. Conclusion – The author expected that institutions providing higher levels of education would have better-resourced Web design and training, but the results of the survey did not support this expectation. One reason why associate’s colleges performed better than other institutions in some areas of Web design may be that these colleges tend to offer more Web design and computer technology courses than baccalaureate, master’s and doctorate-granting institutions. Web site design and testing attracted fewer resources than might be expected in academic libraries. Across all types of institutions, Web design tended to be the responsibility of a small team or one person, with most Web designers having other responsibilities apart from the library’s Web site. Just over half of the institutions surveyed did not implement usability testing of their library Web sites...|$|E

Further information about the series and links to publications can be found on the Department of Health Mental Health Surveys web page. The main aims of the Mental Health of Children and Young People in Great Britain, 2004 survey were: to examine whether there were any changes between 1999 and 2004 in the prevalence of the three main categories of mental disorder: conduct disorders, emotional disorders and hyperkinetic disorders to describe the characteristics and behaviour patterns of children in each main disorder category and subgroups within those categories to look in more detail at children with autistic spectrum disorder to examine the relationship between mental disorder and aspects of children's lives not covered in the previous survey, for example, medication, absence from school, empathy and social capital to collect baseline information to enable identification of the protective and risk factors associated with the main categories of disorder and the precursors of personality disorder through future follow-up surveys Main Topics : The data file contains: a subset of information collected in the previous 1999 survey on 10, 438 children aged 5 - 15; these variables included those which were repeated in comparable form in 2004. The full 1999 dataset has also been deposited at UKDA (see 'Abstract' section above) the full data collected in the 2004 survey on 7, 977 children aged 5 - 16 any potentially disclosive variables have been removed Information was provided for the survey from up to three sources: the primary care giver, the child/young person (aged 11 - 15 / 16 years) and the child/young person's teacher (nominated by child/parent). Topics covered in the 2004 survey included: housing, general health, strengths and difficulties, friendship, development, separation anxiety, social and specific phobias, panic attacks and agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, compulsions and obsessions, generalised anxiety, depression, self-harm, attention and activity, awkward and troublesome behaviours, eating disorders, tics, personality issues, stress and life events, school exclusions. Some data were gathered by self-completion, for example drink and drug use (from child/young person) and parent's/parents' education, employment, income, strengths and difficulties (parent).

The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 2007 (APMS 2007) is the third survey of psychiatric morbidity in adults living in private households. The main aim of the survey was to collect data on poor mental health among adults aged 16 and over living in private households in England. The specific objectives of the survey were: to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity according to diagnostic category in the adult household population of England. The survey included assessment of common mental disorders; psychosis; borderline and antisocial personality disorder; Asperger syndrome, substance misuse and dependency; and suicidal thoughts, attempts and self-harm to screen for characteristics of eating disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and problem gambling to examine trends in the psychiatric disorders that have been included in previous survey years (1993 and 2000) to identify the nature and extent of social disadvantage associated with mental illness to gauge the level and nature of service use in relation to mental health problems, with an emphasis on primary care to collect data on key current and lifetime factors that might be associated with mental health problems, such as experience of stressful life events, abusive relationships, and work stress to collect data on factors that might be protective against poor mental health, such as social support networks and neighbourhood cohesion Further information can be found on the Information Centre for Health and Social Care survey web page.

Further information about the series and links to publications can be found on the Department of Health Mental Health Surveys web page. The Mental Health of Young People Looked After by Local Authorities in Great Britain, 2001 - 2003 was the second major national survey focusing on the development and well-being of young people to be carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The first survey, carried out in 1999, obtained information about the mental health of 10, 500 young people living in private households (held at UKDA under SN 4227). The 1999 survey has since been repeated in 2004 (held under SN 5269) - see also the full list of surveys in the series above. The rationale for a national survey of the mental health of children and adolescents looked after by local authorities was exactly the same as that for the private household population. In order to plan mental health services effectively it is necessary to know how many children in local authority care have mental health problems, what their diagnoses are and how far their needs for treatment are being met. The extent of the morbid population needs to be known so that the resources and planning can effectively take this into account. The survey was first conducted separately in England in 2001 - 2002, and then conducted in both Scotland and Wales in 2002 - 2003. The data from each survey have been merged into one file for this deposit. The primary purpose of the survey was to produce prevalence rates of three main categories of mental disorder: conduct disorder, hyperactivity and emotional disorders (and their comorbidity), based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD- 10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Revision (DSM-IV) criteria. Where there were sufficient numbers, the survey also aimed to provide prevalence rates of type of problem (eg separation anxiety, social phobia etc.) and to investigate the co-occurrence of disorders. The survey also aimed to determine the impact and burden of children's mental health problems in terms of social impairment and adverse consequences for others, and to examine service utilisation. Main Topics : The survey consisted of an interview schedule for carers, which was asked of one carer of all selected children. It covered background characteristics, general health, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), separation anxiety, specific and social phobias, panic attacks and agoraphobia, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), compulsions and obsessions, generalised anxiety, depression, attention and activity, awkward and troublesome behaviour, less common disorders, significant problems, use of services for those problems, impact, use of all types of services, strengths, reading, mathematics and spelling ability. The questionnaire content for children and adolescents included friendship, SDQ, separation anxiety, attachment disorder, specific and social phobias, panic attacks and agoraphobia, PTSD, compulsions and obsessions, generalised anxiety, depression, attention and activity, awkward and troublesome behaviour, chronic fatigue, friendships, help-seeking behaviour, significant problems, and strengths. The self-completion element included a moods and feelings questionnaire, and also covered awkward and troublesome behaviour, smoking cigarettes, use of alcohol, experience with drugs, sexual behaviour and exclusion from school. A postal questionnaire was also sent to teachers, covering scholastic achievement as well as assessments of behaviour and emotional well-being. This included scholastic achievement and special needs, SDQ, emotions, attention, activity and impulsiveness, awkward and troublesome behaviour, social behaviour, other concerns and help from the school.

As a former high school teacher, I have taught with a Smart Board in my classroom and have learned how to incorporate this tool to effectively enhance student engagement. Through this process, I also experienced what problems can come up in the use of Smart Boards and how to proactively prevent them. Whether participants have Smart Boards at their institutions or are just interested in learning more about their functionality, this interactive presentation will provide participants with an understanding of the research on student learning in a Smart Board classroom, sample lessons on common IL instruction topics, and a toolkit of practical tips and tricks for working with interactive whiteboards.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the prevalence of sexual aggression as reported by adolescent males and females in the Netherlands. Data were collected from a low-risk school-based sample (n= 219; 119 adolescent females and 100 adolescent males), a medium-risk school-based sample (vocational training) (n= 237; 117 adolescent females and 120 adolescent males); and a high-risk sample from eight different juvenile justice institutions (n= 377; 215 adolescent females and 162 adolescent males). Participants reported on the strategy used to force a person into sexual contact (defined as sexual touching, sexual intercourse or oral sex) against his/her will. Results showed that around 8 % of the adolescent females and 10 % of the adolescent males reported having used sexual aggression against a person. However, prevalence rates differed for the different samples: the juvenile <b>institution</b> <b>sample</b> showed the highest rate. Further, we found that for adolescent females "beliefs about sexual behaviour" was the only predictor of sexually aggressive behaviour, while for adolescent males being a victim of sexual abuse {{was the most important}} predictor. The results are discussed in relation to the literature on sexually aggressive offending behaviour. © 2011 National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} disparity between business school focus and business community needs. A {{content analysis of}} 200 corporate job descriptions collected in Fall 2009 revealed 140 specific license/certification/skills commonly cited as required for candidates applying for business jobs. A detailed matching of these post-graduation proficiencies with pre-graduation business major tracks is provided herein to assist schools in better aligning curricula with job requirements. This matching and aligning process is proposed as a key means for reducing disparity between post-graduation licenses/certification/skills required and the academic tracks that are feeders for such positions. Examination of 200 résumés of business students nearing graduation revealed low to no proficiency on the job description-derived skill sets. This finding suggests that disparity between school of business focus and practitioner needs is ongoing and potentially problematic, {{at least at the}} <b>institutions</b> <b>sampled.</b> A content analysis of 100 school of business course syllabi and 20 textbooks supported this conclusion. This article provides suggestions for closing the gap between business school curricula and corporate needs. The old business school is compared to our vision of the new business school, where close alignment of pre-graduation training with post-graduation job requirements serves both students and practitioners well.

40|$|Emotional {{intelligence}} (EI) is {{the capacity}} of an individual to identify his/her own emotions and to become sensitive to those that he/she perceives from {{the environment and the}} circle of people he/she is interacting with. It is a particular set of abilities and knowledge-building attitudes. EI enables managers to tap into their emotions as a source of energy to foster intrapersonal and interpersonal understanding. EI is increasingly being emphasized as a leader attribute that managers require to improve the performance of their organizations. The objectives of this study were; to determine the influence of age on management’s EI and to establish the moderating effects of gender and managerial experience on the relationship between age and management’s EI. A survey research design was used for this study. The institutions studied were selected using stratified random sampling technique. The three strata considered were primary schools, secondary schools, and colleges/tertiary institutions.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the standard limitations of a retrospective audit of this nature, a further {{limitation of this study}} is that for the PCR to be performed in our <b>institution,</b> <b>samples</b> were required to be referred to a specific laboratory that only operates during standard working hours. We are therefore unable to comment on the incidence of K. kingae in our population, as the laboratory was not routinely referred samples out of hours and may not have been referred all samples in hours, with potential for cases of K. kingae to remain undiagnosed. The increasing recognition of K. kingae as a pathogen has now led to a change in practice, with retention of a separate synovial fluid sample for PCR in {{addition to}} samples sent for regular analysis out of hours. Previously undiagnosed cases may have undergone an abortive course [1], or may have undergone treatment as presumed septic arthritis. This is highly likely, as synovial fluid samples in all cases of septic arthritis are Gram stain positive in only 30 – 50  % of cases and culture positive in 50 – 80  % [8], and K. kingae is effectively treated by a wide range of antibiotics given empirically to young children [12, 19]. The fact that five children in our series had more than one presentation to the Emergency Department and one child required two arthroscopic knee washouts confirms that infection with K. kingae should not be considered a benign, self-limiting condition [1].|$|R
