5|$|September 21, 1938– The New England Hurricane of 1938 {{passes to}} the east of the state, causing strong winds of up to 100mph (160km) and {{powerful}} waves along the coastline. The bridge to Brigantine collapses, leaving the city marooned. A Fall tomato crop is ruined, and half of the apple <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> destroyed.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} {{threat to}} mass-producing plants for <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> their susceptibility to diseases. Wild species have {{a range of}} genetic variability that allows some individuals to survive should a disturbance occur. In agriculture, resistance through variability is compromised, since genetically uniform seeds are planted under uniform conditions. Monocultural agriculture thus causes low crop diversity, especially when the seeds are mass-produced or when plants (such as grafted fruit trees and banana plants) are cloned. A single pest or disease could threaten a whole crop due to this uniformity. A well-known historic case was the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1847, where a vital crop with low diversity was destroyed by a single fungus. Another example is when a disease caused by a fungus affected the monocultured 1970 US corn crop, causing a loss of over one billion dollars in production.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{is sent to}} {{the ruined}} planet Harvest to {{investigate}} Covenant activity, where Cutter learns that the Covenant has excavated something at the planet's northern pole. When the UNSC's main outpost on <b>Harvest</b> <b>is</b> captured, Cutter orders Forge to retake it. Soon after, Forge scouts the Covenant excavation and discovers that they, {{under the direction of the}} Arbiter, have discovered a Forerunner facility. Forge's troops defeat the Covenant forces before they can destroy the installation, and Anders arrives. She determines that the facility is an interstellar map, and recognizes a set of coordinates that points to the human colony of Arcadia.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a schizocarp {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.|$|E

30|$|Crop <b>was</b> hand <b>harvested</b> twice. First <b>harvest</b> <b>was</b> done on 128 DAS when 90 % of the {{capsules}} turned {{brown and}} capsule number <b>was</b> counted, second <b>harvest</b> <b>was</b> on 150 DAS. Estimation of unripe green capsule, {{which would be}} available for second <b>harvest,</b> <b>was</b> also done. Ratio of ripened to unripened capsules was calculated to know early ripening. Yield (%) in first <b>harvest</b> <b>was</b> calculated to find uniformity in maturity timings. Also the ratios of marketable to non-marketable fruits were also calculated (Atiyeh et al. 2000 b) so as to know the effect of different treatments on marketable seed yield. In each of the harvest, malformed and non-marketable fruits were sorted out and counted.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 226 samples of maize and 59 of wheat from the 2004 – 2007 <b>harvests</b> <b>were</b> {{investigated}} {{for the presence}} and concentration of deoxynivalenol (DON). Samples of the 2004 <b>harvest</b> <b>were</b> analyzed after their storing for one year in barns, while those of the 2005 – 2007 <b>harvest</b> <b>were</b> taken directly off fields immediately after the <b>harvest.</b> The samples <b>were</b> analyzed by liquid chromatography on an ODS Hypersil column with DAD detector and ELISA methods. The average incidence rate of DON in maize from the 2004 <b>harvest</b> <b>was</b> 50 % (concentration range 0. 042 – 2. 460 mg/kg, average value 0. 536 mg/kg), while for those of the 2005 – 2007 <b>harvest</b> it <b>was</b> 32. 4 % (concentration range 0. 027 – 2. 210 mg/kg, average value 0. 223 mg/kg).

25|$|Traditionally the <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> {{stored in}} old water jars (Sir, زيرor Gerr, جرّ) that are preparatorily lined with ash. A further layer of ash on top seals it and protects the fruits from maggots (Sus, سوس), (cf. Material Culture of the Manasir).|$|E
25|$|Groundfish: this <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> {{dominated}} by Pacific whiting. Some stocks need rebuilding. Rockfish can live {{as long as}} 100 years, and grow and reproduce very slowly. This makes stock recovery very slow. In 2004, plans for rebuilding several overfished groundfish species were approved.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} farming <b>harvesting</b> <b>is</b> done by fitting conical nets on the {{sluice gates}} and opening them during low tide. The shrimp {{are trapped in}} the net as the water recedes. The remaining shrimp <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> by cast netting. In semi-intensive and intensive practices, <b>harvesting</b> <b>is</b> done by complete draining of the pond. The rest of the shrimp are collected by hand.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDeforestation {{is a major}} {{environmental}} issue, while demand for timber products increases rapidly in the developing world. One can thus wonder whether forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>is</b> sustainable worldwide, or if demand for timber products is fulfilled with the products from deforestation. Our panel data analysis shows that countries where timber <b>harvesting</b> <b>is</b> more important tend to experience larger deforestation rates than others, giving the intuition that forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>is</b> generally not sustainable. We also show that timber certification is negatively related to deforestation and thus {{seems to be a}} good indicator of harvesting sustainability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|In {{some regions}} of India, fasts of {{religious}} nature are {{an occasion for}} a change in normal diet, and a total absence from cooking or eating is held as elective while a normal diet for a fasting day is a light feast consisting of different foods from usual, amongst which sweet potato is one of the prime sources of sustenance. Sweet potato– shakarkand, शक्करकंद– is eaten otherwise, too, and a popular variety of preparation in most parts is roasted slow over kitchen coals at night and eaten with some dressing—primarily salt, possibly yogurt—while the easier way in the south is simply boiling or pressure cooking before peeling, cubing and seasoning for a vegetable dish as part of the meal. In Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it is known as 'Sakkara valli Kilangu'. It is boiled and consumed as evening snack. In some parts of India, fresh sweet potato is chipped, dried and then ground into flour; this is then mixed with wheat flour and baked into chapattis (bread). Between 15 and 20 percent of sweet potato <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> converted by some Indian communities into pickles and snack chips. A part of the tuber <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> used in India as cattle fodder.|$|E
25|$|Melucuaq (lit. «small roe») or Elquaq (lit. «seaweed») is herring roe-on-kelp, herring spawn-on-kelp, or herring eggs on kelp. This is the fertilized eggs or roe (qaarsat, meluk, imlauk) of the Pacific herring {{attached}} to eelgrass, seaweed or other submerged vegetation. Herring spawn-on-kelp is a favored food among {{the majority of}} households in Togiak, Manokotak, and Aleknagik. Additional households in Twin Hills, Dillingham, and other communities in Bristol Bay and elsewhere also eat spawn-on-kelp. Harvests of spawn-on-kelp took place between late April and early June. Spawn-on-kelp for subsistence use is generally picked by hand, though rakes are occasionally used. Today, freezing and salting {{are the most common}} methods of preservation. In the past, spawn-on-kelp was preserved by drying and storage in open-weave grass baskets (kuusqun, kuusqulluk). As in the past, people today prefer to eat spawn-on-kelp dipped in seal oil. The product of the <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> commonly shared with relatives and friends in the harvesters' home community during feats celebrating birthdays or holidays. In all four Nelson Island communities (Tununak, Newtok, Toksook Bay, and Nightmute), much of the roe-on-kelp is consumed soon after it is harvested, but a portion of the <b>harvest</b> <b>is</b> preserved in seal-skin pokes filled with seal oil.|$|E
