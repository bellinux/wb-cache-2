5000|$|The Shockley diode {{equation}} or the diode law, {{named after}} transistor co-inventor William Shockley of Bell Telephone Laboratories, gives the I-V (current-voltage) characteristic of an <b>idealized</b> <b>diode</b> in either forward or reverse bias (applied voltage): ...|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, let us {{consider}} a mathematically <b>idealized</b> <b>diode.</b> In such an ideal diode, if the diode is reverse biased, the current flowing through it is zero. This ideal diode starts conducting at 0 V and for any positive voltage an infinite current flows and the diode acts like a short circuit. The I-V characteristics of an ideal diode are shown below: ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} theoretical {{analysis of}} a MEMS electrostatic energy harvester configured as the Bennet's doubler. Steady-state operation of the doubler circuit can be approximated by a right-angled trapezoid Q-V cycle. A similarity between voltage doubler and resistive-based charge-pump circuit is highlighted. By taking electromechanical coupling into account, the analytical solution of the saturation voltage {{is the first time}} derived, providing a greater comprehension of the system performance and multi-parameter effects. The theoretical approach is verified by results of circuit simulation for two cases of mathematically <b>idealized</b> <b>diode</b> and of Schottky diode. Development of the doubler/multiplier circuits that can further increase the saturation voltage is investigated. Comment: 16 page...|$|E

5000|$|For {{illustration}} {{this discussion}} assumes <b>idealized</b> <b>diodes</b> that conduct {{in the forward}} direction with no voltage drop and do not conduct in the reverse direction. Logic design assume two distinct levels of signals that are labeled “1” or “0”. For positive logic the 1 represents the most positive level and 0 for the most negative level. For illustration in this discussion positive logic 1 is represented by +6 volts and 0 volts represents logic 0. In binary logic the exact magnitude of the signal voltage is not critical {{and it is only}} necessary that 1 and 0 states be represented by detectably different voltage levels.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a novel {{rectification}} phenomenon in a 2 -D lattice network consisting of N× N sites with diode and AC source elements with controllable phases. A phase cascade configuration is described in which the current ripple in a load resistor goes to zero in the large N limit, enhancing the rectification efficiency without requiring any external capacitor or inductor based filters. The integrated modular configuration is qualitatively different from conventional rectenna arrays in which the source, rectifier and filter systems are physically disjoint. Exact analytical results derived using <b>idealized</b> <b>diodes</b> are compared to a realistic simulation of commercially available diodes. Our results on nonlinear networks of source-rectifier arrays are potentially of interest to a fast evolving field of distributed power networks...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{modeling}} {{can provide}} quantitative insight into cardiac fluid dynamics phenomena {{that are not}} evident from standard imaging tools. We propose {{a new approach to}} modeling left ventricle fluid dynamics based on an image-driven model-based description of ventricular motion. In this approach, the end-diastolic geometry and time-dependent deformation of the left ventricle cavity are obtained from cardiac magnetic resonance images and a fictitious elastic structure is used to impose the contractile behavior of the left ventricle. This allows seamless treatment of the isovolumic phases. Besides the ventricular motion, the intracavitary fluid dynamics is controlled by the mitral valve. Three different mitral valve models are included in the simulation: an <b>idealized</b> <b>diode</b> (with or without regurgitation) and a lumped parameter model accounting for the opening dynamics of the valve and including regurgitation.

40|$|A generic circuit {{partitioning}} {{method is}} proposed which reorders the equations and variables of power electronic circuits with <b>idealized</b> switches and <b>diodes</b> {{in a specific}} bordered block-triangular form, where each block on the diagonal is dependent only on {{a small number of}} switches. The number of floating-point operations for sparse matrix triangularization, needed after a change of switch configuration, is reduced significantly by using the possibility to individually store the triangular LU factors of the diagonal blocks in memory for each possible switch configuration. The method is applicable to any power electronic circuit, but is especially beneficial for electromagnetic transient simulation involving modular multilevel converter (MMC) HVDC topologies where the number of switching components is usually very large. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Idealized</b> {{modelling}} of <b>diodes,</b> relays {{and switches}} {{in the framework}} of linear complementarity is introduced. Within the charge approach, the classical electromechanical analogy is extended to passively and actively switching components in electrical circuits. The associated branch relations are expressed in terms of set-valued functions, which allow to formulate the circuit’s dynamic behaviour as a dierential inclusion. This approach is demonstrated by the example of the DC–DC buck converter. A dierence scheme, known in mechanics as time stepping, is applied for numerical approximation of the evolution problem. The discretized inclusions are formulated as a linear complementarity problem in standard form, which implicitly takes care of all switching events by its solution. State reduction, which requires manipulation of the set-valued branch relations in order to obtain a minimal model, is performed on the example of the buck converter...|$|R
