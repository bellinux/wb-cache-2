500|$|According to {{some historians}} and medical experts, Garfield might have survived his wounds had the doctors {{attending}} him had {{at their disposal}} today's medical research, techniques, and <b>equipment.</b> <b>Standard</b> medical practice at the time dictated that priority be given to locating {{the path of the}} bullet. Several of his doctors inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, a common practice in the 1880s. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield's demise. Biographer Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation. Rutkow, a professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, has argued that starvation also played a role. Rutkow suggests that [...] "Garfield had such a nonlethal wound. In today's world, he would have gone home in a matter of two or three days." ...|$|E
