60|$|And so Jimmy {{found himself}} waiting upon table {{at a place}} that was both reputable and disreputable, serving {{business}} men at noon and criminals and the women of the underworld at night. In the weeks that he was there he came to know many of the local celebrities in various walks of life, to know them at least by name. There was Steve Murray, the labor leader, whom rumor said was one of Feinheimer's financial backers--a large man with a loud voice and the table manners of a <b>Duroc-Jersey.</b> Jimmy took an instinctive dislike to the man {{the first time that he}} saw him.|$|E

From center to center, Paula kept the {{telephones}} warning {{ahead of the}} party's coming, so that Mr. Manson waited to exhibit the great King Polo, and his broad-backed Shorthorn harem, and the Shorthorn harems of bulls that were only little less than King Polo in magnificence and record; and Parkman, the Jersey manager, was on hand, with staffed assistants, to parade Sensational Drake, Golden Jolly, Fontaine Royal, Oxford Master, and Karnak's Fairy Boy--blue ribbon bulls, all, and founders and scions of noble houses of butter-fat renown, and Rosaire Queen, Standby's Dam, Golden Jolly's Lass, Olga's Pride, and Gertie of Maitlands--equally blue-ribboned and blue-blooded Jersey matrons in the royal realm of butter-fat; and Mr. Mendenhall, who had charge of the Shires, proudly exhibited a string of mighty stallions, led by the mighty Mountain Lad, and a longer string of matrons, headed by the Fotherington Princess of the silver whinny. Even old Alden Bessie, the Princess's dam, retired to but part-day's work, he sent for that they might render due honor to so notable a dam.|$|E
50|$|Albert Loeb built Castle Farms as a {{model farm}} to {{showcase}} livestock in addition to new farm equipment that was sold by his company. The original estate covered 1600 acres, and included the Loebs's summer home, caretakers houses, fields, orchards, and this livestock barn complex. Loeb hired Chicago architect Arthur Heun to design the buildings on the estate, including these farm buildings. During the farm's operation, Loeb bred prize-winning stock of Holstein-Friesian cattle, <b>Duroc-Jersey</b> hogs, and Belgian horses. The farm also established a premium-quality mail-order business in butter, syrup, honey, poultry, eggs, and other products. Albert Loeb died in 1924, but his son Ernest continued the farm {{for a few years}} until financial difficulties forcced its closure in 1927.|$|E

40|$|In 1913 an {{investigation}} was {{started at the}} Iowa experiment station in 2 ̆ 7 the laboratories of the animal husbandry section, which aimed toward aiding in a genetic analysis of the belt pattern in Hampshire swine. The crosses, which have already involved many hundreds of pigs, have dealt entirely with the <b>Duroc-Jersey</b> and the Hampshire breeds. The breed standard describes the Hampshires as 2 ̆ 2 black {{with the exception of}} a white belt encircling the body, including the fore legs, 2 ̆ 2 while the <b>Duroc-Jersey</b> is described as being 2 ̆ 2 cherry red without other admixtures. 2 ̆ 2 The white belt of the Hampshire is far from being a fixed character, however, and many pigs continue to come with only partial or imperfect belts, or even with no white whatever. This is true in spite of rigid selection for belts by the breeders. Our work with this belt pattern has shown it to be complex in genetic make-up and no report can be made on its hereditary behavior at this time. The purpose of this paper is to touch briefly upon certain phases of color inheritance in swine as already recorded in various published accounts, and to report in greater detail some new data on the relationship between black and red swine...|$|E
40|$|Several reports {{concerning}} the toxic effects on pigs of feeds natu-rally or experimentally contaminated with aflatoxins, metabolites of AspergiLLm Jlavwl 6, have been publishedl- 33 5 - 8, 12. A British group 35 $ has reported {{the results of}} inclusion of small to moderate amounts of aflatoxin in the feed of pigs during their growth from 40 to 200 lb live weight. They concluded that concentrations of 280 and 410 parts per billion @pb) of affatoxin B 1 in the feed significantly depressed rate of growth and efficiency of feed conversion, primarily in the 40 - 140 lb live-weight range. Microscopic lesions were minimal except in pigs receiving 410 ppb of aflatoxin B 1. This paper presents the pathologic findings in a study designed {{to determine the effects}} of low to moderate levels of aflatoxin, prima-rily BI, in growing pigs from weanling to market-weight age. The results differ in several important respects from those previously reported. The effect on gain in weight and efficiency of feed conver-sion in the pigs has been reported by HINTZ et a]. *. Materials and Methods Two consecutive trials were made on a total of 108 <b>Duroc-Jersey</b> pigs. Trial I consisted of 6 groups, 5 containing 10 pigs each (6 barrows and 4 gilts) and 1 containing 8 pigs (6 barrows and 2 gilts). Beginning at 12 to 14 weeks of age the pigs were fed a peanut-meal ration containing (2, < 8, 51, 105, or 233 ppb aflatoxin Bl for about 107 days. A control group was fed a ration in which soybean meal was substituted for the peanut meal. Trial I 1 consisted of 5 groups of 10 pigs each (6 barrows and 4 gilts). Pigs were 13 to 14 weeks of age at the beginning of the trial and were fed a peanut-mea...|$|E
