5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of termites, various methods {{have been developed to}} track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific <b>ELISA</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The <b>ELISA</b> <b>test,</b> however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine <b>ELISA</b> <b>test</b> with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{serological}} {{laboratory tests}} most widely available and employed are the Western blot and ELISA.

2500|$|Diagnosis of {{heartworm}} {{infection in}} cats is problematic. [...] Like in dogs, a positive <b>ELISA</b> <b>test</b> for heartworm antigen {{is a very}} strong indication of infection. [...] However, the likelihood of a positive antigen test depends on the number of adult female worms present. [...] If only male worms are present, the test will be negative. [...] Even with female worms, an antigen test [...] usually only becomes positive seven to eight months after infection. [...] Therefore, a cat may have significant clinical signs long before the development of a positive test. [...] Heartworm-associated respiratory disease can be found in cats that never develop adult heartworms and therefore never have a positive antigen test.|$|E
2500|$|A {{range of}} {{laboratory}} investigations are performed, where possible, to diagnose {{the disease and}} assess its course and complications. An <b>ELISA</b> <b>test</b> for antigen and IgM antibodies give 88% sensitivity and 90% specificity {{for the presence of}} the infection. Other laboratory findings in Lassa fever include lymphopenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase [...] levels in the blood. Lassa fever virus can also be found in cerebrospinal fluid. In West Africa, where Lassa is most prevalent, it is difficult for doctors to diagnose due to the absence of proper equipment to perform tests. In cases with abdominal pain, in countries where Lassa is common, Lassa fever is often misdiagnosed for example as appendicitis and intussusception which delays treatment with the antiviral ribavirin.|$|E

40|$|Timely {{diagnosis}} of leptospirosis {{is essential for}} an effective treatment. Large diversity of clinical symptoms has led leptospirosis diagnosis difficult. Researchers have conducted many tests with wide-range of sensitivity and specificity to achieve novel diagnostic procedures which have higher sensitivity and specificity compared with previous tests and which are more reliable and available to public laboratories. This study aimed to introduce Lsa 63 and LipL 32 proteins-based <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests</b> with more sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and convenience for public laboratories. Recombinant forms of Lsa 63 and LipL 32 proteins were first generated. After coating these proteins, IgM and IgG <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests</b> were performed. 220 patients with suspicion of leptospirosis infection were selected for serum collection. The sera tests were carried out using MAT, IgM and IgG <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests.</b> In order to assess the performance of ELISA, {{the results of this}} test were compared with MAT. 30 % of serum samples (n= 65) in MAT were positive for leptospirosis infection, while <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests</b> including rLipL 32 - rLsa 63 -IgM and rLipL 32 -rLsa 63 -IgG showed 40. 45 % (n= 89) and 38. 63 % (n= 80) positive reaction, respectively.

40|$|Background: Ruling out somatic bowel disease, such as {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD), is {{an important}} goal {{in the management of}} abdominal complaints. Endoscopy is commonly used but is invasive and expensive. Mucosal inflammation in IBD can be detected through fecal biomarkers, though the present enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (<b>ELISA)</b> <b>tests</b> require laboratory facilities. We validated the diagnostic performance of two new fecal rapid tests (FRTs) for the detection of calprotectin and lactoferrin and assessed their potential to differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Methods: The calprotectin and lactoferrin FRTs and <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on the fecal samples of 114 patients referred for endoscopy, 80 % of whom had IBS and 20 % IBD, and validated against the endoscopic diagnosis. Results: The sensitivity and negative predictive value of the calprotectin FRT were both 100 %, whereas they were 78 % and 95 %, respectively, for the lactoferrin FRT. The specificity and positive predictive value were slightly higher for the lactoferrin FRT. Both FRTs had similar diagnostic accuracy as the corresponding <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests.</b> Conclusions: The calprotectin and lactoferrin rapid tests are as good as the <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests</b> in detecting colonic inflammation.

40|$|Abstract Background Serology {{is often}} used for the {{diagnosis}} of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is important to identify specific antigens that can distinguish between {{the presence or absence}} of antibodies against M. pneumoniae. The two proteins, P 116 and P 1, are found to be immunogenic. By using these in ELISA it is possible to identify an immune response against M. pneumoniae in serum samples. Results A recombinant protein derived from the P 116 protein and one from the P 1 protein were used in two <b>ELISA</b> <b>tests,</b> rP 116 -ELISA and rP 1 -ELISA. Human serum samples from patients with atypical pneumonia were tested and compared to the results of the complement fixation test.
