Diamond and Sidney Farber, proclaimed [...] "father" [...] of modern-day chemotherapy. <b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> <b>Syndrome</b> {{is named after}} him. Children's Hospital Boston is located on Blackfan Street, which is named after Blackfan.|$|E
50|$|At Harvard, {{his main}} {{interests}} were nutrition and hematology. He was Louis K Diamondâ€™s mentor, {{and together they}} wrote the first collection of photographs of microscopic appearances of the Blood in Childhood disease. In 1938, they described <b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> <b>syndrome.</b> He also mentored Sidney Farber, the father of modern cancer chemotherapy. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, next door to Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, is partially named after Sidney Farber.|$|E
40|$|Neutropenia {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of <b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> (congenital hypoplastic anaemia). Three patients are reported: all had neutropenia as well as anaemia, and to investigate {{the cause of the}} neutropenia culture of bone marrow for granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GMCFCs) was performed. Two cases had a low incidence of GMCFCs, but the third case had a high incidence. These findings suggest that myeloid precursors can be abnormal in <b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> and that the mechanism of neutropenia may, like that of anaemia, vary from patient to patient...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an {{important}} cause of inherited aplastic anemia in childhood because of its relatively high frequency of occurrence, the implication for different management, {{and the need for}} genetic counselling. The common manifestations are congenital physical abnormalities, marrow failure, and predisposition to development of cancers. Bone marrow transplantation has been used to treat marrow failure for FA patients but they are at increased risks of transplant related toxicities and graft versus host disease. We report two children with FA who were treated successfully with matched sibling bone marrow transplantation using a new fludarabine-based conditioning regimen without irradiation. The stem cell source was from marrow which was infused after positive selection of CD 34 + cells. Both patients had haematological recovery and no major post-transplant complications occurred. One achieved full donor chimerism and stable mixed chimerism was present in another. This regimen appears to be effective and can prevent FA patients from major transplant related complications. Key words Aplastic anaemia; Bone marrow transplantation; Fanconi anaemia also include rare conditions such as Shwachman-Diamond <b>syndrome,</b> dyskeratosis congenita, <b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> anaemia, Kostmann's <b>syndrome</b> etc. FA is an autosoma...|$|R
40|$|Dyskeratosis congenita and <b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> are two rare {{congenital}} conditions both {{characterized by}} cytopenia due to marrow failure, and special somatic features. We report the successful experience of allogeneic {{bone marrow transplantation}} in two patients each {{with one of the}} conditions. Both had normal reconstitution of marrow activities and became transfusion independent after transplantation. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Infection with Listeria monocytogenes is {{uncommon}} in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, and is even rarer among recipients of bone marrow transplantation. Hemosiderosis, either idiopathic or caused by transfusion, {{appears to be}} another risk factor. We report a 3 -year-old Chinese girl with transfusion-dependent <b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> <b>syndrome</b> who had L. monocytogenes septicemia when she received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. She was treated successfully with intravenous ampicillin. Our case adds to the clinical evidence that patients with iron overload are susceptible to listeriosis, particularly when they are immunocompromised and do not receive iron-chelation treatment. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Congenital hypoplastic anemia (<b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> <b>syndrome)</b> {{is thought}} to involve the erythropoietic cell line alone. In this study, the {{evaluation}} of lymphocyte function in five patients with this syndrome revealed a number of abnormalities. Peripheral blood T lymphocyte percentages as assessed by monoclonal antibodies were decreased in three patients. T-helper/T-suppressor cell (OKT 4 :OKT 8) ratios were almost unity {{in four of the}} five patients. We usually find a ratio of 2 : 1 in normal populations. Studies of lymphocyte-mediated suppression of lymphoproliferation demonstrated an inability to generate concanavalin A-induced suppressor cells in the same four patients and impaired prostaglandin-mediated suppression in two patients. Co-culture studies revealed a T lymphocyte-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis in a single patient, who also showed suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction. The four remaining patients showed no excessive suppressor effects either upon erythropoiesis or lymphoproliferation. These studies demonstrate that in congenital hypoplastic anemia, the cellular defect is not restricted to the erythroid progenitor cells, but extends to the lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Four {{children}} with congenital hypoplastic anemia (<b>Diamond-Blackfan</b> <b>syndrome)</b> and 30 control {{children with}} normal erythropoiesis were studied by a cell culture method {{in which human}} marrow, grown in a plasma clot, responds to added erythropoietin (EPO) {{with the appearance of}} discrete colonies of nucleated erythroid cells. The colonies arise from EPO-responsive stem cells and are not related to the number of morphologically identifiable marrow erythroids plated. Results of studies on control marrow indicated that without EPO there was little or no colony formation. Increasing EPO doses or nucleated marrow cells per culture resulted in a linear increase in colony numbers. The optimal EPO concentration of 2. 5 U/ml yielded a mean of 158 +/- 79 colonies/ 1 x 10 (5) nucleated cells on day 7 of incubation. Even in the absence of recognizable erythroids, marrows of all four patients with anemia grew erythroid colonies. Two patients on no therapy had decreased colony numbers. The other two, on prednisone, had normal numbers. Sera from patients did not inhibit colony formation from either autologous or control marrow. In contrast, serum from an adult with acquired pure red cell aplasia produced striking inhibition of colony growth. It appears that the red cell failure in this disorder is not due to an absence of erythroid stem cells, and a serum inhibitor to erythropoiesis as seen in the acquired disease is unlikely...|$|E
