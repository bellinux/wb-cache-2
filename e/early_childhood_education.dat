5|$|Education in Malaysia {{falls under}} the remit of two federal ministries; the Malaysian Ministry of Education is {{responsible}} for primary and secondary education, while the Ministry of Higher Education has oversight over public universities, polytechnic and community colleges. <b>Early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>education</b> is not directly controlled by the Ministry of Education as it does with primary and secondary education. However, the ministry does oversee the licensing of private kindergartens, the main form of <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>education,</b> {{in accordance with the}} National Pre-School Quality Standard, which was launched in 2013.|$|E

He {{worked as a}} preschool teacher {{for two years before}} the success of The Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, The Wiggles {{became one of the most}} successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well-documented.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>education</b> and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E

5|$|Asma is a {{professional}} Emirati puppeteer, storyteller and creative drama specialist. A graduate of the United Arab Emirates University, Asma earned her BA in English Literature, minoring in drama and theater. Through a Summer Master’s Degree Program in Applied Drama at the City University of New York, Asma distinguished herself as a creative drama specialist, {{with a focus on}} puppetry and <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>education.</b> This led her to be chosen by the Zayed Higher Organization in 2012 to work with children with special needs. As a result of her training with the ‘Kids on the Block’ program, which uses special puppets crafted with different disabilities, Asma has opened up a new field of early childhood intervention; one that uses the dynamics of puppetry and creative drama to enhance education for the most impressionable audience in the UAE.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of the Southern Baptists and United Methodists led {{opposition}} to the amendment during Wilkinson's administration, activating the Coalition Against a State Lottery. Despite the opposition, Kentucky voters approved the lottery amendment {{by a vote of}} 694,577 to 446,937 in the November 1988 elections. Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the lottery. The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's lottery commission. The recommendations included the establishment of a lottery board whose president and members would be appointed by the governor and could only be removed by the governor, and earmarked the first year's proceeds to be split evenly between <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> <b>education</b> programs, programs for the elderly, and a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. Legislators insisted on more legislative control of the lottery and did not favor explicit earmarks for the proceeds, preferring to allocate them in the 1990 legislative session. They also objected to the lottery board's exemption from open records and open meetings laws.|$|E

40|$|Interest {{is growing}} in the {{contributions}} of qualitative research {{to the field of}} <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> special <b>education.</b> One qualitative method, focus groups, is examined. This article discusses what types of <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> special <b>education</b> questions might be addressed in focus groups and suggests guidelines by which to consider the quality of design of focus group use in <b>early</b> <b>childhood</b> special <b>education</b> research. Four key questions are explored that aid in designing and judging focus group research. These include: (a) Who should participate in the focus groups? (b) What checks on credibility should we include? (c) How shall we maintain research stability while allowing for an emergent design? and (d) How will the information gained in the focus groups inform us about the general phenomenon?
