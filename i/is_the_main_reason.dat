5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for the decline of population.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its {{population}} of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was {{the largest in the}} history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost.

5|$|The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was {{the largest}} fire {{in the history of}} Copenhagen, Denmark. It began on the evening of 20 October 1728 and {{continued}} to burn until the morning of 23 October. It destroyed approximately 28% of the city (measured by counting the number of destroyed lots from the cadastre), left 20% of the population homeless, and the reconstruction lasted until 1737.

5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> why it is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E

25|$|Demographers {{have put}} forward several factors behind high birthrates among Muslims in India. According to sociologists Roger and Patricia Jeffery, {{socio-economic}} conditions rather than religious determinism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for higher Muslim birthrates. Indian Muslims are poorer and less educated {{compared to their}} Hindu counterparts. Noted Indian sociologist, B.K. Prasad, argues that since India's Muslim population is more urban compared to their Hindu counterparts, infant mortality rates among Muslims is about 12% lower than those among Hindus.|$|E

25|$|Easter Sunday, which {{immediately}} follows Holy Week {{and begins}} with the Easter Vigil, is the great feast day and apogee of the Christian liturgical year: on this day the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated.

25|$|The {{elements}} are interconnected {{only at the}} exterior nodes, and altogether they should cover the entire domain as accurately as possible. Nodes will have nodal (vector) displacements or degrees of freedom which may include translations, rotations, and for special applications, higher order derivatives of displacements. When the nodes displace, they will drag the elements along in a certain manner dictated by the element formulation. In other words, displacements of any points in the element will be interpolated from the nodal displacements, and this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for the approximate nature of the solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of small molecule devices and displays usually involves thermal evaporation in a vacuum.

However, contrary to polymer-based devices, the vacuum deposition process enables the formation of well controlled, homogeneous films, {{and the construction of}} very complex multi-layer structures. This high flexibility in layer design, enabling distinct charge transport and charge blocking layers to be formed, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reason</b> for the high efficiencies of the small molecule OLEDs.|$|E

25|$|The {{central zone}} of Lofn (100120km in diameter) {{corresponds}} to the crater floor, which lies about 0.6km below the surrounding cratered plains.

Other examples of such craters are Doh and Bran. The hummocky terrain (rim) surrounding the floor consists of randomly distributed massifs as large as 50km and has mottled appearance at some places. The width of the rim unit varies from about 18km on the north-west side to more than 130km on the south-east side.|$|E
