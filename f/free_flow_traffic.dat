One of the main results of Kerner's theory is that traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck is a random (probabilistic) phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (F → S transition) that occurs in a metastable state of free flow at a highway bottleneck. This basic result of Kerner's theory shows the incommensurability of three-phase traffic theory with all earlier traffic flow theories.|$|E

The maximal speed was limited to 120  km/h for <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>traffic,</b> but nevertheless we can see that our model, though optimal for congested conditions, can capture the right speed (see parts of the blue curve from 2, 200  m to 2, 700  m) {{because of the presence of}} some trucks in the images.|$|E
30|$|The time {{correlation}} factor τ {{can be used}} to model the operation of VANETs in three different traffic flow conditions: uncongested (i.e, <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>traffic</b> state with low vehicle density), near capacity (i.e., vehicle density takes intermediate values) and congested state (i.e., high values for the vehicle density). Higher values of τ results in negligible temporal variations in the vehicle speed, which represents an uncongested highway scenario where drivers can drive independent of other vehicles. However, in the uncongested highway scenario, there would be deterioration of link lifetime because of frequent disconnections and non-availability of neighbor nodes for forwarding the packets. When time {{correlation factor}} is less, the vehicle speed would exhibit very high temporal variations and this is equivalent to a congested traffic state. We have selected τ to be equal to 0.9 for some of our simulation experiments so that the performance of the protocol can be studied for a <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>traffic</b> state. The beacon interval determines the frequency with which measurement values are taken for the prediction. It has been observed that, beacon interval Δt has strong influence on accuracy of residual link lifetime prediction as shown in Fig. 6. When Δt is reduced, more measurement values would be available, resulting in accurate prediction at the cost of an increase in complexity. For some of our simulation experiments, we have chosen Δt= 0.6.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue is a {{phenomenon}} that can occur when a structure is exposed for repeated loads dur-ing a long time. This is {{what has happened in}} the Vårby Bridge south of Stockholm. The bridge, which was erected in 1996, was just after ten years during an inspection detected to have cracks in the weld between the stiffener and the flanges. This lead to an extensive inves-tigation to be able to describe what was the cause. Because of the great measurement a lot of data about the <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> and their effect on the bridge was obtained. That raised an idea of comparing the fatigue models in Eurocode against a real case. The question that was of in-terest was how well the Eurocode models actually were compare to the real measurements, how they relate to each other and how they relate to a fictitious real vehicle. The intermediate values for Nobs is showing that there is quite large differences. Therefore they should be used. The model should be a straight line instead of the “stair model” that is used today so the fatigue is designed on the safe side rather than the unsafe side which it is today in the upper part of the span. The results show that the bridge is able to handle the <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>traffic</b> that it is exposed for. At the simulation of FLM 3 together with DEM the result shows a life length that is satisfactory with the recommendations in Eurocode. The ratio between the equivalent stress range for FLM 3 and the <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>traffic</b> was 89 percent. The ratio between FLM 4 and the <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>traffic</b> gave that the traffic was 22 percent higher when the equivalent stress ranges was compared. The comparison between FLM 3 and FLM 4 was made with ÅDTt from the <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> <b>traffic.</b> This gave a ratio of 73 percent between the models, with FLM 4 as the lower one. The fictitious real vehicle of 25, 25 meters didn’t give any critical results, but was higher than the fatigue limit. What could be seen was that the actual contribution from vehicles of the same amplitude that the simulations gave is very low in the <b>free</b> <b>flowing</b> measurements. This means that they are no danger for the bridge. Another conclusion is that measurements should be done on other bridges to see how the stress range of the traffic actually is compared to Eurocode. One should also review the FLM 4 and see if it could be modified to fit the Swedish conditions of vehicle design and distribu-tion. Another thing that might be overlooked is if there could be some sort of collective pa-rameter, taking the fact that not all vehicles are fully loaded in to account. For future struc-tures maybe it would be in place to start cooperate between the designing sector and the truck manufactures to make both the trucks and the bridges as optimized as there can be, and to avoid unnecessary fatigue contribution.

Another important contribution from this work was that ground-truth travel times were recovered by re-identifying vehicles captured on videotape.

The architecture of the traffic monitoring system was designed such that identity information is encrypted and handled separately from traffic information, with no single entity having access to both. The spatial sampling strategy is based on the use of virtual trip lines that can be re-configured on-the-fly. This feature builds-in guaranteed flexibility for future monitoring needs.

By cooperative communication among VMeshes, a local transient information could be “retained ” {{within a given}} geographic region for {{a certain period of}} time, without any infrastructure help. In this paper, we study this “storage capability ” of VMesh. We analyze the scenarios of highway traffic (both one-way and two-way highway <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>traffic),</b> and vehicular traffic in a city environment. For highway traffic, we study different properties of the “VMesh storage”, using a simulation tool that accurately models the freeway vehicular mobility. For city traffic, we first perform simulations based on real traffic trace of San Francisco Yellow Cabs. Then we compare the results with the scenario where a general Random Way Point (RWP) mobility model is used. Our results show that transmission range has high impact on the storage lifetime for one-way highway traffic, {{and the size of the}} region in which we want the information stored has high impacts for two-way highway traffic. For city-wide traffic, the storage’s lifetime generated using San Francisco Yellow Cabs ’ trace is shorter than that obtained using the RWP mobility model. This arises due to the regular movement of the cabs as compared to the random vehicle movement in the RWP mobility model. I...|$|E
40|$|Congestion on {{highways}} often occurs by sudden {{transitions from}} <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> <b>traffic</b> to synchronized traffic. Associated with such phase transitions are large decreases in speed. Such phase transitions {{seem to be}} often caused by temporal distortions in traffic flows, such as a short peak {{in the flow of}} traffic entering a highway from a ramp. If the traffic flow on the ramp has decreased after the peak, congestion on the highway may persist for a longer period. The paper develops a model of congestion for such situations that is based on assumptions about driver behavior and has these characteristics. Critical properties of driver behavior are that, for obvious reasons, sudden large changes in speed are avoided and that reactions to other drivers occur with some delay. In a model where speed can be changed immediately from to any desired value (and vice versa) and drivers react immediately to each other some of the typical characteristics of congestion on highways do not occur. The model suggests that control of the traffic flow, and especially of variations in traffic density, is of major importance in dealing with congestion. Measures for reducing congestion that intend to decrease the average flow of traffic (such as road pricing) should be supplemented by measures reducing the variation in that flow. ...|$|E
