40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis Coalitions of <b>Independent</b> <b>Candidates</b> in Elections to City Councils in the Czech Republic {{deals with}} terms of candidacy Coalitions of <b>Independent</b> <b>Candidates</b> in elections to city councils in Czech cities and municipalities.

The analysis {{is focused on}} comparison {{of the presence of}} Coalitions of <b>Independent</b> <b>Candidates</b> in Czech cities of different size. The focus is mainly on local elections 2014. Successful Coalitions of <b>Independent</b> <b>Candidates</b> has been described in details. The aim is to refer to disadvantages suffered by Coalitions of <b>Independent</b> <b>Candidates</b> in larger cities. The disadvantage is, that Coalitions of <b>Independent</b> <b>Candidates</b> have to produce petition with 7 % signatures of voters from the city, where they want to candidate. Despite this disadvantage is majority of Czech councilors elected from the Coalitions of <b>Independent</b> <b>Candidates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{specifies}} a {{model of}} the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system in which political parties themselves float <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> to gain electoral advantage, leading to a Prisoners’ Dilemma type game where each party tries to out-maneuver one another. Imposing some intuitively appealing assumptions on this game, we show that the total number of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> across constituencies would follow a Negative Binomial distribution. Empirical results for the 2004 parliamentary election in India reveal a good fit of the Negative Binomial model to data. Results also help to identify a few major determinants of the spatial distribution of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> in India. Results point out that the number of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> across constituencies in a State in India is strongly influenced by political fractionalization in that State, with metropolitan and urban constituencies on an average having more <b>independent</b> <b>candidates.</b> We also find that elite politicians and their family members, ceteris paribus, face more <b>independent</b> <b>candidates.</b> Finally, results establish that number of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> is typically less in reserved constituencies due to reduced number of potential candidates. Our results suggest that FPTP electoral systems as in India need to put appropriate institutional constraints that increase transaction costs of electoral participation for <b>independent</b> <b>candidates...</b>|$|R
50|$|Open list {{systems and}} STV, the only PR system {{which does not}} require {{political}} parties, enable <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> to be elected. In Ireland, on average, about six <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> have been elected each parliament.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} number of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> in Indian parliamentary election in the year 2004. The statistical models developed are applications and generalizations of Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions. Our {{results suggest that the}} distribution of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> can be explained well with a negative binomial probability model or its generalizations. Our results also help to identify three major factors behind the variations in the number of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates.</b> First, a major determinant of the number of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> is political fractionalization. Results suggest that the number of non-independent candidates would typically lead to more <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> in the fray. Interestingly, our analysis points out that the major determinant appears to be political fractionalization at the State level rather than at the constituency itself. Second, we find some indirect evidence of presence of free riders. Free riders typically stand in urban constituencies and against the so called VIP candidates. Third, our results suggest that SC and ST constituencies would have typically lower number of <b>independent</b> <b>candidates</b> due to lack of potential candidates as compared to general constituencies. ...|$|R

Berrios prevailed in the November 2010 general election with 46 {{percent of the vote}} in a field that also included Republican Sharon Strobeck-Eckersall. Claypool attributed his defeat to his failure to get enough suburban support to offset Berrios' organization in Chicago.|$|E

Unable to sway enough disaffected Kirchner supporters, Lavagna garnered third place. Alfonsín was honoured by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner with a bust of his likeness at the Casa Rosada on October 1, 2008. This was his last public appearance.|$|E

Aided by the Iran hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation, Reagan won the election in a massive landslide. The 1980 presidential election {{marked the beginning of}} the Reagan Era, and signified a conservative realignment in national politics. At 69 years old, Reagan became the oldest person ever elected U.S. president until 2017, when President Donald Trump was sworn in at the age of 70.|$|E

5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an <b>independent</b> <b>candidate.</b> This was widely seen as a challenge to the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
