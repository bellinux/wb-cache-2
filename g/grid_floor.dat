In this study, the correlation between gut microbiota composition determined by Denaturing Grade Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and tag-encoded 16 S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing (454 /FLX) and behavior in the Tripletest (Elevated Plus Maze, Light/Dark Box, and Open Field combined), the Tail Suspension Test, and Burrowing in 28 female BALB/c mice exposed to two weeks of <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> induced stress was investigated. Cytokine and glucose levels were measured at baseline, during and after exposure to <b>grid</b> <b>floor.</b> Stressing the mice clearly changed the cecal microbiota as determined by both DGGE and pyrosequencing. Odoribacter, Alistipes and an unclassified genus from the Coriobacteriaceae family increased significantly in the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housed mice. Compared to baseline, the mice exposed to <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housing changed {{the amount of time spent}} in the Elevated Plus Maze, in the Light/Dark Box, and burrowing behavior. The <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housed mice had significantly longer immobility duration in the Tail Suspension Test and increased their number of immobility episodes from baseline. Significant correlations were found between GM composition and IL- 1 α, IFN-γ, closed arm entries of Elevated Plus Maze, total time in Elevated Plus Maze, time spent in Light/Dark Box, and time spent in the inner zone of the Open Field as well as total time in the Open Field. Significant correlations were found to the levels of Firmicutes, e. g. various species of Ruminococccaceae and Lachnospiraceae. No significant difference was found for the evaluated cytokines, except an overall decrease in levels from baseline to end. A significant lower level of blood glucose was found in the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housed mice, whereas the HbA 1 c level was significantly higher. It is concluded that <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housing changes the GM composition, which seems to influence certain anxiety-related parameters...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} two {{experiments in}} which preferences of laboratory mice for materials which {{could serve as}} cage enrichment were investigated. In the first experiment, presence of nesting material (paper towel or tissue) {{and the presence of}} a nest box (perforated metal or clear perspex box) were tested against each other. On average, the 47 mice tested spent significantly more time in the cage with the nesting material (more than 69 % of their total time, whereas less than 25 % of their time in the cage with the nest box). In the second experiment, the preferred nesting material (tissues) was placed in a cage with a <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> (previously found to be avoided) and the nest box (perforated metal) was placed in another cage, connected to the first, with a solid floor covered with sawdust bedding material.

Our experimental hypothesis was that the production of fluorescent faeces - following consumption of fluorescent bait - may be used for rodent monitoring. For this purpose we studied the production of fluorescent faeces, temporal dynamics and detectability in wild black rat (Rattus rattus). Wild black rats were individually housed in experimental cages with the wire-mesh <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> and faeces were collected in short-time intervals. The peak of fluorescent activity in faeces was detected 10 - 20 hours after bait ingestion.

40|$|A {{variety of}} space flight models are {{available}} to mimic the physiologic changes seen in the rat during weightlessness. The model reported by Wronski and Morey-Holton has been widely used by many investigators, in musculoskeletal physiologic studies especially, resulting in accumulation of an extensive database that enables scientists to mimic space flight effects in the 1 -g environment of Earth. However, information on nutrition or gastrointestinal and renal function in this space flight model {{is limited by the}} difficulty in acquiring uncontaminated metabolic specimens for analysis. In the Holton system, a traction tape harness is applied to the tail, and the rat's hindquarters are elevated by attaching the harness to a pulley system. Weight-bearing hind limbs are unloaded, and there is a headward fluid shift. The tail-suspended rats are able to move freely about their cages on their forelimbs and tolerate this procedure with minimal signs of stress. The cage used in Holton's model is basically a clear acrylic box set on a plastic <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> with the pulley and tail harness system attached to the open top of the cage. Food is available from a square food cup recessed into a corner of the floor. In this system, urine, feces, and spilled food fall through the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> onto absorbent paper beneath the cage and cannot be separated and recovered quantitatively for analysis in metabolic balance studies. Commercially available metabolic cages are generally cylindrical and have been used with a centrally located suspension apparatus in other space flight models. The large living area, three times as large as most metabolic cages, and the free range of motion unique to Holton's model, essential for musculoskeletal investigations, were sacrificed. Holton's cages can accommodate animals ranging in weight from 70 to 600 g. Although an alternative construction of Holton's cage has been reported, it does not permit collection of separate urine and fecal samples. We describe the modifications to Holton's food delivery system, cage base, and the addition of a separator system for the collection of urine and fecal samples for metabolic and nutrition studies in the tail suspension model...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to provide evidence that the behavioral effects of physostigmine are related to inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adult male Holtzman rats were trained to pole jump to a buzzer as the conditioned stimulus and to electric shock to the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> as the unconditioned stimulus. All drugs were given s. c. as base. Physostigmine (0. 125 - 0. 25 mg/kg) depressed pole jump behavior in methyl atropine (2. 1 mg/kg) or saline-treated rats. (-) Hyoscyamine (1 mg/kg) blocked the actions of physostigmine, suggesting a central site of action. Total brain acetylcholine (ACh) and AChE were determined in various groups of animals. The increase in brain ACh and the decrease in AChE activity were negatively correlated in physostigmine-treated rats. These changes were highly correlated during the onset and peak of physostigmine behavioral effects but not during the recovery period. Although (-) hyoscyamine antagonized the behavioral effects of physostigmine, it did not alter the increase in brain ACh or decrease in brain AChE. It is concluded that most of the behavioral effects of physostigmine are related to central AChE inhibition...|$|E

40|$|Scotophobin is a peptide previouslu {{identified}} [14] as the behaviorally active {{factor in}} brain extract of rats trained in passive dark avoidance. Mice injected intraperitoneally with a synthetic version of scotophobin or placebo were tested without reinforcement {{in a box}} with one dark and two white chambers. Scotophobin recipients spent less time than controls in the dark chamber. When strict precautions were taken against chemical degradation, the dose-response relationship remained stable for months and resembled that found by Ungar for natural scotophobin. A content analysis of all frequent mouse behaviors in the test apparatus delineated a more detailed scotophobin behavior pattern. Scotophobin elevated emotionally as measured by defecation rate when mice were locked in the dark box, but not when they were locked in a white or transparent box. The dark box as used in the original rat training situation produced the maximal drug induced avoidance effect. Avoidance was reduced by stimulus changes involving wall color, illumination, and the <b>grid</b> <b>floor.</b> Thus scotophobin induction of avoidance behavior as well as heightened emotionality appears to show stimulus specificity...|$|E

Adding the shelf to timeouts in one component of multiple fixed-ratio schedules of timeout resulted in higher response rates in the component where the shelf was included (Experiment II). When timeouts with and without the shelf were arranged on concurrent schedules, the shelf-timeout combination was preferred, even when of shorter duration than timeout alone (Experiment III). In all three experiments, subjects climbed on the shelf, although all shocks were cancelled during timeout periods.

Because extinction of a response also requires acquisition of new information, extinction, like original learning, would be expected to require {{protein synthesis}}. The present experiments examined the involvement of protein synthesis in the hippocampus in the extinction of a learned fear-based response known to involve the hippocampus. Rats were trained in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task in which they received footshock after stepping from a small platform to a <b>grid</b> <b>floor.</b> They were then given daily retention tests without footshock. The inhibitory response (e. g., remaining on the platform) gradually extinguished with repeated testing over several days. Footshock administered in a different context, instead of a retention test, prevented the extinction. Infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (80 μg) into the CA 1 region of the hippocampus (bilaterally) 10 min before inhibitory avoidance training impaired retention on all subsequent tests. Anisomycin infused into the hippocampus immediately after the 1 st retention test blocked extinction of the response. Infusions administered before the 1 st retention test induced a temporary (i. e., 1 day) reduction in retention performance and blocked subsequent extinction. These findings are consistent with other evidence that anisomycin blocks both the consolidation of original learning and extinction...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough hippocampal-cortical {{interactions}} are {{crucial for the}} formation of enduring declarative memories, synaptic events that govern long-term memory storage remain mostly unclear. We present evidence that neuronal structural changes, i. e., dendritic spine growth, develop sequentially in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (aCC) during the formation of recent and remote contextual fear memory. We found that mice placed in a conditioning chamber for one 7 min conditioning session and exposed to five footshocks (duration, 2 s; intensity, 0. 7 mA; interstimulus interval, 60 s) delivered through the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> exhibited robust fear response when returned to the experimental context 24 h or 36 d after the conditioning. We then observed that their fear response at the recent, but not the remote, time point was associated with an increase in spine density on hippocampal neurons, whereas an inverse temporal pattern of spine density changes occurred on aCC neurons. At each time point, hippocampal or aCC structural alterations were achieved {{even in the absence of}} recent or remote memory tests, thus suggesting that they were not driven by retrieval processes. Furthermore, ibotenic lesions of the hippocampus impaired remote memory and prevented dendritic spine growth on aCC neurons when they were performed immediately after the conditioning, whereas they were ineffective when performed 24 d later. These findings reveal that gradual structural changes modifying connectivity in hippocampal-cortical networks underlie the formation and expression of remote memory, and that the hippocampus plays a crucial but time-limited role in driving structural plasticity in the cortex...|$|E
