Two models exist which integrate the use of dispersants: Mackay's model and Johansen's model. There are several parameters which must be considered when creating a dispersion model, including oil-slick thickness, advection, resurfacing and wave action. A general problem in modeling dispersants is that they change several of these parameters; surfactants lower {{the thickness of the}} film, increase the amount of diffusion into the water column and increase the amount of breakup caused by wave action. This causes the oil slick's behavior to be more dominated by vertical diffusion than <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection.</b>|$|E

Turbulence is high in the mixed layer. However, it becomes zero {{at the base of the}} mixed layer. Turbulence again increases below the base of the mixed layer due to shear instabilities. At extratropical latitudes this layer is deepest in late winter as a result of surface cooling and winter storms and quite shallow in summer.

Consistent diagnostic evidence has been found in recent MJO-permitting global models viewed from the moisture-mode dynamical paradigm. To test this idea in a causal sense, tropical moisture advection by vorticity anomalies is artificially modulated in a superparameterized global model known to produce a realistic MJO signal. Boosting <b>horizontal</b> moisture <b>advection</b> by tropical vorticity anomalies accelerates and amplifies the simulated MJO in tandem with reduced environmental gross moist stability. Limiting rotational <b>horizontal</b> moisture <b>advection</b> shuts the MJO down. These sensitivities are robust in that they are nearly monotonic with respect to the control parameter and emerge despite basic-state sensitivities favoring the opposite response. Speedup confirms what several diagnostic lines of evidence already suggest—that anomalous moisture advection is fundamental to MJO propagation. The rotational component is shown to be especially critical. Amplification further suggests it {{may play a role in}} adiabatically maintaining the MJO...|$|R

40|$|Severe windstorms {{regularly}} inflict damage throughout Europe. This research examines {{a set of}} 31 midlatitude cyclones, investigating each {{in depth}} but encompassing {{a wide variety of}} such storms. The set is selected using the Storm Severity Index, and categorised using two methods. The first method is based on the relationship between the storm and the jet stream. Four groups emerge: storms that move {{along the edge of the}} jet; that cross the jet stream early; that cross later; or have a split jet. The second method is based on the Pressure Tendency Equation. This establishes whether <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>advection</b> or diabatic processes dominate during storm development. These two approaches are linked: storms in the first two jet groups tend to be driven by <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>advection,</b> and the other two groups by diabatic processes. This work then studies the storms’ forecast quality and spread using ECMWF data. It finds that storm intensity tends to be under-forecast, the forecast storms move too slowly and are too far south. Forecast quality improves and spread decreases earlier in storms that cross the jet early, compared to those that cross later, suggesting a link between jet interaction and forecast error. Storms where <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>advection</b> dominates are on average less well forecast than their diabatic counterparts, but diabatically driven storms tend to have greater forecast spread. Finally, this study proposes metrics for storm-prone situations, examining the configuration of the atmosphere prior to the development of the storms. These describe a variety of key factors for cyclogenesis, such as baroclinicity, barotropicity and moist stability. Of the 31 storms, 29 are associated with a value greater than the 98 th percentile of one or more metrics. There is a large overlap between storms where baroclinicity is strong and those where <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>advection</b> dominates the deepening, confirming that the two approaches are dynamically linked. This relationship between the storms, the dynamics, and the metrics will allow future work to identify sources of uncertainty in modelling severe European windstorms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Direct {{measurements}} of Kuroshio at its origin (18 N, {{east of the}} Luzon Island) are conducted from November 2010 to October 2012. It is found that the depth-averaged Kuroshio between 200 and 700 m has increased over 15 cm s 21 during the 2 year observational period and it is accompanied by the pronounced southward shift of the North Equatorial Current (NEC) bifurcation. Further analysis indicates that the Kuroshio’s strengthening is confined to the upstream segment east of the Luzon Island while the Kuroshio decreased as it passed the Luzon Strait due to a dipole-like sea surface height (SSH) trend between 15 N and 23 N. It is demonstrated that the 2 year strengthening of the Kuroshio, {{as well as the}} dipole-like SSH trend can be adequately reproduced by a 1. 5 layer nonlinear reduced gravity model, suggesting an important role of upper ocean response to low-frequency wind forcing in the western Pacific.

The cloud resolving model is forced by the large-scale vertical velocity and zonal wind and large-scale <b>horizontal</b> <b>advections</b> derived from TOGA COARE for a 20 -day period. Precipitation efficiency may {{be defined as a}} ratio of surface rain rate to sum of surface evaporation and moisture convergence (LSPE) or a ratio of surface rain rate to sum of condensation and deposition rates of supersaturated vapor (CMPE). Moisture budget shows that the atmosphere is moistened (dryed) when the LSPE is less (more) than 100 %. The LSPE could be larger than 100 % for strong convection. This indicates that the drying processes should be included in cumulus parameterization to avoid moisture bias. Statistical analysis shows that the sum of the condensation and deposition rates is bout 80 % of the sum of the surface evaporation rate and moisture convergence, which ads to proportional relation between the two efficiencies when both efficiencies are less han 100 %. The CMPE increases with increasing mass-weighted mean temperature and creasing surface rain rate. This suggests that precipitation is more efficient for warm environment and strong convection.

In the first approach, nighttime eddy covariance measurements were compared to independent values of total ecosystem respiration by means of bottom-up modeling of the underlying biological processes. Turbulent fluxes and storage term were normalized to the fluxes calculated by the bottom-up model. Below a u(*) threshold of 0. 6 m/s the normalized turbulent fluxes decreased with decreasing u(*), but the flux to the storage increased only up to values less than 20 % of the modeled flux at low turbulence. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> was measured by a horizontal CO 2 gradient over a distance of 130 m combined with horizontal wind speed measurements. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> occurred at most of the evenings independently of friction velocity above the canopy. Nevertheless, <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> was higher when u(*) was low. The peaks of <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> correlated with changes in temperature.

The model is forced by the large-scale vertical velocity and zonal wind and large-scale <b>horizontal</b> <b>advections</b> derived from TOGA COARE for a 20 -day period. The role of cloud microphysics is first examined by analyzing mass-weighted mean heat budget and column-integrated moisture budget. Hourly budgets show that local changes of mass-weighted mean temperature and column-integrated moisture are mainly determined by the residuals between vertical thermal advection and latent heat of condensation and between vertical moisture advection and condensation respectively. Thus, atmospheric thermodynamics depends on how cloud microphysical processes are parameterized. Cloud microphysics budgets are then analyzed for raining conditions. For cloud-vapor exchange between cloud system and its embedded environment, rainfall and evaporation of raindrop are compensated by the condensation and deposition of supersaturated vapor. Inside the cloud system, the condensation of supersaturated vapor balances conversion from cloud water to raindrop, snow, and graupel through collection and accretion processes. The deposition of supersaturated vapor balances conversion from cloud ice to snow through conversion and riming processes. The conversion and riming of cloud ice and the accretion of cloud water balance conversion from snow to graupel through accretion process. Finally, the collection of cloud water and the melting of graupel increase raindrop to compensate the loss of raindrop due to rainfall and the evaporation of raindrop...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the roles of various physical processes in baroclinic tropical cyclone (TC) motion and the vertical coupling between the upper- and lower-level circulations, a new dynamical framework is advanced. A TC is treated as a positive potential vorticity (PV) anomaly from environmental flows, and its motion is linked to the positive PV tendency. It is shown that a baroclinic TC moves to the region where the azimuthal wavenumber one component of the PV tendency reaches a maximum, but does not necessarily follow the ventilation flow (the asymmetric flow over the TC center). The contributions of individual physical processes to TC motion are equivalent to their contributions to the wavenumber one PV component of the PV tendency. A PV tendency diagnostic approach is described based on this framework. This approach is evaluated with idealized numerical experiments using a realistic hurricane model. The approach is capable of estimating TC propagation with a suitable accuracy and determining fractional contributions of individual physical processes (<b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>advection,</b> diabatic heating, and friction) to motion. Since the impact of the ventilation flow is also included {{as a part of the}} influence of <b>horizontal</b> PV <b>advection,</b> this dynamical framework is more general and particularly useful in understanding the physical mechanisms of baroclinic and diabatic TC motion. 1...|$|R

The results show that the seasonal shift of the South Asian High in the upper troposphere and the establishment of the EAM and the INM are closely related to the seasonal warming which causes a reversal of the meridional gradient of upper tropospheric mean temperature over the monsoon regions. On the average of 15 years, the reversal time of the temperature gradient in the EAM region (INM region) is concurrent with (one pentad earlier than) the onset time of the summer monsoon. In most years of the 15 -year period, the reversal of temperature gradient coincides or precedes the onset time of the summer monsoon in both the EAM region and the INM region. The results suggest an important role of thermal processes on the establishment of the Asian monsoon. The contributors to the upper tropospheric warming over the EAM region are the strong <b>horizontal</b> warm <b>advection</b> and the diabetic heating against the adiabatic cooling due to upward motion. In the INM region, strong adiabatic heating by subsidence and the diabetic heating are major warming processes against the strong <b>horizontal</b> cold <b>advection</b> related to the persistent northwestlies to the southwestern periphery of the Tibetan Plateau.

The "southern baroclinic zone" lies along the path of the warm Kuroshlo ocean current and beneath the climatological location of the upper level jet stream.

40|$|Effects of {{landfall}} {{location and}} approach angle on track deflection {{associated with a}} tropical cyclone (TC) passing over an idealized and Central Appalachian Mountain is investigated {{by a series of}} idealized numerical experiments. When the TC landfalls on the central portion of the mountain range, it is deflected to the south upstream, passes over the mountain anticyclonically, and then moves westward downstream. The TC motion is steered by the positive vorticity tendency (VT) which is dominated by <b>horizontal</b> vorticity <b>advection</b> upstream and downstream, but with additional influence from the stretching and residual terms, which are mainly associated with diabatic heating and frictional effects. The track deflection mechanism upstream and downstream is similar to the dry flow in previous study, but is very different {{in the vicinity of the}} mountain. When the TC landfalls near the northern (southern) tip, it experiences less (more) southward deflection due to stronger (weaker) vorticity advection around the tip. When the TC approaches the mountain range from the southeast and landfalls on the northern tip, center, or southern tip, the track deflections are similar to those embedded in an easterly flow but with weaker orographic blocking. These results are similar to the cases simulated in the dry flow in previous study, except that there is no track discontinuity due to the weaker orographic blocking associated with strong TC convection. When a TC moves along the north-south mountain range from the south, it tends to deflect toward the mountain and then crosses over to the other side at later time. In these cases, the positive VT is influenced by all <b>horizontal</b> vorticity <b>advection,</b> vorticity stretching (diabatic heating) and residual (friction) terms due to longer and stronger interaction with the mountain range.

Changes in the MJO's amplitude, zonal scale, and phase speed are examined using daily-mean precipitation during boreal winter (November to April) when the MJO is strongest. The MJO precipitation variance increases with tropics mean surface temperature. However, the westward moving waves of the same temporal and spatial scales increase at about the same rate, suggesting that the maintenance mechanism for the MJO does not change with warming. On the other hand, a robust increase in phase speed of the MJO is found with a rate of 5 - 12 % per degree of surface warming. The robust increase in the MJO phase speed are examined using the linear moisture wave theory of Adames and Kim (2016). In this theory, the MJO phase speed is determined by the horizontal moisture gradient in the lower troposphere, the gross dry stability, the convective moisture adjustment timescale, and zonal wavenumber of the MJO. All CMIP 5 models examined show an increase in the horizontal humidity gradient, the gross dry stability and the convective moisture adjustment timescale, while exhibiting a decrease in the zonal wavenumber of the MJO. The increase in the horizontal humidity gradient and zonal scale of the MJO act to increase the speed of the MJO by enhancing <b>horizontal</b> moisture <b>advection</b> associated with the MJO, while the gross dry stability and convective moisture adjustment timescale act to slow down the MJO by dampening the <b>horizontal</b> moisture <b>advection</b> process.

40|$|The {{concept of}} an interannually varying Indian summer monsoon season is {{introduced}} here, considering that {{the duration of the}} primary driving of the Indian monsoon – the large-scale meridional gradient of the deep tropospheric heat source – may vary from one year to another. Onset (withdrawal) is defined as the day when the tropospheric heat source shifts from south to north (north to south). This physical principle leads to a new thermodynamic index of the seasonal mean monsoon. While the traditional measure of seasonal rainfall, averaged from 1 June to 30 September, indicates a breakdown of the ENSO–monsoon relationship in recent decades, it is argued that this breakdown is partly due to the inappropriate definition of a fixed monsoon season. With a new physically based definition of the seasonal mean, the ENSO–monsoon relationship has remained steady over the decades. El Nino (La Nina) events contract (expand) the season, and thus decrease (increase) the seasonal mean monsoon by setting up persistent negative (positive) tropospheric temperature (TT) anomalies over the southern Eurasian region. Thus, we propose a new pathway, whereby the Indian summer monsoon could be influenced by remote climatic phenomena via modification of TT over Eurasia. Diagnostics of the onset and withdrawal processes suggest that onset delay is due to the enhanced adiabatic zubsidence that inhibits vertical mixing of sensible heating from warm landmass during the pre-monsoon months. On the other hand, the major factor that determines whether the withdrawal is early or late is the horizontal advective cooling. Most of the late (early) onsets and early (late) withdrawals are associated with El Nino (La Nina). This link between the ENSO and the monsoon is realized through vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>advections</b> associated with the stationary waves in the upper troposphere set up by the tropical ENSO heating...|$|R

In this study, measurements from a long-term moored buoy are {{used in conjunction with}} satellite, in situ, and atmospheric reanalysis datasets to analyze the seasonal mixed layer heat balance in the thermocline ridge region of the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean. This region is characterized by a shallow mean thermocline (90 m, as measured by the 20 degrees C isotherm) and pronounced seasonal cycles of Ekman pumping and SST (seasonal ranges of - 0. 1 to 0. 6 m day(- 1) and 26 degrees- 29. 5 degrees C, respectively). It is found that surface heat fluxes and <b>horizontal</b> heat <b>advection</b> contribute significantly to the seasonal cycle of mixed layer heat storage. The net surface heat flux tends to warm the mixed layer throughout the year and is strongest during boreal fall and winter, when surface shortwave radiation is highest and latent heat loss is weakest. <b>Horizontal</b> heat <b>advection</b> provides warming during boreal summer and fall, when southwestward surface currents and horizontal SST gradients are strongest, and is close to zero during the remainder of the year. Vertical turbulent mixing, estimated as a residual in the heat balance, also undergoes a significant seasonal cycle.

In spite of no direct wind forcing and negligible thermohaline forcing, the current in Ongul Strait {{is found to be}} strong, with a typical velocity being 0. 3 m/s. The strong current is confined only to the upper 100 - 300 m from the surface. The direction of the mean current changes drastically from southward to northward in May...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Sept. 26, 2014 - March 26, 2015 Surf zone eddies (f < 0. 01 Hz) are important in nearshore mixing, shoreline erosion, the distribution of pollutants, and ecological processes, such as offshore transport of larvae. Surf zone eddies have traditionally been treated as two-dimensional features with horizontal length scales larger than the local water depth. Studies by Lippmann et al. (2010) and Henderson (2014) during the Duck 94 and Surf Zone Eddy Experiment (SUZEE) indicate the presence of vertical structure in eddies. Here, we numerically investigate the vertical variability of surf zone eddies using the Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment-Transport Model (COAWST). We specifically focus {{on the influence of}} wave forcing, bottom friction, and <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> on the structure of eddies. From this study, it is apparent that eddies vary in the vertical and that wave forcing and bottom friction play a strong role in altering the vertical structure while <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> may also have an influence...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the causes of}} the seasonal cycle of the near-surface salinity using a mixed-layer salinity model and a combination of satellite products, atmospheric reanalyses, and in situ observations for the period 2000 - 2008, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. We find that the balance differs from one region to another. In the western tropical Atlantic, it is controlled by <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> from March to November and by freshwater flux and entrainment {{for the rest of the}} year. In the central tropical Atlantic, it is mainly due to the strong contribution of precipitation in agreement with previous results. In the northeastern tropical Atlantic, all terms contribute to the mixed layer salinity between December and March; during the rest of the year, precipitation and zonal advection mainly control the balance. In the Gulf of Guinea, it is driven by freshwater flux from October to February; from March to July, it is controlled by <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> and entrainment; from August to September, mixed-layer salinity variability is weak. Finally, in the Congo region, it is driven by freshwater flux (precipitation and runoff from Congo River) from September to December, by <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> during January to March, and by vertical entrainment during the rest of the year (April to August). There are some discrepancies between observed and modeled salinity tendencies. Some of them are due to our model formulation, which does not explicitly account for the effect of vertical diffusion. Uncertainties of observation products, which force the model, are also sources of errors...|$|E
40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) is an {{essential}} part of the hydrological cycle and accurately estimating it plays a crucial role in water resource management. Surface energy balance (SEB) models are widely used to estimate regional ET with remote sensing. The presence of <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection,</b> however, perturbs the surface energy balance system and contributes to the uncertainty of energy influxes. Thus, it is vital to consider <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> when applying SEB models to estimate ET. This study proposes an innovative and simplified approach, the surface energy balance-advection (SEB-A) method, which is based on the energy balance theory and also takes into account the <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection</b> to determine ET by remote sensing. The SEB-A method considers that the actual ET consists of two parts: the local ET that is regulated by the energy balance system and the exotic ET that arises from <b>horizontal</b> <b>advection.</b> To evaluate the SEB-A method, it was applied to the middle region of the Heihe River in China. Instantaneous ET for three days were acquired and assessed with ET measurements from eddy covariance (EC) systems. The results demonstrated that the ET estimates had a high accuracy, with a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 713, a mean average error (MAE) of 39. 3 W/m 2 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 54. 6 W/m 2 between the estimates and corresponding measurements. Percent error was calculated to more rigorously assess the accuracy of these estimates, and it ranged from 0 % to 35 %, with over 80 % of the locations within a 20 % error. To better understand the SEB-A method, the relationship between the ET estimates and land use types was analyzed, and the results indicated that the ET estimates had spatial distributions that correlated with vegetation patterns and could well demonstrate the ET differences caused by different land use types. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the SEB-A method requested accurate estimation of the available energy, R n − G, but was less constrained with the difference between ground and air temperature, T 0 − T a – l o c...|$|E
40|$|Explosive {{maritime}} cyclogenetic {{events are}} usually {{aligned with the}} warm currents off the east coasts of Japan and the U. S. One such event occurred during FGGE in an area which featured good instrumented ship and aircraft coverage. The UCLA 4 th order GMC was employed to generate predictions of the event for comparisons with the real-world data. FGGE III-b data were used to initialize the model calculations. Attention was directed to the physical processes causing {{the onset of the}} cyclogenesis, particularly the heat budgets of the fluxes involved. The diabatic heating was observed to be equivalent to the <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>advection.</b> The main source of energy around the cyclone center was identified as the conversion of energy from static energy to kinetic energy. Further analyses of similar events are required if the present results are to be validated...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. A rapidly intensifying wintertime cyclone {{impacted}} the Hawaiian Islands from 11 to 15 December 2008. A detailed {{case study}} {{of the evolution of}} this meteorology “bomb” is conducted using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data. The focus is on the dynamic forcing and large-scale settings between the deepening and decaying stages. Model sensitivity simulations are conducted using the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model to diagnose the roles played by latent heat release on the evolution of the storm. Feedbacks of latent heat release contribute to the rapid cyclogenesis. Latent heat release enhances vertical motion in the eastern flank of the surface cyclone, which 1) increases the potential vorticity (PV) advection aloft; 2) causes surface pressure falls underneath with stronger cyclonic flow; 3) strengthens the low-level frontogenesis as cold and warm air are brought into juxtaposition and 4) brings moisture from the tropics into the warm sector with increased southerly winds. With a westward tilted vertical structure, the feedback of latent heat release further increases the upper-level forcing as the enhanced low-level <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>advection</b> deepens the upper-level trough and intensifies the upper-level ridge. During the decaying stage, latent heat release slows down the cyclolysis with similar processes, but the impact and feedbacks of latent heat release are less significant as compared to the deepening stage due to 1) decreasing moisture and low-level instability as the cyclone moves northwestward, and 2) less significant westward tilted structure. The enhanced rising motion associated with PV advection aloft is in the northeast quadrant of the upper-level low, thus the feedback of latent heat release weakens the upper-level low. Furthermore, without a westward tilt of the trough axis, the enhanced <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>advection</b> neither deepens the upper-level trough and intensifies upper-level ridge nor increases the upper-level forcing...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{version of}} the {{classical}} surface pressure tendency equation (PTE) is applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis data to quantitatively assess the contribution of diabatic processes to the deepening of extratropical cyclones relative to effects of temperature advection and vertical motions. The five cyclone cases selected, Lothar and Martin in December 1999, Kyrill in January 2007, Klaus in January 2009, and Xynthia in February 2010, all showed explosive deepening and brought considerable damage to parts of Europe. For Xynthia, Klaus and Lothar diabatic processes contribute more to the observed surface pressure fall than <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>advection</b> during their respective explosive deepening phases, while Kyrill and Martin {{appear to be more}} baroclinically driven storms. The powerful new diagnostic tool presented here can easily be applied to large numbers of cyclones and will help to better understand the role of diabatic processes in future changes in extratropical storminess...|$|R
