50|$|When available, astronomical star sights {{are able}} to give the {{meridian}} bearing to better than one hundred times {{the accuracy of the}} <b>gyro-theodolite.</b> Where this extra precision is not required, the <b>gyro-theodolite</b> is able to produce a result quickly without the need for night observations.|$|E
50|$|Unlike an {{artificial}} horizon or inertial navigation system, a <b>gyro-theodolite</b> cannot be relocated {{while it is}} operating. It must be restarted again at each site.|$|E
50|$|Although a <b>gyro-theodolite</b> {{functions}} at {{the equator}} {{and in both}} {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres, it cannot be used at either the North Pole or South Pole, where the Earth's axis is precisely perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the spinner and the meridian is undefined. Gyro-theodolites are not normally used within about 15 degrees of the pole because the east-west component of the Earth’s rotation is insufficient to obtain reliable results.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the main {{elements}} of <b>gyro-theodolites</b> and {{inertial navigation systems}} are provided. The main function principles of mechanical gyros are explained and the main difficulties in maintenance and sources of errors while measuring with gyros and <b>gyro-theodolites</b> are listed. The principles of RLG and FOG gyros and the principles of inertial navigation are explained. The main differences of a guided platform and a strap-down system are explained. A brief review of mathematical expressions for position coordinate- determination from double integration of acceleration measurements from accelerometers is given. It is indicated on difficulties in INS application during a long time period caused by insufficient knowledge of gravity acceleration due to locally gravity anomalies and gyro-drift. The necessity of INS signal correction using another  positioning system  like GNSS is pointed out, applying Kalman filter algorithms for interpolation between two measuring points so as position prediction of points which are not measured.  </div...|$|R
50|$|When the spinner is {{released}} from restraint with its {{axis of rotation}} aligned close to the meridian, the gyroscopic reaction of spin and Earth’s rotation results in precession of the spin axis {{in the direction of}} alignment with the plane of the meridian. This is because the daily rotation of the Earth is in effect continuously tilting the east-west axis of the station. The spinner axis then accelerates towards and overshoots the meridian, it then slows to a halt at an extreme point before similarly swinging back towards the initial point of release. This oscillation in azimuth of the spinner axis about the meridian repeats with a period of a few minutes. In practice the amplitude of oscillation will only gradually reduce as energy is lost due to the minimal damping present. <b>Gyro-theodolites</b> employ an undamped oscillating system because a determination can be obtained in less than about 20 minutes, while the asymptotic settling of a damped gyro-compass would take many times that before any reasonable determination of meridian could possibly be made.|$|R
5000|$|Gyro-theodolites are {{primarily}} {{used in the}} absence of astronomical star sights and GPS. For example, where a conduit must pass under a river, a vertical shaft {{on each side of the}} river might be connected by a horizontal tunnel. A <b>gyro-theodolite</b> can be operated at the surface and then again at the foot of the shafts to identify the directions needed to tunnel between the base of the two shafts. [...] During the construction of the Channel Tunnel, which runs under the English Channel from France to the UK, gyro-theodolites were used to align the tunnels.|$|E
50|$|When not in operation, the {{gyroscope}} assembly {{is anchored}} within the instrument. The electrically powered gyroscope is started while restrained and then released for operation. During operation the gyroscope is supported within the instrument assembly, typically on a thin vertical tape that constrains the gyroscope spinner axis to remain horizontal. The {{alignment of the}} spin axis is permitted to rotate in azimuth by only the small amount required during operation. An initial approximate estimate of the meridian is needed. This might be determined with a magnetic compass, from an existing survey network or {{by the use of}} the <b>gyro-theodolite</b> in an extended tracking mode.|$|E
5000|$|In 1852, the French {{physicist}} Léon Foucault {{discovered that}} a gyro with {{two degrees of freedom}} points north. This principle was adapted by Max Schuler in 1921 to build the first surveying gyro. In 1949, the <b>gyro-theodolite</b> - at that time called a [...] "meridian pointer" [...] or [...] "meridian indicator" [...] - was first used by the Clausthal Mining Academy underground. Several years later it was improved with the addition of autocollimation telescopes. In 1960, the Fennel Kassel company produced the first of the KT1 series of gyro-theodolites. Fennel Kassel and others later produced gyro attachments that can be mounted on normal theodolites.|$|E
30|$|The older dataset of {{magnetic}} measurements used {{here is the}} total intensity F measured {{by means of a}} proton magnetometer around 1990.0 by the former Geophysical Enterprise of Tirana and covers all Albanian territory with an array of 28 sites (Duka and Bushati, 1991). In September 1994 (epoch 1994.75), in the framework of a joint project between the CGG, PDTU and the former ING a new vector magnetic survey measuring F, inclination I and declination D (Chiappini et al., 1997, 1999) covered the Albanian territory. The measurements were taken by using a Geometrics proton magnetometer and a Bartington fluxgate theodolite, together with a <b>gyro-theodolite</b> for the absolute determination of the geographical azimuth. In August 2003 (epoch 2003.6; Duka et al., 2004) another scalar field campaign was conducted for the total intensity F only using an Overhauser effect magnetometer, repeating the scalar measurements at 10 of the 28 sites of the previous F survey. At each site data were recorded for 1 – 2 hours in order to obtain a satisfactory accumulation of total intensity data.|$|E
40|$|Obviously the {{distance}} between the CNGS Target at CERN and the LNGS Opera experiment cannot be measured directly and in fact requires the combination of three independent sets of measurements: two to link underground reference points at each site to corresponding points on the surface; and a third to link the surface points at both sites. the Opera results raised questions about the speed at which neutrinos travelled, the main alignment concern for the CNGS beamline had been an orientation problem -to ensure that the beamline arrived to within 100 m of its target at LNGS. GPS measurements at the two sites, and the use of <b>gyro-theodolite</b> measurements in the tunnel at CERN, ensured that the absolute alignment of the beamline was established to the required accuracy. determinations of the links between the surface and the tunnel were not considered necessary until interest grew in {{the distance}} between the sites, at which point additional measurement campaigns were organised in order to further reduce the uncertainty in the distance. Details of all these campaigns and the distance estimates will be given...|$|E
40|$|The {{surveying}} and alignment {{activities at}} Fermilab are {{the responsibility of}} the Alignment and Metrology Group. The Group supports and interacts with physicists and engineers working on any particular project, from the facility construction phase to the installation and final alignment of components in the beam line. One of the goals of the Alignment and Metrology Group is to upgrade the old survey networks in the tunnel using modern surveying technology, such as the Laser Tracker for tunnel networks and GPS for the surface networks. According to the job needs, all surveys are done with Laser Trackers and/or Videogrammetry (V-STARS) systems for spatial coordinates; optical and electronic levels are used for elevations, <b>Gyro-Theodolite</b> for azimuths, Mekometer for distances and GPS for baseline vectors. The group has recently purchased two new API Laser Trackers, one INCA 3 camera for the V-Stars, and one DNA 03 digital level. This report presents the projects and major activities of the Alignment and Metrology Group at Fermilab during the period of 2000 to 2004. It focuses on the most important current projects, especially those that have to be completed during the currently scheduled three-month shutdown period. Future projects, in addition to the status of the current projects, are also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the strain and velocity behaviour of the ice surface near the two German Antarctic Stations on Filchner/Ronne and Ekström ice shelves was performed {{by the use of}} various geodetic measuring techniques. The relative positions and heights of control points valid for reference data were deduced from terrestrial observations (horizontal and vertical angle selectro optical distances). After a second sampling of data, these values served {{as the basis for the}} deformation analyses. Doppler-Satellite-observations (Navy Navigation Satellite System) made absolute positioning (latitude, longitude, height) of special points possible. These Doppler observations, supported by azimuth measurements (<b>gyro-theodolite</b> and sun observations) provided the datum of control networks (translations and orientation). After the repetition of these observations, the drift rates and azimuths of the control points as wenas the rotanon rates of the surface elements could be given. From vertical angles and horizontal distances differences in height end refraction coefficients were calculated. On days without clouds the refraction coefflcients increased by arnounts of up to 3. 0 (in extreme cases up to 5. 0). Distances over 1 km have to be subdivided to reach a standard deviation level of an heigh: difference better than 0. 05 m. In order to determine the heterögeneity of refraction, some height differences should be measured with higher accuracy end-by subdivision of distances...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of the distance from CERN to Gran Sasso involves the combination of three independent sets of measurements: the {{calculation of}} the distance between pillars included in the geodetic reference network at CERN and the Lab Nationale Gran Sasso (LNGS); and the transfer on each site of coordinates, from the geodetic surface network, underground into the tunnel or experiment hall installations. The transfer of coordinates, from the surface, underground at the two sites was not done {{as part of the}} CNGS Project. Initial survey concerns for the project were directed towards the orientation of the beamline from CERN to LNGS to within ~ 100 m. <b>Gyro-theodolite</b> measurements underground were planned at CERN so a transfer would effectively only translate the target point. Given the precision estimated for previous transfers, it was decided not to undertake expensive and time-consuming measurements campaigns for a negligible gain in accuracy. Therefore only GPS measurements at the two sites were carried out. The Opera results which raised questions about the speed at which neutrinos travelled, increased interest in the calculated distance between the two installations. In spite of the estimated distance precision, two measurement campaigns to establish the link between the surface network and the underground networks were undertaken, together with further GPS measurements. Details of these campaigns, with comparisons to the initial values, and revised estimates of the distance will be given...|$|E
40|$|One {{of prime}} aspects of {{surveying}} projects is guidance of paths {{of a long}} tunnel from different directions and finally ending all paths in a specific place. This kind of underground surveying, because of particular condition, has some different points {{in relation to the}} ground surveying, including Improper geometry in underground transverse, low precise measurement in direction and length due to condition such as refraction, distinct gravity between underground point and corresponding point on the ground (both value and direction of gravity) and etc. To solve this problems, astro-geodetic that is part of geodesy science, can help surveying engineers. In this article, the role of astronomy is defined in two subjects: 1 - Azimuth determination of directions from entrance and exit nets of tunnel and also calibration of <b>gyro-theodolite</b> to use them in Underground transvers: By astronomical methods, azimuth of directions can be determine with an accuracy of 0. 5 arcsecond, whereas, nowadays, no gyroscope can measure the azimuth in this accuracy; For instance, accuracy of the most precise gyroscope (Gyromat 5000) is 1. 2 cm over a distance of one kilometre (2. 4 arcsecond). Furthermore, the calibration methods that will be mention in this article, have significance effects on underground transverse. 2 - Height relation between entrance point and exit point is problematic and time consuming; For example, in a 3 km long tunnel (in Arak- Khoram Abad freeway), to relate entrance point to exit point, it is necessary to perform levelling about 90 km. Other example of this boring and time consuming levelling is in Kerman tunnel. This tunnel is 36 km length, but to transfer the entrance point height to exit point, 150 km levelling is needed. According to this paper, The solution for this difficulty is application of astro-geodetic and determination of vertical deflection by digital zenith camera system TZK 2 -D. These two elements make possible to define geoid profile in terms of tunnel azimuth in entrance and exit of tunnel; So by doing this, surveying engineers are able to transfer entrance point height to exit point of tunnels in easiest way...|$|E
