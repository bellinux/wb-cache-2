40|$|Abstract- Cyclic {{redundancy}} checking is {{a method}} of checking for errors in data that has been transmitted on a communications link. The Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an efficient technique for detecting errors during digital data transmissions between a source and a destination. It {{is designed to be}} fast and easy to implement in a hardware by using logic XOR (<b>exclusive</b> <b>OR)</b> <b>gates</b> and shifters. The algorithm provides very good protection from burst errors, which are typical for transmission lines. Thanks to easy implementation, it is useful for error detection but cannot safely rely on data integrity verification. This paper describes the mathematical basis behind CRC in an intuitive fashion and then explains Algorithm for the serial CRC generating and checking at both transmitter and receiver side. This includes analyzing various types of error during transmission. Keywords- Checksum, Codeword, CRC standards...|$|R

40|$|Recently, we {{developed}} two ultra-fast all-optical switches in the nanosecond and picosecond regimes. The picosecond switch {{is made of}} a polydiacetylene thin film coated on the interior wall of a hollow capillary of approximately 50 micron diameter by a photo-polymerization process. In the setup a picosecond Nd:YAG laser at 10 Hz and at 532 nm with a pulse duration of approximately 40 ps was sent collinearly along a cw He-Ne laser beam and both were waveguided through the hollow capillary. The setup functioned as an <b>Exclusive</b> <b>OR</b> <b>gate.</b> On the other hand, the material used in the nanosecond switch is a phthalocyanine thin film, deposited on a glass substrate by a vapor deposition technique. In the setup a nanosecond, 10 Hz, Nd:YAG laser of 8 ns pulse duration was sent collinearly along a cw He-Ne laser beam and both were wave-guided through the phthalocyanine thin film. The setup in this case functioned as an all-optical AND logic gate. The characteristic table of the ExOR gate in polydiacetylene film was attributed to an excited state absorption process, while that of the AND gate was attributed to a saturation process of the first excited state. Both mechanisms were thoroughly investigated theoretically and found to agree remarkably well with the experimental results.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{principle}} and {{the implementation of}} novel light-emitting logic devices based on the real-space transfer (RST) of hot electrons between complementary conducting layers. One of these layers, the emitter, is doped n-type and has two or more contacts for applying the lateral electric field. Heated by this field, electrons are injected into a complementary p-type collector layer, contacted independently. The injection current {{is accompanied by a}} luminescence signal arising from the recombination of the transferred electrons in a specially designed collector active region. The peculiar symmetry of charge injection by RST enables one to implement functional logic gates. The simplest structure with two emitter contacts acts as an <b>exclusive</b> <b>OR</b> <b>gate</b> in the dependence of both the collector current and the output light on the input voltages. The multiterminal device performs such functions as OR and NAND and is electrically reprogrammable between these functions. room temperature.

These studies, based on continuation modeling and transient device simulation, reveal a variety of instabilities and a striking novelty of multiply-connected current-voltage characteristics. A RST transistor can support anomalous steady states in which hot-electron injection occurs {{in the absence of any}} voltage between the emitter electrodes. Some of these states break the reflection symmetry in the plane normal to the channel at midpoint. In the anomalous states, the electron heating is due to a fringing field from the collector electrode. The formation of hot-electron domains in real-space transfer represents a transition to such a collector-controlled state. 1...|$|E

Examples include a multiplexer (MUX), a latch, two <b>exclusive</b> <b>OR</b> (XOR) <b>gates,</b> and a buffer/level shifter, circuits that typically employ stacked differential pairs in conventional ECL and hence do not easily lend themselves to low voltage operation. When implemented in a 1. 5 -pm, 12 -GHz bipolar technology, these circuits exhibit a speed comparable with that of their 1. 5 -V CMOS counterparts designed in a 0. 5 -pm process with a threshold voltage of 0. 5 V.

5000|$|To {{implement}} reversible computation, estimate its cost, and {{to judge}} its limits, {{it can be}} formalized in terms of gate-level circuits. A simplified model of such circuits {{is one in which}} inputs are consumed (however, note that real logic gates as implemented e.g. in CMOS do not do this). In this modeling framework, an inverter (logic gate) (NOT) gate is reversible because it can be undone. The <b>exclusive</b> <b>or</b> (XOR) <b>gate</b> is irreversible because its two inputs cannot be unambiguously reconstructed from its single output. However, a reversible version of the XOR gate—the controlled NOT gate (CNOT)—can be defined by preserving one of the inputs. The three-input variant of the CNOT gate is called the Toffoli gate. It preserves two of its inputs a,b and replaces the third c by [...] With , this gives the AND function, and with [...] this gives the NOT function. Thus, the Toffoli gate is universal and can implement any reversible Boolean function (given enough zero-initialized ancillary bits). More generally, reversible gates that consume their input have no more inputs than outputs. A reversible circuit connects reversible gates without fanouts and loops. Therefore, such circuits contain equal numbers of input and output wires, each going through an entire circuit. Similarly, in the Turing machine model of computation, a reversible Turing machine is one whose transition function is invertible, so that each machine state has at most one predecessor.|$|R
