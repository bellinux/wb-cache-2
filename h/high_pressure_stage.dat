40|$|The tip {{clearance}} flow within industrial axial compressor rows {{has a significant}} impact on compressor performance. This is especially the case in the later <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> which have a significantly shorter blade length and relatively larger {{tip clearance}} than the early <b>stages.</b> <b>Pressure</b> driven fluid leaks through the tip clearance producing losses and because of the short blading this is the largest source of loss in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages.</b> Most tip clearance flow work and understanding focuses on the early stages which have smaller relative tip clearances and are similar to aero engines. This work strives to understand the physics behind these large tip clearance flows and how they can be managed to reduce losses increasing the efficiency of the machine. It would be desirable to use computational techniques to solve all flow feature problems within turbomachinery reducing time and cost. However these techniques have limited accuracy and rely on the expertise of the user to obtain the best result possible. For this reason experimental result are used to calibrate and understand the differences between the computational and real machines. 2. Why? The tip clearance is required because of the relative motion of the blade to the casing {{and they need to be}} large enough to cope with thermal expansions of the blades and casing at the most extreme operating conditions. Throughout the compressor the density of the working fluid is increased from stage to stage thus the volumetric flow rate decreases for the same mass flow rate. This means that the annulus cross sectional area has to be reduced to keep a reasonable axial velocity. An industrial axial machine has one shaft thus all of the blade rows in the compressor and turbine rotate at the same rotational velocity. Therefore in order to keep the tangential blade speed up to produce blade loading the radius has to be kept large. This means that the tip clearances in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> are relatively large compared to the blade radius and can typically be six percent of the annulus height. Improving the flow through the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> will increase the efficiency and make the compressor more robust increasing the operating range postponing stall or surge...|$|R
25|$|In a {{multi-stage}} compressor, at the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages,</b> {{axial velocity}} is very small. Stalling value decreases {{with a small}} deviation from the design point causing stall near the hub and tip regions whose size increases with decreasing flow rates. They grow larger at very low flow rate and affect the entire blade height. Delivery pressure significantly drops with large stalling {{which can lead to}} flow reversal. The stage efficiency drops with higher losses.|$|R

40|$|Clearance leakage {{losses of}} axial {{compressor}} rotors and stators {{have a major}} impact on the overall compressor performance. The clearance heights in the last stages (high pressure stages) of a gas turbine compressor are very large in comparison to the low pressure stages due to mechanical constraints and small blade heights. The reduction of clearance leakage losses in a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> still holds an important potential for the overall performance improvement at design point conditions. In the following work, a method for tip clearance loss reduction by circumferential casing contouring above a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> rotor with a constant clearance height is presented.

Starting over with a 3 DOptimization of the mentioned rotor casing the work additionally refers to the aerodynamic effects and the off design performance of the optimized geometry.

5000|$|Increasing {{pressure}} ratio, as Figure 1 above shows, {{increasing the}} pressure ratio increases {{the efficiency of}} the Brayton cycle. This is analogous to the increase of efficiency seen in the Otto cycle when the compression ratio is increased. However, practical limits occur when it comes to increasing the pressure ratio. First of all, increasing the pressure ratio increases the compressor discharge temperature. This can cause the temperature of the gasses leaving the combustor to exceed the metallurgical limits of the turbine. Also, the diameter of the compressor blades becomes progressively smaller in <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> of the compressor. Because the gap between the blades and the engine casing increases in size {{as a percentage of the}} compressor blade height as the blades get smaller in diameter, a greater percentage of the compressed air can leak back past the blades in <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages.</b> This causes a drop in compressor efficiency, and is most likely to occur in smaller gas turbines (since blades are inherently smaller to begin with). Finally, as can be seen in Figure 1, the efficiency levels off as pressure ratio increases. Hence, little gain is expected by increasing the pressure ratio further if it is already at a high level.|$|R

50|$|In the {{compressor}} at <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> if there occurs a deviation from design point (at which compressor {{is designed to}} operate) the angle of attack exceeds its stalling value and stall cells (which are the regions where fluid starts to whirl at a particular location and doesn't move forward) to form at hub and tip of the blade. The size of these cells increases with decreasing flow rate. If the flow rate is further reduced these cells grow larger and it affects the whole blade height and this causes significant drop in the delivery pressure and at very low flow rate, flow reversal takes place which is known as surge. It also results in drop in stage efficiency of {{the compressor}} and its delivery pressure.|$|R

40|$|Large tip {{clearances}} in {{the region}} of six percent span exist in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> of compressors of industrial gas turbines. The over tip clearance ﬂow causes signiﬁcant block-age and accounts for the largest proportion of loss in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> compressor. This paper examines large tip clearances in two different compressor cascades. The ﬁrst was a cascade of controlled-diffusion blades and the second cascade had geome¬try more representative of modern engine practise. The second cascade also featured realistic inlet boundary layer conditions delivered by an upstream injection system. Increasing the understanding of such ﬂows will allow for improvements in the design of such compressors. The key conclusions of this paper are: a) At large tip clearances the tip clearance is the primary variable inﬂuencing the ﬂow pattern, blade geometry is a secondary consideration; b) The blade geometry has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on loss gener¬ation through the cascade; c) With increasing tip clearance the loss generation through the cascade can diminish but the ﬂow turning is much reduced; and d) The blade loading at the tip can increase at large tip clearances. ...|$|R

40|$|The Laboratory of Industrial Energy {{systems has}} {{evaluated}} {{a series of}} high performance air-water heat pump concepts with the aim to retrofit existing fuel fired boilers for residential hydronic heating systems. The results are published {{within the framework of}} the Swiss Retrofit Heat Pump project, which is conducted by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The two-stage heat pump cycle has shown the best efficiency prospects. Oil migration between the upper stage and lower stage compressors is the main obstacle for commercialization in the low heat rate range. The oil mass concentration is measured by the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrospopy (FTIR) method with an attenuated total reflection cell (ATR). This method was calibrated on a separated test loop and compared to measurements of mass-sampling and of density by a Coriolis effect densitymeter. Infrared analysis gives a precision of < 0. 1 % of oil concentration and the detection limit was identified at about 0. 3 %. Density measurements cannot be used in the ordinary temperature range of the liquid line in the heat pump. Mass sampling and the FT-IR measurements give corresponding results. An air-water heat pump (10 kWth, R- 407 C) was build in the laboratory to perform comparison tests in the single-stage and two-stage heating modes. The main elements of the heat pump are: two scroll type compressors, a brazed plate condenser, a finned tube evaporator, an economizer heat exchanger and two electronic expansion valves. Defrosting is done by cycle inversion with a 4 -way reversing valve. Measured improvements on the two-stage heating mode of 30 % for the COP and 24 % for the heat output comparing to the corresponding test point (A- 7 /W 50) in the single stage configuration have been shown. Important reductions of the maximum system temperature at the outlet of the compressors enable an extended range of application (including the point A- 12 /W 65). In the two-stage heating mode an oil transfer rate of 5 - 10 g/min from the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> to the low pressure stage compressor was detected in all tested conditions, which is strongly limiting the continuous service of the heat pump. For long term running tests an additional balancing system composed of an oil pump and an oil vessel has been installed. The circulating oil concentration is between 0. 2 % and 0. 4 % for the two-stage configuration as measured with the FT-IR method. In single-stage mode the concentration is lower than 0. 2 % and only the mass sampling technique provided reliable results. Sensibility analysis in changing the regulation parameters did not give concluding results in order to design a stable configuration of the two-stage heat pump. In absence of integrated two-stage scroll compressors intermediate solutions have to be considered. These consist in the implementation of a booster compressor or the implementation of an oil separator at the outlet of the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> compressor coupled with a oil return management or a periodic shut down of the heat pump with external balancing of the oil level in the crankcase.

40|$|AbstractThe first <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> of {{a modern}} gas turbine {{operates}} at very high temperatures that require complex blade-cooling systems to guarantee high performance and efficiency of the gas turbine while maintaining a very low level of energy losses, though using compressed air for cooling. An accurate and efficient conjugate heat transfer (CHT) solver is thus necessary to compute the flow and temperature fields of the air within the cooling channels and of the gas around the blades—{{by means of the}} Navier—Stokes and energy equations—as well as the blade temperature field, by means of the heat conduction equation. Due to the very high geometrical complexity of the cooling channels within the blades, generating a body fitted mesh for the three domains—air, gas and blade—is extremely difficult and time consuming. Nevertheless, many turbine blade-cooling simulations have been performed with success, though at large computational cost, see, e. g., [1]. A promising alternative approach is provided by the Immersed Boundary (IB) method, which discretizes both the solid and fluid fields by means of a single Cartesian grid, thus reducing the grid generation process to a relatively simple and quick task—an interesting review of the IB method and its application is provided in [2]. The CFD group at the Department of Mechanics, Mathematics and Management of the Polytechnic of Bari has chosen such an approach, by first developing and improving an accurate and efficient IB method for the compressible Navier—Stokes equations [3, 4], and later extending it with success to solve CHT problems [5]. At present, these works are limited to two-dimensional serial calculations. The aim of this work is to extend the two-dimensional IB solver to three-dimensions, using a new IB least-squares reconstruction, an advanced data structure and a parallel solver, so as to obtain a computational tool capable of computing very complex CHT problems within reasonable computational times...|$|E

An experimental rig using laser anemometry techniques {{was employed to}} create a database of particle restitution ratios {{for a range of}} materials. This data was unique in that the particle rebound was measured in a quiescent condition where the aerodynamic effects had been minimised, and also parametric factors not previously available were included. These values were incorporated into the existing Particle Trajectory Code developed by Cranfield University and Rolls Royce PLC. The code is used to calculate the trajectories of discrete particles in three dimensional gas turbine geometries, and the ensuing erosion. It was modified to include the effects of the periodic boundary conditions, particle fragmentation, splitter blades, and variations in inlet dust concentration profile. Flowfield calculations were performed on a Rolls Royce GEM- 2 and splittered GEM- 60 impeller, which both represent the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> of the axial + centrifugal compression system of GEM engines.

Simulated erosion data under the same conditions was checked using practical results obtained in a Rolls Royce PLC Helicopter Engine Environmental Protection Programme, and good agreement was achieved. In order to provide a qualitative, experimental assessment of erosion, a GEM- 60 impeller was coated with four layers of paint of different colours.
