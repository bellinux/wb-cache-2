25|$|The Japanese comic or manga Aku no Hana, by Shūzō Oshimi, is {{inspired}} by Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. The anime was aired in 2013 and drew attention due to its heavy use of rotoscope animation.

25|$|Ōe's {{next phase}} {{moved away from}} sexual content, {{shifting}} this time toward the violent fringes of society. The works which he published between 1961 and 1964 are influenced by existentialism and picaresque literature, populated with more or less criminal rogues and anti-heroes whose position {{on the fringes of}} society allows them to make pointed criticisms of it. Ōe's admission that Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is his <b>favorite</b> <b>book</b> can be said to find a context in this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of A Confederacy of Dunces reflects the {{structure of}} Ignatius's <b>favorite</b> <b>book,</b> Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. Like Boethius' book, A Confederacy of Dunces is divided into chapters that are further divided into a varying number of subchapters. Key parts of some chapters are outside of the main narrative. In Consolation, sections of narrative prose alternate with metrical verse. In Confederacy, such narrative interludes vary more widely in form and include light verse, journal entries by Ignatius, and also letters between himself and Myrna. A copy of the Consolation of Philosophy within the narrative itself also becomes an explicit plot device in several ways.|$|E

500|$|When You Reach Me was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article about a man suffering from amnesia, and by parts of her childhood and her <b>favorite</b> <b>book,</b> A Wrinkle in Time.

Lee declared that [...] "there is no greater honor the novel could receive". By 2004, the novel had been chosen by 25communities for variations of the citywide reading program, more than any other novel. David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts, who supervised The Big Read, states [...] "people just seem to connect with it. It dredges up things in their own lives, their interactions across racial lines, legal encounters, and childhood. It's just this skeleton key to so many different parts of people's lives, and they cherish it." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the story, {{the main}} {{character}} Miranda is often reading Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, Stead's <b>favorite</b> <b>book</b> as a child; she read and reread it multiple times. She recalls that L'Engle was the only author she met in her childhood. Stead described the novel as a talisman for Miranda; she included {{it in the first}} draft and planned to remove it, [...] "because you can't just toss A Wrinkle in Time in there casually". Her editor suggested leaving it in if it could be better tied into the story. Stead was aware that she did not want A Wrinkle in Time to have too big an influence on When You Reach Me. Keeping this in mind, she reread A Wrinkle in Time through the perspective of different characters, which enabled her to develop new connections and ideas in her own work.|$|E
