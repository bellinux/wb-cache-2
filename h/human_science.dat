500|$|Ecology {{is as much}} a {{biological}} science as it is a <b>human</b> <b>science.</b> Human ecology is an interdisciplinary investigation into the ecology of our species. [...] "Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three." [...] The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.|$|E

We focus on how we communicate as ethical and lyrical subjects in the <b>human</b> <b>sciences</b> while observing scientific protocols. The key question that dominates the current work is: how can poetics and truth, seen as a primary part of our verbal experience of the world, come to capture the problem of self-understanding and concept formation in the <b>human</b> <b>sciences...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Dilthey's ideas {{should be}} {{examined}} {{in terms of his}} similarities and differences with Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert, members of the Baden School of Neo-Kantianism. Dilthey was not a Neo-Kantian, but had a profound knowledge of Immanuel Kant's philosophy, which deeply influenced his thinking. But whereas Neo-Kantianism was primarily interested in epistemology on the basis of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, Dilthey took Kant's Critique of Judgment as his point of departure. An important debate between Dilthey and the Neo-Kantians concerned the [...] "human" [...] as opposed to [...] "cultural" [...] sciences, with the Neo-Kantians arguing for the exclusion of psychology from the cultural sciences and Dilthey for its inclusion as a <b>human</b> <b>science.</b>|$|E

And like de Camp's other popular Krishna novels, it's a wry and wacky story of a human forced to contend with the semicivilized and semihuman cultures of an alien world where Murphy's law always holds good, and nothing ever goes according to plan. You could call it sword-and-sorcery, since swords are buckled with a touch of swash, and <b>human</b> <b>science</b> is a sort of magic to the too-human but egg-laying Krishnans. But the adventure is always cock-eyed." [...] He concludes that [...] "f you've read and enjoyed the other stories of Krishna, you'll want this one. If you haven't read any, this is a good one to start with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even casual {{conversation}} with the computer's operators, or with a human guard, could allow such a superintelligent AI to deploy psychological tricks, ranging from befriending to blackmail, to convince a human gatekeeper, truthfully or deceitfully, that it's in the gatekeeper's interest to agree to allow the AI greater access to the outside world. The AI might offer a gatekeeper a recipe for perfect health, immortality, or whatever the gatekeeper is believed to most desire; {{on the other side}} of the coin, the AI could threaten that it will do horrific things to the gatekeeper and his family once it [...] "inevitably" [...] escapes. One strategy to attempt to box the AI would be to allow the AI to respond to narrow multiple-choice questions whose answers would benefit <b>human</b> <b>science</b> or medicine, but otherwise bar all other communication with or observation of the AI. A more lenient [...] "informational containment" [...] strategy would restrict the AI to a low-bandwidth text-only interface, which would at least prevent emotive imagery or some kind of hypothetical [...] "hypnotic pattern". Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers. For example, the AI could choose to creatively malfunction in a way that increases the probability that its operators will become lulled into a false sense of security and choose to reboot and then de-isolate the system.|$|E
