5000|$|Even though {{computers}} can now display {{a wide variety}} of fonts, the majority of IDEs and software text editors employ a monospaced font as the default typeface. This increases the readability of source code, which is often heavily reliant on distinctions involving individual symbols, and makes differences between letters more unambiguous in situations like password <b>entry</b> <b>boxes</b> where typing mistakes are unacceptable. [...] Monospaced fonts are also used in terminal emulation and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents.

Methods used to eradicateinvasive rodents, like house mice, at high population densities may not be appropriate forintercepting them at lower densities. A better understanding of the immediate behavior ofhouse mice when first introduced to a novel environment would help managers developeffective biosecurity techniques to protect against new invasions. To address this problem,we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment that simulated an invasion by wild housemice into a novel environment. We quantified and compared the immediate behaviors ofwild house mice (n = 40) by testing various odors and other attractants, including odors(e. g., foods and conspecific), shelter, water, and a control. There was a significant differencein mouse responses to these treatments (P ≤ 0. 0001). We found that the most commonimmediate reaction of invading mice was to seek shelter in a den box (u = 47. 7 <b>box</b> <b>entries)</b> rather than responding to the other potential attractants presented. Secondarily, the micewere interested in some food scents, particularly bacon grease (u = 18. 3 <b>box</b> <b>entries),</b> peanutbutter (u = 17. 0 <b>box</b> <b>entries),</b> and cheese (u = 14. 5 <b>box</b> <b>entries).</b> The sex of the mouse didnot influence their responses to odors and attractants (P ≥ 0. 243), however, we noted thatfemales visited male feces and urine odors (u = 17 visits) more than males visited femalefeces and urine odors (u = 11 visits). Fewest visits were to the empty box (u = 8. 0 <b>box</b> <b>entries)</b> and the water box (u = 5. 1 <b>box</b> <b>entries)</b> Based on our findings, we surmise that a secure denbox which included certain food odors might entice and hold mice in a restricted area for ashort duration in a novel environment.

40|$|Abstract: WebTOP is a three-dimensional, {{interactive}} {{computer graphics}} system developed at Mississippi State University to help students learn about waves and optics. It {{has been used to}} help teach undergraduate introductory physics and upper-level optics classes. Currently, it is comprised of sixteen modules spanning eight different subject areas. The subject areas are waves, geometrical optics, reflection and refraction, polarization, interference, diffraction, lasers, and scattering. WebTOP simulations have the following characteristics. First, they are three dimensional, i. e., they have navigation controls that allow the user to rotate the scene, pan, or zoom, in order to view it from any desired orientation. Secondly, they are interactive. The user can change the parameters either by typing in the desired values into the appropriate text <b>entry</b> <b>box,</b> or by using the mouse cursor to move the appropriate widget in the scene. Thirdly, the simulations are animated, for those phenomena for which animation is appropriate. Furthermore, the simulations include VCR-type controls that allow the user to record his/her interactions with the simulation for later retrieval, viewing, and editing. Finally, these modules run inside a web browser. They can be run from our website...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Structure {{analysis}} of table form documents {{is an important}} issue because a printed document and even an electronic document do not provide logical structural information but merely geometrical layout and lexical information. To handle these documents automatically, logical structure information is necessary. In this paper, we first analyze the elements of the form documents from a communication point of view and retrieve the grammatical elements that appear in them. Then, we present a document structure grammar which governs the logical structure of the form documents. Finally, we propose a structure analysis system of the table form documents based on the grammar. By using grammar notation, we can easily modify and keep it consistent, as the rules are relatively simple. Another advantage of using grammar notation is that it can be used for generating documents only from logical structure. In our system, documents are assumed to be composed of a set of boxes and they are classified as seven box types. Then the box relations between the indication box and its associated <b>entry</b> <b>box</b> are analyzed based on the semantic and geometric knowledge defined in the document structure grammar. Experimental results have shown that the system successfully analyzed several kinds of table forms...|$|E
40|$|Passwords are {{a burden}} on the user, {{especially}} nowadays with {{an increasing number of}} accounts and a proliferation of different devices. Pico is a token-based login method that does not ask users to remember any secrets, nor require keyboard entry of one-time passwords. We wish to evaluate its claim of being simultaneously more usable and more secure than passwords, whilst testing its support for frictionless deployment to web-based services. Our main aim is to collect actionable intelligence on how to improve it. In our study, we teamed up with an Alexa Top 500 website, Gyazo, to offer this alternative login mechanism to users intent on performing a real task of image sharing. We focused on the ecological validity of the trial, and gained knowledge both through the challenges of the trial and the results generated. Users appreciated the ability to avoid password entry but the overall benefit was mitigated by the existing measures put in place by Gyazo to minimise the number of times users are presented with a password <b>entry</b> <b>box.</b> Our main finding is that providing enough benefit requires a solution that applies across sites, rather than focusing on authentication for a single site in isolation.

40|$|Since most {{accelerator}} control system circuit boards reside {{in a commercial}} bus architecture, such as CAMAC or VMEbus, a computerized test station is needed for exercising the boards. This test station is needed {{for the development of}} newly designed prototypes, for commissioning newly manufactured boards, for diagnosing boards which have failed in service, and for long term testing of boards with intermittent failure problems. WindoWorks was created to address these needs. It is a flexible program which runs on a PC compatible computer and uses a PC to bus crate interface. WindoWorks was designed to give the user a flexible way to test circuit boards. Each test is incapsulated into a window. By bringing up several different windows the user can run several different tests simultaneously. The windows are sizable, and moveable.

There {{is currently a}} lack of evidence regarding the self-reported concerns of SCT patients before and after SCT. Aim and design: This exploratory study performed a secondary analysis of self-reported, written concerns of SCT patients before and after transplant to determine patients&# 39; concerns. Methods: Content analysis of text <b>box</b> <b>entries</b> of SCT patients collected between 2005 and 2007 at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Text <b>box</b> <b>entries</b> were collected as part of symptom assessment using the Electronic Self-Report Assessment &ndash; Cancer instrument. The assessment was presented to 137 patients undergoing SCT at two time points: prior to ambulatory visits before any therapy had begun (T 1) and at the first visit after hospital discharge following SCT (T 2). Results: Text <b>box</b> <b>entries</b> were made before (n = 52) and after (n = 87) the transplant, resulting in 139 text <b>box</b> <b>entries</b> made by 137 patients representing 133 concerns. Using content analysis, the entries were categorized and ranked according to frequency. After symptom concerns, patients ranked work and financial issues the most frequent concerns prior to SCT. After SCT, symptoms remained the most frequently entered area of concern, followed by survival. Conclusion: Oncology providers need to assess SCT patients for work and financial concerns before and after transplant. Appropriate and timely referrals may ease the burden of these concerns for patients. Thus, assessment of financial and work concerns by the oncology team should {{be an integral part}} of quality health care for patients undergoing SCT.
