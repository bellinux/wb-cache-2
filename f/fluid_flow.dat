5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E

30|$|Due {{to their}} wide applications, the micropolar <b>fluid</b> <b>flows</b> have drawn much {{attention}} from mathematicians and physicists {{and have been}} well studied. For the theories on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the micropolar <b>fluid</b> <b>flows,</b> we refer to [3 – 9]. At the same time, the long-time behavior of solutions for the micropolar <b>fluid</b> <b>flows</b> has been investigated from various aspects. Chen et al. proved the existence of H^ 2 -compact global attractors in a bounded domain [10] and verified the existence of uniform attractors in nonsmooth domains [11]. Lukaszewicz [12] established the existence of H^ 1 -pullback attractor for nonautonomous micropolar <b>fluid</b> <b>flows</b> in a bounded domain. As for the long-time behavior of solutions for the micropolar <b>fluid</b> <b>flows</b> on unbounded domains, Dong and Chen [13] discussed the existence and regularity of the global attractors. Later, they [14] obtained the L^ 2 time decay rate for global solutions of the 2 D micropolar equations via the Fourier splitting method. Chen and Price [15] obtained the L^ 2 time decay rate for small solutions of the 3 D micropolar equations via Kato’s method. Zhao et al. [16] showed {{the existence of an}} H^ 1 -uniform attractor and so on. For more theories about the micropolar <b>fluid</b> <b>flows,</b> we refer to [17 – 21].|$|R

25|$|Air {{resistance}} {{experiments were}} carried out by investigators throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

Equations for <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> with friction were developed by Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes. To simulate <b>fluid</b> <b>flow,</b> many experiments involved immersing objects in streams of water or simply dropping them {{off the top of}} a tall building.

25|$|With some exceptions, the {{knowledge}} of hypersonic aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow.</b> For example, while the behavior of hypersonic flow is understood, building a scramjet aircraft to fly at hypersonic speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful scramjet aircraft, the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics. Nevertheless, there are still important problems in basic aerodynamic theory, such as in predicting transition to turbulence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.|$|E
