40|$|To determine, by {{analysing}} all available clinical trial data, the clinical efficacy against placebo of an extract from {{the fruit of}} the American <b>dwarf</b> <b>palm</b> <b>tree,</b> Serenoa repens (Permixon(R), Pierre Fabre Medicament, Castres, France), as there is controversy about the use of phytotherapeutic agents in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). METHODS All clinical trial data published on Permixon, comprising 14 randomized clinical trials and three open-label trials, involving 4280 patients, were analysed. These trials were of different size (22 - 1100 patients) and duration (21 - 720 days). The peak urinary flow rate and nocturia were the two common endpoints. The statistical analysis was based on a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS Permixon was associated with a mean (SEM) reduction in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of 4. 78 (0. 41). The mean placebo effect on peak urinary flow rate was an increase of 1. 20 (0. 49) mL/s. The estimated effect of Permixon was a further increase of 1. 02 (0. 50) mL/s (P = 0. 042). Placebo was associated with a reduction in the mean number of nocturnal voids of 0. 63 (0. 14); there was a further reduction attributable to Permixon of 0. 38 (0. 07) (P < 0. 001). There was some heterogeneity among the studies for nocturia; one over 2 years involving 396 patients and showing no difference between placebo and Permixon had a large effect on the results. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis of all available published trials of Permixon for treating men with BPH showed a significant improvement in peak flow rate and reduction in nocturia above placebo, and a 5 -point reduction in the IPSS...|$|E

40|$|We are {{experiencing}} {{a revival of}} interest in phytotherapeutic agents, both in Europe and North America, especially {{as a consequence of}} patients’ dissatisfaction with the adverse effects of the medical alternatives. One of the most frequently prescribed and studied such agents is Serenoa repens extract, derived from the berry of the <b>dwarf</b> <b>palm</b> <b>tree.</b> We aimed to review the most important published data regarding this type of treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A review of the existing articles regarding the use of Serenoa repens extracts for benign prostatic hyperplasia was performed. The articles were analysed with regard to their relevance, scientific value {{and the size of the}} evaluated series. Multiple mechanisms of action have been attributed to this extract, including antiandrogenic action, an anti-inflammatory/anti-oedematous effect, prolactin signal modulation, and an antiproliferative effect exerted through the inhibition of growth factors. Regarding efficacy, European Association of Urology guidelines state that Serenoa repens extracts significantly reduce nocturia in comparison with placebo. However, the guideline committee is unable to make specific recommendations about phytotherapy of male lower urinary tract symptoms owing to the heterogeneity of the products and the methodological problems associated with meta-analyses. Most of the published trials regarding Serenoa repens phytotherapy demonstrate a significant improvement of urinary status and a favourable safety profile. Also, some authors have credited it with giving a significant improvement in erectile function and decreasing complications following transurethral resection of the prostate, especially bleeding. The results of phytotherapy with Serenoa repens extracts are very promising. More high-quality, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are required in order to demonstrate without doubt the true therapeutic value of these products. Particular attention must be focused on differentiating between registered preparations, which are regulated as drugs, and those considered to be food supplements...|$|E

40|$|The {{biological}} invasions represent today {{a serious}} ecological problem, {{and is one}} of the main threats to biodiversity, in Italy as in the rest of the world. In the last century several species of <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> have been introduced in gardens, parks and lanes of great part of Italy, where climate allows their life and growth. Among the others Phoenix canariensis, P. dactylifera, Washingtonia robusta, W. filifera, Jubaea spectabilis and Trachycarpus fortunei. All of these species are exotic, as the only indigenous palm in Italy is the <b>dwarf</b> fan <b>palm</b> (Chamaerops humilis), which occurs along the tirrenian coast from Sicily to Liguria, in Sardinia and most of the smaller islands. <b>Palm</b> <b>trees</b> have become by now part of the Italian landscape, as do pine tree in Rome or cypress in Tuscany. Recently, two different species of exotic insects where recorded for the first time in Italy: the south American moth Paysandisia archon and the chinese beetle Rhynchophorus ferrugineus. Both of them lay their eggs on <b>palm</b> <b>trees,</b> and their larvae feed into the stem and kill the palms. Both arrived in Italy and in other Mediterranean countries as larvae or eggs hidden into the plants imported from the native regions. These insects are rapidly spreading through Italy, following palm plantations, and destroying palms from north to south, with a huge economic damage. Furthermore, they are locally changing probably for ever the Italian landscape. More recently, there is evidence of infestation on <b>dwarf</b> fan <b>palm</b> by both the moth and the beetle.

Haar-based rectangular windows or {{also known as}} Haar-like rectangular features have been popular in face recognition as used in Viola-Jones object detection framework. Similar to face recognition, the oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> recognition would also need a suitable Haar-based rectangular windows that best suit to the characteristics of oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree.</b> A set of seven Haar-based rectangular windows {{have been designed to}} better match specifically the young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> as the crown size is much smaller compared to the matured ones.

40|$|Oil <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> are {{important}} economic crops in Malaysia and other tropical areas. The number of oil <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> in a plantation area is important information for predicting the yield of palm oil, monitoring the growing situation of <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> and maximizing their productivity, etc. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework for oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> detection and counting using high-resolution remote sensing images for Malaysia. Unlike previous <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> detection studies, {{the trees in}} our study area are more crowded and their crowns often overlap. We use a number of manually interpreted samples to train and optimize the convolutional neural network (CNN), and predict labels for all the samples in an image dataset collected through the sliding window technique. Then, we merge the predicted palm coordinates corresponding to the same <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> into one <b>palm</b> coordinate and obtain the final <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> detection results.

40|$|Oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> is an {{important}} cash crop in Thailand. To maximize the productivity from planting, oil palm plantation managers {{need to know the}} number of oil <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> in the plantation area. In order to obtain this information, an approach for <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> detection using high resolution satellite images is proposed. This approach makes it possible to count the number of oil <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> in a plantation. The process begins with the selection of the vegetation index having the highest discriminating power between oil <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> and background. The index having highest discriminating power is then used as the primary feature for <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> detection. We hypothesize that oil <b>palm</b> <b>trees</b> are located at the local peak within the oil palm area. To enhance the separability between oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> crowns and background, the rank transformation is applied to the index image. The local peak on the enhanced index image is then detected by using the non-maximal suppression algorithm. Since both rank transformation and non-maximal suppression are window based, semi-variogram analysis is used to determine the appropriate window size. The performance of the proposed method was tested on high resolution satellite images. In general, our approach uses produced very accurate results, e. g., about 90 percent detection rate when compared with manual labeling...|$|R
