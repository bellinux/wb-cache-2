500|$|Peggy's {{breast cancer}} storyline was devised at the {{suggestion}} of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea [...] "that had been knocking about for a long time." [...] In Lesley Henderson's book, Social Issues in Television Fiction, an EastEnders researcher explains that: [...] "A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with. The programme sought expert advice on [...] "storyline visuals" [...] {{from a variety of sources}} including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals. There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: [...] "EastEnders is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> to make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... Greenstreet {{chatters}} {{about the}} falcon {{while waiting for}} a drugged drink to knock out Bogart. Huston's strategy is crafty. Earlier, Greenstreet has set it up by making a point: [...] "I distrust a man who says 'when.' If he's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to drink too much, it's because he's {{not to be trusted}} when he does." [...] Now he offers Bogart a drink, but Bogart doesn't sip from it. Greenstreet talks on, and tops up Bogart's glass. He still doesn't drink. Greenstreet watches him narrowly. They discuss the value of the missing black bird. Finally, Bogart drinks, and passes out. The timing is everything; Huston doesn't give us closeups of the glass to underline the possibility that it's drugged. He depends on the situation to generate the suspicion in our minds.|$|E

5000|$|Teacher and {{composer}} Robert Saxton: [...] "I actually {{think some of}} Britten's late compositions are masterpieces. I heard the String Quartet No. 3 played at Tanglewood when I was teaching there in 1986, {{and it was a}} moving experience to witness a tough American modern music audience, nine hundred or a thousand of them, stunned into silence at the end, before they felt able to applaud.

6000|$|What {{affected}} Westover {{first of}} all at the seance, and perhaps most of all, was {{the quality of the}} air in the little house; it was close and stuffy, mixed with an odor of mould and an ancient smell of rats. The kerosene-lamp set in the centre of the table, where Jackson afterward placed his planchette, devoured the little life that was left in it. At the gasps which Westover gave, with some despairing glances at the closed windows, Whitwell said: [...] "Hot? Well, I guess it is a little. But, you see, Jackson has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> about the night air; but I guess I can fix it for you." [...] He went out into the ell, and Westover heard him raising a window. He came back and asked, [...] "That do? It 'll get around in here directly," [...] and Westover had to profess relief.|$|E

5000|$|GameSpot {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 6.1 out of 10, saying: [...] "Play in Virtual Chess <b>is</b> plain hard <b>to</b> see. The pieces <b>are</b> {{difficult}} <b>to</b> tell apart from any angle, so you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extra <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> avoid stupid mistakes. To this end, plan on {{spending a lot of}} time rotating the board, which turns a full 360 degrees horizontally or vertically. ... Thankfully, a 2D version is also included, but that removes the whole point of the game: the fight animations. The game would be better off without them anyway. Had they occurred on the regular playing screen, that would have been one thing. Such is not the case. ... Unless the fighting actually occurs fully rendered using the same engine as the rest of the game, rather than as an annoyingly distracting cutscene, the novelty will always fade fast. Masters and novices alike will probably quickly strip Virtual Chess down to its clearer, more practical 2D mode after a minimum of laughs are achieved from the fights. Even in this mode, the game provides a great tool for fans of the 'real thing' of any skill level." ...|$|R

That was not helpful. But I nonetheless had to testify before Congress. On questions that <b>were</b> too market-sensitive <b>to</b> answer, “no comment” was indeed an answer.

Then, instead of just stopping, I would continue on resolving the sentence in some obscure way which made it incomprehensible. But nobody was quite sure I wasn’t saying something profound when I wasn’t. And that became the so-called Fed-speak which I became an expert on over the years.

Several teams expressed concern over the state of the country as early as the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix, while the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights urged the teams to boycott the race amid renewed political disturbances in the country, claiming that the Bahrain government <b>was</b> attempting <b>to</b> use the race to present the country as being stable. Bernie Ecclestone maintained his stance on the race going ahead, while [...] World Champion Damon Hill stated his belief that Formula One could return to Bahrain [...] "with a clear conscience" [...] after visiting the country. However, Hill changed his stance just two weeks later, stating that the race could [...] "create more problems than it solved". He elaborated further, cautioning against [...] "indifference" [...] and urging the sport not to take political sides. Fellow former World Champion Jackie Stewart expressed his support for the race taking place, warning that cancelling the Grand Prix could be even more damaging to the sport than holding it. [...] "The FIA, like many in the diplomatic community in the kingdom, the main political opposition ...believes the staging of a Grand Prix would be beneficial in bridging some of the difficulties Bahrain is experiencing. The FIA is {{not in a position to}} influence political matters in a sovereign country such as Bahrain and we can only wish for a long-term peaceful solution."

That is not what this sport should be about." [...] Former World Champion Damon Hill, voicing concerns over the race going ahead as planned. [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>careful</b> because if you <b>were</b> <b>to</b> say the Bahrain Grand Prix should not take place, then will there be pressure on Russia, for example, for the Winter Olympics when they come round in 2014?

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to prior John Ford westerns, such as The Searchers and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Liberty Valance {{was shot in}} black and white on Paramount's sound stages. Multiple stories and speculations exist to explain this decision. Ford claimed to prefer the black and white medium over color: [...] "In black and white, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>careful.</b> You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know your job, lay your shadows in properly, get your perspective right, but in color, there it is," [...] he said. [...] "You might say I'm old fashioned, but black and white is real photography." [...] Ford also reportedly argued that the climactic shoot-out between Valance and Stoddard would not have worked in color. [...] Others have interpreted the absence of the magnificent outdoor vistas so prevalent in earlier Ford westerns as [...] "a fundamental reimagining Ford of his mythic West" [...] - a grittier, less romantic, more realistic portrayal of frontier life. [...] A more pragmatic interpretation cites the fact that Wayne and Stewart - two of Hollywood's biggest stars, working {{together for the first time}} - were considerably older (54 and 53, respectively) than the characters they were playing. Filming {{in black and white}} helped ease the suspension of disbelief necessary to accept that disparity. [...] According to cinematographer William H. Clothier, however, [...] "There was one reason and one reason only ... Paramount was cutting costs. Otherwise we would have been in Monument Valley or Brackettville and we would have had color stock. Ford had to accept those terms or not make the film." ...|$|R
