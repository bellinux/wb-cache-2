5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> the ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E

5|$|All {{variations}} of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if God exists.|$|E
5|$|However, the Ottomans forced John Sigismund {{to declare}} the treaty null and void on 21 April. John Sigismund and Hasan, Pasha of Temesvár, joined forces and recaptured Erdőd (now Ardud in Romania), Nagybánya and Szatmár.

5|$|On 19 December 2010, the 35th day {{following}} the fire, authorities {{were reported to}} be detaining mourners who were visiting the site.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Neptune in 1846 {{led to the}} discrediting of the Titius–Bode law {{in the eyes of}} scientists, because its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position.

5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
