40|$|Studies of the {{software}} <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> are {{a natural extension of}} scope from that of conventional software development methodologies meeting the requirement for engineering large-scale software development. A new approach for dealing with the difficulties of large-scale software development in software engineeering is to establish an appropriate software <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> system. This work researches into software <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> system modelling and analysis. The delivered aims of this thesis are to investigate empirical software <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> research and practices to solve current problems identified in software <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> system modelling, to integrate current process models into a well founded and unifying framework and to lay theoretical foundations for {{the software}} <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> as a formalised discipline...|$|R
40|$|Research and {{development}} {{work on the}} removal of specific fission products from aqueous wastes has been in progress at the Hanford Atomic Products operation for several years. Initially, the primary incentive lay in the safe and economic disposal of these wastes. Scavenging techniques were developed which permitted the precipitation of the long-lived and biologically hazardous fission products cesium and strontium and the subsequent discharge of the supernates to the soil. Recently, interest has increased in the recovery of specific fission products for use in industry. Accordingly, research {{and development}} efforts have been expanded to include the search for economic processes for the isolation of specific fission products from Hanford wastes. The processes and techniques thus far developed are logical outgrowths of the scavenging processes currently {{being used in the}} disposal of Hanford wastes. The Hanford Operations Office directed a letter of inquiry to the General Electric Company requesting an appraisal of the feasibility of isolating and packaging radiocesium from Hanford wastes. In accordance with this request, the Engineering Department conducted a brief survey to determine the <b>process,</b> <b>engineering,</b> and economic feasibility of recovering specific fission products from Hanford waste solutions.

40|$|Abstract—Today’s systems {{integration}} technologies enable {{the integration of}} (software+) engineering environments to support <b>engineering</b> <b>processes</b> across domain and tool boundaries. These <b>engineering</b> <b>processes</b> heavily rely on manual configuration of integration frameworks, resulting in costly, time-consuming, and error-prone human work. In this paper, we introduce an extended model-driven approach for the automated derivation of integration technology configurations for supporting <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> This allows both an efficient and effective derivation of initial configurations, as well as easy adaptations of existing configurations in case of changed <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> Based on a standard software <b>engineering</b> <b>process,</b> we show the feasibility of the proposed approach and discuss the advantages and limitations for software(+) engineering...|$|R

40|$|The feature {{oriented}} method {{with business}} component semantics (FORM/BCS) {{is an extension}} of the feature oriented reuse method (FORM) developed at Pohan University of Science and Technology in South Korea. It consists of two engineering processes: a horizontal <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> driven by the FORM domain <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> and a vertical <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> driven by the FORM application <b>engineering</b> <b>process.</b> This paper investigates the horizontal <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> - which consists of analyzing a product line and developing reusable architectures - and shows that this process can be systematized through a set of maps that describe how one can systematically and rigorously derive the fundamental business architectures of a product line from the feature model of that domain. The main result of the paper is therefore that the formalization of the assets of FORM/BCS enables a clear definition of how an activity of the horizontal <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> produces a target asset from an input one. This result opens the door {{for the development of a}} tool supporting the method...|$|R

Up to now, bottleneck management research has concentrated on manufacturing processes, while neglecting product design and <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> This research fills this gap through developing and testing of a new bottleneck management concept for product design and <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> The new concept is developed using a system theory modelling approach and comprises of four bottleneck management counter measures. Two propositions were developed to test the concept through an event-discrete simulation model. The simulation is grounded on empirical data from three design-driven companies and tests {{the impact of the}} four bottleneck management counter measures on {{the performance of}} product design and <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> The findings from the simulation confirm the applicability of the newly developed bottleneck concept to improve the performance of product design and <b>engineering</b> <b>processes.</b> In doing so, this research study expands bottleneck management for the first time from manufacturing to product design and <b>engineering</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Typical complex {{software}} and systems engineering projects involve {{a set of}} different engineering disciplines and therefore heavily rely on systems integration approaches. Service-oriented architecture and Enterprise Service Bus provide a valuable basis for systems integration; however often depend on tedious manual work or invasive and therefore inflexible adaptations in case of even minimal changes to <b>engineering</b> <b>processes</b> or <b>engineering</b> tools. In this paper we describe the Engineering Service Bus (EngSB), an integration platform which not only integrates tools and systems, but also provides a bridge between <b>engineering</b> <b>processes</b> and existing <b>engineering</b> tools. We evaluate the EngSB by implementing a standard software <b>engineering</b> <b>process</b> for multi-engineering environments.
