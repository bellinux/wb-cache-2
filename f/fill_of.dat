5|$|Stela 74 is a {{fragment}} of Olmec-style sculpture that {{was found in the}} Middle Preclassic <b>fill</b> <b>of</b> Structure 7, where it was placed when that structure replaced the Pink Structure. It bears a foliated maize design topped with a U-symbol within a cartouche and has other, smaller, U-symbols at its base. It is very similar to a design found on Monument 25/26 from La Venta.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick <b>fill</b> <b>of</b> the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E
5|$|Altar 19 {{was buried}} in the <b>fill</b> <b>of</b> the final version of Temple 33, {{immediately}} in front of the second version of the summit shrine. It was badly damaged and was broken into several pieces, and the majority of a sculpture depicting a seated person was chipped away. The three fragments were buried together in a way that paired the altar with the buried Stela 31; this may have maintained a relationship between the monuments that existed when they were originally on public display. The altar was crafted from limestone and is now in the site museum at Tikal. It has been dated to approximately AD 445.|$|E

5|$|Amenhotep I was {{succeeded by}} Thutmose I, {{apparently}} a senior military figure. It is unclear {{if there was}} any blood relationship between the two, although {{it has been suggested that}} Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep's elder brother Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I's name appears next to Amenhotep's on a divine barque found by archeologists in the <b>fill</b> <b>of</b> the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency.|$|E

Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls.

25|$|The Dead Sea {{is formed}} in a {{pull-apart}} basin {{due to the}} left-stepping offset between the Wadi Arabah and Jordan Valley segments. The part of the basin with a sedimentary <b>fill</b> <b>of</b> more than 2km is 150km long and 15–17km wide in its central part. In the north, the fill reaches its maximum thickness of about 10km. The sequence includes Miocene fluvial sandstones of the Hazeva Formation overlain by a sequence of Late Miocene to early Pliocene evaporites, mainly halite, the Sedom Formation, and a lacustrine to fluvial sequence of Pliocene to recent age.|$|E
25|$|The Ghab basin {{was formed}} in the Pliocene and is {{interpreted}} to be a pull-apart basin formed due to the overlap at the left-stepping offset between the Missyaf fault and the Hacıpaşa fault.

Based on the interpretation of seismic reflection data and a single well penetration (Ghab-1) the <b>fill</b> <b>of</b> the basin {{is thought to be}} entirely Pliocene to recent in age. There are two main depocentres in the basin at the northern and southern end, separated by an intrabasinal high.|$|E

500|$|Amenhotep began or {{continued}} {{a number}} of building projects at temple sites in Upper Egypt {{but most of the}} structures he built were later dismantled or obliterated by his successors. From written sources it is known that he commissioned the architect Ineni to expand the Temple of Karnak. Ineni's tomb biography indicates that he created a 20 cubit gate of limestone {{on the south side of}} Karnak. He constructed a sacred barque chapel of Amun out of alabaster and a copy of the White Chapel of Senusret III. Sculpted material from these structures has been recovered from the <b>fill</b> <b>of</b> Amenhotep III's third pylon allowing some of these structures to be rebuilt at Karnak. Amenhotep also built structures at Karnak for his Sed festival, a festival by which a pharaoh's strength and vigour was renewed after reigning 30 years, but it seems likely that he died before he could use them. [...] A temple was constructed in Nubia at Saï, and he built temple structures in Upper Egypt at Elephantine, Kom Ombo, Abydos, and the Temple of Nekhbet. [...] As far as is known Amenhotep did not build anything of significance in Lower Egypt, like his father.|$|E
500|$|Pyramid B3 is {{actually}} two pyramids built upon a single basal platform. Together they comprise {{the most important}} architectural unit in Group B. The northern pyramid of the pair is denominated B3a; the southern is B3b. The two pyramids each have five stepped levels and face west onto the plaza. Each pyramid was accessed by a single stairway flanked by wide balustrades; each had a small altar {{at the base of}} its stairway. Both stairways had nineteen steps and the pyramids stand [...] high. Low platforms on their summits indicate where the temple buildings once stood. The double form of the twin pyramids had its origin in the Valley of Mexico and indicates foreign influences at the city. A broken stela was excavated from within the <b>fill</b> <b>of</b> Pyramid B3a; it was a plain monument broken in two parts. The bottom section still stood, while the upper section was lying beside it. It is one of very few such monuments raised in the Maya highlands and such stelae are characteristic of the Classic Period (c. 250–900). It is possible that it stands where originally erected before the pyramid was built over it. A funerary urn was excavated from underneath the rear of Pyramid B3b.|$|E
