30|$|The {{conditioning}} {{model is}} the item response model multiplied by the population model (Adams & Wu [2007]; Embretson & Reise [2000]). Hence, the conditioning model captures information from the test <b>items</b> (<b>expressed</b> in the <b>item</b> response model) and background information (expressed in the population model). Hence, it offers the opportunity to specify a population distribution of persons consisting of several subpopulations. This is especially important if the population distribution is conditional on several demographic variables rather than being a simple (unconditional) normal distribution.|$|R
40|$|Multi-item {{rating scales}} are the {{accepted}} solution for achieving {{reliable and valid}} measures in the social sciences. Issues not fully resolved include the optimal number of response categories, choice of semantic rating versus Likert form, and the appropriateness of mixing positively and negatively <b>expressed</b> <b>items.</b> While there is considerable empirical research on these issues, it addresses the scaling of respondents and is yet to produce consensus as to the most appropriate practice. In marketing, multi-item scales are not only used to scale consumer respondents, {{they are used to}} scale marketing stimuli. This article examines these response format issues when the primary objective is to scale marketing stimuli rather than consumers using generalisability theory criteria for data quality. G-study website assessment data using different response formats are used to compare their effects on the observed variance components and G-coefficients for websites. Conclusions are drawn for the most appropriate response format to use in marketing studies that scale marketing stimuli...|$|R

To ensure that the meaning of the translation was equivalent to the source a debriefing process was performed individually. On an item-by-item basis each participant was asked to <b>express</b> the <b>item</b> {{in his or her own}} words which also provided interpretations for items that were problematic in translation. Emphasis was put on identification of any areas of concern in the instrument: There were no new items developed.|$|R

It discusses those terminologies and expressions that depict the cultural values of Batswana in {{the usage of}} English in Botswana. Two types of borrowed items are discussed: those depicting old traditional practices that cannot be translated into English (kgosi and mophato) and those reflecting recent socio-political experiences in Botswana including the HIV/AIDS threat (tebelopele and omang).

50|$|Most {{stores have}} self {{checkout}} {{and some have}} self scanning facilities. Self-checkout facilities are small checkout for <b>express</b> (15 <b>items</b> or less) purchases, where customers scan and bag their own groceries, with several self-checkouts monitored over by a single staff member for assistance and to clear any restricted transactions (e.g. alcohol). Self-scanning facilities (Shop n' Go) are where a pre-registered customer scans each item with a hand-held scanner as they put them in their trolley. This reduces waiting time at the checkout, with most customers only requiring {{to pay for the}} groceries, although random rescans do take place. All stores have conventional checkout operator scanning available.|$|R

30|$|The {{personal}} innovativeness {{scale has}} three items (Liu et al., 2010). We can define personal innovativeness as {{the level of}} willingness to accept new technology; hence it is conceptualized in terms of three <b>items</b> <b>expressing</b> individual levels of interest and intention towards informal learning with technology. For instance, “If I heard about a new digital technology for learning, I would look forward to experimenting with it in informal learning context”.|$|R
40|$|The {{assumption}} that “words express ideas” is first tested against a rank list of general vocabulary of American English. The lexical <b>items</b> <b>expressing</b> the top concepts established (Man, Time, Space) {{are found to}} closely correspond to top items in a similar rank list of Russian. This proves both the universality of the top concepts and {{the validity of the}} original assumption. The paper then proceeds to investigate how the concept of “sentimentality” is lexicalized. First, definitions from obviously relevant entries (containing the base sentimenta) in a collegiate dictionary of English are mined for keywords. T ese lead to other entries and their definitions which, in their turn, yield new keywords. This production of lexical <b>items</b> <b>expressing</b> the concept of "Sentimentality" is considerably expanded in the next step, when two large thesauri of English are Submitted to a similar process. Finally, the resulting lists are convincingly demonstrated to be rewarding devices in a (simulated) computer-supported search for the presence, direct and indirect, of the diffuse concept of “sentimentality” in such a vast and varied mine as the text of Encyclopaedia Britannica...|$|R

40|$|The MPEG- 21 Multimedia Framework aims {{to provide}} an {{end-to-end}} framework for transparent and universal access to media content. It defines mechanisms to represent, process and exchange aggregate media objects, called Digital Items. One of the main requirements in MPEG- 21 is to devise a mechanism for making Digital Items dynamic, by allowing program code to be packaged along with them. This executable code consists of operations {{that are used to}} process the Digital Item. The design of this mechanism is categorized into three parts: a specification to express and package these processing operations, an engine on the platform to execute the processing operations, and base APIs on the platform that will assist in implementing these processing operations. This thesis proposes a solution that uses Java for <b>expressing</b> Digital <b>Item</b> processing operations. Also as a part of this solution, it proposes adapting the MPEG-J specification to define an engine for the execution of the the Java based processing operations.

40|$|The cascade {{model is}} a rule {{induction}} methodology that uses level-wise expansion of a lattice. An attribute-value pair is <b>expressed</b> as an <b>item,</b> and every node in the lattice is specified by an itemset and by its supporting instances. If {{the distribution of the}} class attribute values shows a large change along a link in the lattice, the link is represented as a rule "IF item-along-link added on itemset-on-upper-node, THEN class-I". The strength of a rule is measured by its between-group sum of squares (BSS). Factors affecting diagnosis, the results of cultures, and prognosis are examined in a meningoencephalitis data set. Strong rules are expected to lead to new knowledge of the disease. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{introduced}} diploma thesis I {{worked with}} the collection of 200 written advertisements (Czech and English) and 200 TV commercials (Czech and English). The main task of the thesis was to describe the major features of Czech and English advertisements from the syntactic point of view, compare them and support by proper examples. The thesis also includes statistic data based on the analysis of individual items in the collected material. The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first one deals with the general features of advertisement, its position within the Czech stylistics, its forms and the possibilities that each form provides. The next chapter focuses on {{the analysis of the}} syntactic structure itself and examines the different ways of <b>expressing</b> the <b>items</b> being compared. The third chapter describes the advertisements in the context of pragmatics. Utterances used in advertisements are analyzed by exploring the theory of speech acts, theory of cooperative principle and maxims of politeness. The chapter also examines the different ways of addressing a receiver and his/her position in the discourse of advertising. The last chapter includes all findings and conclusions.

40|$|The abundance, {{nature and}} {{possible}} sources of litter on 32 beaches on the Balearic Islands (Mediterranean Sea) were investigated in 2005. Mean summer abundances in the Balearics reached approximately 36 items m- 1, with a corresponding weight of 32 ± 25 g m- 1, which {{is comparable to}} the results of other studies in the Mediterranean. Multivariate analyses (principal component analysis and redundancy analysis) confirmed strong similarities between islands and a statistically significant seasonal evolution of litter composition and abundance. In summer (the high tourist season), debris contamination <b>expressed</b> as <b>item</b> abundance was double that in the low season and showed a heterogeneous nature associated with beach use. Cigarette butts were the most abundant item, accounting for up to 46 % of the objects observed in the high tourist season. In contrast, plastics related to personal hygiene/medical items were predominant in wintertime (67 %) and natural wood was the most important debris by weight (75 %). In both seasons, litter characteristics suggested a strong relationship with local land-based origins. While beach users were the main source of summer debris, low tourist season litter was primarily attributed to drainage and outfall systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new way of {{analyzing}} a special kind of item, called Free Choice Items (FCIs). As the name reveals, these <b>items</b> <b>express</b> freedom of choice and are therefore grammatical in contexts which express variation among alternatives, such as in imperatives: pick any card (Vendler 1967). Untill now, attention has been mostly given to the licensing conditions of these items and scholars have claimed that FCIs are grammatical in all contexts that presuppose alternatives. In this paper, based on novel English and Greek data, I argue that focus should also be given {{to the nature of the}} alternatives that FCIs denote. I pursue the hypothesis that FCIs are divided into two subclasses: FCIs that denote epistemic alternatives and FCIs that denote metaphysical alternatives...|$|R

40|$|Rationale. The {{existing}} personality inventories {{are exploring}} too general psychological features {{so that the}} possible psychology/disease associations might be leveled out. Objective. We attempt to build a tool to explore the possible correlation between certain psychological features and the most common internal disorders. Method. We have used two questionnaires containing many pairs of synonymous items (necessary for assessing {{the consistency of the}} answers). The items are divided into four main domains: preoccupation for the basal conditions of existence (health / disease / death, fear, money, lodging); interaction with other people; action, will / volition, self-assertion; and preoccupation with the exterior. In this first article we are presenting the correlations between items of the first domain, based on the answers from our first 3138 respondents. Results and discussions. The concern about health is best reflected by general formulations. The desire for security is best <b>expressed</b> by <b>items</b> combining the worry about money and dwelling, and worst by items reflecting the eagerness to gain, keep or judiciously spend money. Among the various fears, those of future, darkness, and loneliness are better indicators of security concern.

Precaution and inclination for order are the best indicators for the aspiration to stability. Poorer ones are the desire for cleanliness and the tendenc...|$|R
5000|$|Semantic {{representations}} (SemR) in meaning-text theory consist {{primarily of}} a web-like semantic structure (SemS) which combines with other semantic-level structures (most notably the Semantic-Communicative Structure SemCommS, [...] which represents what is {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "Information Structure" [...] in other frameworks). The SemS itself consists of a network of predications, represented as nodes with arrows running from predicate nodes to argument node(s). Arguments can be shared by multiple predicates, and predicates can themselves be arguments of other predicates. Nodes generally correspond to lexical and grammatical meanings as these are directly <b>expressed</b> by <b>items</b> in the lexicon or by inflectional means, but the theory allows the option of decomposing meanings into more fine-grained representation via processes of semantic paraphrasing, [...] which are also key to dealing with synonymy and translation-equivalencies between languages. SemRs are mapped onto the next level of representation, the Deep-Syntactic Representation, by the rules of the Semantic Component, which allow for a one to many relationship between levels (that is, one SemR can potentially be expressed by a variety of syntactic structures, depending on lexical choice, the complexity of the SemR, etc.).The structural description and the (semi-) automatic generation of SemR are subject to research. Here the decomposition takes advantage of the Semantic Primes of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage to determine a termination criterion of the decomposition.|$|R
