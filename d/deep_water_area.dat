30|$|During the LST, {{the lake}} level sank below the first-order step-fault belt, and the second-order slope break {{restricted}} the depositional {{boundary of the}} lake. The region landward of the second-order slope break was exposed, which led to denuding of the underlying strata but supplied the second-order step-fault belt with sediments. The LST fan delta was deposited adjacent to the second-order slope break and a basin floor fan formed in {{the central part of}} the lake. Subsequently, the lake level rose to the first-order step-fault belt during the EST and the facies belts receded. The first-order slope break defined the border of the basin while the second-order slope break defined the <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> <b>area</b> of the lake, which respectively controlled the distribution of the EST fan delta and the deep lacustrine mudstone. During the HST, the sediment supply rate gradually increased and exceeded the rate of accommodation space formation. The accommodation space near the first-order step-fault belt was soon filled. Then the sediments went over the second-order slope break and prograded toward the central basin, forming the progradational HST fan delta and frontal slip turbidite fans.|$|E
30|$|The above discussions {{showed that}} the magma {{volatiles}} exsolution, magma−water interaction and quenching {{are related to the}} water depth of the eruptive vent. If the eruptive vent is deep, the huge hydrostatic pressure will suppress volatiles exsolution and explosive eruption. Research on the critical pressure or depth of inhibiting explosive eruption has long been a focus. The water depth of most explosive eruptions was less than 200  m, which is illustrated by case studies (i.e., Cas et al. 2001). The theoretical calculation shows that the critical depth for the exsolution of the CO 2 -dominated component of magmatic volatiles, is approximately 700  m, and its corresponding critical pressure is 7.38 Mpa (Head and Wilson 2003), which is basically consistent with the early estimation that the water depth of an explosive eruption is less than 500 – 1000 m (Mcbirney 1963). In other words, the exsolution of magmatic volatiles will not result in explosive eruption in <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> <b>area</b> below 700  m. However, this has been disproved by recent observations. Some experiments and theoretical investigations even demonstrate that explosive eruptions can possibly occur under 4000  m (Wohletz 2003), because of the correlated magma−water interactions which could generate a mass of vapor and provide energy for volcanic explosion (Head and Wilson 2003).|$|E

The experiments brought together underwater acousticians, geophysicists and oceanographers with the aim to collect comprehensive acoustic and environmental ground-truth data. Environmental-adaptive signal processing was first demonstrated in a <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> <b>area</b> (WESTSARDINIA' 89 & 90). From ducted propagation measurements, a model-based matched filter (MBMF) receiver that fully incorporates the physics of wave propagation determined a source range, depth and Doppler. For environmental inversion the broadband extension of matched-field processing was investigated in a shallow water area south of Elba island (YELLOWSHARK' 94 & 95). Geoacoustic properties of the sea bottom were determined by finding the best fit between predicted and observed sound fields at multiple frequencies using genetic search algorithms. The same inversion results were obtained by MBMF processing of broadband linearly-frequency-modulated signals enabling {{the use of an}} array of a few hydrophones instead of a dense and large vertical array. This motivated the development of drifting acoustic buoys which were tested successfully over the southern continental shelf off Marettimo island, Sicily (ENVERSE' 97 & 98).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the shallows of water reservoirs, which are located between the shore line and the <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> <b>area.</b> The intermediate location of these shallows is the reason that their formation, especially at large amplitude of water level oscillations, is a very complex process. At the same time the role of these shallows is subject to considerable discussion in the relevant literature. Comprehensive investigations of water quality at present include not only the technological aspects of pollution control (waste treatment, water purification, etc.) but also the relevant ecological problems which in turn are closely related to social problems and to the conditions of human life. This paper describes the role of reservoir shallows, taking into consideration the entire spectrum of the above mentioned aspects. Special stress is given to the filtering role of shallows; they act as natural filters protecting water in the reservoir against the nonpoint source pollutants of agricultural origin which are difficult to control. The degree to which the reservoir shallows can act as the "natural filters" depends on their structure, which in turn depends on the regime of water level oscillations in the reservoir. This dependence makes possible the control of natural processes which occur in the ecosystem of the reservoir's shallows by the appropriate control of the reservoir water levels...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{retrieving}} {{significant wave}} height from X-band marine radar images based on shadow statistics is investigated, since the retrieving accuracy {{can not be}} seriously affected by environmental factors and the method {{has the advantage of}} without any external reference to calibrate. However, the accuracy of the significant wave height estimated from the radar image acquired at the near-shore area is not ideal. To solve this problem, the effect of water depth is considered in the theoretical derivation of estimated wave height based on the sea surface slope. And then, an improved retrieving algorithm which is suitable for both in <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> <b>area</b> and shallow water area is developed. In addition, the radar data are sparsely processed in advance in order to achieve high quality edge image for the requirement of shadow statistic algorithm, since the high resolution radar images will lead to angle-blurred for the image edge detection and time-consuming in the estimation of sea surface slope. The data acquired from Pingtan Test Base in Fujian Province were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved method which takes into account the water depth is more efficient and effective and has better performance for retrieving significant wave height in the shallow water area, compared to the in situ buoy data as the ground truth and that of the existing shadow statistic method...|$|E

The delta-C- 13 values of seagrass leaves ranged from - 7. 3 to - 16. 3 parts per thousand among different study sites, with a significantly lower mean value for seagrass leaves from those sites near mangrove forests (- 12. 8 +/- 1. 1 parts per thousand) than those far from mangrove forests (- 8. 3 +/- 0. 9 parts per thousand; P < 0. 05). Furthermore, seagrass leaves from a shallow water area had significantly lower delta-C- 13 values than those found in a <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> <b>area</b> (P < 0. 01). There was no significant variation in delta-C- 13 values between young and mature leaves (P = 0. 59) or between the tip and base of a leaf blade (P = 0. 46).

30|$|Based on a {{large amount}} of seismic, {{drilling}} and core data, the characteristics of the early-middle Miocene submarine fans in the Baiyun Sag, northern South China Sea are investigated. By analyzing the sedimentary processes of submarine fans in SQ 21 (SQ 21 refers to the 3 rd-order sequence with its bottom boundary 21 Ma), a sedimentary model of the sand-rich fans is established and the main factors controlling fan deposition are detailed. The results indicate that from early to middle Miocene the Pearl River Mouth Basin developed seven 3 rd-order sequences in all, with each lowstand systems tract (LST) of the sequence corresponding to submarine fans. However, only the fans in SQ 13.8 and SQ 21 are sand-rich fans, the others being mud-rich fans. The cores reveal that the submarine fans in the Pearl River Mouth Basin developed five lithofacies: (1) mud clast-bearing sandstone, interpreted as channel deposits; (2) typical turbidite sandstones, also interpreted as channel deposits; (3) thin-bedded sandstone and mudstone, interpreted as channel-levee complex deposits; (4) massive sandstones, interpreted as lobe deposits; (5) massive mudstone, interpreted as hemipelagic mud. The sand-rich submarine fans in the Pearl River Mouth Basin mainly developed in LST, and in LST reverse faults were active, which {{led to the formation of}} accommodation on the shelf. Different from the theory of classic sequence stratigraphy, the accommodation on the shelf captures terrigenous debris transported by the Pearl River, and the uplift at the edge of shelf serves as a “Linear Source” for the <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> <b>area</b> instead of the Pearl River. Therefore, the fans mainly derived from the eroded debris from the uplift. Factors controlling fan deposition include the basin’s tectonic framework, the evolution of the slope break, relative sea-level changes as well as the evolution of the fault system, and the fans are formed under the combination of the above factors.|$|E
