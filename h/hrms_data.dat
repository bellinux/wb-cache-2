The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to determine the validity of heart rate measurements obtained by a simple, lightweight, commercially available wrist-worn heart rate monitor (HRM) during work (cycle exercise) sessions conducted in the laboratory and also during the particularly challenging work environment of space flight. Three different comparisons were made. The first compared <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> to simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of varying heart rates that were generated by an ECG simulator. The second compared <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> to ECG recordings collected during work sessions of 14 subjects in the laboratory. Finally, ECG downlink and <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> were compared in four astronauts who performed cycle exercise during space flight. The data were analyzed using regression techniques. The results were that the HRM recorded virtually identical heart rates compared with ECG recordings for the data set generated by an ECG simulator. The regression equation for the relationship between ECG versus <b>HRM</b> heart rate <b>data</b> during work in the laboratory was: ECG HR = 0. 99 x (HRM) + 0. 82 (r 2 = 0. 99). Finally, the agreement between ECG downlink <b>data</b> and <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> during space flight was also very high, with the regression equation being: Downlink ECG HR = 1. 05 x (HRM) - 5. 71 (r 2 = 0. 99).

40|$|We {{developed}} a simple, rapid, high-throughput detection and genotyping method for noroviruses using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis {{to create a}} difference plot. The capsid gene was amplified by real-time RT-PCR {{in the presence of}} ResoLight HRM dye, a saturating DNA dye. Following optimization of the HRM assay conditions, the major norovirus genotypes were selected. Because we had only small quantities of the patient stool samples used in this study, we constructed plasmids for each genotype and used these to optimize the HRM assay. We selected six stool samples, each positive for one of the six dominant subtypes of noroviruses that have been circulating in Japan, namely, genotypes 4, 8, and 9 from genogroup 1 and genotypes 3, 4, and 10 from genogroup 2. The specific high-resolution derivate plot of the HRM assay for each plasmid was constructed by subtracting the melting-curve shape of the plasmid from the reference or base curve. The RNAs extracted from 14 clinical samples positive for small round structured viruses were then directly analyzed using the HRM assay. The <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> from the clinical RNA samples corresponded with the genotype results obtained by RT-PCR and sequencing of the clinical samples. In addition, the <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> from the clinical RNA samples corresponded with the <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> from the six reference plasmid DNAs, indicating that this assay is useful for the direct detection and genotyping of noroviruses in clinical samples. This assay requires no multiplexing or hybridization probes and provides a new approach to the genetic screening of noroviruses in clinical virology laboratories...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to examine in {{free-living}} individuals from a high-density city (1) the objectively determined physical activity levels across quartiles derived from pedometer step counts, (2) the pedometer steps day - 1 required to meet health-enhancing guidelines of accruing 30 min day - 1 of moderate physical activity and (3) the agreement between three objective criteria for the pedometer guidelines. Over 7 days 49 Hong Kong Chinese aged 15 - 55 years (n = 30 males) wore a polar heart rate monitor (HRM), an MTI and Tritrac accelerometer, plus a Yamax pedometer for ≥ 600 min day - 1. Participants averaged 9, 839 ± 3, 088 steps day - 1, whilst accumulating 44. 5 ± 22. 6, 43. 1 ± 21. 7, and 24. 7 ± 19. 3 min day - 1 of moderate physical activity by the Tritrac, MTI and HRM, respectively. Significant differences between quartiles of pedometer-determined activity were predominantly seen in the accelerometry data, especially during moderate and moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity (effect sizes > 1. 5 between upper and lower quartiles), but not seen in the <b>HRM</b> <b>data.</b> Using both criterion accelerometer datasets, a threshold of 8, 000 steps day - 1 accurately categorized ∼ 90 % of those achieving, and ∼ 80 % of those not achieving, 30 min day - 1 of appropriate activity.

Among analytical technologies, mass spectrometry plays {{a central role}} into {{the wide range of}} metabolomics applications as global metabolite profiling, absolute quantification and also metabolite structural elucidation. This chapter presents an overview of Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FT-MS) advantageous features for the large-scale measurements of metabolites. Principles of FT-MS devices are described with some details on the performance characteristics such as the highest available mass resolving power, mass measurement ability with sub-ppm errors, the most powerful dynamic range and various activation modes. Particularly, wefocused onto the usefulness of atmospheric pressure ionization sources coupled to FT analyzers for very high-throughput direct injection mass spectrometry approach. However, different analytical issues should be considered when employing Direct Injection High Resolution Mass Spectrometry approach, including matrix effects and metabolite identification complexity. The collection of large <b>HRMS</b> <b>data</b> sets constitutes only the preliminary step of the metabolomics workflow.

Although conventional manometry has been widely used to evaluate esophageal motor function, this is not fully satisfactory for explaining esophageal symptoms. High-resolution manometry (HRM) is designed to overcome the limitations of conventional manometric systems with advanced technologies. A solid-state HRM assembly with 36 solid-state sensors spaced at 1 cm intervals (Sierra Scientific Instruments Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA) has been widely used around the world. Calibration and post-study thermal correction should be performed at each test. The HRM assembly was passed transnasally and positioned to record from the hypopharynx to the stomach.

Detection of CNRMV and CGRMV was performed in a realtime PCR using a primer set {{for both of them}} or duplex real-time PCR that included one specific primer set for each virus. These two strategies allowed us to confirmed virus infection in all tested samples.

Next generation real-time PCR systems, along with improved saturating DNA-binding dyes, enable the direct acquisition of <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> after quantitative PCR. Melting behaviour is particularly influenced by the length, nucleotide sequence and GC content of the amplicons. This method is expanding rapidly in several research areas such as human genetics, reproductive biology, microbiology and ecology/conservation of wild populations. Here we have developed a successful HRM protocol for avian sex identification based on the amplification of sex-specific CHD 1 fragments. The melting curve patterns allowed efficient sexual differentiation of 111 samples analysed (plucked feathers, muscle tissues, blood and oral cavity epithelial cells) of 14 bird species. In addition, we sequenced the amplified regions of the CHD 1 gene and demonstrated the usefulness of this strategy for the genotype discrimination of various amplicons (CHD 1 Z and CHD 1 W), which have small size differences, ranging from 2 bp to 44 bp.

High resolution melt (HRM) analysis of PCR products can identify strain variation amongst genera of bacteria. The intergenic (16 S- 23 S rDNA) spacer region contains sequence regions conserved within genera and other sequence region variables between species within genera. We wished to investigate whether HRM analysis of PCR ribotyping products could identify ribotype 027 C difficile. Ribotyping was performed on 93 clinical isolates and five control strains and band patterns were analysed using GelCompar II (Applied Maths, USA). Real-time PCR using ribotyping primers was performed and normalised melt curves were generated. The <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> was then imported into ScreenClust software (QIAGEN) to generate principal component analysis graphs depicting clustered relationships of strains. Ribotyping produced clear PCR bands for 88 / 98 isolates tested.

While preliminary studies indicate that a bolus might be retained in this area, the clinical relevance of the LPZ remains unclear. AIM: To investigate a possible relationship between esophageal symptoms {{and the size of the}} esophageal LPZ. METHODS: We reviewed high-resolution manometry (<b>HRM)</b> <b>data</b> from patients with esophageal symptoms (dysphagia, chest pain, and heartburn/regurgitation) and asymptomatic volunteers. The proximal border of the LPZ was defined as the point where the amplitude of the proximal contraction wave declined below 30 mmHg, and the distal border as the point where the distal contraction wave first increased above 30 mmHg. RESULTS: The average (+/- standard error of mean [SEM]) length of the LPZ in 44 asymptomatic individuals was 5. 4 +/- 0. 6 cm and did not differ (P = 0. 222) from the LPZ in 64 patients with dysphagia (6. 8 +/- 0. 4 cm), 34 patients with chest pain (6. 4 0. 6 cm), and 42 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms (7. 0 +/- 0. 6 cm). These results did not change when the length of the LPZ was corrected for total esophageal length. The time width of the LPZ in asymptomatic individuals (1. 6 +/- 0. 2 s) was shorter than in patients with dysphagia and GERD symptoms (dysphagia 2. 4 +/- 0. 2 s, GERD symptoms 2. 8 +/- 0. 3 s).

The purpose of these studies was to assess the utility of distance methods developed for comparison of time series <b>data</b> to classify <b>HRM</b> curves as a means of fungal species identification. Dynamic time warping (DTW), first introduced in the context of speech recognition to identify temporal distortion of similar sounds, is an elastic distance measure that has been successfully applied {{to a wide range of}} time series <b>data.</b> Comparison of <b>HRM</b> curves of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region from 51 strains of 18 fungal species using DTW distances allowed accurate classification and clustering of all 51 strains.

The results revealed a number of prior misclassifications, discriminated species that are not resolved by routine phenotypic tests, and accurately identified all 243 test strains. In addition to DTW, several other distance functions, Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) and Shape-based Distance (SBD), showed promise.

Their structures were established based on 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and <b>HRMS</b> <b>data.</b> All prepared compounds were screened for their in vitro protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitory activities. The effects of {{modification of the}} linker, functional groups and substituted positions at the phenyl ring on PTK inhibitory activity were investigated. Twelve halophenols showed significant PTK inhibitory activity. Among them, compounds 6 c, 6 d, 7 d, 9 d, 10 d, 11 d and 13 d exhibited stronger activities than that of genistein, the positive reference compound. The results gave a relatively full and definite description of the structure–activity relationship and provided a foundation for further design and structure optimization of the halophenols...|$|E
40|$|Four new 8 -hydroxybriarane diterpenoids, frajunolides P–S (1 – 4), {{together}} with umbraculolide A, juncenolide C, junceellonoid A and juncin R, were {{isolated from the}} acetone extract of the gorgonian Junceella fragilis, collected from the southeast coast of Taiwan. Compound 1 contains an unusual pivaloyloxy group at C- 2, while 3 is a rare compound having a chlorine atom on the olefinic carbon (C- 6). The structures of the isolated compounds were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1 D- and 2 D-NMR, as well as <b>HRMS</b> <b>data.</b> Compound 1 was further confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. In the anti-inflammatory test, compounds 1 and 2 exhibited moderate inhibition on superoxide anion generation and elastase release by human neutrophils in response to formylmethionylleucyl-phenylalanine/dihydrocytochalasin B (fMLP/CB) ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the factors affecting HRM subsidiary autonomy within multinational companies (MNCs). Drawing on institutional theory arguments, along with {{an analysis of the}} impact of international HRM structures, it attempts to identify the multiplicity of factors influencing subsidiary autonomy with regard to <b>HRM.</b> Using <b>data</b> gathered from a highly representative survey of foreign MNC subsidiaries located in Spain, the results identify a number of factors that hold explanatory power. First, the distance between the home and the host country in terms of variety of capitalism is crucial in explaining variations in subsidiary autonomy. In addition, international HR structures, such as the existence of an international policy-making body and the use of HR shared service centres or HR data reporting mechanisms, are also important in accounting for the degree of autonomy over HR issues experienced by the MNC subsidiaries in our study. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} a single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) based genotyping method for Klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high resolution melting (HRM) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. The approach is termed mini-MLST or Minim typing and it has previously been applied to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Six SNPs were derived from concatenated MLST sequences {{on the basis of}} maximisation of the Simpsons Index of Diversity (D). DNA fragments incorporating these SNPs and predicted to be suitable for HRM analysis were designed. Using the assumption that HRM alleles are defined by G+C content, Minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a D = 0. 979 against known STs. The method was tested against 202 K. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the MLST analyses were performed after the HRM analyses. The HRM-based alleles were indeed in accordance with G+C content, and the Minim typing identified known STs and flagged new STs. The tonB MLST locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two Minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. However these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. Therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonB gene (D = 0. 929), and the other using <b>HRM</b> <b>data</b> from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonB MLST fragment (D = 0. 995). The HRM assays were developed on the Rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the LightCycler 480, allowing a 384 -well high through-put format. The assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current MLST data. Minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit. Patiyan Andersson, Steven Y. C. Tong, Jan M. Bell, John D.
