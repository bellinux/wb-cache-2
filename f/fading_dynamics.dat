This paper investigates a MISO broadcast channel where some receivers experience longer coherence intervals (static receivers) and have CSIR, while some other receivers experience shorter coherence intervals (dynamic receivers) and do not enjoy free CSIR. We consider a variety of CSIT conditions for the above mentioned model, including no CSIT, delayed CSIT, or hybrid CSIT.

40|$|A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{version of}} the dirty paper channel is studied, where the channel input and the dirt {{experience}} the same fading process and the fading channel state is known at the receiver (CSIR). This represents settings where signal and interference sources are co-located, {{such as in the}} broadcast channel. First, a variant of Costa's dirty paper coding (DPC) is presented, whose achievable rates are within a constant gap to capacity for all signal and dirt powers. Additionally, a lattice coding and decoding scheme is proposed, whose decision regions are independent of the channel realizations. Under Rayleigh fading, the gap to capacity of the lattice coding scheme vanishes with the number of receive antennas, even at finite Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Thus, although the capacity of the fading dirty paper channel remains unknown, this work shows it is not far from its dirt-free counterpart. The insights from the dirty paper channel directly lead to transmission strategies for the two-user MIMO broadcast channel (BC), where the transmitter emits a superposition of desired and undesired (dirt) signals with respect to each receiver. The performance of the lattice coding scheme is analyzed under different <b>fading</b> <b>dynamics</b> for the two users, showing that high-dimensional lattices achieve rates close to capacity.

40|$|Abstract—In {{time-varying}} faded channels the transmissions {{are organized}} into frames where the channel estimation is mainly training-based. The optimal {{design of the}} training structure is for-mulated here by finding the training length (the optimal number of contiguous pilots) and the training interval (the interval among two successive training phases) to maximize system throughput. The optimal balance of training and payload depends on the com-bination of Doppler frequency and frame length. The level of the {{signal to noise ratio}} and the <b>fading</b> <b>dynamics</b> constrain the quality of the estimate from training. It is shown that the length of the training can be conveniently traded for lower training intervals to reduce the estimate out-dating. For fast-varying fading and for high enough signal to noise ratio, there is a definite advantage in fragmenting the frame with dispersed segments of training symbols of smaller length rather than having a highly reliable channel estimate by concentrating all the training symbols {{at the beginning of the}} frame. Extensive simulations corroborate the design criteria. System throughput is maximized either for noisy binary transmission and for Gaussian input symbol distribution (i. e., by using information theoretic analysis).

The capacity of MIMO systems with transmitter channel state information can be achieved via two schemes: a multiple coding scheme with temporal and spatial water filling and a single coding scheme with temporal and spatial water filling. The former requires an infinite number of different codes and the latter requires inter-block coding and therefore a very long code. We propose three different simple, but powerful, methods for transforming the MIMO fading channel into a set of additive white noise Gaussian channels, to which standard codes for the Gaussian channel can then be applied. We show through a number of examples that these methods can closely approach channel capacity. The code length of the proposed multiple-coding scheme can be much shorter since it can adapt its rate to fading conditions. Also the code length is determined solely by the length of codes chosen for the AWGN channel(s), not the <b>fading</b> <b>dynamics.</b> We study the applications of space-time block codes in DS-CDMA system. We propose subspace-based blind decoders for the downlink which can blindly suppress the multiple access interferences from other users and exploit the advantages provided by multiple antennas simultaneously. Our schemes can be used for quite a few existing space-time block codes because we borrow the structure of linear dispersion codes. We also propose non-coherent blind decoders for the downlink of DS-CDMA system equipped with multiple antennas. Our non-coherent blind decoders can suppress the multiple access interferences and exploit diversity gain without knowing the channel state information either at the base station or at the mobile station.

40|$|The C and Ku {{bands that}} have been the {{backbone}} of satellite telephony and data networks in the past are limited in the amount of bandwidth they provide. Consequently, some broadband Internet services have started to move into the Ka band in order to utilise the bandwidth at these higher frequencies. The use of higher frequencies led to fade mitigation design considerations that had not previously been necessary, as fixed power margins had been sufficient to guarantee high availability. This thesis reviews the majority of fade mitigation techniques that are available and simulates a scenario with several combined in a hybrid scheme. The simulations were made possible by several innovative components, including a near-optimum short-term fade predictor, a procedure capable of simulating the effect ofsite diversity with a single time series of attenuation and a dual-channel protocol structure that is able to increase availability of control information at Vband. The near-optimum short-term fade predictor is compared with several other short-term fade predictors and is shown to perform better in terms of the root-mean-square error and by the cumulative distribution of over-predictions. Also noteworthy is the fact that predictors based on fade slope perform very poorly when compared with signal processing and statistical methods ofprediction. The procedure capable of producing the effects of site diversity on a single time series of attenuation is described. The results of this procedure are compared with the ITU-R model for site diversity improvement and an acceptable fit is shown. A dual-channel protocol structure capable of increasing control information availability at V band is presented and the availability of this scheme is compared to the availability ofcurrent fixed-margin C and Ku band satellite links. While the availability at V band improves via this technique, it does not improve enough to compare favourably with that found in the lower frequency bands. A software turbo decoder capable of decoding the DVB-RCS turbo code is also described in this work since this was not available through other means. The <b>fade</b> <b>dynamics</b> at V band are reviewed and compared with the ITU-R models. The fade slope model gives a good visual fit but the fade duration model is very inaccurate.

This is known as data ferrying or data muling, and finds application in surveillance and scientific monitoring of remote and inaccessible regions. Desiderata for such a network include competing objectives related to latency, bandwidth, power consumption by the nodes, and tolerance for imperfect environmental information. For any design objective, network performance depends upon the control policies of UA and nodes. A model of such a system permits optimal planning, but is difficult to acquire and maintain. Node locations may not be precisely known. Radio fields are directional and irregular, affected by antenna shape, occlusions, reflections, diffraction, and <b>fading.</b> Complex aircraft <b>dynamics</b> further hamper planning.

To advocate reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, people in communication society are seeking to accommodate and take advantage of this new technology for wireless systems, such as sensor networks, Internet of Things, and heterogeneous networks. In this dissertation, we focus on energy harvesting (EH) based wireless networks, where multiple users are powered by energy harvesters and share limited spectrum resources. In this system, the design of efficient access schemes plays a crucial role in optimizing the system performance. Moreover, different from the conventional wireless systems, there are two random processes that must be jointly counted in the transmission design: the channel <b>fading</b> and the <b>dynamics</b> of the EH powered battery. Specifically, we narrow down the design onto two typical network setups. First, in a single channel access scenario, an ad hoc network with multiple transmitter-receiver pairs is considered, where all EH-based transmitters share one channel by random access. Two EH rate models are applied: Constant and i. i. d. (i. e., independent and identically distributed) EH rate models. To quantify the roles of both the energy and channel state information, a distributed opportunistic scheduling framework is proposed such that the average throughput of the network is maximized. Second, in a multi-channel access scenario, we study an uplink transmission under a heterogeneous network hierarchy, where each EH-based mobile user (MU) is capable of both deterministically accessing to a large network via one private channel, and dynamically accessing a small network with a certain probability via one common channel shared by multiple MUs. Considering a time-correlated EH model, we study an opportunistic transmission scheme to maximize the average throughput for each MU by jointly exploiting the statistics of the system states. Finally, back to the single channel access setup, we investigate the multiuser energy diversity by analyzing the fundamental scaling law of the throughput over the number of EH-based users under both centralized and distributed access schemes.

However, and despite significant progress with the advent of space missions and UV, EUV and XUV direct observations of the hot chro-mosphere and million degrees coronal plasma, much is yet to be achieved in the understanding of these high temperatures, fine dissipative structures and of the coronal heating in general. Recent missions have shown the definite role of waves and of the magnetic field deep in the inner corona, at the chromosphere-corona interface, where dramatic changes occur. The dynamics of the chromosphere and corona is controlled by the emerging magnetic field, guided by the coronal magnetic field. Accordingly, the direct measurement of the chromospheric and coronal magnetic fields is of prime importance.

We give a detail account of the proposed mission profile, major scien-tific objectives and model payload of HiRISE, a natural complement to the Solar Probe type missions lacking duty cycle, high resolution, spatial, spectral and temporal multi-temperature diagnostics and full coronal magnetometry...|$|R
