5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> the main convective area several hours later.|$|E

5|$|According to Serbian sources, some 120,000 Serbs were <b>{{displaced}}</b> <b>from</b> 1991 to 1993, and 250,000 were displaced after Operation Storm. The {{number of}} displaced Serbs was 254,000 in 1993, dropping to 97,000 {{in the early}} 1995 and then increasing again to 200,000 {{by the end of}} the year. Most international sources place the total number of Serbs displaced at around 300,000. According to Amnesty International 300,000 were <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> 1991 to 1995, of which 117,000 were officially registered as having returned as of 2005. According to the OSCE, 300,000 were displaced during the war, of which 120,000 were officially registered as having returned as of 2006. However, it is believed the number does not accurately reflect the number of returnees, because many returned to Serbia, Montenegro, or Bosnia and Herzegovina after officially registering in Croatia. According to the UNHCR in 2008, 125,000 were registered as having returned to Croatia, of whom 55,000 remained permanently.|$|E

5|$|The {{island of}} Samar {{sustained}} the worst {{damage caused by}} the storm. There, 82fatalities were reported and 56 were injured. A total of 19,390people were displaced; roughly 8,000families or 48,000people was forced to move to evacuation centers. Elsewhere, in the coastal town of Calapan, 5,600dwellings received damage, and 85% of the coastal town's residents were <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> their homes.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Mariana Islands, {{agriculture}} {{damage was}} estimated at $2million (1987USD) and 15families were <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> their homes.

5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E

5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) from the center. Convection became <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> the center of circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north.|$|E
5|$|From the two storms combined, {{more than}} 1million were <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> their homes. Throughout the Philippines, 470,962people or 92,271families sought shelter {{due to the}} typhoon, of which 5,023families or 30,138people sought shelter in schools, churches and town halls {{in a total of}} 10provinces. A total of 671homes were {{destroyed}} while 6,341others were damaged. One hundred-twenty-one people were killed while 17other individuals were reportedly missing and 26other people were wounded. The storm inflicted $24.2million in damage, with $15.2million in agriculture and $8.82million in infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Further {{intensification}} was slowed {{because of}} strong wind shear, which caused the storm's center of circulation to be <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> {{the bulk of}} convection. Due {{to the lack of}} atmospheric steering currents at the time, Odile assumed a slow, meandering course towards the west. Continued wind shear caused the tropical storm to become disorganized on September11 before abating, allowing for thunderstorms to rebuild over Odile's circulation center on September12. The relaxed wind shear enabled the growth of intense rainbands encircling the tropical cyclone as well as improved outflow aloft. The following day, Odile quickly attained a large central dense overcast; in accordance with Dvorak-derived satellite intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded the storm to hurricane intensity.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century, the Sauk and Meskwaki (or Fox) Native American tribes lived {{along the}} Mississippi River {{in what is}} now the U.S. states of Illinois and Iowa. The two tribes had become closely {{connected}} after having been <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> the Great Lakes region in conflicts with New France and other Native American tribes, particularly after the so-called Fox Wars ended in the 1730s. By the time of the Black Hawk War, the population of the two tribes was about 6,000 people.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are thought}} to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins is paraphyletic. Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins. Isthminia panamensis is an extinct genus and species of river dolphin, living 5.8 to 6.1 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered near Piña, Panama.|$|E

5|$|The NHC {{noted that}} a trough ahead of Christine would {{determine}} {{the future of the}} storm. This trough would either merge with the storm and allow significant intensification, or remain separate and cause Christine to dissipate. By September3, the low-level circulation had been <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> all convective activity and Christine weakened to a tropical depression. Several hours after weakening, the depression passed over Antigua with winds of 35mph (55km/h). The following day, the system degenerated into a tropical wave near the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The remnants of Christine were monitored by the NHC for several days before dissipating near the trough on September6.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Kelly, {{known as}} Typhoon Oniang in the Philippines, struck Japan {{during the middle}} of October1987. An area of {{disturbed}} weather formed along the monsoon trough near Yap on October6. Although thunderstorm activity was initially <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> the center, gradual development occurred nevertheless. The disturbance became a tropical depression on October9, and a tropical storm the next day. While moving generally north-northwest towards Japan, Kelly attained typhoon intensity on October12. Continuing to intensify, Typhoon Kelly reached its maximum intensity on October15, but a weakening trend began thereafter. The next day, the typhoon passed over the islands of Shikoku and Honshu. By October17, Kelly completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|A {{deepening}} trough {{over the}} eastern United States was forecast {{to turn the}} storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was <b>displaced</b> <b>from</b> the center of circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast {{in response to a}} subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States.|$|E
