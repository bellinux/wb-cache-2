The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The <b>gain</b> <b>is</b> attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E

40|$|Cooperation between {{physically}} separated wireless nodes {{can achieve}} the high signalto-noise ratio (SNR) diversity gains characteristic of multi-antenna arrays. Simulations indicate that such <b>gains</b> <b>are</b> still achieved for SNRs {{in the range}} of practical interest for several applications. Cooperation further yields SNR gains in addition to diversity gains. In contrast to diversity, the SNR <b>gains</b> <b>are</b> affected by the choice of inter-node distances. Such SNR <b>gains</b> <b>are</b> quantified in this paper via a geometry-inclusive error analysis. The notion of geometry-inclusive SNR <b>gains</b> <b>is</b> developed to facilitate geometry-based comparisons of cooperative strategies. ...|$|R

25|$|Most {{amplifiers}} {{are designed}} to be linear. That is, they provide constant gain for any normal input level and output signal. If an amplifier's <b>gain</b> <b>is</b> not linear, the output signal can become distorted. There are, however, cases where variable <b>gain</b> <b>is</b> useful. Certain signal processing applications use exponential gain amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|Raman {{amplifiers}} {{have some}} fundamental advantages. First, Raman gain exists in every fiber, {{which provides a}} cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the <b>gain</b> <b>is</b> nonresonant, which means that <b>gain</b> <b>is</b> available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2µm. A third advantage of Raman amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines {{can be used to}} increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of Raman amplification {{is that it is a}} relatively broad-band amplifier with a bandwidth > 5 THz, and the <b>gain</b> <b>is</b> reasonably flat over a wide wavelength range.|$|E

25|$|A high {{proportional}} gain {{results in}} a large change in the output for a given change in the error. If the proportional <b>gain</b> <b>is</b> too high, the system can become unstable (see the section on loop tuning). In contrast, a small gain {{results in a}} small output response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional <b>gain</b> <b>is</b> too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the proportional term should contribute {{the bulk of the}} output change.|$|E

50|$|In air systems, {{convective}} heat <b>gains</b> <b>are</b> assumed {{to become a}} cooling load instantly.

Conductive heat <b>gains</b> <b>are</b> converted to convective and radiative heat gains. If the space's air temperature and humidity are kept constant then heat extraction rate and space cooling load are equal. The resulting cooling load through different air system types in the same built environment can be different.|$|R

40|$|Background: Rigorous {{assessment}} of medical knowledge and technical skill inspires learning, reinforces confidence, and reassures the public. Identifying curricular effectiveness using objective measures of learning is therefore crucial for competency-oriented program {{development in a}} learner-centric educational environment. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether various measures of learning, including class-average normalized <b>gain,</b> can <b>be</b> used to assess the effectiveness of a one-day introductory bronchoscopy course curriculum. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental one-group pre-test/post-test study at the University of California, Irvine. The group comprised 24 first-year pulmonary and critical care trainees from eight training institutions in southern California. Class-average normalized gain, single-student normalized gain, absolute gain, and relative <b>gain</b> <b>were</b> used as objective measures of cognitive knowledge and bronchoscopy technical skill learning. A class-average normalized gain of 30 % was used to determine curricular effectiveness. Perceived educational value using Likert-scale surveys and post-course questionnaires was determined during and 3 months after course participation. Results: Mean test scores of cognitive knowledge improved significantly from 48 to 66 % (p = 0. 043). Absolute gain for the class was 18 %, relative <b>gain</b> <b>was</b> 37 %, class average normalized <b>gain</b> ≤g≤ <b>was</b> 34 %, and the average of the single-student normalized <b>gains</b> g(ave) <b>was</b> 29 %. Mean test scores of technical skill improved significantly from 43 to 77 % (p = 0. 017). Absolute <b>gain</b> <b>was</b> 34 %, relative <b>gain</b> <b>was</b> 78 %, class average normalized <b>gain</b> ≤g≤ <b>was</b> 60 %, and the average of the single-student normalized <b>gains</b> g(ave) <b>was</b> 59 %. Statistically significant improvements in absolute <b>gain</b> <b>were</b> noted in all five elements of technical skill (p < 0. 05). Likert-scale surveys, questionnaires, and surveys demonstrated strong perceived educational value. Conclusion: The effectiveness of a one-day introductory bronchoscopy curriculum was demonstrated using a pre-test/post-test model with calculation of normalized gain and related metrics. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R
