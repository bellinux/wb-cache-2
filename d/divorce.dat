5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} <b>divorce</b> as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk <b>divorce</b> was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for <b>divorce</b> and, unlike England, where <b>divorce</b> necessitated and act of parliament, <b>divorce</b> cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|Civil <b>divorce</b> {{is not a}} <b>divorce</b> {{according}} to the Church. If it is deemed {{to be the only}} way of ensuring legal rights, care of children, or protection of inheritance, the Church considers it morally acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to <b>divorce</b> their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The <b>divorce</b> is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a <b>divorce</b> with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial <b>divorce.</b> The <b>divorce</b> rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of <b>divorce,</b> fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to <b>divorce</b> a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study aims {{to know how}} the psychological dynamic of Subjective Well‐Being (SWB) of children is from <b>divorced</b> parents. This research involved three children from <b>divorced</b> parents as subject. The subjects’ ages were between 18 ‐ 21 years old. Data was collected through in‐depth interview, participative observation, and self report method. Findings indicated that there were three conditions of subjective well‐being of children from <b>divorced</b> parents. The first condition is the condition before the parent`s <b>divorced,</b> whereas the second and the third are the condition after the parent`s <b>divorced.</b> The first condition shows that children from <b>divorced</b> parents have low level of subjective well‐being before their parents <b>divorced.</b> It is mainly because of the parental conflict and the low level of family to spend time together which araised motional attachment. In the second condition, children from <b>divorced</b> parents still have low level of subjective well‐being that mainly because of the parental <b>divorced,</b> parental attitude that never told to their child about the <b>divorced,</b> and the decrease of parental attachment following the <b>divorced.</b> The third condition, children from <b>divorced</b> parents show the higher level of subjective well‐being that mainly because of the acceptance of children for the parents <b>divorced.</b> This acceptance leads children from <b>divorced</b> parents feeling positive affect and life satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the contributions of college students' perceptions of family of origin health and self-esteem to {{their perceptions of the}} <b>divorced</b> single mother. It was hypothesized that individuals who hold more positive views of their family of origin health will also view themselves and, consequently, the <b>divorced</b> single mother more positively. Participants were 170 college students, 113 of whom lived only with their biological parents, and 57 of whom lived at sometime in their lives with a <b>divorced</b> single mother. Four instruments were used to collect the data, including the Family of Origin Health Scale (Hovestadt et al., 1985), the Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), the Perception of <b>Divorced</b> Mother Scale (Ganong & Coleman, 1983), and a demographic questionnaire. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were used in data analyses. Generally, results indicated that family type made no major impact on participants' perceptions of the <b>divorced</b> single mother. Among participants in the biological parent group and the <b>divorced</b> single mother group, family of origin health significantly predicted more positive perceptions of the <b>divorced</b> single mother. In this analysis, the regression model for the biological parent group was significant, while for the <b>divorced</b> single mother group it was not. Self-esteem was not found to contribute significantly to participants' perceptions of the <b>divorced</b> single mother, and thus did not mediate the relationship between family of origin health and perceptions of the <b>divorced</b> single mother. Finally, among the biological parent group, amount of interaction with single parent families headed by a <b>divorced</b> single mother significantly predicted more positive perceptions of the <b>divorced</b> single mother. Among the <b>divorced</b> single mother group, however, amount of time lived in a single parent family headed by a <b>divorced</b> mother did not significantly predict their perceptions of the <b>divorced</b> single mother...|$|R

5|$|By custom {{there were}} seven {{conditions}} where a man could <b>divorce</b> his wife. These were: (1) disobedience to parents-in-law, (2) barrenness (unable to continue family line), (3) adultery (mixing another clan's blood into the family), (4) jealousy (of concubines), (5) incurable disease (unable to continue family line), (6) loquacity (not getting along with brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law), and (7) theft. However, a husband {{was not allowed to}} <b>divorce</b> his wife if she had completed three years of mourning for one of his deceased parents, if there were no living relatives in her father's family to return to, or if the husband's family was originally poor but became rich after marriage. Sometimes women were also able to initiate the <b>divorce</b> and remarry if the husband's family was in poverty, he was diseased, or his in-laws were too abusive. Although remarriage was frowned upon (especially since <b>divorce</b> meant a wife took away her dowry wealth from her ex-husband's family), it was nonetheless common amongst divorcees and widowers in all social groups.|$|E
5|$|By early 1960, James Kinne was contemplating <b>divorce,</b> {{partially}} {{because of his}} wife's spendthrift habits and {{partially because}} he strongly suspected she was being unfaithful to him.

Sharon, too, was thinking about ways out of the marriage; according to John Boldizs, she once offered him $1,000 to kill her husband or find someone who would, although he later claimed that she may have been joking.|$|E
