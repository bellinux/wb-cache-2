5|$|When the General Assembly {{reversed}} {{the election results}} after a dispute, incensed Republicans armed themselves and descended on Frankfort. Taylor's Democratic opponent, William Goebel, was shot and died after being sworn in on his deathbed. Taylor exhausted his finances in a legal battle with Goebel's running mate J. C. W. Beckham over the governorship. Taylor ultimately lost the battle, and was implicated in Goebel's assassination. He fled to neighboring Indiana. Despite eventually being pardoned for any wrongdoing, <b>he</b> <b>seldom</b> returned to Kentucky. Taylor died in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) offer Pembleton (Andre Braugher) a {{promotion}} to lieutenant and the vacant shift commander position working alongside Gee (Yaphet Kotto). Pembleton asks for {{time to consider}} it, and the duo ask him {{not to mention the}} offer to Gee. Gee is inquisitive and immediately senses Pembleton is lying when he says the discussion was nothing. After discussing the offer with his wife Mary (Ami Brabson), Pembleton decides not to take the job and confesses to Gee, who has already learned the truth and is disappointed Pembleton did not tell him sooner. The episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives, which <b>he</b> <b>seldom</b> does.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews with AllMusic's Thom Jurek observing [...] "Tap: John Zorn's Book of Angels, Vol. 20 is {{a special}} album in both men's catalogs. (It's being released simultaneously on both Nonesuch and Tzadik.) These compositions offer Metheny something that <b>he's</b> <b>seldom</b> {{been able to take}} advantage of. While he's regularly performed the works of other composers, <b>he</b> has <b>seldom</b> had the opportunity to so thoroughly orchestrate and arrange them. Ironically, this collaboration has resulted in giving him the freedom to explore his artistic expression as an individual, at a deeper level".|$|R

5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, <b>he</b> <b>seldom</b> visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Hamence played 19first-class {{matches and}} scored 582runs {{at an average}} of 32.33. An {{occasional}} bowler who delivered 56.3 overs of medium pace during the tour, he took seven wickets at 21.42 and completed nine catches. He was the most successful of the specialist batsmen with the ball, occasionally opening the bowling in the tour matches, such as in both innings of the second match against Surrey and the second innings of the second match against Yorkshire. This allowed Bradman to rest his first-choice bowlers to keep them fresh for the Tests. Hamence's primary role was to allow the leading batsmen an opportunity to conserve energy for the Tests; the Australians generally had six days of play scheduled every week. In most of the matches, Hamence batted in the middle order at Nos. 5, 6 and 7.N- Along with Loxton, he was given 22 first-class opportunities with the bat, whereas the other eight frontline batsmen had at least 26 innings. Loxton scored 973 runs, while the others all scored more than 1,000. All of the batsmen other than Loxton averaged at least 47.30. and as Australia won many of their matches by an innings or by eight or more wickets, <b>he</b> <b>seldom</b> batted in the second innings. On four occasions, he was unbeaten when Australia either declared, reached their target or time ran out.|$|E

25|$|Päts {{served as}} the {{chairman}} of the Farmers' Assemblies party only unofficially and he was considered to be a bad partisan and often formed the opposition within the party.

25|$|Caine {{retired from}} active {{politics}} in 1908. Due {{to the other}} pressures on his time <b>he</b> <b>seldom</b> spoke in the Keys.

25|$|He {{could be}} broken but never bent, and his rude frankness accorded with his hard, sombre face, {{and he often}} alienated men's sympathies though <b>he</b> <b>seldom</b> lost their respect. His lyricism is vigorous, feeling but austere, and almost entirely {{subjective}} and personal, while his pamphlets are distinguished by energy of conviction, strength of affirmation, and contempt for weaker and more ignorant opponents.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>seldom</b> played thereafter, but {{returned}} for the Gopalan Trophy match in 1968-69, making his highest score, 22, and taking 4 for 58, including the wickets of Anura Tennekoon (leg-before) and David Heyn (bowled). His last match came in 1969-70, when, {{for his last}} wicket, he bowled the Andhra opening batsman before a run had been scored in the match.|$|E
25|$|Pauli {{made many}} {{important}} contributions {{in his career}} as a physicist, primarily in the field of quantum mechanics. <b>He</b> <b>seldom</b> published papers, preferring lengthy correspondences with colleagues such as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, with whom he had close friendships.

The highest of his 20 first-class centuries was 146 for Auckland against Central Districts at Auckland in 1971–72.

25|$|In 1852, {{the voters}} of Edinburgh offered to re-elect him to Parliament. He {{accepted}} on the express condition that he need not campaign and would not pledge himself to a position on any political issue. Remarkably, he was elected on those terms. <b>He</b> <b>seldom</b> attended the House due to ill health. His weakness after suffering a heart attack caused him to postpone for several months making his speech of thanks to the Edinburgh voters. He resigned his seat in January 1856. In 1857 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Macaulay, of Rothley in the County of Leicester, but seldom attended the House of Lords.|$|E
25|$|Eden's {{occasional}} {{articles and}} his early 1970s television appearance were {{an exception to}} an almost total retirement. <b>He</b> <b>seldom</b> appeared in public, unlike other former Prime Ministers, e.g. James Callaghan who commented frequently on current affairs. He was even accidentally omitted {{from a list of}} Conservative Prime Ministers by Margaret Thatcher when she became Conservative Leader in 1975, although she later went {{out of her way to}} establish relations with Eden and, later, his widow. In retirement he was highly critical of regimes such as Sukarno's Indonesia which confiscated assets belonging to their former colonial rulers, and appears to have reverted somewhat to the right-wing views which he had espoused in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Political economist, however, gave {{other side}} of story by arguing {{the fact that his}} {{policies}} were not aimed at alleviating poverty as <b>he</b> <b>seldom</b> offered relief to the poor sections of the society. Shaukat Aziz is roundly criticized for his policy of downsizing in the public sector and disintegrating the effects of nationalization policies of Benazir Bhutto as early as the 1990s but Aziz defended as he points out that his policies made these institutions viable while they {{were on the verge of}} collapse. Political economist dr. S. Akbar Zaidi argues that his policies mastered Pakistan's economy but such indicators are misleading and unsustainable because his policies do not examine or explain the particular, perplexing economy of Pakistan.|$|E

While in Italy {{he was able to}} view works by Michaelangelo, Giotto, and Caravaggio. After the war Ivey spent three years at the California School of Fine Art in San Francisco, where he undertook serious study of modern art with such influential instructors as Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, David Park, and Clay Spohn. Friends and fellow students included noted painters Richard Diebenkorn and Frank Lobdell.|$|E
25|$|Grattan {{supported}} the veto, {{but a more}} radical Catholic party was now arising in Ireland {{under the leadership of}} Daniel O'Connell, and Grattan's influence gradually declined. <b>He</b> <b>seldom</b> spoke in Parliament after 1810, the most notable exception being in 1815, when he separated himself from the Whigs and {{supported the}} final struggle against Napoléon. His last speech of all, in 1819, contained a passage referring to the Union he had so passionately resisted, which exhibits the statesmanship, {{and at the same time}} the equable quality, of Grattan's character. His sentiments with regard to the policy of the Union remained, he said, unchanged; but the marriage, having taken place, it is now the duty, as it ought to be the inclination, of every individual to render it as fruitful, as profitable and as advantageous as possible.|$|E
