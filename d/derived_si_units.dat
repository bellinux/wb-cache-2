5000|$|The newton second (also newton-second, symbol Ns or N·s) is the <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of impulse. It is {{dimensionally}} {{equivalent to}} the momentum unit kilogram metre per second (kg·m/s). One newton second corresponds to a one-newton force applied for one second.|$|R
5000|$|The katal (symbol: kat) is the <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of {{catalytic}} activity. It is a <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> for quantifying the {{catalytic activity}} of enzymes (measuring the enzymatic activity level in enzyme catalysis) and other catalysts.

50|$|The International System of <b>Units</b> (<b>SI)</b> {{specifies}} a set {{of seven}} base units from which all other <b>SI</b> <b>units</b> of measurement are <b>derived.</b> These <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> are either dimensionless, or can be expressed {{as a product of}} {{one or more of the}} base units, possibly scaled by an appropriate power of exponentiation.|$|R
25|$|In 1979, {{because of}} the {{difficulties}} in realizing a Planck radiator at high temperatures and the new possibilities offered by radiometry, the 16thCGPM adopted the modern definition of the candela. The arbitrary (1/683) term was chosen so that the new definition would exactly match the old definition. Although the candela is now {{defined in terms of}} the second (an <b>SI</b> base <b>unit)</b> and the watt (a <b>derived</b> <b>SI</b> <b>unit),</b> the candela remains a base <b>unit</b> of the <b>SI</b> system, by definition.|$|R

50|$|The SI {{includes}} {{two classes of}} units which are defined and agreed internationally. The first of these classes includes the seven <b>SI</b> base <b>units</b> for length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, luminous intensity and amount of substance. The second class consists of the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b> These derived units are {{defined in terms of}} the seven base units. All other quantities (e.g. work, force, power) are expressed in terms of <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R

50|$|In photometry, the lumen second (lm s or lm⋅s) is the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of {{luminous}} energy. It {{is based}} on the lumen, the <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> of luminous flux, and the second, the <b>SI</b> base <b>unit</b> of time.|$|R
50|$|The {{only way}} to express a nonstandard order of {{magnitude}} as an <b>SI</b> <b>unit</b> is to combine two prefixed <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> whose component base units cancel out; for example, units of 105 seconds could be expressed as kilojoules per centiwatt (kJ/cW) or hectocoulombs per milliampere (hC/mA). Such misuse of <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units</b> can create a cognitive dissonance; to do so requires the invocation of units {{not directly related to}} the quantity being measured (coulombs and amperes, for example, quantify electricity, making it awkward to combine the two in a way that creates a unit of time with no electrical component).|$|R
50|$|The pascal can be {{expressed}} using <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>units,</b> or alternatively solely <b>SI</b> base <b>units,</b> as:where N is the newton, m is the metre, kg is the kilogram, and s is the second.|$|R

A newton is equal to a kg·m/s2, and a kilogram-force is 9.80665 newtons, meaning that 1 kgf/cm2 equals 98.0665 kilopascals.|$|R
50|$|The newton (symbol: N) is the International System of <b>Units</b> (<b>SI)</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of force. It {{is named}} after Isaac Newton in {{recognition}} of his work on classical mechanics, specifically Newton's second law of motion.|$|R
5000|$|Many derived units do {{not have}} special names. For example, the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of area is the square metre (m2) and the <b>SI</b> <b>derived</b> <b>unit</b> of density is the {{kilogram}} per cubic metre (kg/m3 or kg m−3). However, 22 derived units are recognized by the SI with special names, which are written in lowercase. However, the symbols for units named after persons, are always written with an uppercase initial letter. For example, the symbol for the hertz is [...] "Hz"; but the symbol for the metre is [...] "m".|$|R
