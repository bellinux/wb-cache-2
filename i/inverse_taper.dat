Most gratings show coupling loss (to/from a cleaved single mode fiber) of a few dB (∼ 2 – 6 dB) with a 3 dB bandwidth of tens of nanometers [5], [9], [11], [13], [17], [21] while complex, multi-etch gratings with bottom reflectors have reached sub-dB loss with broader bandwidth [24], [25], [27], [28]. A few other proposed approaches for grating geometries are based on transformation optics [29], [30], parabolic reflectors [31], and subwavelength grating tapers [32], [33], however they also suffer from the bandwidth-efficiency tradeoff.

40|$|XFELs provide X-ray pulses with {{unprecedented}} peak {{brightness and}} ultrashort duration. They are usually driven by planar undulators, {{meaning that the}} output radiation is linearly polarized. For many experimental applications, however, polarization control is critical: besides the ability to produce linearly polarized radiation, one often needs the possibility of generating circularly polarized radiation with a high, stable degree of polarization. This may be achieved by using a {{first part of the}} XFEL undulator to produce bunching and then, by propagating the the bunched beam through an "afterburner" - a short undulator with tunable polarization, where only limited gain takes place.

40|$|Copper {{interconnects}} {{have shown}} its limit {{to meet the}} bandwidth demand even in the short reach applications due to its increase power consumption, RC delay, EMI, crosstalk and other effects which are aggravated as dimension shrinks. Despite efforts to increase the system performance, e. g. by multicore technology, migration to photonics is unavoidable, as it can give much superior performance. The major impediment to the wide-use of photonics is the cost. Three major components {{that contribute to the}} cost escalation are the absence of integrable light source, fast modulator, and effective fiber to waveguide coupler. The latest issue was addressed in this work. Coupling light efficiently from fiber to waveguide is challenging because of the size (6 [mu]m core diameter for fiber, 500 nm for waveguide), shape, and refractive index (~ 1. 5 for fiber, 3. 5 for waveguide) differences. Optical solder was proposed as the gap filler in between the fiber and waveguide to account for the fabrication uncertainties. Together with an <b>inverse</b> <b>taper</b> structure patterned in the waveguide end, the coupling loss was much reduced from 7. 5 dB (direct butt-coupling), to less than IdB. Besides, optical solder increases the reliability of device, as it prevents moisture and dust from impairing the optically active area of the die. Its fabrication is also integrable with the current CMOS technology. The configuration allows high density optical interconnect {{at the edges of the}} die; together with the electrical interconnect spreading across the area of the chip. All these make this system very good potential coupling method to solve one of the major impediments above, and thus enable the widespread use of electronic-photonic ICs. by Fidelia Tjioe. Thesis (M.

40|$|The electronic-photonic {{integrated}} circuit (EPIC) {{has emerged as}} a leading technology to surpass the interconnect bottlenecks that threaten to limit the progress of Moore's Law in microprocessors. Compared to conventional metal interconnects, photonic interconnects have the potential to increase bandwidth density while simultaneously reducing power consumption. However, photonic devices are orders of magnitude larger than electronic devices and therefore consume valuable substrate real estate. The ideal solution, in order to take advantage of optical interconnects without decreasing transistor counts, is to monolithically implement dense threedimensional integration of electronics and photonics. This involves moving the photonic devices off the substrate, and into the metal interconnect stack. Moving photonic devices into the interconnect stack imposes two fabrication limitations. First, the available thermal budget allowed for photonic device processing is limited to 450 °C. Second, the metal interconnects are embedded within amorphous dielectrics and therefore there is no crystalline seed to initiate epitaxial growth. This thesis addresses two major barriers for integration of photonics in the back end: (1) how to fabricate high quality Ge for active regions of optoelectronic devices while adhering to back-end processing constraints, and (2) how to couple optical power to these devices. First, an approach was developed to fabricate the active region of Ge-based optoelectronic devices. A new technique, known as two-dimensional geometrically confined lateral growth (2 D GCLG), has demonstrated single crystalline Ge on an amorphous substrate. This thesis presents the first application of the 2 D GCLG technique to fill a lithographically defined Si 0 2 trench with large grain Ge, while adhering to back-end processing constraints. A modified design is then proposed to increases the yield of 2 D GCLG structures. This trench filling technique is an integral step towards fabricating Ge-based optoelectronic devices that are capable of being integrated into the back-end of a microprocessor. Once it was established that high quality Ge trenches could be fabricated in the back-end, optical coupling to devices was addressed. For dense three-dimensional integration of photonic devices, vertical coupling between photonic planes is necessary. Therefore, this thesis begins with the design and simulation of vertical couplers. These couplers utilize evanescent coupling between two overlapping inversely tapered waveguides, which ensure efficient coupling due to optical impedance matching. These couplers are designed to exhibit coupling efficiencies in excess of 98. 4 %, equivalent to a 0. 07 dB coupling loss. The technique of evanescent coupling between overlapping inverse tapers is then applied to electro-absorption modulators (EAMs). A design for low-loss evanescent coupling from a waveguide to a Ge EAM is modeled and optimized. The design implements lateral evanescent coupling from overlapping <b>inverse</b> <b>taper</b> structures.

40|$|Designs {{for deep}} {{ultraviolet}} (DUV) edge emitting laser diodes (LDs) {{based on the}} wurtzite III-nitride (III-N) material system are presented. A combination of proprietary and commercial advanced semiconductor LD simulation software is used to study the operation of III-N based DUV LDs theoretically. Critical factors limiting device performance are identified based on an extensive literature survey. A comprehensive design parameter space is investigated thoroughly {{with the help of}} advanced scripting capabilities. Several design strategies are proposed to eliminate the critical problems completely or partially. A DUV LD design is proposed based exclusively on AlInN active layers grown epitaxially on bulk AlN substrates because AlInN offers a promising alternative to AlGaN for the realization of LDs and LEDs operating in the DUV regime. The proposed AlInN-based design also features a tapered electron blocking layer (EBL) instead of a homogeneous one. Tapered EBLs redistribute the interfacial polarization charge volumetrically throughout the entire EBL thickness via compositional grading, and eliminate the parasitic inversion layer charge. AlGaN based DUV LD designs are explored also because at present, {{it may be difficult to}} grow AlInN epitaxially with superior crystalline quality. Polarization charge matching is proposed to improve electron and hole wavefunction overlap within the active region. Although the strategy of polarization charge matching has already been proposed in the literature to enhance performance of visible wavelength LEDs and LDs, the proposed design presents the first demonstration that polarization charge matching is also feasible for DUV LDs operating at sub- 300 nm wavelengths. A lateral current injection (LCI) LD design is proposed featuring polarization-charge-matched barriers and regrown Ohmic contacts to avoid a group of issues related to the highly inefficient p-type doping of wide bandgap III-N materials in vertical injection designs. The proposed design partially decouples the problem of electrical injection from that of optical confinement. Although the idea of an LCI LD design has been proposed in the literature in the 90 s to be used as longer wavelength active sources in optoelectronic integrated circuits using GaInAsP/InP and related material systems, the proposed design is the first theoretical demonstration that this concept can be applied to DUV LDs based on III-N material system. To solve the problem of hole transport in vertical injection designs, a DUV LD design based exclusively on AlGaN material system is presented, featuring an inverse-tapered p-waveguide layer instead of an EBL. Several EBL designs are investigated, and compared with conventionally-tapered EBL design. Through judicious volumetric redistribution of fixed negative polarization charge, <b>inverse</b> <b>tapering</b> may be exploited to achieve nearly flat valence band profiles free from barriers to hole injection into the active region, in contrast to conventional designs.

40|$|Silicon as a {{platform}} for photonics has recently seen a very large increase in interest because of its potential to overcome the bandwidth limitations of microprocessor interconnects and the low manufacturing cost given by the high compatibility with the already established micro-electronics industry. There has therefore been a signicant push in silicon photonics research to develop all silicon based optical components for telecoms applications. The work reported in this Thesis is con- cerned with the design, fabrication and characterisation of coupled ring resonators on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) material. The nal objective of this work is to pro- vide a robust and reliable technology for the demonstration of optical buers and delay-lines operating at signal bandwidths up to 100 GHz and in the wavelength region around 1550 nm. The core of the activity focused on the optimisation of the fabrication technology and device geometry to ensure the required device performance for the fabrication of long chains of ring resonators. The nal pro- cess has been optimised to obtain both intra-chip and chip-to-chip reproducibility with a variability of the process controlled at the nanometre scale. This {{was made possible by}} careful control of all the variables involved in the fabrication process, reduction of the fabrication complexity, close feature-size repeatability, line-edge roughness reduction, nearly vertical sidewall proles and high uniformity in the ebeam patterning. The best optical propagation losses of the realized waveguides reduced down to 1 dB=cm for 480 220 nm 2 rectangular cross-section photonic wires and were consistently kept at typical values of around 1. 5 dB=cm. Control of the coupling coecients between resonators had a standard deviation of less than 4 % for dierent realizations and resonance dispersion between resonators was below 50 GHz. All these gures represent the state-of-the-art in SOI photon- ics technology.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} III-nitride materials for deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light emitting devices. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a DUV laser diode (LD) operating at room temperature. Epitaxial structures for these devices are grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and several material analysis techniques were employed to characterize these structures such as atomic force microscopy, electroluminescence, Hall-effect measurement, photoluminescence, secondary ion mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, transmission line measurement, and X-ray diffraction. Each of these will be discussed in detail. The active regions of III-nitride based UV emitters are composed of AlxGa 1 -xN alloys, the bandgap of which can be tuned from 3. 4 eV to 6. 2 eV, which allows us to attain the desired wavelength in the DUV by engineering the molar fraction of aluminum and gallium. In order to emit photons in the DUV wavelength range (> 4. 1 eV), high aluminum molar fraction AlxGa 1 -xN alloys are required. Since aluminum has very low ad-atom mobility on the growth surface, a very low group V to group III precursor ratio (known as V/III ratio), high growth temperature, and low growth pressure is required to form a smooth surface and subsequently abrupt heterointerfaces. The first part of this work focuses on developing high-quality multi-quantum well structures using high aluminum molar fraction ([Al] > 60 %) AlxGa 1 -xN alloys. Optically pumped DUV lasers were demonstrated with threshold power density as low as 250 kW/cm² for the emission wavelength as short as 248. 3 nm. Transverse electric (TE) -like emission dominates when the lasers were operating above threshold power density, which suggests the diode design requires the active region to be fully strained to promote better confinement of the optical mode in transverse direction. The second phase of this project is to achieve an electrically driven injection diode laser. Owing to their large bandgap, low intrinsic carrier concentration, and relatively high dopant activation energy, the nature of these high aluminum molar fraction materials are highly insulating; therefore, efficiently transport carriers into active region {{is one of the main}} challenges. Highly conducting p-type material is especially difficult to achieve because the activation energy for magnesium, a typical dopant, is relatively large and some of the acceptors are compensated by the hydrogen during the growth. Furthermore, due to the lack of a large work function material to form a p-type ohmic contact, the p-contact layer design is limited to low aluminum molar fraction material or gallium nitride. Besides the fabrication challenges, these low aluminum molar fraction materials are not transparent to the laser wavelength causing relatively high internal loss (αi). In this work, an <b>inverse</b> <b>tapered</b> p-waveguide design is employed to transport holes to active region efficiently while the graded-index separate-confinement heterostructure (GRINSCH) is employed for the active region design.

For the first test version of the impeller, designated the MFI- 2 A, the blade height was arbitrarily made greater than that for the basic impeller (the MFI- 2) to allow for viscous effects. At design equivalent speed of 1400 feet per second the peak pressure ratio and maximum adiabatic efficiency were 3. 95 and 79 percent, respectively. The adiabatic efficiency of the MFI- 2 A is four points lower than that for impeller model MFI- 1 A, but because of the higher slip factor for the MFI- 2 A, the pressure ratios are approximately equal. The procedures followed {{in the design of the}} MFI- 1 A and MFI- 2 A were, in general, the same; and, although the prescribed initial condition resulted in geometrical configurations that were quite dissimilar, the resulting performance characteristics compare favorably with designs for which considerable development work has been necessary...|$|R
40|$|Some area in Indonesia such as {{southern}} part of Sumatra to Nusa Tenggara have big enough wind speed to produce electrical energy by using wind turbine. However, the potential resources are not yet fully developed, and only 1. 4 GW electrical energy has been generating in the Indonesia region. Most of the wind energy generating equipment is designed to the European wind speed which is 10 - 30 knot. So, {{it is very important}} to modify the such equipment to be able to implement in Indonesia area which is have a lower wind speed. The purpose of this research is to know the influence of number of blades and wind speed to electricity generated by horizontal axis wind turbine with blade <b>taper</b> <b>inversed</b> linear. The result showed that the highest electrical output power was 2, 02 watt produced by 5 blades and 3, 5 m/s wind speed. The lowest electrical output power was 2, 347 watt achieved by using 3 blades and 2, 5 m/s wind speed...|$|R
40|$|The copper (Cu) {{interconnect}} {{has become}} the bottleneck for bandwidth scaling due to its increasing RC time constant with the decreasing gate line width. Currently, silicon based optical interconnect is widely pursued as the most promising technology to replace Cu in microprocessor chips. Silicon optical interconnect is based on integrated silicon nanophotonic technologies. It can leverage the large scale and low cost of CMOS technology and deliver higher bandwidth with no EMI and low heat dissipation. Passive photonic component, such as waveguides, couplers, filters, splitters, are the backbone of integrated photonic circuit. This thesis {{is dedicated to the}} development of low loss, high performance, high index contrast optical waveguides and couplers via materials, processes engineering, development, and device designs. We primarily focus on SOI single crystalline silicon (c-Si or SOI), PECVD amorphous silicon (a-Si:H, or simplified as a-Si), and PECVD silicon nitride (SiNxHy) based single mode channel waveguides. We have previously identified that sidewall roughness scattering is the dominant loss mechanism for the TE mode in high index contrast single mode channel waveguides. In this thesis, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the roughness scattering and its positive correlations with (1) sidewall optical intensity; (2) sidewall RMS roughness; and (3) sidewall index contrast. Novel processes and designs, such as hard mask and chemical oxidation, are developed based on the above understanding. In single mode, 500 x 200 nm 2 c-Si channel waveguides, we have achieved world-record 2. 7 dB/cm and 0. 7 dB/cm transmission loss coefficients for the TE mode and the TM mode, respectively. For deposited waveguides, bulk absorption loss is also important for both TE and TM modes. For PECVD a-Si, we adapt hydrogen passivation to reduce dangling bond density. (cont.) We also use a thin silicon nitride as the over cladding layer to help preserve H passivation and to reduce sidewall index contrast, acting as the graded index layer for a-Si waveguide core. We have accomplished the lowest reported loss coefficients in directly etched, single mode, 700 x 100 nm 2 a-Si channel waveguides of 2. 7 dB/cm for the TE mode, comparable to c-Si waveguide with similar dimensions. For the first time, damascene process has also been demonstrated as a promising process for a-Si waveguide fabrication. We have achieved a record-low loss of 2. 5 dB/cm in 600 x 100 cm 2 a-Si channel waveguides. Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) is the most critical step. For PECVD SiNxHy, we have previously identified that the absorption loss is due to the resonant absorption caused by N-H vibration. In this thesis, three different low temperature approaches have been developed and optimized to reduce NH concentration in as-deposited SiNxHY via (1) deposition chemistry; (2) post-deposition Ultraviolet light (UV) treatment; and (3) post-deposition, in-situ N 2 /Ar plasma treatment. All three processes are compatible with CMOS back-end processes, such as a-Si process. While changing deposition chemistry is the simplest method to obtain low NH containing SiNxHy, it comes with high SiH concentration and may have undesirable properties. Experimentally, for UV treatment, the highest H removal percentage is 60 %; for plasma treatment, - 90 %. UV treatment shows strong compositional dependence. The underlying mechanism of such dependence is identified and confirmed by Monte-Carlo modeling. Low loss and spectrally broadband optical couplers are indispensable optical components in an integrated photonic circuit. A high performance coupler should be capable of overcoming the mode-size mismatch, mode-shape mismatch, mode-position mismatch, and polarization mismatch, bridging different optical devices with minimal coupling loss. In this thesis, we have demonstrated a fiber-to-waveguide coupler based on asymmetric graded index taper and monolithically integrated cylindrical lens. (cont.) It is capable of transforming single mode light between single mode fiber and waveguides with minimal coupling loss of 0. 45 dB between 1520 nm and 1630 nm. We have also demonstrated a vertical waveguide-to-waveguide coupler that is based on complementary <b>inverse</b> <b>tapers.</b> This design is tolerant of large refractive index mismatch between the two waveguides and also of any fabrication variation that would affect the effective indices of the two waveguides. We have achieved a minimal coupling loss of 0. 25 dB per coupler and excellent broadband behavior is also demonstrated. Slot waveguides are a newly developed class of waveguides with unique optical properties. Slot waveguides can achieve exceptional high optical field in nanometer sized low index regions. In this thesis, we have demonstrated low loss transmission of 6 dB/cm for the fundamental slot mode in horizontal slot waveguides at 1550 nm. The horizontal slot configuration removes the constraints of thin slot definition by lithography and allows an arbitrarily thin slot to be fabricated via deposition or oxidation. Because the resulting interface is much smoother than the etched interface, the transmission loss in horizontal slot waveguides is much lower than in vertical slot waveguides. We also demonstrated that multiple slot configurations result in higher optical confinement compared to single slot configurations with the same slot thickness. The low loss and high optical confinement in the low index slot region realized in horizontal slot waveguides promises many useful applications, such as Er-doped silicon-based light emitters. For integration of slot waveguides with conventional channel waveguides, we have designed and simulated mode couplers and polarization rotators for slot-slot, slot-channel waveguide mode transformations. Athermal operation is important for realizing stable passive, WDM optical network on silicon. Athermal design of silicon waveguide systems uses advanced polymer cladding of large negative TO coefficient to provide compensation for the large positive TO coefficient in silicon. The reduced thermo-optic (TO) effect is experimentally demonstrated by reducing TO coefficient from 85 pm/K to 11 pm/K using polymer films. by Rong Sun. Thesis (Ph. D.)
