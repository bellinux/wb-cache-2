50|$|While {{the disease}} is usually caused by a bite, it can also occur from close contact with rodents or {{ingestion}} of contaminated food or water. The latter is known as <b>Haverhill</b> <b>fever.</b> The <b>disease</b> typically presents with chills and fever accompanied by headache, vomiting, and muscle pain. A rash and arthritis develop 2-4 days after the initial onset. Less commonly the infection can cause pneumonitis, endocarditis or meningitis. As these symptoms are common to many febrile diseases, this is often classified as a fever of unknown origin (FUO). If untreated, death will occur in approximately 10% of cases.|$|R

50|$|The streptobacillosis form of {{rat-bite fever}} is {{known by the}} {{alternative}} names <b>Haverhill</b> <b>fever</b> and epidemic arthritic erythema. It is a severe disease caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis, transmitted either by rat bite or ingestion of contaminated products (<b>Haverhill</b> <b>fever).</b> After an incubation period of 2-10 days, <b>Haverhill</b> <b>fever</b> begins with high prostrating fevers, rigors (shivering), headache, and polyarthralgia (joint pain). Soon, an exanthem (widespread rash) appears, either maculopapular (flat red with bumps) or petechial (red or purple spots) and arthritis of large joints can be seen. The organism can be cultivated in blood or articular fluid. The disease can be fatal if untreated in 20% of cases due to malignant endocarditis, meningoencephalitis, or septic shock. Treatment is with penicillin, tetracycline, or doxycycline.|$|R

50|$|In the U.S., rat bite fever is {{primarily}} caused by transmission of S. moniliformis from {{the bite of}} a rat. However, approximately 30% of patients diagnosed with rat bite fever do not recall being scratched or bitten by an infected animal. Transmission of the bacterium is also known to occur via consumption of infected water, close contact with, or handling of rats. <b>Haverhill</b> <b>fever,</b> named after the 1926 outbreak of the disease in Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{is a form of}} rat bite fever that can result from ingesting food contaminated with S. moniliformis. In 1986 at a boarding school in the United Kingdom, another outbreak of <b>Haverhill</b> <b>fever</b> was reported. Some 304 people were reported to have been afflicted. Infection was suspected to have resulted from the consumption of either unpasteurized milk or water contaminated with rat feces. Infected individuals described symptoms including a sudden development of vomiting, severe headache, and cold sweats with a high fever. Parker and Hudson first isolated the cause of this outbreak, which they named Haverhilia multiformis. This organism was later matched to S. moniliformis after further research.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Haverhill</b> <b>Fever</b> (or {{epidemic}} arthritic erythema) {{is a form}} of [...] "rat-bite fever" [...] {{caused by}} the bacterium Streptobacillus moniliformis, an organism common in rats and mice. Symptoms begin to appear two to ten days after a rat bite injury. The illness resembles a severe influenza, with a moderate fever (38-40 °C, or 101-104 °F), chills, joint pain, and a diffuse red rash, located mostly on the hands and feet. The causative organism can be isolated by blood culture, and penicillin is the most common treatment. Treatment is usually quite successful, although the body can clear the infection by itself in most cases. Complications are rare, but can include endocarditis and meningitis.|$|R

40|$|Rat-bite fever {{is caused}} by two {{bacterial}} species, Streptobacillus moniliformis and Spirillum minus. The two forms of the disease are known, respectively, as streptobacillary rat bite fever and spirillary rat bite <b>fever.</b> <b>Haverhill</b> <b>fever</b> {{is a form of}} S. moniliformis infection acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water. In the U. S., rat bite fever is usually caused by S. moniliformis, a Gram negative pleomorphic bacillus. This organism has also been called Streptothrix muris ratti, Nocardia muris, Actinomyces muris, Actinobacillus muris, Proactinomyces muris, Haverhillia multiformis, and Asterococcus muris. S. minus commonly causes rat bite fever in Asia. This organism is a short Gram negative spiral with two or three turns. Relatively little has been published about S. minus; it has never been cultivated in artificial media and is not well characterized. Geographic Distribution Streptobacillus moniliformis and Spirillum minus can be found worldwide; however, S. minus is common only in Asia.

The objective of the research is to obtain information regarding the area of dengue <b>fever</b> <b>disease</b> distribution in Banjar City by utilizing the Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) model. The research is an observational study with Explanatory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA). Data analysis uses SDE model with the scope of the entire sub district area in Banjar City. The data analyzed is dengue fever case from 2007 - 2013 periods, with the number of sample of 315 cases. Social demographic overview of dengue fever patients in Banjar City shows that most of the patients are within the productive age, with 39. 7 % within the school age and 45. 7 % are within the work age. Most of the dengue fever patients are men (58. 1 %). Distribution of dengue fever cases from the period of 2007 until 2012 mostly occur in 25 - 37. 5 meters above sea level (MASL) (55. 8 %). The SDE models of dengue fever cases in Banjar City generally form dispersion patterns following the x-axis and clustered by physiographic boundaries.

SETTING: Preventive Medicine department, Ministry of Health, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of all laboratory confirmed cases of Alkhurma hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> <b>disease</b> collected through active and passive surveillance from 1 (st) -January 2009 to December, 31, 2011. RESULTS: Alkhurma hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> (AHFV) <b>disease</b> increased from 59 cases in 2009 to 93 cases in 2011. Cases are being discovered outside of the region where it was initially diagnosed in Saudi Arabia. About a third of cases had no direct contact with animals or its products. Almost all cases had gastro-intestinal symptoms. Case fatality rate was less than 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in this study showed the mode of transmission of AHFV virus may not be limited to direct contact with animals or its products. Gastro-intestinal symptoms were not previously documented. Observed low case fatality rate contradicted earlier reports. Close monitoring of the epidemiology of AHFV is recommended to aid appropriate diagnosis. Housewives are advised to wear gloves when handling animals and animal products as a preventive measure...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was {{aimed to develop}} method for determining regional vulnerability index of dengue <b>fever</b> <b>disease</b> and its zone in Indonesia particularly for regional district. The vulnerability index (IK) was developed by combining data on intensity, time series recorded data on the incidences for 3 years consecutively (m), and frequency of dengue's incidences, light (Fr), medium (Fs) and heavy (Fb) incidence. Analysis on distribution of monthly IR showed that the IR's values at probability of 25 %, 75 %, and 99 % are 0. 4, 2. 8 and 30. 1, respectively, where in monthly scale, the light incidence is within a range of 0 2. 8. The slope coefficients of Fr, Fs, and Fb for calculating the IK was determined by averaging the IR's values for the each incidence.  The values of IK were mapped to develop the map of regional vulnerability index or called as Regional Vulnerability Index Zone. The map showed that the most vulnerable region covered big cities particularly those which lie on Java Island and clustered into cluster 3 and 2. Pattern and value of the monthly vulnerability index differ significantly for each cluster.   Key Word: Dengue <b>fever</b> <b>diseases,</b> vulnerability index, vulnerability map</p...|$|R
