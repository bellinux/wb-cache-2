Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at p is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel, {{interactive}} shape modeling technique: Dynamic Implicit Solid Modeling, which unifies volumetric <b>implicit</b> <b>functions</b> and powerful physics-based modeling. Although <b>implicit</b> <b>functions</b> are extremely powerful in graphics, geometric design, and shape modeling, the full potential of <b>implicit</b> <b>functions</b> {{is yet to be}} fully realized {{due to the lack of}} flexible and interactive design techniques. In order to broaden the accessibility of <b>implicit</b> <b>functions</b> in geometric modeling, we marry the implicit solids, which are semi-algebraic sets of volumetric <b>implicit</b> <b>functions,</b> with the principle of physics-based models and formulate dynamic implicit solids. By using “density springs ” to connect the scalar values of <b>implicit</b> <b>functions,</b> we offer a viable solution to introduce the elasticity into implicit representations. As a result, our dynamic implicit solids respond to sculpting forces in a natural and predictive manner. The geometric and physical behaviors are tightly coupled in our modeling system. The flexibility of our modeling technique allows users to easily modify the geometry and topology of sculpted objects, while the inherent physical properties can provide a natural interface for direct, force-based free-from deformation. The additional constraints provide users more control on the dynamic implicit solids. We have developed a sculpting system equipped with a large variety of physics-based toolkits and an intuitive haptic interface to facilitate the direct, natural editing of <b>implicit</b> <b>functions</b> in real-time. Our experiments demonstrate many attractive advantages of our dynamic approach for implicit modeling such as intuitive control, direct manipulation, real-time haptic feedback, and capability to model complicated geometry and arbitrary topology. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Monotone {{comparative}} statics is a sub-field {{of comparative}} statics {{that focuses on}} the conditions under which endogenous variables undergo monotone changes (that is, either increasing or decreasing) when there is a change in the exogenous parameters. [...] Traditionally, comparative results in economics are obtained using the <b>Implicit</b> <b>Function</b> Theorem, an approach that requires the concavity and differentiability of the objective function as well as the interiority and uniqueness of the optimal solution. The methods of monotone comparative statics typically dispense with these assumptions. It focuses on the main property underpinning monotone comparative statics, which is a form of complementarity between the endogenous variable and exogenous parameter. Roughly speaking, a maximization problem displays complementarity if a higher value of the exogenous parameter increases the marginal return of the endogenous variable. This guarantees that the set of solutions to the optimization problem is increasing with respect to the exogenous parameter.|$|E

It was seen that the fusiform gyrus was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well.
