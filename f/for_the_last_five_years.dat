25|$|Since Cambodia {{had had no}} {{official}} population count <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> the country's population figure is merely guesswork, {{which has led to}} incorrect projections of possible voters – making it difficult for the National Election Commission to ascertain the number of actual voters that should be listed in Cambodia's voting rolls. The lack of actual population count could have led to fraudulent voting, such as voters voting in multiple precincts using different names. According to the opposition CNRP, between 1.2 and 1.3 million names were omitted from voting rolls.|$|E
25|$|The film opens {{five years}} after the ending of the first film, with Don (Shah Rukh Khan) narrating the story. The European drug cartel bosses meet in the French Riviera to discuss a new threat {{emerging}} from Asia: Don is jeopardising their business by undercutting their prices, and the bosses decree that Don must die. Living in Thailand <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> he goes to a remote settlement to pick up a shipment of cocaine. Instead of the expected uneventful transaction, Don fights his way out. He returns to Malaysia, surrendering to Roma (Priyanka Chopra), who has joined Interpol, and Inspector Malik (Om Puri). Don is sentenced to death and sent to prison, where he meets old rival Vardhan (Boman Irani). He offers Vardhan a partnership, and they escape from prison after poisoning the other inmates.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 69 he was 'rejuvenated' by the Steinach {{operation}} {{which was}} performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time, Yeats {{was involved in a}} number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock, and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: [...] "I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done". In 1936, he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892–1935.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his career, Messi {{has been}} {{compared}} with his compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the [...] "New Maradona" [...] moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, [...] "Messi is Maradona every day. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico." [...] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays [...] "at {{the level of the}} best Maradona". Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.|$|E
500|$|On 22 April 2010 {{the club}} {{admitted}} {{that it had}} committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> by running a well-organised dual contract and bookkeeping system which left the NRL ignorant of $3.17 million in payments made to players outside of the salary cap, including $550,000 in 2007, $965,000 in 2009 and $1.03 million in 2010. As a result, NRL Chief Executive David Gallop stripped the Melbourne Storm of their 2007 and 2009 Premierships and their 2006, 2007 and 2008 minor Premierships (all of which were withheld, rather than awarded to the runners-up), fined them a then Australian sporting record $1,689,000, deducted all eight Premiership points they had already received in the 2010 season, and barred them from receiving Premiership points {{for the rest of}} the season. The club had won enough matches to make the finals, but automatically finished in last place due to the penalties. The penalty did not have an effect on the players, who remained eligible for Test and State of Origin selection as well as Dally M contention; ultimately, Melbourne did not figure prominently in the latter awards.|$|E

500|$|Tahil's casting was {{considered}} to be controversial, and was slammed by British Asian actors who said the part should have been given to a UK actor, referring to it as [...] "disgraceful". Actors Albert Moses and Renu Setna complained that home-grown talent was being overlooked, with Moses saying, [...] "British Asian actors have been fighting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> to persuade the BBC to bring an Asian family into EastEnders and when at last it happens it goes to Bollywood. It is a disgrace and an insult to British Asian actors. This is a terrible thing for the BBC to do. It should be ashamed." [...] Setna said: [...] "I have heard that for this storyline the BBC has brought over a Bollywood star to play the father. Why, when we have excellent Asian actors of our own?" [...] British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace resident actors capable of doing the same work. A spokesperson for the BBC responded: [...] "After due consideration, Dalip was deemed to be the most appropriate actor for the job." [...] Additionally, it was suggested that Madhur Jaffrey was miscast in the role of Dan's wife Pushpa.|$|E
500|$|The ending {{sequence}} with Pam and Jim in {{the hospital}} was filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center using the Sacred Heart Hospital set from Scrubs. Although the good news Jim and Pam learn {{in the hospital}} was never specifically stated, episode writer Jen Celotta confirmed that the news was that Pam was pregnant; the script included an off-hand question from a nurse to Pam about whether she was pregnant so that viewers would make the connection later. Celotta said {{the idea of the}} pregnancy came as the writers were working on this specific episode, although she felt the show had always been heading in that direction. The series producers considered filming the scene with audible dialogue, but they thought the scene was more powerful without audio and felt actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer [...] "are such great actors and have the ability to convey so much without hearing their dialogue." [...] Celotta said the show's producers have no plans to release the scene with audio. While filming Jim Halpert's emotional reaction to the pregnancy news, Krasinski and director Ken Kwapis discussed the fact that Jim has been surrounded by this camera crew <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> so he would be glad to share this moment with them. The moment when Jim looked directly at the camera, in particular, was meant to convey the idea that he was celebrating the news with the crew. The script did not call for tears, but Krasinski cried naturally as part of his performance.|$|E

2500|$|Current {{authority}} {{could be}} said to still be ambivalent.

2500|$|Before {{rail lines}} were built, {{travellers}} bound from Portland, Oregon for Idaho or the Inland Empire generally went {{by way of}} the Columbia River. [...] This route was like a series of giant stairsteps.

[...] This then required transfer to a portage railroad (first hauled by mules, later by steam engines), which proceeded {{to the top of the}} Cascades. [...] Travellers then boarded another steamboat to proceed up river to the Dalles, where the process would be repeated for a [...] portage around Celilo Falls and the other rapids upriver from the Dalles, which like the Cascades were unnavigable both upstream and downstream. [...] This, the middle river, was the route Hassalo ran on from 1880 to 1888. [...] Hassalo’s first captain on the middle river was Fred Wilson, followed by H.F.
