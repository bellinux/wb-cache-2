Cervical <b>flexion-extension,</b> <b>rotation</b> right and left range of motion was measured pre- and post intervention using an electrogoniometer. Asymptomatic participants (n= 22; n= 10 males; n= 12 females) were recruited using convenience sampling. Eleven participants {{were randomly assigned to}} the experimental group (EG) and eleven to the control group (CG). Prior to receiving the allocated intervention the cervical and upper thoracic spine of each participant was examined for the presence of somatic dysfunction by a registered osteopath. The EG received an upper thoracic manipulation and the CG received a “sham wind up” to the same region (T 1 –T 4). Paired t-tests were used to analyze within-group changes in cervical rotation, flexion and extension. Increased cervical rotation in one direction (right), and flexion was observed following a thoracic thrust manipulation for the EG, demonstrating mean (SD) increase in right rotation of 7. 09 degrees (a ‘moderate’ effect) and 4. 30 degrees (a ‘moderate’ effect) for flexion.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{virtual reality}} (VR) systems, the user's finger and hand {{positions}} are sensed {{and used to}} control the virtual environments. Direct biocontrol of VR environments using surface electromyography (SEMG) signals may be more synergistic and unconstraining to the user. The {{purpose of the present}} investigation was to develop a technique to predict the finger joint angle from the surface EMG measurements of the extensor muscle using neural network models. Methodology SEMG together with the actual joint angle measurements were obtained while the subject was performing <b>flexion-extension</b> <b>rotation</b> of the index finger at three speeds. Several neural networks were trained to predict the joint angle from the parameters extracted from the SEMG signals. The best networks were selected to form six committees. The neural network committees were evaluated using data from new subjects. Results There was hysteresis in the measured SMEG signals during the flexion-extension cycle. However, neural network committees were able to predict the joint angle with reasonable accuracy. RMS errors ranged from 0. 085 ± 0. 036 for fast speed finger-extension to 0. 147 ± 0. 026 for slow speed finger extension, and from 0. 098 ± 0. 023 for the fast speed finger flexion to 0. 163 ± 0. 054 for slow speed finger flexion. Conclusion Although hysteresis was observed in the measured SEMG signals, the committees of neural networks were able to predict the finger joint angle from SEMG signals. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} specific face-mask removal tools during football helmet face-mask retraction using 3 -dimensional (3 -D) video. Design and Setting: Four different tools were used: the anvil pruner (AP), polyvinyl chloride pipe cutters (PVC), Face Mask (FM) Extractor (FME), and Trainer 2 ̆ 7 s Angel (TA). Subjects retracted a face mask once with each tool. Subjects: Eleven certified athletic trainers served as subjects and were recruited from among local sports medicine professionals. Measurements: We analyzed a sample of movement by 3 -D techniques during the retraction process. Movement of the head in 3 planes and time to retract the face mask were also assessed. All results were analyzed with a simple repeated-measures one-way multivariate analysis of variance. An overall efficiency score was calculated for each tool. Results: The AP allowed subjects to perform the face-mask removal task the fastest. Face mask removal with the AP was significantly faster than with the PVC and TA and significantly faster with the TA than the PVC. The PVC and AP created significantly more movement than the FME and TA when planes were combined. No significant differences were noted among tools for <b>flexion-extension,</b> <b>rotation,</b> or lateral flexion. The AP had an efficiency score of 14; FME, 15; TA, 18; and PVC, 35.

40|$|Rationale behind motion {{preservation}} devices is {{to eliminate}} the accelerated adjacent-level effects (ALE) associated with spinal fusion. We evaluated multidirectional flexibilities and ALEs of StabilimaxNZ® and simulated fusion applied to a decompressed spine. StabilimaxNZ® was applied at L 4 –L 5 after creating a decompression (laminectomy of L 4 plus bilateral medial facetectomy at L 4 –L 5). Multidirectional Flexibility and Hybrid tests were performed on six fresh cadaveric human specimens (T 12 –S 1). Decompression increased average <b>flexion–extension</b> <b>rotation</b> to 124. 0 % of the intact. StabilimaxNZ® and simulated fusion decreased the motion to 62. 4 and 23. 8 % of intact, respectively. In lateral bending, corresponding increase was 121. 6 % and decreases were 57. 5 and 11. 9 %. In torsion, corresponding increase was 132. 7 %, and decreases were 36. 3 % for fusion, and none for StabilimaxNZ® ALE was defined as percentage increase over the intact. The ALE at L 3 – 4 was 15. 3 % for StabilimaxNZ® versus 33. 4 % for fusion, while at L 5 –S 1 the ALE were 5. 0 % vs. 11. 3 %, respectively. In lateral bending, the corresponding ALE values were 3. 0 % vs. 19. 1 %, and 11. 3 % vs. 35. 8 %, respectively. In torsion, the corresponding values were 3. 7 % vs. 20. 6 %, and 4. 0 % vs. 33. 5 %, respectively. In conclusion, this in vitro study using Flexibility and Hybrid test methods showed that StabilimaxNZ® stabilized the decompressed spinal level effectively in sagittal and frontal planes, while allowing {{a good portion of}} the normal rotation, and concurrently it did not produce significant ALEs as compared to the fusion.

Summary of Background Data. Assessment of cervical range of motion is {{used to evaluate the}} effect of different treatments, determine impairment, and ascertain the relationship between neck disorders and cervical spine mobility. Methods. Sixty "neck-healthy" volunteers (25 men, 35 women; mean age 38 years, range 22 - 58 years) performed active maximal movements in <b>flexion-extension,</b> <b>rotation,</b> and lateral flexion. Maximal cervical range of: motion was recorded simultaneously with the Zebris and Myrin devices. Intradevice reliability, concurrent validity; intertester comparison, intratester reliability, and intraindividual variability were computed. Results. Our study showed good agreement of full-cycle cervical range of motion measurement between devices, testers, and the test and retest (intraclass correlation [ICC] was > 0. 90 for intradevice reliability, > 0. 93 for concurrent validity, and > 0. 92 for intratester reliability). Method error, assessed with the within-subject coefficient of variation for 95 % of the measurements, was 5. 4 % to 11. 1 % for intradevice reliability, 4. 4 % to 7. 6 % for concurrent validity, 3. 6 % to 7. 6 % for intratester reliability, and 5. 3 % to 9. 9 % for individual variability. Individual variability did not increase with an increased cervical range of motion. Conclusion. Both devices are reliable and showed good agreement. We conclude that the two techniques can be used interchangeably. Our study supports the continued use of the Myrin - a gravity-reference goniometer in routine clinical orthopedic work.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an {{ambulatory}} system for the three-dimensional (3 D) knee kinematics evaluation, which can be used outside a laboratory during long-term monitoring. In order to show the efficacy of this ambulatory system, knee function was analysed using this system, after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion, and after reconstructive surgery. The proposed system was composed of two 3 D gyroscopes, fixed on the shank and on the thigh, and a portable data logger for signal recording. The measured parameters were the 3 D mean range of motion (ROM) and the healthy knee was used as control. The precision of this system was first assessed using an ultrasound reference system. The repeatability was also estimated. A clinical study was then performed on five unilateral ACL-deficient men (range: 19 - 36 years) prior to, and a year after the surgery. The patients were evaluated with the IKDC score and the kinematics measurements were carried out on a 30 m walking trial. The precision in comparison with the reference system was 4. 4 degrees, 2. 7 degrees and 4. 2 degrees for <b>flexion-extension,</b> internal-external <b>rotation,</b> and abduction-adduction, respectively. The repeatability of the results for the three directions was 0. 8 degrees, 0. 7 degrees and 1. 8 degrees. The averaged ROM of the five patients' healthy knee were 70. 1 degrees (standard deviation (SD) 5. 8 degrees), 24. 0 degrees (SD 3. 0 degrees) and 12. 0 degrees (SD 6. 3 degrees for <b>flexion-extension,</b> internal-external <b>rotation</b> and abduction-adduction before surgery, and 76. 5 degrees (SD 4. 1 degrees), 21. 7 degrees (SD 4. 9 degrees) and 10. 2 degrees (SD 4. 6 degrees) 1 year following the reconstruction. The results for the pathologic knee were 64. 5 degrees (SD 6. 9 degrees), 20. 6 degrees (SD 4. 0 degrees) and 19. 7 degrees (8. 2 degrees) during the first evaluation, and 72. 3 degrees (SD 2. 4 degrees), 25. 8 degrees (SD 6. 4 degrees) and 12. 4 degrees (SD 2. 3 degrees) during the second one. The performance of the system enabled us to detect knee function modifications in the sagittal and transverse plane. Prior to the reconstruction, the ROM of the injured knee was lower in <b>flexion-extension</b> and internal-external <b>rotation</b> in comparison with the controlateral knee. One year after the surgery, four patients were classified normal (A) and one almost normal (B), according to the IKDC score, and changes in the kinematics of the five patients remained: lower flexion-extension ROM and higher internal-external rotation ROM in comparison with the controlateral knee.

Thus, an author group evaluated the feasibility, pull-out characteristics, {{and accuracy of}} anterior transpedicular screw (ATPS) fixation. Although first success with clinical application of ATPS has already been reported, no data exist on biomechanical characteristics of an ATPS-plate system enabling transpedicular end-level fixation in advanced instabilities. Therefore, we evaluated biomechanical qualities of an ATPS prototype C 4 –C 7 for reduction of range of motion (ROM) and primary stability in a non-destructive setup among five constructs: anterior plate, posterior all-lateral mass screw construct, posterior construct with lateral mass screws C 5  + C 6 and end-level fixation using pedicle screws unilaterally or bilaterally, and a 360 ° construct. 12 human spines C 3 –T 1 {{were divided into two}} groups. Four constructs were tested in group 1 and three in group 2; the ATPS prototypes were tested in both groups. Specimens were subjected to flexibility test in a spine motion tester at intact state and after 2 -level corpectomy C 5 –C 6 with subsequent reconstruction using a distractable cage and one of the osteosynthesis mentioned above. ROM in <b>flexion–extension,</b> axial <b>rotation,</b> and lateral bending was reported as normalized values. All instrumentations but the anterior plate showed significant reduction of ROM for all directions compared to the intact state. The 360 ° construct outperformed all others in terms of reducing ROM. While {{there were no significant differences}} between the 360 ° and posterior constructs in flexion–extension and lateral bending, the 360 ° constructs were significantly more stable in axial rotation. Concerning primary stability of ATPS prototypes, there were no significant differences compared to posterior-only constructs in <b>flexion–extension</b> and axial <b>rotation.</b> The 360 ° construct showed significant differences to the ATPS prototypes in flexion–extension, while no significant differences existed in axial rotation.

He mentioned that lumbar spinal stenosis is characterized by developmental narrowing of the spinal canal in the mid-sagittal plane and that spondylotic changes may only act as additional constrictive agents [21, 22]. In contrast with this interpretation, the opinion has subsequently emerged that degenerative changes of the bony components of the spinal canal are in most cases the only cause of lumbar spinal stenosis [4, 5, 8]. Furthermore, it is recognised that the dimensions of the spinal canal may change under dynamic conditions, particularly in <b>flexion-extension</b> and <b>rotation</b> movements of the spine [10, 18]. In the 1980 's, CT scanning has significantly contributed to the knowledge of the pathomorphology of lumbar spinal stenosis.

The {{question is how}} well these designs {{can act as a}} functional replacement of the intervertebral disk. Four finite element models were made, for four different design concepts, to determine how well they can mimic the physiological intervertebral disk mechanical function. The four designs were a homogenous elastomer, a multi-stiffness elastomer, an elastomer with fiber jacket, and a hydrogel with fiber jacket. The best material properties of the four models were determined by optimizing the model behavior to match the behavior of the intervertebral disk in <b>flexion-extension,</b> axial <b>rotation,</b> and lateral bending. It was shown that neither a homogeneous elastomer nor a multi-stiffness elastomer could mimic the non-linear behavior within the physiological range of motion. Including a fiber jacket around an elastomer allowed for physiological motion in all degrees of freedom. Replacing the elastomer by a hydrogel yielded similar good behavior. Mimicking the non-linear behavior of the intervertebral disk, in the physiological range of motion is essential in maintaining and restoring spinal motion and in protecting surrounding tissues like the facet joints or adjacent segments.

Purpose: To investigate the effect of rugby league practice and age on active cervical range of motion. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Active cervical range of motion was quantified in 34 Rugby League players and 70 healthy control men (adolescents, 15 - 16 years; young adults, 19 - 25 years; adults, 31 - 45 years) using an optoelectronic motion analyser. Principal plane movements (<b>flexion-extension,</b> axial <b>rotation,</b> lateral bending) and concomitant out-of-plane motions were computed, and compared by factorial analyses of variance. Results: Aging significantly reduced active cervical flexion-extension (from adolescence to adult age: about 15 ° in control participants, 21 ° in rugby players) and lateral bending (from adolescence to adult age: about 6 ° in control participants, 17 ° in rugby players). A trend in motion reduction was observed for axial rotation. Significant reductions were found for concomitant movements in other planes. Rugby league practice significantly modified active cervical lateral bending: during adolescence and young adulthood it had a beneficial effect, increasing the range of motion of 8 - 11 °, but after the third decade of life the effect reversed.

40|$|In human {{movement}} analysis, {{accuracy and}} robustness of the algorithms {{used to determine}} the location of centres of rotation from stereophotogrametric data depend mainly on their capacity to deal with the artefacts due to soft tissue deformation (STA). While evaluating these algorithms using a mathematical simulation approach, effectual realizations of STAs are needed. This study aimed at accomplishing this objective by modelling STAs, in twelve selected areas of the thigh, as a linear function of the hip angles, assuming no knee joint movement. The proposed model was calibrated and assessed using ex-vivo experiments. This entailed that only the component of the STA due to skin stretching was accounted for. Photogrammetric data of markers placed on the skin and on hip-bone and femur pins were recorded during passive <b>flexion-extension,</b> ab-adduction, <b>rotation</b> and circumduction of the hip joint. Artefact skin marker displacements were represented in a femur embedded anatomical frame.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate possible differences in the physical abilities of the cervical spines of helicopter pilots and rear aircrew with and without neck pain during the previous year. Methods: The study included 61 male helicopter pilots and 22 rear aircrew without neck pain (Sx-) and 17 pilots and 17 rear aircrew with neck pain (Sx+). Active cervical range of motion (<b>flexion-extension,</b> right-left <b>rotation,</b> and right-left lateral flexion), neck position sense (reposition error back to neutral and defined positions after submaximal cervical movement), and maximum isometric neck muscle strength (flexion, extension, and right and left lateral flexion) were measured. Two-way factorial analyses of variance were performed, in which the fixed factors were occupation (pilot or rear aircrew) and neck pain state (Sx+ or Sx-). Results: On average, there was a trend toward lower values in strength [extension: 55 (19) Nm vs. 58 (20) Nm; flexion 22 (8) Nm vs. 24 (12) NmJ and smaller cervical range of motion [flexion-extension: 132 degrees (19 degrees) vs. 137 degrees (15 degrees); rotation: 156 degrees (14 degrees) vs. 160 degrees (14 degrees) ] in the total Sx+ crew, compared to their Sx- colleagues.

Finite element models used to investigate injury mechanisms often fail {{to examine the effects}} of variation in geometry or material properties on mechanical behavior. The goals of this study were to model geometric variation for a set of cervical spines, to extend this model to a parametric finite element model, and, as a first step, to validate the parametric model against experimental data for low-loading conditions. Individual finite element models were created using cervical spine (C 3 -T 1) CT data for five male cadavers. Statistical shape modeling was used to generate a parametric finite element model incorporating variability of spine geometry, and soft tissue material property variation was also included. The probabilistic loading response of the parametric model was determined under <b>flexion-extension,</b> axial <b>rotation,</b> and lateral bending and validated by comparison to experimental data. Based on qualitative and quantitative comparison of the experimental loading response and model simulations, we suggest that the model performs adequately under relatively low-level loading conditions in multiple loading directions. In conclusion, statistical shape modeling methods coupled with finite element analyses within a probabilistic framework, along with the ability to statistically validate the overall model performance, provide innovative and important steps towards describing the differences in vertebral morphology, spinal curvature, and variation in material properties. We suggest that these methods, with additional investigation and validation under injurious loading conditions, will lead to understanding and mitigating the risks of injury in the spine and other musculoskeletal structures...|$|R

Spatio-temporal parameters and synthetic indexes (Arm Variable Score, AVS and Arm Profile Score, APS) were calculated and compared with those of age-matched healthy individuals. Kinematic data were correlated with the EDSS score and clinical tests such as the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT) and hand-grip strength (HGS). Findings PwMS exhibit reduced velocity, increased movement duration, sway of adjusting and frequency of direction changes as well as higher APS values (15. 4 ° vs. 8. 6 °, P < 0. 001) with respect to controls due to alterations in trunk flexion-extension, shoulder abduction-adduction, <b>flexion-extension</b> and <b>rotation</b> and elbow <b>flexion-extension.</b> Moderate-to-large correlations were found between APS and EDSS (rho = 0. 609, P < 0. 001), NHPT (rho = 0. 468, P = 0. 03) and HGS (rho = − 0. 627 P < 0. 001). Interpretation The kinematic analysis of HTM provides useful information in quantifying UL impairments in pwMS. The APS index appears suitable to represent UL movement deviations from the physiological pattern in pwMS and to assess disease progression or effectiveness of pharmacologic and rehabilitative treatments effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of gait abnormalities in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) represents {{a key factor}} in evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatments. Despite the availability of sophisticated equipment to objectively evaluate the kinematic aspects of gait, there are still some difficulties in processing the large and complex amount of data they produce in the daily clinical routine. On the basis of the above-mentioned considerations we propose a novel characterization of gait kinematics in individuals with MS, based on a single measure (Gait Profile Score, GPS) obtained from a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of gait performed using an opto-electronic system. We also investigated the correlation between GPS and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) values. Thirty-four patients suffering from relapsing-remitting MS (13 female, 21 male, mean age 46. 7 years) with an EDSS score of ≤ 6 underwent a gait analysis from which the GPS index was calculated. Their results were compared with those of a control group of healthy age- and gender-matched subjects. The GPS of individuals with MS was found significantly higher with respect to controls (9. 12 ° vs. 5. 67 °, p < 0. 001) as the result of kinematic differences in gait patterns referring to pelvic tilt and <b>rotation,</b> hip <b>flexion-extension</b> and <b>rotation,</b> knee <b>flexion-extension</b> and ankle dorsi- and plantar-flexion. A moderate correlation was also found between the EDSS score of the participants and their GPS values (r = 0. 63, p < 0. 001). The GPS index thus appears suitable to represent gait deviations from physiological patterns in individuals affected by MS and potentially useful in assessing the outcomes related both to rehabilitation programs and pharmacologic/physical therapies...|$|R
40|$|To extend {{an already}} {{existing}} three-dimensional (3 -D) {{model of the}} shoulder (Van der Helm, 1994) a cadaver study was performed in which quantitative information on the 3 -D orientations of rotation axes in the upper extremity was collected. To calculate axes, we measured the glenohumeral, humeroulnar and ulnoradial movements on five human cadaver arms (four right arms, one left). Movement was measured with an electromagnetic tracking system which sensors were directly attached to scapula, humerus, ulna and radius. In addition, a series of anatomical landmarks was measured. From the tracking data, the Instantaneous Helical Axes (IHA) were calculated, {{as well as the}} resulting optimal mean Gleno-Humeral (GH) center of <b>rotation,</b> <b>Flexion-Extension</b> (FE) axis and Pronation-Supination (PS) axis. To allow {{for the construction of a}} musculoskeletal model, anatomical landmarks, were transformed from the global measurement co-ordinate system to separate local co-ordinate systems, related to the rotation center and axes of rotation. The FE- and PS-axis could be determined accurately and were found to be almost perpendicular (88. 9 ± 5. 1 °) and crossed at 3. 3 ± 0. 8 mm. It is suggested that forearm movements can be modelled with a two Degree-of-Freedom model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Effect of Fixation Plate Length on Spinal Instability Following Anterior Cervical Plate Fixation for the Repair of in Vitro Flexion-Distraction Injuries Introduction: Anterior {{cervical}} decompression and fusion {{with a plate}} (ACDFP) is {{a commonly}} performed treatment following a traumatic injury to the subaxial cervical spine. The purpose of the presented work {{was to determine the}} biomechanical effect of plate length on cervical spine kinematic stability following ACDFP stabilization for a simulated traumatic injury. Methods: Eleven fresh-frozen cadaveric C 5 -C 6 and C 6 -C 7 motion segments were examined in this study. To assess kinematics, flexibility testing was performed on each specimen using a spinal loading simulator. A testing protocol was designed to assess the kinematics of the following conditions: i) preinjury, ii) simulated soft tissue injury (both facet capsules, ½ of the ligamentum flavum, and 2 / 3 of the annulus were sectioned along with an induced rotation to a unilateral facet perch), iii) ACDFP with 22. 5 mm plate fixation, and iv) ACDFP with 32. 5 mm fixation. Kinematic range of motion (ROM) data was collected and analyzed for motions of <b>flexion-extension,</b> axial <b>rotation,</b> and lateral bending. Results: The injury produced significantly greater motion than the pre-injury state; with the greatest increase in motion occurring for axial rotation. Both plates were successful in significantly reducing the ROM (for all motion types) below the injured condition and {{there were no significant differences}} in the change in ROM between the two plate sizes. Furthermore, in flexion-extension, both plates also significantly reduced the ROM below that of the intact condition. Discussion and Conclusions: The results would suggest that the simulated injury was successful in generating spinal instability consistent with the intended injury. The position of the plate in the frontal plane is responsible for impeding the flexion-extension ROM below the motions experienced by the intact condition. Finally, there were no differences between plate sizes for any of the measured motions. Therefore, we advise the use of smallest plates suitable to avoid the theoretical risk of adjacent level degeneration...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this project}} was to study the {{fretting}} behaviour of the cemented femoral stem fixation of a total hip prosthesis, trying to capture the loss of contact between the femoral stem and polymetylmethacrilate cement fixation. To have a landmark, studies were performed compared with cementless fixation, where no fretting phenomenon occurs, on real prostheses, under biological 3 D loading conditions. A fatigue test device, installed on a servo-hydraulic triaxial dynamic testing machine was used. It allowed monitoring the <b>flexion-extension,</b> abduction-adduction, inner-outer <b>rotation</b> movements, and the variation of the torsional torque, depending on normal loading. The test ends when the sample does not fail after 2000000 cycles, or when it has reached a predetermined number of cycles. Test fluid medium used was NaCl mixed with distilled water, a favourable environment for appearance of fretting corrosion. After the failure of stem fixation at 2450000 cycles, the mantle of bone cement remaining adherent on femoral stem was removed. Microscopic inspection of the femoral stem and of the inner part of the polymetylmethacrilate mantle demonstrated the existence of corrosion of the femoral stem surface beneath the cement mantle, and Fe 2 O 3 deposits on the femoral stem surface and on the inner part of the mantle...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} neck {{range of}} movement recording using three different methods goniometers (EGM), inclinometers (INC) and a three-dimensional video analysis system (IMG) in simultaneous and synchronized data collection. Twelve females performed neck <b>flexion-extension,</b> lateral flexion, <b>rotation</b> and circumduction. The differences between EGM, INC, and IMG were calculated sample by sample. For flexion-extension movement, IMG underestimated the amplitude by 13 %; moreover, EGM showed a crosstalk of about 20 % for lateral flexion and rotation axes. In lateral flexion movement, all systems showed similar amplitude and the inter-system differences were moderate (4 - 7 %). For rotation movement, EGM showed a high crosstalk (13 %) for flexion-extension axis. During the circumduction movement, IMG underestimated the amplitude of flexion-extension movements by about 11 %, and the inter-system differences were high (about 17 %) except for INC-IMG regarding lateral flexion (7 %) and EGM-INC regarding flexion-extension (10 %). For application in workplace, INC presents good results compared to IMG and EGM though INC cannot record rotation. EGM should be improved {{in order to reduce}} its crosstalk errors and allow recording of the full neck {{range of movement}}. Due to non-optimal positioning of the cameras for recording flexion-extension, IMG underestimated the amplitude of these movements. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{number of}} total knee {{replacements}} being performed worldwide is undergoing an unprecedented increase. Hinged total knee replacements, used in complex salvage and revision procedures, currently {{account for a}} small but growing proportion of prostheses implanted. Modern hinged prostheses share the same basic configuration, allowing <b>flexion–extension</b> and tibial <b>rotation.</b> One aspect on which designs differ is the anteroposterior location of the hinge. A more posterior hinge is designed to increase the patellar tendon moment arm, reducing the quadriceps force required for a given activity and benefiting the patient. Five commonly used total knee replacements were evaluated in terms of quadriceps force and patellar tendon moment arm using a laboratory-based rig. Significant differences were identified between the five prostheses in quadriceps force and patellar tendon moment arm. Analysis of the correlation between these two parameters indicates that while patellar tendon moment arm influences quadriceps force, {{it is not the only}} factor. Also important is the lever function of the patella, and it is suggested here that the non-physiological nature of the prosthetic patellofemoral geometry may result in unnatural joint function. Thus, a thorough understanding of the resulting kinematic function of hinged total knee replacements is becoming increasingly important in complex revision total knee replacement to meet rising patient expectations and functional demands...|$|R
40|$|The {{elbow joint}} {{is a complex}} {{articulation}} composed of the humeroulnar and humeroradial joints (for flexion-extension movement) and the proximal radioulnar articulation (for pronation-supination movement). During the flexion-extension movement of the elbow joint, the rotation center changes and this articulation cannot be truly represented as a simple hinge joint. The main goal of this project is to design and assemble a medical rehabilitation exoskeleton for the elbow with one degree of freedom for <b>flexion-extension,</b> using the <b>rotation</b> center for proper patient elbow joint articulation. Compared with the current solutions, which align the exoskeleton axis with the elbow axis, this offers an ergonomic physical human-robot interface with a comfortable interaction. The exoskeleton is actuated with shape memory alloy wire-based actuators having minimum rigid parts, for guiding the actuators. Thanks to this unusual actuation system, the proposed exoskeleton is lightweight and has low noise in operation with a simple design 3 D-printed structure. Using this exoskeleton, these advantages will improve the medical rehabilitation process of patients that suffered stroke and will influence how their lifestyle will change to recover from these diseases and improve their ability with activities of daily living, thanks to brain plasticity. The exoskeleton {{can also be used}} to evaluate the real status of a patient, with stroke and even spinal cord injury, thanks to an elbow movement analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Postural control tests like {{standing}} and sitting stabilometry {{are widely used}} to evaluate neuromuscular control related to trunk balance in low back pain patients. Chronic low back pain patients have lesser postural control compared to healthy subjects. Few studies have assessed the reproducibility of the centre of pressure deviations and to our knowledge no studies have investigated the reproducibility of three-dimensional kinematics of postural control tests in a low back pain population. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the test-retest reproducibility of a seated postural control test in low back pain patients. Methods Postural control in low back pain patients was registered by a three dimensional motion analysis system combined with a force plate. Sixteen chronic low back pain patients having complaints for at least six months, were included based on specific clinical criteria. Every subject performed 4 postural control tests. Every test was repeated 4 times and lasted 40 seconds. The force plate registered the deviations of the centre of pressure. A Vicon- 612 -datastation, equipped with 7 infra-red M 1 camera's, was used to track 13 markers attached to the torso and pelvis in order to estimate their angular displacement in the 3 cardinal planes. Results All Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) calculated for the force plate variables did not exceed 0. 73 (ranging between 0. 11 and 0. 73). As for the torso, ICC's of the mean <b>flexion-extension</b> and <b>rotation</b> angles ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 93 and of the mean lateral flexion angle from 0. 50 to 0. 67. For the pelvis the ICC of the mean flexion-extension angle varied between 0. 66 and 0. 83, the mean lateral flexion angle between 0. 16 and 0. 81 and the mean rotation angle between 0. 40 and 0. 62. Consecutive data suggest that the low test-retest reproducibility is probably due to a learning effect. Conclusion The test-retest reproducibility of these postural control tests in an unstable sitting position can globally be considered as rather moderate. In order to improve the test-retest reproducibility, a learning period may be advisable at the beginning of the test. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether peripheral muscle strength is significantly different between lean and obese women controlled for age and physical activity, using an allometric approach. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of isometric handgrip and isokinetic leg and trunk muscle strength. SUBJECTS: 173 obese (age 39. 9 +/- 11. 4 y, {{body mass index}} (BMI) 37. 8 +/- 5. 3 kg/m(2)) and 80 lean (age 39. 7 +/- 12. 2 y, BMI 22. 0 +/- 2. 2 kg/m(2)) women. MEASUREMENTS: Anthropometric measures (weight, height) and body composition (bioelectrical impedance method), isometric handgrip (maximal voluntary contraction on the Jamar dynamometer), isokinetic trunk <b>flexion-extension,</b> trunk <b>rotation,</b> and knee <b>flexion-extension</b> (Cybex dynamometers). RESULTS: Absolute isokinetic strength output (that is, strength uncorrected for fat-free mass) was larger in obese compared to lean women, except for knee flexion and isometric handgrip, which {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 05). Pearson correlation coefficients between strength measures and fat-free mass (kg) were low to moderate both in lean (r= 0. 28 - 0. 53, P< 0. 05) and in obese (r= 0. 29 - 0. 49, P< 0. 001) women. There was no correlation with fat mass (kg) in the lean, whereas in the obese women a weak positive relation could be observed for most isokinetic data (r= 0. 21 - 0. 39, P< 0. 01). When correcting for fat-free mass (raised to the optimal exponent determined by allometric scaling), all strength measurements were at least 6 % lower in obese when compared to the lean women, except for trunk flexion, which was at least 8 % stronger in obese women. DISCUSSION: The higher absolute knee extension strength measures of leg and the similar extension strength of the trunk in the obese sample compared to the lean might be explained by the training effect of weight bearing and support of a larger body mass. However when the independent effect of fat-free mass is removed, these strength measures, as well as oblique abdominal muscle and handgrip strength, turned out to be lower in obese women. These observations could be the reflection of the overall impairment of physical fitness as a consequence of obesity and its metabolic complications. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Using a {{three-dimensional}} motion analyzer (Vicon MX, Vicon Motion System Inc., Oxford, UK), the coordinates of infrared reflective markers attached to subjects’ bodies were recorded between 40 [*]ms {{before and after}} foot contact. A previous study showed that ACL ruptures occur within 40 [*]ms (Koga et al. 2010), so this timeframe was used for kinematic analyses in this study. The reference position for these measurements was obtained during the static standing trial. The moment the GRF appeared was considered as the landing. Maximal knee angular displacements (<b>flexion–extension,</b> abduction–adduction, internal–external <b>rotations),</b> anterior tibial translation, and peak GRF were compared between the single and dual task. Sixteen infrared cameras (MX-T 20, Vicon Motion System Inc., Oxford, UK) surrounded the subject, and the sampling frequency was set to 100 [*]Hz. Twenty-three markers (14 [*]mm) were attached following a point cluster technique (Andriacchi et al. 1998). A force-plate was synchronized with this system, and GRF during each movement was measured at a 1000 -Hz sampling frequency. Wireless surface electrodes (Trigno Lab, Delsys, Inc., Boston, USA) were also synchronized with the three-dimensional motion analyzer to measure electromyographic activity of six muscles (vastus medialis, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, biceps femoris, and gluteus medialis). Electromyographic activity was evaluated as the integral during the 40 [*]ms before and after initial foot contact. Sites of surface electrode attachment followed a previous study (Rainoldi et al. 2004). The markers and surface electrodes were only attached to the leg being measured.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} neck mechanism for humanoid robots. The research was conducted within the project which is developing a humanoid robot Marko that represents assistive apparatus in the physical therapy for children with cerebral palsy. There are two basic ways for the neck realization of the robots. The first is based on low backlash mechanisms that have high stiffness and the second one based on the viscoelastic elements having variable flexibility. We suggest low backlash differential gear mechanism that requires small actuators. Based on the kinematic-dynamic requirements a dynamic model of the robots upper body is formed. Dynamic simulation for several positions of the robot was performed and the driving torques of neck mechanism are determined. Realized neck has 2 DOFs and enables movements {{in the direction of}} <b>flexion-extension</b> 100 °, <b>rotation</b> ± 90 ° and the combination of these two movements. It consists of a differential mechanism with three spiral bevel gears of which the two are driving and are identical, and the third one which is driven gear to which the robot head is attached. Power transmission and motion from the actuators to the input links of the differential mechanism is realized with two parallel placed gear mechanisms that are identical. Neck mechanism has high carrying capacity and reliability, high efficiency, low backlash that provide high positioning accuracy and repeatability of movements, compact design and small mass and dimensions...|$|R
