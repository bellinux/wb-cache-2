40|$|There exists some {{uncertainty}} at present, in {{the formulation}} of civil defense doctrine, as to whether it is advisable for window curtains to be closed or open during nuclear attack. Closed curtains would be in position to intercept some major portion, or all, of the thermal radiation pulse that would otherwise enter through the window and ignite kindling fuels within the room. But because they did so they would probably ignite and the flaming curtains, propelled into the room by the blast wave, could represent an even more serious <b>ignition</b> <b>hazard</b> than would occur if the window remained uncovered, and the curtains uninvolved.

40|$|Abstract. Magnesium alloys {{have been}} {{increasingly}} used in automotive and aerospace components and in portable microelectronic devices {{due to their}} “ultralightness ” and high specific strength. Machining is an important method used to process magnesium alloys. The advantages of machining over other processing methods such as die casting include reduction in power consumption and excellent surface finish. However, the ignition of chips presents a dangerous problem during machining. This problem has attracted considerable research interests. Though coolants can be used effectively to prevent ignition, the pollution of environment and reclamation of chips can not be resolved easily. Therefore, one better approach is to control the machining parameters for minimizing <b>ignition</b> <b>hazard</b> of magnesium alloy chips during dry machining. A systematic study was conducted for a few different magnesium alloys (including AM 50 A and AZ 91 D) to understand effect of cutting parameters (cutting speed, feedrate and depth of cut) on ignition of chips during face milling. It is interesting to find that for any fixed cut depth ignition in the forms of sparks, flares or ring of fire occurs only in the moderate cutting speeds and feedrates and can thus be easily prevented by adopting either higher or lower cutting speeds or feedrates. Chips produced in different machining conditions were collected and their morphology was analyzed to understand mechanisms of ignition...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{electrically}} insulating synthetic materials, such as plastics, for fuel pipelines and other fuel handling components is now becoming widespread. In {{the case of}} buried or underground pipelines in filling station forecourts {{the use of these}} materials offers superior corrosion resistance and increased longevity. This in turn reduces the risk of pollution due to fuel leakage. It is well reported that the flow of fuel under certain conditions in metal pipes can produce significant levels of electrostatic charge on the fuel. Little work however has been undertaken on plastic pipe where charge can accumulate at the fuel/pipe wall interface. This paper reports on tests performed on a full-scale, high-density, polyethylene pipework system.

However, the viewpoint of ignition as a statistical phenomenon appears to be more consistent with the inherent variability in engineering test data.

A mathematical model, based on solutions of the fluid flow equations, is described, with a prescribed probability density function (p. d. f.) approach {{used to determine the}} distribution of conserved scalar quantities. Three distributions are explored, and their ability to simulate experimental data in jet and wake flows, in isolation of fluid flow calculations, is tested. A composite p. d. f.

Coupling of this p. d. f. with flow field calculations yields reasonable predictions of scalar p. d. f. ’s in a methane jet, with probabilities of ignition implied from measured and predicted p. d. f. ’s being in close accord.
