Wreck-It Ralph, the antagonist of the game Fix-It Felix Jr., is ostracized by his game's characters for <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> his job, while the titular hero Felix is praised. Tired of being mistreated, Ralph announces at the game's thirtieth anniversary party that he will earn his neighbors' respect by winning a medal.|$|E

Merlo arrived in the Mexican capital with a fake Uruguayan passport, where he soon realized that the Mexican security forces were following him. He thought they were <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> basic surveillance on him {{to see if he}} was doing any illegal activity in Mexican territory.|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} {{formative}} years, the sōsaku-hanga movement, {{like many other}} art movements such as the shin-hanga movement, futurism and proletarian art movement, struggled to survive, experiment and sought a voice in an art scene dominated by mainstream arts that were well received by the Bunten. Hanga in general (including shin-hanga) did not achieve the status of Western oil paintings (yōga) in Japan. Hanga was considered as a craft that was inferior to paintings and sculptures. Ukiyo-e woodblock prints had always been considered as mere reproductions for mass commercial consumption, {{as opposed to the}} European view of ukiyo-e as art, during the climax of Japonisme. It was impossible for sōsaku-hanga artists to make a living by <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> creative prints. Many of the later renowned sōsaku-hanga artists, such as Kōshirō Onchi (also known as the father of the creative print movement), were book illustrators and wood carvers. It was not until 1927 that hanga was accepted by the Teiten (the former Bunten). In 1935, extracurricular classes on hanga were finally permitted.|$|E
25|$|During the Korean War, a Chinese army {{offensive}} {{broke through}} the UN lines in January 1951 and was rapidly advancing south. The South Korean army was ordered to burn all of the buildings in the Odae Mountains in order to deny shelter to the advancing Chinese troops. WolJeong Temple could be seen burning when a squad of South Korean soldiers arrived at Sangwon Temple. Explaining their mission, they ordered everyone to pack what they could and leave immediately. Instead, Hanam Sunim returned to the Dharma Hall, put on his formal robe, and, sitting down, told the lieutenant {{to go ahead and}} burn the buildings. Hanam Sunim then told the lieutenant that his since his job was to stay with the temple, and the lieutenant's was to burn it, there would be no conflict(or bad karma) because they were both <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> their job. The lieutenant couldn't get Hanam Sunim to leave, and so at great risk to himself (for disobeying orders in wartime) he instead piled all of the wooden doors and window shutters in the courtyard and burned those instead. In this way, Sangwon Temple {{was one of the few}} temples in this area to survive the war.|$|E

500|$|David Morrissey portrayed Colonel Brandon. The actor {{was sent}} the script by his agent, and he {{initially}} questioned whether another Austen adaptation was needed. However, he then {{read the script}} {{and thought it was}} [...] "just brilliant", especially as Davies had added more scenes featuring the male characters. Dominic Cooper took on the role of John Willoughby, Brandon's rival for Marianne's affections. Describing his character, Cooper said [...] "The way I tried to persuade myself he wasn't too bad was that he's a 25-year-old young guy and he genuinely falls in love with Marianne – he's not <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> it for one moment in time."

Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There was {{an awful lot of}} soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all. And I'm deliberately just writing down all the positive things that I hear or see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beyond the Sea" [...] {{was written}} by The X-Files co-executive {{producers}} and long-time writing partners, Glen Morgan and James Wong; it was their fourth script for the series. The episode was directed by David Nutter. As Morgan and Wong explained, their episode was written in response to criticisms of the show's initially limited characterization of Scully. Wong said, [...] "Gillian Anderson needed to show off her talents more, {{and this was a}} perfect opportunity to dispel those notions that Scully will never believe. It was time for the character to grow, because she was <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> {{the same kind of thing}} too often." [...] Executives at Fox vetoed the idea two times before Carter told the network, [...] "we're doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|On the game's multiplayer, IGN's Stapleton {{reported}} low player {{counts in}} matches, long wait times in lobbies, server disconnection and occasional crashes. [...] "Because of that," [...] he wrote, [...] "I can't strongly recommend ... the multiplayer experience alone". VideoGamer.com found online character progression streamlined {{by comparison with}} the original version. According to them, the [...] "grind of <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> PvP until co-op Jobs arrive with regularity" [...] was lost, and newcomers would likely find multiplayer enjoyable and balanced. However, they wrote of frequent server disconnection, especially during load screens. GameSpot's Walton thought that Grand Theft Auto Online [...] "still suffers {{from a lack of}} direction" [...] for its open-ended and frenetic gameplay, but still is fun. Game Informers Reiner reported [...] "minimal lag or issues in the expanded firefights and races".|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E

As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> a cameo. We just had a really good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But we just had a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E
