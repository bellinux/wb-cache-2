50|$|Until 2011, {{there were}} four stages of ECyD, {{each with its own}} <b>theme,</b> <b>symbol,</b> and commitments. Entrance into each stage was called “Incorporation” and usually took place within a Mass. These {{incorporations}} were usually offered at ECyD retreats or summer conventions. After participants had made their commitment, they were given the symbol for their stage. All the stages required daily prayers, biweekly confession, communion with other ECYD members, and monthly apostolic work. The commitments progressively grew according to teens ages adding items like a Gospel reflection and conscience exam. These stages were changed as part of a general review of ECyD.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{emotional}} responses of mothers {{to their children}} with learning difficulties were identified and explored. A narrative research design was used to capture a chapter in the life stories of eleven mothers whose children were attending a school specialising in ‘remedial’ education, relating their experiences and emotional responses regarding their child’s learning difficulties. Data was collected by means of individual interviews, letters from the mothers, field notes {{in the form of}} journal entries written by the researcher, as well as individual feedback and collaboration sessions with the mothers. Data was analysed by means of several phases of theme analysis, after which, through a final analysis, 18 emotional <b>response</b> <b>themes</b> were identified. Three emotional <b>response</b> <b>themes</b> were identified as exception themes. The 18 emotional <b>response</b> <b>themes,</b> along with the three exception themes, were then clustered around joyful, sad, fearful and angry emotional response categories. After feedback and collaboration sessions, the themes were then further interpreted through a final level of analysis to weave a narrative of mothers’ emotional responses to their child with learning difficulties. This study found that mothers experience complex emotions in response to their child with learning difficulties. The strongest emotional <b>response</b> <b>themes</b> that emerged, which were reported by all the mothers were frustration, happiness and love. The more positive emotional responses were mentioned in relation to their child being accepted at the school specialising in ‘remedial’ education, as well as to an increased understanding of their child’s learning difficulties. Mothers mentioned that they experienced frustration and a lack of support as regards being helped to understand their child’s learning difficulties better. It was thus found that an understanding of their child’s learning difficulties appeared to be related to a decrease in negative emotional responses and an increase in more positive emotional responses. All the mothers in the study indicated an emotional response of love towards their child with learning difficulties. Dissertation (MEd (Educational Psychology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2005.

40|$|Current {{evidence}} on ageing and states of awareness in memory tasks is mixed. In all cases, {{there is an}} age-related decline in memory accompanied by recollective experience (remember responses); however, for memory {{in the absence of}} recollective experience (know responses), there is no effect of age in some experiments but an increase with age in others. This paper presents data from a tune recognition experiment (Maylor, 1991) in which subjects were not explicitly asked to make remember/know decisions. Here, these states of awareness are inferred from subjects' responses. Middle-aged and elderly volunteers listened to theme tunes from television programmes; if they recognized the tune, they were asked to provide as much information about the programme as possible. Age significantly influenced remember <b>responses</b> (<b>theme</b> tune familiar plus some information about the programme reported) but not know <b>responses</b> (<b>theme</b> tune familiar but no information about the programme reported). Thus the analysis provides further converging evidence that knowing can remain invariant across manipulations that reduce the level of remembering...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the significance of}} suburban commuter imagery in a selection of screen visions of mid-century modernity. A number of examples, including Mad Men, and the screen adaptations of The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit (1956) and Revolutionary Road (2008), will be shown to echo key <b>themes,</b> <b>symbols</b> and scenes in their depictions of suburbia and the cultural impact of the corporation. Taken together, these narratives indicate the resilience of the “Organization Man” (Whyte 1956) as a figure marking the tension between individualism and conformity. It is this tension that the archetypal businessman’s uniform continues to symbolise in popular culture, even if, as this paper will argue, {{it is no longer}} the most fitting expression available. </span...|$|R
40|$|John Ernst Steinbeck Jr. wrote sixteen novels, seven non-fiction {{books and}} five short stories {{throughout}} his life. He won a Pulitzer Prize and a Nobel Prize for Literature in his career. Of Mice and Men and Cannery Row {{are the two}} of the widely-known novels of the author concerning the research question: To what extent are the novels Of Mice and Men and Cannery Row, both by John Steinbeck {{parallel to each other}} in their <b>themes,</b> <b>symbols</b> and historical features? By a careful scrutiny, it is seen that both of these novels approach and investigate many important themes. Of Mice and Men handles the themes of dreams, friendship and family, loneliness, views about women, outsiders and survival of the fittest; likewise the novel Cannery Row analyzes the themes of outsiders, family, friendship and humanity, loneliness, prostitution and views about women. Moreover, the links between these two novels with their symbols are analyzed. The related symbols of the novels, reflected by the characters, settings and objects cover a great place in Steinbeck’s depictions. The linkages between the historical backgrounds of these best-sellers are surveyed with the use of external resource. Both of these novels revolve around 1930 s, in the time of Great Depression and World War 2, and it is seen that the profound effects of this period are expressed in these novels. Dreadful effects of this historical chaos can be examined in both of them. In conclusion, by the deep examining of these novels, it is observed that Cannery Row and Of Mice and Men, both by John Steinbeck are closely related to each other with their <b>themes,</b> <b>symbols</b> and historical features...|$|R
5000|$|Emotional {{branding}} uses {{a series}} of <b>themes</b> and <b>symbols</b> to create meaning for a consumer. In this sense, [...] "theme" [...] means a concept or story line that is present throughout an ad, and if integrated well-enough, throughout the brand. A [...] "symbol" [...] {{is representative of the}} theme. Vance Packard's The Hidden Persuaders suggests that the symbol represents a promise and consumers buy the promise. The text reads, [...] "The cosmetic manufacturers are not selling Lanolin, they are selling hope. We no longer buy oranges, we buy vitality. We do not buy just an auto, we buy prestige." [...] As suggested in Edward Bernays' The Engineering of Consent, Themes must appeal to human motivations in order to be successful. Motivation lies deep with a person's subconscious desires to achieve or meet certain goals. Bernays suggests that there is an extensive list of factors that drive motivation based on both ideological values and personal experience. There are a few techniques used with symbolism. The first is making the <b>theme</b> and <b>symbol</b> of a brand continuously publicized. The second technique is making sure that the <b>theme</b> and <b>symbol</b> hold substance and promote a specific idea about the company. The company symbol needs to be adaptable to a changing society while standing firmly as a set of values. Symbols can represent multiple themes simultaneously, as suggested by Bernays. For example, a kitten can represent both playfulness and comfort. Symbols provide a promise for a sense of fulfillment associated with their brand. Vance Packard highlights the eight hidden needs that consumers have that <b>themes</b> and <b>symbols</b> attempt to sell. The eight needs are as follows: ...|$|R

40|$|The study’s {{controlling}} {{question is}} to determine the extent millennialism as an intellectual movement informed the thinking of Colonial America. The evidence gathered suggests a kind of smorgasbord with no uniform thought. What can be deduced from the literature, however, is the fluidity of millennialism and its ability to adapt and contort to the political ideology of the era. Moreover, millennialism provided a sense of purpose for the American continent with the Great Awakening serving as the legitimizing movement which both popularized and diffused the millennium. From the 1750 s, American millennialism began its evolution from a spiritual consummation of all things to a more politicized millennium, mirroring England. By the time of the Revolution, millennial <b>themes,</b> <b>symbols,</b> and language dominated the American continent far more than Whig ideology...|$|R

25|$|The Flushing Meadows {{site was}} {{selected}} in 1959 for the 1964 World's Fair. Gilmore D. Clarke and Michael Rapuano were retained to tailor the original 1939 park layout {{for the new}} fair. Three structures were retained from the 1939 Fair. Meanwhile, several new structures and attractions were created including the Unisphere, Shea Stadium, the New York Hall of Science, and Queens Botanical Garden; the latter three were intended as permanent attractions for the future park. The Unisphere, built as the <b>theme</b> <b>symbol</b> for the 1964/1965 World's Fair, has since become the main sculptural feature of the park. It stands on the site occupied by the Perisphere during the earlier Fair. The Van Wyck Expressway was extended north through the park site, along the right-of-way of the former World's Fair Railroad.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the {{presentation}} of a typology of rural imagery based on a thematic and interpretative analysis of Polish and Czech literary texts from the 1960 s {{with respect to the}} ongoing changes made to the original romantic-realist concept of the rural novel. The analysis of specific literary works (Sekyra by Ludvík Vaculík, Smuteční slavnost by Eva Kantůrková, and Čas kopřiv by Josef Knap from Czech literature, and, from Polish literature, Opadaný sad by Wiesław Myśliwski, the novels Na slunci by Julian Kawalec and … až budeš králem, až budeš katem… by Tadeusz Nowak) permits us to create a basic register of elements of rural narrativity which, however, Czech and Polish literatures have different perspectives on. Through this dichotomy we present typical narratives contained in the Czech and Polish rural novel of the given period. The subsequent interpretative analysis of the texts takes inspiration from contemporary narratology with special attention to the narrator and time categories, and by extension to the interplay of these categories with individual <b>themes,</b> <b>symbols</b> and topoi...|$|R
