5|$|At {{the first}} {{race of the}} season in Melbourne, Webber {{qualified}} in 7th place and held that position for {{the early part of the}} race, managing to finish in 13th position after the RB3 suffered from a throttle-related malfunction and a jammed <b>fuel</b> <b>flap.</b> At the , he again out-qualified his more experienced teammate Coulthard and finished tenth, which was encouraging for the team in such a new and radical car. Bahrain was also going well for both drivers, who were running in sixth and seventh positions, until both cars retired due to mechanical malfunctions. Webber again was hampered by the aforementioned jammed <b>fuel</b> <b>flap,</b> radically affecting the aerodynamic drag, a vital set-up consideration for the Sakhir circuit.|$|E
50|$|Super S trim was {{available}} in 1993-1997, then the name was changed to SR (Facelift); Differences include a slightly faster 3.6 turns lock-to-lock rack, over the standard 3.8 turns, different colour coded front and rear bumpers, colour coded wing mirrors and bump strips, rear wrap around spoiler, front fog lights, remote <b>fuel</b> <b>flap</b> opening, wider 175/60/r13 tyres, rear ash tray, tachometer, more heavily bolstered seats, split folding rear seats and rear speaker shelf as standard. Features such as electric windows and power steering were still optional extras. The only engine available for the Super S was the 75 bhp CG13DE/ 1.3 twin cam 16v engine.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{qualifying}} in 7th {{place for}} his home race in Melbourne, Mark Webber finished down in 13th {{due to a}} persistent problem with a <b>fuel</b> <b>flap</b> that closed as the pit mechanics went to put the fuel in {{and when it was}} opened it remained open until the next pit stop greatly increasing drag and decreasing airflow over the rear wing. It was worse for David Coulthard however, who crashed heavily with Williams's Alexander Wurz in the late stages of the race. Malaysia was more of the same for Webber, while Coulthard retired with brake problems. However, in Bahrain the team showed improving pace and Coulthard and Webber were running 7th (with Coulthard starting from the back) and 8th respectively before reliability problems put both out of the race in quick succession. However, in testing at Barcelona Coulthard has set the fastest lap in the new configuration of the circuit (since superseded by Felipe Massa). Coulthard secured the team's first points by scoring a gritty 5th with a faulty gearbox on his closing laps in Spain, while Webber was dogged with hydraulic problems all weekend, eventually retiring from the race after failing to set a competitive lap in qualifying. The performance hike the team experienced at the Catalan track left both drivers and team optimistic about their future results, with reliability troubles being as much a focus as the increase of their already competitive pace.|$|E
50|$|The Rapid {{introduced}} {{some new}} ‘Simply Clever‘ details, i.e. double sided mat in the boot (rubber/textile), warning vest holder under driver's seat, removable waste bin in door panelling and ice scraper on the <b>fuel</b> tank <b>flap.</b>|$|R
50|$|Modern cars often feature remote {{opening of}} the fuel tank <b>fuel</b> filler <b>flap</b> using an {{electric}} motor or cable release. For both convenience and security, many modern fuel tanks cannot be opened by hand or otherwise from {{the outside of the}} car.|$|R
50|$|Series 1A-R522 and 1B-R522 - Series 1A-522 and 1B-522 {{aircraft}} with long-range <b>fuel</b> tanks, modified <b>flaps</b> {{and main}} landing gear doors.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{customer}} complaints, the Wiesel {{retained its}} predecessors hard upholstery, lockable <b>fuel</b> tap <b>flap</b> {{and lack of}} a steering lock. It was easy for a thief to force the flap, and Der deutsche Straßenverkehrs testers were astonished that IWL had not rectified this fault from the previous model. IWL produced the Wiesel until 1959, by which time a total of 57,400 had been built.|$|R
50|$|For 1969, {{the only}} {{exterior}} change was the <b>fuel</b> filler <b>flap</b> {{no longer had}} a finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a heated rear window, day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed swing axles as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{an aluminum}} sheet covered steel space frame, based on Formula One racing construction techniques. Its [...] span wing employs winglets and <b>flaps.</b> <b>Fuel</b> is {{carried in a}} single fuselage tank and totals , giving a range of over [...]|$|R
50|$|Inside all {{the cars}} came with a bench seat at the front and at the back as {{standard}} apart {{from the top of}} the line Taunus 20M TS which included individual front seats as standard. Individual seats were available at extra cost on the less exalted models, as part of a (by the standards of the time) long list of optional extras. The boot/trunk could be locked from the outside, and when this was done the adjacent <b>fuel</b> filler <b>flap</b> was locked automatically at the same time.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{an aluminum}} sheet covered steel space frame, based on Formula One racing construction techniques. Its 7.90 m span wing employs winglets and <b>flaps.</b> <b>Fuel</b> is {{carried in a}} single fuselage tank and totals 130 L, giving a range of over 1700 km.|$|R
500|$|The A330 and A340 {{fuselage}} {{is based}} on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external and cabin width: [...] and [...] Typical seating arrangements are 2–2–2 six-abreast in business class and 2–4–2 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder, elevators, horizontal tail plane are used as <b>fuel</b> tank, <b>flaps,</b> ailerons and spoilers are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight When necessary, the A330 uses the Honeywell 331–350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power.|$|R
50|$|The Octavia {{features}} numerous so-called ‘Simply Clever‘ details, i.e. an {{ice scraper}} inside the <b>fuel</b> filler <b>flap,</b> a rubbish bin {{inside the door}} panel, and a double-sided (rubber/textile) floor mat in boot. A tilting/sliding panoramic sunroof is available as an option - single-piece for the Octavia hatchback and two-piece for the Octavia Combi. The Bolero, Amundsen and Columbus car radios are protected against theft by the physical separation of the central display and the multimedia system’s own central unit. The Octavia also offers a Phone Box, a storage compartment for the mobile phone with planar antenna {{in the bottom of}} the compartment, which permits a so-called inductive exterior antenna connection.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 December 1940, the XF4F-3 prototype, BuNo 0383, c/n 356, {{modified}} from XF4F-2, {{was lost}} under circumstances {{that suggested that}} the pilot may have been confused by the poor layout of <b>fuel</b> valves and <b>flap</b> controls and inadvertently turned the fuel valve to [...] "off" [...] immediately after takeoff rather than selecting flaps [...] "up". This was the first fatality in the type.|$|R
50|$|Cold {{inflation}} pressure is the {{inflation pressure}} of tires before {{the car is}} driven and the tires warmed up. Recommended cold inflation pressure is displayed on the owner's manual and on the placard (or sticker) attached to the vehicle door edge, pillar, glovebox door or <b>fuel</b> filler <b>flap.</b> Drivers are encouraged {{to make sure their}} tires are adequately inflated, as suboptimal tire pressure can greatly reduce fuel economy, increase emissions, increased wear on the edges of the tire surface, and can lead to premature failure of the tire. Excessive pressure, on the other hand, may lead to impact-breaks, decrease braking performance, and cause uneven wear (i.e. greater wear on the center part of the tire surface).|$|R
50|$|After {{eliminating}} all {{individual and}} combined sources of mechanical failure, the NTSB {{ruled that the}} extension of the slats was due to the flight crew manipulating the flap/slat controls in an inappropriate manner. Investigators believed that 727 pilots (in general, and this flight specifically) were setting the trailing edge flaps to two degrees during high altitude cruise, {{while at the same time}} pulling the circuit breaker for the slats so that they would not activate. This configuration was rumored to result in increased lift with no increase in drag, thus allowing more speed, higher elevation, or decreased <b>fuel</b> consumption. <b>Flaps</b> and Slats were intended to only be deployed at low speeds during take-off or landing.|$|R
50|$|The car had modern {{features}} for 1964: squared-off body with flat roof panel and sharp tailfins, panoramic rear window and semi-panoramic windshield. Deluxe versions had then-fashionable quad headlights and (some series) two-tone paint.Since {{the layout of}} the first prototypes was created {{on the basis of the}} preceding M-407, the rear end design of the pre-facelift models inherited such characteristic features of the previous Moskvitch series as tailfins decorated with chrome trims, narrow taillights, a recognisable trunk handle, and a <b>fuel</b> tank <b>flap</b> in the middle, behind the number plate. The rear part of the car is equipped with two white reversing lights and is similar in appearance to that of many other automobiles of the 1950s-1960s such as the Peugeot 404 or the BMW 700, but has different contours and details.|$|R
50|$|The Lim-5M was {{regarded}} {{only as an}} interim variant, and work on a more advanced plane continued, testing many different ideas. In 1961, 40 Lim-6 attack aircraft were built. They introduced new blown flaps, but tests showed problems with the modified Lis-6 jet engine and the aircraft were not given to the Air Force. As a result, {{it was decided to}} redesign the thick wing sections with <b>fuel</b> tanks, blown <b>flaps,</b> double wheels and RATO and return to only slightly modified Lim-5 construction, with increased weapon-carrying capability instead.|$|R
25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only {{a single}} set of tail lights {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a <b>fuel</b> filler <b>flap</b> was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.|$|R
500|$|The I-250 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} aircraft with a monocoque fuselage. Other {{than the}} VRDK the aircraft was largely conventional in layout, although the cockpit was set very {{far back in}} the fuselage, almost {{to the base of}} the vertical tail. The two-spar wings had a thickness of 10% to preserve aileron control and avoid tip stall. They were fitted with Frise ailerons and slotted <b>flaps.</b> <b>Fuel</b> was contained in a [...] fuselage tank and a [...] tank in each wing. The conventional landing gear mainwheels had a levered suspension and retracted inwards. The tail wheel retracted aft into the very small ventral fin. The VK-107A engine initially drove a [...] VISh-105SV propeller.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was tightly packed, {{leaving no}} room for fuel tankage or main landing gear. While the notched delta wing lacked the volume of a standard delta wing, each wing contained a fairly conventional three-section main fuel tank and leading-edge tank, holding the wing flaps also each contained a [...] fuel tank and an additional [...] was contained in a fuel recuperator, bringing the aircraft's total internal fuel capacity to [...] The main landing gear was sandwiched outboard of the main tanks and aft of the leading edge tanks, with the <b>flap</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks behind. The long main gear legs retracted towards the wingtip, necessitating an exceptionally thin main tyre inflated to the high pressure of [...] On landing the No. 1 engine was usually shut down when taxying to save brake wear, as keeping both engines running at idle power was still sufficient to propel the Lightning to 80mph if brakes were not used. Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid brakes were fitted.|$|R

40|$|Design, performance, and {{economic}} tradeoffs for STOL short-haul systems are presented. The analyses showed that quiet, short-field aircraft can be economically viable and provide benefits to airport congestion and to community noise relief. The {{objective of the}} studies was to compare and evaluate propulsive-lift systems and low-wing-loading aircraft provided with ride quality control and gust load alleviation, and to determine fuel consumption and cost tradeoffs, along with recommendations for development of technology, noise criteria, and airport planning. In the low density arena, the optimum aircraft sized for less than 50 passengers have active controls for ride quality and gust alleviation; turboprop propulsion offers significant cost and fuel saving with no appreciable block time penalty for the short typical stage lengths (on the order of 150 miles). In the high density arena, high bypass-ratio fan-powered aircraft, with design cruise speed of 0. 7 to 0. 75 M and range capability to 1500 miles, {{are considered to be}} optimum. Field performance of 3000 feet or better can be achieved by the hybrid over-the-wing/internally blown flap concept with viable economics and low <b>fuel</b> consumption. Mechanical <b>flap</b> aircraft with high bypass-ratio engines are indicated to be superior for field lengths of 3500 feet or more. Technology development of propulsive lift is required, and further definition of the best fan-powered engine for low noise and low fuel consumption is needed...|$|R
