One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was a young Marvin Minsky, then a 24-year-old graduate student. In 1951 (with Dean Edmonds) he built the first neural net machine, the SNARC.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have looked in operation.|$|E

25|$|Charles was now {{willing to}} offer {{concrete}} advantages in territory and authority {{in exchange for}} other powers' worthless recognitions of the Pragmatic Sanction that made his daughter Maria Theresa his heir.

25|$|Though these faults {{have been}} traced {{for only a}} little ways, the {{southeast}} striking anticlines they are associated with continue as far as Riffe Lake, near Mossyrock. They are also on-strike with a swarm of faults on the Columbia River, bracketing The Dalles. As {{all of these are}} thrust and reverse faults, they probably result from northeast directed regional compression. These faults also cross the Saint Helens Zone (SHZ), a deep, north-northwest trending zone of seismicity that appears to be the contact between different crustal blocks. <b>How</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be connected is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The first {{discovered}} FHM locus was the CACNA1A gene (originally named CACNL1A4), which encodes the P/Q-type calcium channel CaV2.1. There are currently 17 known mutations in this channel, see Table 1, and these mutations are {{distributed throughout the}} channel. Some of these mutations result in patients with notable cerebellar degeneration or other dysfunction. 15 of these mutants have received at least some further analysis at the electrophysiological level to attempt to determine <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> lead to the FHM1 phenotype. There is increasing contradiction in the literature as to {{the end result of}} these mutations on channel kinetics and neuronal excitability.|$|E
25|$|Aphasia is best {{thought of}} as a {{collection}} of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> best be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time).|$|E

25|$|A {{recurring}} {{concern of}} expressionist architects {{was the use}} of materials and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be poetically expressed. Often, the intention was to unify the materials in a building so as to make it monolithic. The collaboration of Bruno Taut and the utopian poet Paul Scheerbart attempted to address the problems of German society by a doctrine of glass architecture. Such utopianism {{can be seen in the}} context of a revolutionary Germany where the tussle between nationalism and socialism had yet to resolve itself. Taut and Scheerbart imagined a society that had freed itself by breaking from past forms and traditions, impelled by an architecture that flooded every building with multicolored light and represented a more promising future. They published texts on this subject and built the Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. Inscribed around the base of the dome were aphoristic sayings about the material, penned by Scheerbart.|$|E
25|$|Ward, a young {{traveling}} salesman of dry goods, {{was concerned}} over {{the plight of}} many rural Midwest Americans who were, he thought, being overcharged and under-served {{by many of the}} small town retailers on whom they had to rely for their general merchandise. He opened his first mail-order house in 1872. By heavy use of the railroads centered on Chicago, and by associating his business with the non-profit Patrons of Husbandry (the Grangers), Ward offered rural customers a far larger stock than generally available in small towns and at a lower price. Unlike local country merchants, Ward offered no bargaining and no credit. His free catalog, printed by the most modern methods, was widely mailed to customers, allowing them to see pictures of consumer goods and imagine <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be used. Later, Ward used the Post Office's Rural Free Delivery service; he lobbied for a parcel post system that came about in 1906. The early 20th century was the heyday of mail orders and Ward's had become an American tradition, along with its rival Sears Roebuck.|$|E
500|$|Sorrell {{admitted}} in a retrospective interview that MediEvil presented [...] "a mountain of challenges" [...] {{due to the}} fact that, like many other developers at the time, were new to 3D gaming. He also admitted that some members of the team spent long nights without sleeping in order to finish the game on time. He described it as [...] "a huge learning project" [...] for the team. During development, the Cambridge team played beta versions of successful platformers such as Super Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot which helped them understand <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> solve some challenges in building a 3D action game for the first time.|$|E

[...] "One Hundred Years from Now" [...] has a quicker tempo than most of the material on Sweetheart of the Rodeo and functions as a speculation on current human vanities and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be viewed by successive generations. [...] The Chuck Berry influenced [...] "Lazy Days" [...] {{was not included in the}} final album, but was re-recorded by Parsons and Hillman's later band, the Flying Burrito Brothers, for their 1970 album, Burrito Deluxe.|$|E
500|$|Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden {{established}} naturalism as {{the dominant}} style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought {{to show the world}} as it actually was, and to depict people {{in a way that made}} them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted [...] "gold that looked like gold"), paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light, shadow and reflection. They moved beyond the flat perspective and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the Arnolfini Portrait, Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures. Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2017, Woods {{was arrested}} near Jupiter, Florida by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office at about 3:00 am EDT for {{driving under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol or drugs. He was asleep in his car, which, although running, was stopped in a traffic lane. [...] He later stated that he was taking drugs prescribed to him and did not realize <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> interact together. On July 3, 2017 Tiger tweeted that he had completed an out of state intensive program to tackle an unspecified issue. On August 9, 2017, Woods, who skipped his arraignment, entered a not guilty plea through his attorney Douglas Duncan and agreed to take part in a first time DUI offender program and hold another arraignment on October 25. At a hearing on October 27, Woods pled guilty to reckless driving. He received a year of probation, was fined $250, and ordered to undergo 50 hours of community service along with regular drug tests, and was not allowed to drink alcohol during his time of probation. If he violated his probation, he would have been sentenced to 90 days in jail with an additional $500 fine.|$|E
