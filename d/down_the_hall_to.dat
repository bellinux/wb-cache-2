5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> the Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E
25|$|Hearing the commotion, Paules went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Taboada's {{bedroom and}} saw Rolling. She {{attempted}} to barricade {{herself in her}} bedroom but Rolling broke through the door. Rolling taped her mouth and wrists, cut off her clothing and raped her, before turning her onto her belly and stabbing her {{three times in the}} back. Rolling posed Paules' body but left Taboada's in the same position in which he had died.|$|E
25|$|In August 1982, Atlanta {{police officer}} Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a {{citation}} for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle {{into the brush}} along Monroe Ave, thereby observing him violating the city’s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying the $50 fine, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's apartment three weeks later to serve the now-invalid warrant. Hardwick’s roommate was sleeping {{on the couch in}} the living room. The roommate invited officers in and directed them <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Hardwick’s room. The door was open and the officers observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.|$|E

60|$|Wulf {{despatched}} one of <b>the</b> men <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> {{bring up}} <b>the</b> interpreter. As {{soon as he}} arrived Wulf doffed his helmet and stepped forward.|$|R

25|$|One day, Léon meets Mathilda Lando (Portman), {{a lonely}} 12-year-old girl. Mathilda {{lives with her}} {{dysfunctional}} family in an apartment down the hall, and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's abusive father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After they discover he has been cutting the cocaine to keep for himself, DEAagents storm the building, led by sharply dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield (Oldman). During the raid, Stansfield quickly becomes unhinged and murders Mathilda's entire family while she is out shopping for groceries. When Mathilda returns, she realizes what has happened {{just in time to}} continue <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Léon's apartment, who hesitantly gives her shelter.|$|E
25|$|Hearing her screams {{from behind}} the door, Teresa (Jenna Dewan Tatum) is spotted by Bloody Face who kicks {{open the door and}} attacks her. Grabbing her, Bloody Face then throws Teresa against a wall, {{knocking}} her unconscious. Bloody Face prepares to kill Teresa when Leo (Adam Levine), in an attempt to save her life, throws himself into Bloody Face's way, knocking both of them onto the floor and Bloody Face unconscious. While Teresa regains consciousness, Leo kicks the murder weapon away from Bloody Face towards Teresa. Grabbing the weapon, Teresa violently stabs Bloody Face. They attempt to run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> escape and another Bloody Face on the other end stops them. In disbelief, they turn around to see a third Bloody Face, who fatally shoots them. The two Bloody Faces removed their masks and discuss the recent events, with one appearing nervous of their crime. One of them notices Leo's arm and questions it just as another Bloody Face approaches them.|$|E
500|$|Audiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon {{expected}} to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence {{was similar to}} a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers [...] "the heart of the experience" [...] and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the [...] "whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality {{of dealing with the}} crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.|$|E

60|$|Attendance on {{the patient}} had {{prevented}} the Countess from hearing {{the history of the}} accident, but presently the clatter of horses' feet showed that her lord was returning, and, committing the girl to her old nurse, she went <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> receive him.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} him nothing, but I bowed {{my head in}} token that I had heard and he signed to the men to proceed with me, whilst turning on his heel he stepped <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> again <b>to</b> where Madonna Paola, overcome with weakness, had sunk upon a stool.|$|R
2500|$|After {{entering}} the building, Hasan {{went to the}} first desk {{to the right of}} the North doors and asked to see Major Parrish. [...] MAJ Parrish worked in the building (and had been assisting Hasan in his deployment preparations). [...] The worker went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> get Parrish. [...] According to eyewitnesses, Hasan had then gone around behind the desk and bowed his head for several seconds when he suddenly stood up, shouted [...] "Allahu Akbar!" [...] and opened fire. Witnesses said Hasan initially [...] "sprayed bullets at soldiers in a fanlike motion" [...] before taking aim at individual soldiers. Eyewitness SGT Michael Davis said: [...] "The rate of fire was pretty much constant shooting. When I initially heard it, it sounded like an M16." ...|$|E

50|$|The movie {{ends with}} the Grim Reaper telling the {{audience}} he hopes to see them doomed, and that he'll have a room waiting {{for them in the}} Shadow Zone. Then with a chilling laugh, he walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> school's <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entrance and disappears.|$|R
60|$|Only {{the little}} dog Tommy {{remained}} quite cheerful. He trotted <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> jumped on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dais and sat himself comfortably {{at the feet of}} its occupant.|$|R
60|$|Upon this King Arthur {{arose from}} where he sat {{and all the others}} uprose with him and there was a great sound of loud voices; for the fame of Sir Percival had waxed very great since he had begun his adventures. So King Arthur and <b>the</b> others went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> for <b>to</b> meet Sir Percival.|$|R
60|$|Her {{indolence}} {{turned to}} energy as she charged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> the large double {{door on the}} right and threw it open, revealing to him a scene of splendor and revelry by night.|$|E

60|$|He {{passed his}} arm through hers {{and led her}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> where the Professor and Laura were {{just waiting for the}} lift. He beckoned them to follow him to a corner of the lounge.|$|E
60|$|When old Granny Fox {{had sent}} Reddy Fox {{into the house}} and told him to stay there until she {{returned}} home, he had not wanted to mind, but he knew that Granny Fox meant just what she said, and so he had crawled slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedroom, way underground.|$|R
60|$|Hereward {{went to the}} minster tower, {{and watched}} the Ouse {{flashing}} with countless oars northward toward Southrey Fen. And when they were all out of sight, he went back, {{and lay down on}} his bed and wept,--once and for all. Then he arose, and went <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> abbots and monks, and earls and knights, and was the boldest, cheeriest, wittiest of them all.|$|R
60|$|They {{were handed}} {{on into the}} courtyard, where {{servants}} ran to take their horses, and as the news ran that Master Richard's sons had arrived from the Indies, Will Cavendish came running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> steps <b>to</b> embrace them in his glee, while Lord Talbot {{came to the door}} of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> welcome them. These great London houses, which had not quite lost their names of hostels or inns, did really serve as free lodgings to all members of the family who might visit town, and above all such travellers as these, bringing news of grand national achievements.|$|R
60|$|Later, Phil {{talked to}} her about his longing {{to be a great}} surgeon--in which he had the {{tremendous}} advantage of being almost sincere. He walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> her room, and said good-night lingeringly, holding her hand.|$|E
6000|$|At nine-thirty {{that evening}} he combed and tightly brushed his hair, {{which he had}} been pawing angrily {{for an hour and a}} half, went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Nelly's hall bedroom, and knocked with: [...] "It's Mr. Wrenn. May I ask you {{something}} about the play?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{man seemed}} to look about him keenly for a moment, then vanished, and the steps went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> the front door, which was opened {{from within and}} some one {{admitted}} quietly. Whispers were heard, and then feet approached again, accompanied by a gleam of light.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, the {{proposal}} <b>to</b> tear <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Town <b>Hall</b> <b>to</b> {{make room for}} parking facilities met with public outcry. Although the building was mostly empty {{and in need of}} repair, the uproar convinced the town to save the building. On January 25, 1982 it was designated as a Heritage building, and plans were made to convert the building into a museum. It would not be until the spring of 1988 that <b>the</b> old Town <b>Hall</b> was finally reopened, this time as the Edinburgh Square Heritage and Cultural Centre.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} {{suggests}} Sheep Street, which leads <b>down</b> from <b>the</b> Town <b>Hall</b> <b>to</b> Waterside and <b>the</b> RST, was from early times {{and until the}} late 19th century, the area where sheep, brought from the neighbouring Cotswold Hills to be bought and sold. Today it is the restaurant centre of the town.|$|R
5000|$|Linden {{wakes up}} in a {{hospital}} bed with an identification bracelet on her wrist. She walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> tries <b>to</b> open a locked door—which bears a sign outside: [...] "Psychiatry Acute Ward". In the waiting room, Lt. Carlson (Mark Moses) tells Holder that Linden attacked a casino worker while trying to kill herself. Holder says the tribe is hiding evidence and informs him that the Larsen case files disappeared on the way to county police. Linden tries to call Holder from a nursing station but is told the phone is only available during certain hours. She learns she is on suicide watch for 72 hours.|$|R
60|$|She led him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> {{the door}} of Ted's room and pushed it gently open. On the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rose-colored chiffon lingerie; on the sedate Morris chair a girl's silver slipper. And on the pillows were two sleepy heads--Ted's and Eunice's.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the guards}} seized {{the three of}} them to lead them away, and the frightened babe set up a thin, {{piercing}} wail, while the Bishop and his companions, preceded by one of the monks bearing the candle--it was that Ambrose who had choked Emlyn--marched in procession <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> gain the great door.|$|E
6000|$|LILY--[Jumping up.] I'll bet that's we Jaysons now. [She runs to {{the door}} in the rear and looks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> the right.] Yes, it's Esther and husband and Aunt Davidson. [She comes back to MARTHA {{laughing}} excitedly. The MAID is seen going to the door.] The first wave of attack, Martha! Be brave! The Young Guard dies but never surrenders! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, they do. It's sort of fun {{to fight}} Ma Fike and all the fool rules. I enjoy smoking here {{twice as much as}} I would {{anywhere}} else. And Fike isn't half as bad as the board of visitors--bunch of fat, rich, old Upper-West-Siders with passementeried bosoms, doing tea-table charity, and asking us impertinent questions, and telling a bunch of hard-worked slaves to be virtuous and wash behind their ears--the soft, ignorant, conceited, impractical parasites! But still, it's all sort of like a cranky boarding-school for girls--and you know what fun the girls have there, with midnight fudge parties and a teacher pussy-footing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> trying <b>to</b> catch them." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{lives for}} a long time in a prison. Eventually, he hears his stories, {{broadcast}} over the radio as propaganda. He comes up with an escape plan, after finding Adolf Hitler in the same prison, now a senile old man. Jainlight and Hitler escape to America, to chase the ghost of the woman they both love. Hitler dies in New York City. Jainlight finds his way to Davenhall, where he lives for seventeen years in the hotel with Marc and his mother, trying to summon up the courage to ask for forgiveness. On the night Marc leaves town, he knows his life is slipping away, and he staggers <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> hoping <b>to</b> have time, but he doesn't.|$|R
60|$|I was not surprised, when I ran <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>to</b> {{see that}} a {{brilliant}} June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A beggar-woman and her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.|$|R
