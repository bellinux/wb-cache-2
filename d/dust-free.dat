25|$|If {{this is not}} practical, certain {{alterations}} to stable routine may be effective. The aim is to minimise {{dust and}} maximise air quality in the stable. This may be achieved by soaking hay or feeding a <b>dust-free</b> alternative (such as haylage). The length of time to soak hay for the maximum benefit is debated; however, approximately 30 minutes {{appears to be the}} current consensus.|$|E
25|$|When {{the logic}} board {{of a hard}} disk fails, the drive can often be {{restored}} to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk. In the case of read-write head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a <b>dust-free</b> environment. If the disk platters are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required. For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including fsck on UNIX-like systems and CHKDSK on Windows, {{can be used for}} data recovery. Recovery from logical damage can require file carving.|$|E
500|$|Almost all maria are on {{the near}} side of the Moon, and cover 31% of {{the surface of the}} near side, {{compared}} with 2% of the far side. This is thought to be due to a concentration of heat-producing elements under the crust on the near side, seen on geochemical maps obtained by Lunar Prospectors gamma-ray spectrometer, which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up, partially melt, rise to the surface and erupt. Most of the Moon's mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.0–3.5billion years ago, although some radiometrically dated samples are as old as 4.2billion years. Until recently, the youngest eruptions, dated by crater counting, appeared to have been only 1.2billion years ago. In 2006, a study of Ina, a tiny depression in Lacus Felicitatis, found jagged, relatively <b>dust-free</b> features that, {{due to the lack of}} erosion by infalling debris, appeared to be only 2 million years old. Moonquakes and releases of gas also indicate some continued lunar activity. In 2014 NASA announced [...] "widespread evidence of young lunar volcanism" [...] at 70 irregular mare patches identified by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, some less than 50 million years old. This raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed, at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer due to the greater concentration of radioactive elements. Just prior to this, evidence has been presented for 2–10 million years younger basaltic volcanism inside Lowell crater, Orientale basin, located in the transition zone between the near and far sides of the Moon. An initially hotter mantle and/or local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities also on the far side in the Orientale basin.|$|E
2500|$|Rawalpindi is chaotic, but {{relatively}} <b>dust-free.</b> The weather is highly variable {{due to the}} proximity of the city to the foothills of Himalayas. The average annual rainfall is , most of which falls in the summer monsoon season. However, westerly disturbances also bring quite significant rainfall in the winter. In summer, the record maximum temperature has soared to [...] recorded in June 1954, while it has dropped to a minimum [...] in the winter several times in the past. The last time it reached that temperature was in January 1967.|$|E
2500|$|A thin {{membrane}} surface (TMS) is an oil-treated aggregate {{which is}} laid down upon {{a gravel road}} bed, producing a <b>dust-free</b> road. A TMS road reduces mud problems and provides stone-free roads for local residents where loaded truck traffic is negligible. [...] The TMS layer adds no significant structural strength, and so is used on secondary highways with low traffic volume and minimal weight loading. [...] Construction involves minimal subgrade preparation, following by covering with a [...] cold mix asphalt aggregate. The Operation Division of the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure in Saskatchewan has the responsibility of maintaining [...] of thin membrane surface (TMS) highways.|$|E
2500|$|Thorp's {{innovative}} {{design for}} celluloid diffraction grating replicas won him the Wilde Premium for Original Research in 1901, principally {{in recognition of}} his paper of 1899 entitled Grating Films and their application to Colour Photography. He was also recognised by awards from other bodies, including international exhibitions. His diffraction gratings were particularly noted in an obituary, which said that they made [...] Prior to his developments, details of which he published but did not patent, interested people had to rely upon the photographic methods that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh and Izarn. Thorp's [...] "brilliant idea", announced in 1898 and improved thereafter through experimentation {{and the development of}} new materials, was to take [...] "a cast of the ruled surface in a transparent medium [...] a thin solution of celluloid in amyl acetate." [...] He described his method on numerous occasions, including in a letter published in the edition of 29 December 1905 of the British Journal of Photography (reproduced in Popular Astronomy, 1906), He emphasised the need for a <b>dust-free</b> environment and a uniform drying of the solution as well as asserting that his was the [...] "first method of producing optically useful replicas of gratings and one which after all has not in my opinion been superseded." [...] By 1900 he was able to apply his developments to colour photography and he went on to demonstrate to the British Astronomical Association a method for projecting natural colours that used [...] "three replicas adjusted to diffract the proper colour sensations to the eye".|$|E

5000|$|Blue compact galaxies (BCGs). These {{galaxies are}} often low mass, low metallicity, <b>dust-free</b> objects. Because they are <b>dust-free</b> and contain {{a large number}} of hot, young stars, they are often blue in optical and {{ultraviolet}} colours. It was initially thought that BCGs were genuinely young galaxies in the process of forming their first generation of stars, thus explaining their low metal content. However, old stellar populations have been found in most BCGs, and it is thought that efficient mixing may explain the apparent lack of dust and metals. Most BCGs show signs of recent mergers and/or close interactions. Well-studied BCGs include IZw18 (the most metal poor galaxy known), ESO338-IG04 and Haro11.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Uses== At extreme high pressure, {{water is}} used in many {{industrial}} cleaning applications requiring the removal of surface layers and for <b>dust-free</b> cutting of some metals and concrete. For exterior applications, gas or propane powered washers provide greater mobility than electric ones, as they do not require use in proximity to an electrical outlet, but for indoor applications, electric washers produce no exhaust and are much quieter than gas or propane washers.|$|E
5000|$|... 8mm tapes {{should be}} stored vertically, out of direct sunlight, in a dry, cool, <b>dust-free</b> environment. As with any media, they will {{eventually}} deteriorate and lose their recorded contents over time, {{resulting in a}} buildup of image noise and dropouts.

Such problems will normally require professional attention.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic Videotape- Magnetic {{videotape}} {{was never}} meant to last, and often has a short life (often only a few decades) especially if exposed to warm or humid conditions. Videotapes, should be stored in upright, under cool, dry, <b>dust-free</b> conditions. Videotapes may be stored in polypropylene cases, but without paper inside the cases and [...] "magnetic media should never be stored at temperatures below 46 degrees Fahrenheit". Magnetic media should also be kept away from magnetic sources, which could demagnetize them.|$|E
50|$|After {{the initial}} batch of airfields was {{completed}} using SMT, the Army aviation engineers switched {{almost exclusively to}} another surfacing material known as prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing (PBS). Light and easily transportable, PBS did not create the dust problem encountered with SMT fields. Made of an asphalt-impregnated jute delivered in rolls 300 feet in length and 36 inches or 43 inches in width, PBS was laid in overlapping layers to produce a <b>dust-free</b> fair weather surface. It was also common to build airstrips using both SMT and PBS, laying SMT on top.|$|E
50|$|Moisture content affects {{both the}} ease of cutting wood and the final shape of the work when it dries. Wetter wood cuts easily with a {{continuous}} ribbon of shavings that are relatively <b>dust-free.</b> However, the wet wood moves as it dries. shrinking less along the grain. These variable changes may add the illusion of an oval bowl, or draw attention to features of the wood. Dry wood is necessary for turnings that require precision, as in the fit of a lid to a box, or in forms where pieces are glued together.|$|E
50|$|Nearline {{tape and}} optical storage has the {{advantage}} of relatively longer lifespans compared to spinning hard drives, simply due to the storage media being idle and usually stored in protected <b>dust-free</b> enclosures when not in use. In a robotic tape loading system, the tape drive used for accessing data experiences the most wear and may need occasional replacement, but the tapes themselves can last for years to decades. If there are sealable access doors between the access mechanism and the media, it is possible for the idle media storage enclosure to survive fire, floods, lightning strikes, and other disasters.|$|E
50|$|Testing {{is often}} {{done in a}} clean-room or another <b>dust-free</b> environment, keeping the dust from {{settling}} on the surfaces between cleaning and assembly. Sometimes, the surfaces may be assembled by sliding them together, helping to scrape off any dust that might happen {{to land on the}} flat. The testing is usually done in a temperature-controlled environment to prevent any distortions in the glass, and needs to be performed on a very stable work-surface. After testing, the flats are usually cleaned again and stored in a protective case, and are often kept in a temperature-controlled environment until used again.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} {{involves}} cleaning the playing {{surface of the}} records (unless they have been stored in archival, <b>dust-free</b> conditions since they were last cleaned). This can involve anything from turntable-based, vacuum equipped, professional cleaning machines that use proprietary chemical formulations and cost four figures, to improvised methods involving home-made equipment and/or cleaning solutions consisting of isopropyl alcohol, distilled water (unpurified tap water should not be used, as it will probably leave limescale deposits on the record surface) and a surfactant to aid drying. Isopropyl alcohol should only be used to clean vinyl records: it will cause permanent damage to shellac, master and one-time recordings (acetate, wax and lacquer).|$|E
50|$|While {{working in}} the {{institute}} in collaboration with Leningrad’s researcher O.V. Mazurin, Yu. Belousov wrote the book The Annealing and Tempering of Glass, a popular and famous manual among engineers. This book, devoted to a new method of glass treatment, became a respected reference guide for specialists and researchers in other related industries.Based on this method, in 1988, Yu. Belousov, O.V. Mazurin and others developed USSR’s first technology of a glass <b>dust-free</b> method of sealing glass ampoules, which significantly decreased contamination in medicinal ampouled preparations. This invention was first introduced {{at one of the}} Soviet biopharmaceutical plants currently belonging to the Russian concern VEROPHARM.|$|E
50|$|Trickle valves, {{also known}} as vacuum valves, are {{commonly}} used in industrial dust collection applications to maintain an airlock seal on a dust collector hopper while allowing bulk solid material to be automatically discharged. These valves are typically a less expensive alternative to more commonly used rotary airlocks. Unlike rotary airlock valves which are driven by either an electric motor or a gas or air-powered motor, trickle valves require no external power source and are therefore well-suited for use in mechanical trenchers, where a <b>dust-free</b> environment in the pinnacle truss and axle bore is required for smooth operation. Trickle values were originally developed for this purpose.|$|E
