40|$|When {{gathering}} {{feedback about}} an envisioned system, prototypes communicate design ideas to <b>user</b> <b>groups.</b> However, {{it is unclear}} how user responses are affected by prototype format. We conducted a 2 x 2 quasi-experiment (video /storyboard format x older and younger <b>user</b> <b>groups)</b> to test for an interaction between prototype format and <b>user</b> <b>group.</b> We found a significant interaction between prototype format and responses across <b>user</b> <b>groups.</b> Our results indicate that differences in user responses can be misinterpreted as the result of <b>user</b> <b>group</b> characteristics. We advise using multiple prototype formats to counteract a 'media effect'. Alternatively, we advise using storyboards for a smaller 'media effect'...|$|R
