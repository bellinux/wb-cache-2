5|$|When {{the ship}} became trapped in pack ice his duties {{expanded}} to constructing makeshift housing, and, once {{it became clear}} that the ship was doomed, to altering the sledges for the journey over the ice to open water. He built the quarters where the crew took their meals (nicknamed The Ritz) and cubicles where the men could sleep. These were all christened as well; McNish shared The Sailors' Rest with Alfred Cheetham, the Third Officer. Assisted by the crew, he constructed kennels <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> on the upper deck. Once Endurance became trapped, and the crew were spending the days on the ice, McNish erected goalposts and football became a daily fixture for the men. To pass the time in the evening, McNish joined Frank Wild, Tom Crean, James McIlroy, Worsley and Shackleton playing poker in the wardroom.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs),</b> and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett {{did his best to}} reassure him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E

5|$|On 27 October 1912, Mawson {{outlined}} the summer sledging program. Mertz and Ninnis {{were assigned to}} Mawson's own party, which would use the dogs to push quickly {{to the east of}} the expedition's base in Commonwealth Bay, towards Victoria Land. The party departed Cape Denison on 10 November, heading first to Aladdin's Cave, and from there south-east towards a massive glacier encountered by Aurora on the outward journey. Mertz skied ahead, scouting and providing a lead <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> to chase; Mawson and Ninnis manoeuvred the two dog teams behind. They reached the glacier on 19 November; negotiating fields of crevasses, it was crossed in five days. The party made quick progress once on the plateau again, but they soon encountered another glacier, far larger than the first. Despite strong winds and poor light, Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis reached the far side on 30 November.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between pet shows and pet fashion shows. The pet fashion show's emphasis is on the clothes, not on the dog. In countries all over the world, pet fashion shows are becoming increasingly popular they have become so important that in 2011 New York hosted the first Pet Fashion Week called Last Bark at Bryant Park. During these shows, well groomed pets strut down the runway wearing high fashion clothes. Some well known designers such as Alexander Wang have designed outfits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Swedish Police Authority {{currently}} deploys around 400 police dogs, {{of which}} about 70 percent German Shepherds and 20 percent Malinois. The remaining 10 percent {{consist of a}} range of breeds, including Boxers, Labradors, and Springer Spaniel. There is however no requirement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> to be purebred, as long as they meet mental and physical requirements set by the police. Dogs aged 18–48 months are eligible to take admission tests for the K9 training. The police dogs live with their operators, and after retirement at age 8-10 the operator often assumes the ownership of the dog.|$|E
25|$|Dog food (qimugcin, qimugcitkaq, qimugcessuun) {{refers to}} food <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs.</b> Alunga is {{homemade}} dog food (a boiled mixture {{of fish and}} meat products) and Alungun is dog-feeding trough. Salmon is the best food to feed (nerqe-) dogs. Chum, coho, and pink salmon were the species most frequently processed for dog food. In addition to dried salmon processed for dog food, whole uncut salmon and the heads, entrails, and backbones, not preserved or prepared for dog food, were also used as dog food. Chum salmon harvested during August for use as dog food were usually dried. Between late August and early October, coho salmon harvested for dog food were preserved by burying whole in earthen pits.|$|E

25|$|Beluga whale {{or white}} whale Delphinapterus leucas (cetuaq, assigarnaq, qecip'atuli in Yup'ik cituaq in Cup'ik, cetuar in Cup'ig) {{is used for}} human and dog food. Beluga {{harvested}} in spring are used primarily for human food, although some are used for dog food. Beluga harvests in the fall usually are lower than in spring. The late fall beluga hunts were used to produce food <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs.</b> Parts of the beluga used for human food include the skin, fat, backstrap, and intestines. Backstrap meat is sometimes dried, and beluga skin is sometimes pickled. Beluga products are prepared a number of ways, such as boiling skin and meat (eaten hot or cold); flouring and frying or barbecuing backstraps; and processing fat into oil for use with dried fish and meat. Ways of preserving and using beluga products show local differences between communities and families.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildup of}} American forces in Vietnam created large dog {{sections}} at USAF Southeast Asia (SEA) bases. 467 dogs were eventually assigned to Bien Hoa, Binh Thuy, Cam Ranh Bay, Da Nang, Nha Trang, Tuy Hoa, Phù Cát, Phan Rang, Tan Son Nhut, and Pleiku Air Bases. Within {{a year of}} deployment, attacks on several bases had been stopped when the enemy forces were detected by dog teams. Captured Vietcong told of the fear and respect that they had <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs.</b> The Vietcong even placed a bounty on lives of handlers and dogs. The success of sentry dogs {{was determined by the}} lack of successful penetrations of bases in Vietnam and Thailand. It is estimated by the United States War Dogs Association that war dogs saved over 10,000 U.S. lives in Vietnam. Sentry Dogs were also used by the Army, Navy, and Marines to protect the perimeter of large bases.|$|E
25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in the corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|E

50|$|Training is a rigorous, {{time-consuming}} and comprehensive process <b>for</b> both <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and <b>the</b> handler. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> training is best begun {{early in life}} (upon acquisition of a suitable puppy, 8-10 weeks) <b>for</b> deployment of <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> in 12-18 months and retirement at 5-10 years, depending on the breed and individual dog. Obedience training is essential <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog's</b> safety, order at staging areas, and to maintain professionalism in law enforcement and the public audience. Socialization and handler-canine bonding are especially important for airscenting dogs. Basic agility training is necessary, and advanced training may pay off unexpectedly. Scent training should be initiated early and is often best accomplished by working with an experienced, well-established local training group that has {{a track record of}} working with local or state law enforcement.|$|R

500|$|Over the {{following}} winter, preparations {{were made for}} the summer sledging. Because the conditions—constant, strong winds and an excessive slope by the hut—prevented Mertz from conducting skiing lessons as regularly as intended, he focussed instead on helping Ninnis to care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs.</b> On days when the weather was good they drove the dogs around outside the hut, teaching them to run in teams; when the winds returned the pair fitted and sewed harnesses for each dog, and prepared their sledging food.

500|$|Believing that Shackleton might {{attempt a}} {{crossing}} {{during the first}} season, Mackintosh decided that the first two depots had to be laid without delay, one at 79°S near Minna Bluff, a prominent Barrier landmark, and another further south at the 80° mark. These were, in his view, the minimum that would enable Shackleton's party to survive a crossing of the Barrier. [...] The delayed arrival of Aurora in the Antarctic had given little time for acclimatisation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> and for the untrained men, and this led to differences of view about how to proceed. Ernest Joyce, {{by far the most}} experienced Antarctic traveller in the party, favoured a cautious approach and wanted to delay the start by at least a week.
