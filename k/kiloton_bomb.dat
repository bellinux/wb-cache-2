50|$|The EMP {{at a fixed}} {{distance}} from an explosion increases at most as the square root of the yield (see the illustration to the right). This means that although a 10 kiloton weapon has only 0.7% of the energy release of the 1.44-megaton Starfish Prime test, the EMP {{will be at least}} 8% as powerful. Since the E1 component of nuclear EMP depends on the prompt gamma ray output, which was only 0.1% of yield in Starfish Prime but can be 0.5% of yield in low yield pure nuclear fission weapons, a 10 <b>kiloton</b> <b>bomb</b> can easily be 5 x 8% = 40% as powerful as the 1.44 megaton Starfish Prime at producing EMP.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{released}} by a fission bomb {{is in the form}} of x-rays. The spectrum is approximately that of a black body at a temperature of 50,000,000 kelvins (a little more than three times the temperature of the Sun's core). The amplitude can be modeled as a trapezoidal pulse with a one microsecond rise time, one microsecond plateau, and one microsecond fall time. For a 30 <b>kiloton</b> fission <b>bomb,</b> the total x-ray output would be 100 terajoules.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} plan {{to create}} the basin for a {{tailings}} dam for the nearby diamond mine, a 1.7 <b>kiloton</b> atomic <b>bomb</b> was detonated 98 m underground near Udachny on October 2, 1974. Original plans had called for eight similar explosions to be conducted; however, due to radioactive fallout being far greater than expected, the project was halted after the first blast. The shaft in which the explosion was held was not plugged until eighteen years later, with an estimated 7 to 20 m thick concrete sarcophagus.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} in South Korea, McBeth {{revealed}} together with Nayan Chanda and Shada Islam, in the Review, North Korea's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. American and South Korean officials feared that North Korea was building a reprocessing plant next to a 30 mW nuclear reactor north of Pyongyang. The Americans had first heard of the nuclear reactor project at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center in 1985 {{but it was only}} in late 1988 that satellite cameras detected a mystery extra facility. According to most estimates, a 30 mW reactor would have been capable of producing about seven-to-eight kilograms of weapons-grade material over an extended period. That would have been sufficient for a one <b>kiloton</b> <b>bomb.</b> Chanda, Islam and McBeth broke the story in the Review after it was leaked by the Australian Ambassador to South Korea, Richard Broinowski, who had seen American satellite photographs of the Yongbyon site. The revelation was the biggest scoop of McBeth's career, yet it sank without trace until American mainstream media like Newsweek and the Washington Post finally picked it up almost a year later.|$|E
5000|$|A salted bomb is {{a nuclear}} weapon {{designed}} {{to function as a}} radiological weapon, producing enhanced quantities of radioactive fallout, rendering a large area uninhabitable. [...] The term is derived both from the means of their manufacture, which involves the incorporation of additional elements to a standard atomic weapon, and from the expression [...] "to salt the earth", meaning to render an area uninhabitable for generations. The idea originated with Hungarian-American physicist Leo Szilard, in February 1950. His intent was not to propose that such a weapon be built, but to show that nuclear weapon technology would soon reach the point where it could end human life on Earth. [...] No intentionally salted bomb has ever been atmospherically tested, however the UK tested a 1 <b>kiloton</b> <b>bomb</b> incorporating a small amount of cobalt as an experimental radiochemical tracer at their Tadje testing site in Maralinga range, Australia, on September 14, 1957. Furthermore the triple [...] "taiga" [...] nuclear salvo test, as part of the preliminary March 1971 Pechora-Kama Canal project, produced substantial amounts of Co-60, with this fusion generated neutron activation product being responsible for about half of the gamma dose now (2011) at the test site.|$|E
5000|$|For {{isolated}} systems (closed to all {{mass and}} energy exchange), mass never disappears {{in the center}} of momentum frame, because energy cannot disappear. Instead, this equation, in context, means only that when any energy is added to, or escapes from, a system in the center-of-momentum frame, the system will be measured as having gained or lost mass, in proportion to energy added or removed. Thus, in theory, if an atomic bomb were placed in a box strong enough to hold its blast, and detonated upon a scale, the mass of this closed system would not change, and the scale would not move. Only when a transparent [...] "window" [...] was opened in the super-strong plasma-filled box, and light and heat were allowed to escape in a beam, and the bomb components to cool, would the system lose the mass associated with the energy of the blast. In a 21 <b>kiloton</b> <b>bomb,</b> for example, about a gram of light and heat is created. If this heat and light were allowed to escape, the remains of the bomb would lose a gram of mass, as it cooled. In this thought-experiment, the light and heat carry away the gram of mass, and would therefore deposit this gram of mass in the objects that absorb them.|$|E
50|$|The RAF V bomber {{force was}} {{initially}} meant to use Blue Danube {{as their primary}} armament {{at a time when}} the first hydrogen bomb had not been detonated, and the British military planners still believed that an atomic war could be fought and won using atomic bombs of similar yield to the Hiroshima bomb. For that reason the stockpile planned was for up to 800 bombs with yields of 10-12 <b>kilotons.</b> V-bomber <b>bomb</b> bays were sized to carry Blue Danube, the smallest-size nuclear bomb that was possible to be designed given the technology of the day (1947) when their plans were formulated.|$|R
25|$|After {{establishment}} {{of its own}} deterrent force, the Force de Dissuassion, more {{commonly known as the}} Force de frappe, France withdrew from the military command structure of NATO in 1966. French President Charles de Gaulle viewed the operational {{establishment of}} the Mirage IV fleet, a critical component of the independent Force de frappe, as highly influential to his decision to withdraw France from NATO, and that an independent French nuclear deterrent was necessary to ensure independence as a nation. From 1964 to 1971, the Mirage IV was France's sole means of delivering nuclear ordnance, at this point they were armed with a single 60 <b>kiloton</b> nuclear <b>bomb</b> each.|$|R
50|$|The DF-15C is {{a bunker}} buster variant {{equipped}} with a deep-penetration warhead, {{with a range of}} 700 km and accuracy of 15-20 m CEP. It was originally designed with the intention of destroying the Heng Shan Military Command Center in Taiwan's capital of Taipei, which was built to withstand a 20 kiloton nuclear blast, a 2 <b>kiloton</b> conventional <b>bomb</b> blast, or an electromagnetic pulse; another target would be Chiashan Air Force Base. In the event of an invasion, the destruction of Taiwan's major command center would make it difficult to coordinate defenses. The missile's range also threatens locations as far as Kyushu in Japan and the Indian capital of New Delhi.|$|R
50|$|Upon detonation, a near-ground {{airburst}} of a 1 <b>kiloton</b> neutron <b>bomb</b> {{would produce}} a large blast wave and a powerful pulse of both thermal radiation and ionizing radiation, and non-ionizing radiation {{in the form of}} fast (14.1 MeV) neutrons. The thermal pulse would cause third degree burns to unprotected skin out to approximately 500 meters. The blast would create at least 4.6 psi out to a radius of 600 meters, which would severely damage all non-reinforced concrete structures. At the conventional effective combat range against modern main battle tanks and armored personnel carriers (< 690-900 m), the blast from a 1 kt neutron bomb would destroy or damage to the point of non-usability of almost all un-reinforced civilian buildings.|$|R
25|$|As the {{incendiary}} {{effects of}} a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features, it is estimated by those with Strategic bombing experience that as the city was a firestorm hazard, the same fire ferocity and building damage produced at Hiroshima by one 16-kiloton nuclear bomb from a single B-29 bomber could have been produced instead by the conventional use of about 1.2 <b>kilotons</b> of incendiary <b>bombs</b> from 220 B-29s distributed over the city.|$|R

50|$|The {{incendiary}} {{effects of}} a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features. In principle, the same overall result with respect to destruction of life and property {{can be achieved by}} the use of conventional incendiary and high-explosive bombs. It has been estimated, for example, that the same fire ferocity and damage produced at Hiroshima by one 16-kiloton nuclear bomb from a single B-29 could have instead been produced by about 1,200 tons/1.2 <b>kilotons</b> of incendiary <b>bombs</b> from 220 B-29s distributed over the city.|$|R
50|$|Neutron {{bombs are}} {{purposely}} designed with explosive yields lower than other nuclear weapons. Since neutrons are scattered and absorbed by air, neutron radiation effects drop off rapidly with distance in air. As such, {{there is a}} sharper distinction, relative to thermal effects, between areas of high lethality and areas with minimal radiation doses. All high yield (more than c. 10 <b>kiloton)</b> nuclear <b>bombs,</b> such as the extreme example of a device that derived 97% of its energy from fusion, the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba, {{are not able to}} radiate sufficient neutrons beyond their lethal blast range when detonated as a surface burst or low altitude air burst and so are no longer classified as neutron bombs, thus limiting the yield of neutron bombs to a maximum of about 10 kilotons. The intense pulse of high-energy neutrons generated by a neutron bomb is the principal killing mechanism, not the fallout, heat or blast.|$|R
50|$|The Ministry of Interior {{maintains}} hard shelters, {{capable of}} accommodating 3.6 million persons, {{in cities and}} in other densely populated areas where two-thirds of the country's population live. They are built to withstand the detonation of a 100 <b>kiloton</b> nuclear <b>bomb</b> at ground zero. There is no shelter program in rural areas nor are most detached dwellings and townhouses equipped with shelters. About 10 percent of the shelters are carved out of natural rock, but most are beneath office and residential buildings. Some are designed for multiple use as parking garages, schoolrooms, skating rinks, and swimming pools. By law, builders are obliged to include shelters in blocks measuring 3,000 cubic meters or more. In the late 1980s, in Helsinki, 536,000 spaces were provided, of which 118,000 were in large rock shelters and 14,000 were in subway stations. The shelter space was sufficient to accommodate over 100 percent of the nighttime population of the city, but only 67 percent of the daytime population.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Union's first mass-produced {{tactical}} nuclear weapon {{was based on the}} RDS-4 and remained in service until 1966. It used a plutonium implosion assembly and had a nominal yield of 30 <b>kilotons.</b> The <b>bomb</b> was delivered from a Tu-4 and Tu-16 aircraft. A tactical weapon based on the RDS-4 was also used on September 14, 1954 during Snowball military exercise near Totskoye (similar to Western Desert Rock exercises), when the bomb was dropped by the Tu-4 bomber (the copy of American B-29 bomber). The purpose of this exercise was not to test the bomb itself, but the ability of using it while breaking through enemy defenses (presumably in West Germany). After the explosion Soviet jet fighters were sent to fly through the mushroom cloud while tanks and infantry were forced to move through ground zero. Medical records of contaminated soldiers were forged afterwards and many were forced out of active duty.|$|R
50|$|The People's Republic of China {{became the}} fifth nuclear power on October 16, 1964 when it detonated a 25 <b>kiloton</b> {{uranium-235}} <b>bomb</b> {{in a test}} codenamed 596 at Lop Nur. In the late 1950s, China began developing nuclear weapons with substantial Soviet assistance in exchange for uranium ore. However, the Sino-Soviet ideological split in the late 1950s developed problems between China and the Soviet Union. This caused the Soviets to cease helping China develop nuclear weapons. However, China continued developing nuclear weapons without Soviet support and made remarkable progress in the 1960s. Due to Soviet/Chinese tensions, the Chinese might have used nuclear weapons against either the United States or the Soviet Union {{in the event of}} a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the Chinese nuclear deterrent consisted of gravity bombs carried aboard H-6 bomber aircraft, missile systems such as the DF-2, DF-3, and DF-4, and in the later stages of the Cold War, the Type 092 ballistic missile submarine. On June 14, 1967, China detonated its first hydrogen bomb.|$|R

Mayor Green reports that the NYPD captured the van in New York with a 20 <b>kiloton</b> nuclear <b>bomb</b> on board. But Washington D.C. has been successfully attacked by a bomber. On the way back from the FEMA camp, Anderson's car is stolen by 12 looters and he is forced to walk home to Jericho on foot. Anderson also reports that Lawrence, Kansas has been attacked. Robert Hawkins receives a morse code message on a ham radio stating that Denver, Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, Kansas City, San Diego, and several more cities not shown on screen have been attacked. A black box flight data recorder that Jake recovers from a crashed airliner indicates that air traffic control is non existent, a mushroom cloud is rising 60 km into the atmosphere and that flashes have also been sighted towards Texas.|$|R
5000|$|On Sep. 30, 1966 the Soviet Union in Urta-Bulak, an {{area about}} 80 {{kilometers}} from Bukhara, Uzbekistan, experienced blowouts on five natural gas wells. It was claimed in Komsomoloskaya Pravda that {{after years of}} burning uncontrollably {{they were able to}} stop them entirely. [...] The Soviets lowered a specially made 30 <b>kiloton</b> nuclear <b>bomb</b> into a 6 km borehole drilled 25 to 50 m away from the original (rapidly leaking) well. A nuclear explosive was deemed necessary because conventional explosive both lacked the necessary power and would also require a great deal more space underground. When the bomb was set off, it crushed the original pipe that was carrying the gas from the deep reservoir to the surface and glassified all the surrounding rock. This caused the leak and fire at the surface to cease within approximately one minute of the explosion, and proved over the years to have been a permanent solution. A second attempt on a similar well was not as successful and other tests were for such experiments as oil extraction enhancement (Stavropol, 1969) and the creation of gas storage reservoirs (Orenburg, 1970).|$|R
5000|$|The {{questionable}} {{effectiveness of}} ER weapons against modern tanks is cited {{as one of}} the main reasons that these weapons are no longer fielded or stockpiled. With the increase in average tank armor thickness since the first ER weapons were fielded, tank armor protection approaches the level where tank crews are now almost fully protected from radiation effects. Thus, for an ER weapon to incapacitate a modern tank crew through irradiation, the weapon must now be detonated at such a close proximity to the tank that the nuclear explosion's blast would now be equally effective at incapacitating it and its crew. However this assertion was regarded as dubious in a reply in 1986 by a member of the Royal Military College of Science as neutron radiation from a 1 <b>kiloton</b> neutron <b>bomb</b> would incapacitate the crew of a tank with a protection factor of 35 out to a range of 280 meters, but the incapacitating blast range, depending on the exact weight of the tank, is much less, from 70 to 130 meters. However although the author did note that effective neutron absorbers and neutron poisons such as boron carbide can be incorporated into conventional armor and strap-on neutron moderating hydrogenous material (substances containing hydrogen atoms), such as explosive reactive armor, can both increase the protection factor, the author holds that in practice combined with neutron scattering, the actual average total tank area protection factor is rarely higher than 15.5 to 35. According to the Federation of American Scientists, the neutron protection factor of a [...] "tank" [...] can be as low as 2, without qualifying whether the statement implies a light tank, medium tank, or main battle tank.|$|R
5000|$|Such {{a change}} in mass may only happen when the system is open, and the energy and mass escapes. Thus, if a stick of {{dynamite}} is blown up in a hermetically sealed chamber, {{the mass of the}} chamber and fragments, the heat, sound, and light would still be equal to the original mass of the chamber and dynamite. If sitting on a scale, the weight and mass would not change. This would in theory also happen even with a nuclear bomb, if it could be kept in an ideal box of infinite strength, which did not rupture or pass radiation. Thus, a 21.5 <b>kiloton</b> (...) nuclear <b>bomb</b> produces about one gram of heat and electromagnetic radiation, but the mass of this energy would not be detectable in an exploded bomb in an ideal box sitting on a scale; instead, the contents of the box would be heated to millions of degrees without changing total mass and weight. If then, however, a transparent window (passing only electromagnetic radiation) were opened in such an ideal box after the explosion, and a beam of X-rays and other lower-energy light allowed to escape the box, it would eventually be found to weigh one gram less than it had before the explosion. This weight loss and mass loss would happen as the box was cooled by this process, to room temperature. However, any surrounding mass that absorbed the X-rays (and other [...] "heat") would gain this gram of mass from the resulting heating, so the mass [...] "loss" [...] would represent merely its relocation. Thus, no mass (or, {{in the case of a}} nuclear bomb, no matter) would be [...] "converted" [...] to energy in such a process. Mass and energy, as always, would both be separately conserved.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a series}} of nuclear surface tests that were {{carried out by the}} Soviet Union in the early through the mid 1960s, on October 30, 1961 a {{modified}} Tu-95 carried and dropped the AN602 device named Tsar Bomba, which was the most powerful thermonuclear device ever detonated. The bomb was attached outside underneath of the aircraft; carrying the Tsar Bomba semi-externally, somewhat like a B.I Special version of the Avro Lancaster did with a Grand Slam eleven tonne [...] "earthquake bomb", because the Tsar Bomba could not be carried inside a standard Tu-95's bomb-bay. Video footage of that particular test exists as it was filmed for documentation and shows the specially adapted Tu-95V plane - painted with anti-flash white on its ventral surfaces - taking off carrying the bomb, in flight scenes of the interior and exterior of the plane, and the detonation. Along with the Tsar Bomba, the Tu-95 proved to be a versatile bomber that would be the deliverer of the RDS-4 Tatyana, a fission bomb with a yield of forty-two <b>kilotons,</b> RDS-6S thermonuclear <b>bomb,</b> but the designs proved flawed, RDS-37, a 2.9-megaton thermonuclear bomb, and RP-30-32 200-kiloton bombs.|$|R
50|$|In 1953 Scampton {{became a}} Master Diversion Airfield and the Watch Office {{received}} a glass penthouse {{for use by}} the Local Controller.During this period RAF Scampton was supporting four Canberra squadrons; 10 Sqn, 18 Sqn, 21 Sqn and 27 Sqn. The Canberras moved out in 1955 when the station was earmarked as a V-bomber base. RAF Scampton was selected to be one of ten airfields which were to accommodate part of the RAF V-force, in the case of Scampton, the Avro Vulcan. This required extensive new ground facilities, including a high security area for the storage and maintenance of nuclear weapons and heavy-duty hardstandings for the aircraft.The first nuclear weapons to be delivered to Scampton arrived during 1958 and comprised twenty <b>kiloton</b> (20kt) atomic <b>bombs</b> given the Rainbow Code, Blue Danube. They were replaced by the smaller Yellow Sun Stage 1 (Mk. 1s) which were the first of the UK’s operational thermonuclear weapons. The development of the stand-off nuclear missile Blue Steel required the construction of new specialist buildings: the Missile Servicing and Storage Building (MSSB) which was erected between the main hangars and the airfield, and the highly volatile High Test Peroxide (HTP) and kerosene fuel storage buildings which were located at some distance from the MSSB.Additional structures and parts of the layout were also altered. In particular the runway was rearranged to a NE/SW (current designation alignment 04/22) and extended to 9000 ft (2740 metres). This caused the runway to project beyond the north east corner of the base and required the rerouting of Ermine Street (A15), the most noticeable artificial landscape feature in the area and the historic boundary for such elements as parish boundaries and field systems. Trees along the former tree-lined avenue to Hackthorn Park were also removed between the old line of Ermine Street {{and the end of the}} runway. The eastward bulge in the A15 road can still be seen north of Lincoln.During the Cold War period, the airfield developed its current form, imposing on the landscape in a much more spectacular way. Its extent was no longer bounded by existing field boundaries, but by the shape required for the runway extension. This caused the southwest and northwest corners of the base to jut out from the earlier rectangular plan. Areas of hard standing with associated Operational Readiness Platforms (ORPs) were also provided. Technical buildings were also added to in this period. The Unit Storage buildings to the far north of the site were constructed for storage and maintenance of nuclear bombs. Upon the introduction of the Blue Steel stand-off missile, new buildings were constructed just to the north-east of the hangars, to develop, maintain and fuel the missiles. A new Control Tower was constructed close to these buildings to provide a view of the newly expanded runway. Domestic areas were developed as a response to the increased numbers of personnel using the site. These included new barrack blocks to the southeast of the hangar crescent and larger areas of family accommodation.|$|R
