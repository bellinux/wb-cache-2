40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the main threats to agriculture, {{including}} sugarcane agro-ecosystems, affecting the productivity of growers, and forcing them to implement adaptation measures. The study objective was to understand grower perceptions of climate change impact on sugarcane crop and the adaptation actions they are implementing in managing their crop in relation to socioeconomic and technological factors. This work was carried out in <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Module</b> II- 1 Actopan, Veracruz, which serves part of sugarcane areas of the sugar factories La Gloria and El Modelo, Veracruz, Mexico. The <b>Irrigation</b> <b>Module</b> is located in the central region of the Gulf of Mexico. Information was attained by interviewing 90 sugarcane growers. Approximately 81 % of growers had heard of climate change, 97 % perceived changes in climate, 73. 5 % perceived changes in temperature, 87. 8 % perceived changes in precipitation, 49 % in wind and 69 % claimed damages to their agroecosystems from climate change. Using nonparametric statistics (Spearman ranks) (p < 0. 05), there was a high perception by growers of climate change and sufficiently related to the adaptation actions they had implemented (rs = 0. 3225, p = 0. 0002). Given that the socioeconomic level of a producer influences perception level (rs = 0. 561195, p = 0. 0000001) and the development of actions for adapting to climate change (rs...|$|E

For each climate scenario, three sets of numerical experiments were performed: (1) a CTRL experiment in which all crops {{are assumed to be}} rainfed; (2) an IRRIG experiment in which the <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> is activated using surface water (SW) to feed irrigation; and (3) a PUMP experiment in which a groundwater pumping scheme coupled with the <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> is activated for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater (GW) for irrigation. The parameters associated with irrigation and groundwater pumping are calibrated based on a global inventory of census-based water use compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Our results suggest that irrigation could lead to two major effects: SW (GW) depletion in regions with irrigation primarily fed by SW (GW), respectively. Furthermore, irrigation depending primarily on SW tends to have larger impacts on low-flow than high-flow conditions, suggesting increased vulnerability to drought. By the end of the 21 st century, combined effect of increased irrigation water demand and amplified temporal-spatial variability of water supply may lead to severe local water scarcity for irrigation. Regionally, irrigation has the potential to aggravate/alleviate climate-induced changes of SW/GW although such effects are negligible when averaged globally. Our study highlights the need to account for irrigation effects and sources in assessing regional climate change impacts...|$|E

This modelling experiment assesses historic and current irrigation water demands for different crops in five arc minute spatial resolution for pan-Europe. Two different modelling frameworks have been applied in this study. First, soft-coupling the dynamic vegetation model LPJmL with the land use model LandSHIFT leads to overestimations of national irrigation water demands, which are rather high in the southern Mediterranean countries. This {{can be explained by}} unlimited water supply in the model structure and illegal or not gauged water abstractions in the reported data sets. The second modelling framework is WaterGAP 3, which has an integrated conceptual crop specific <b>irrigation</b> <b>module.</b> Irrigation water requirements as modelled with WaterGAP 3 feature a more realistic representation of pan-European water withdrawals.

The pollution of surface and groundwater by coliform bacteria, including Escherichia coli, originate, in general, from point sources of pollution derived from human settlements, such as those located in Module I- 1, Irrigation District 035, La Antigua, Veracruz, Mexico.

40|$|Urmia Lake, in {{north-western}} Iran, is {{an important}} internationally recognized natural area designated as a RAMSAR site and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Over the last 20 years, the surface area of Urmia Lake has declined by 80 %. As a result, the salinity of the lake has sharply increased which is disturbing the ecosystems, local agriculture and livelihoods, regional health, as well as tourism, which could amplify economic, political and ethnic tensions in this already volatile region. In response to that, Iranian government established the ten-year “Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) ” proposing six approaches in terms of controlling, protecting, surveying, studying and supplying water from other sources. This study first assessed {{the main reasons for}} the decreased inflow using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model, including reservoirs and <b>irrigation</b> <b>modules.</b> The results showed that climate change was the main contributor to this inflow reduction. However, water resources development, particularly water use for irrigation, has played a substantial role as well. In the second step assessed Urmia lake inflow under future climate change and irrigation scenarios. Then, the (VIC) model was forced with bias-corrected climate model outputs for both the lowest (RCP 2. 6) and highest (RCP 8. 5) greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios to estimate future water availability. The results showed that the water resources plans are not robust to changes in climate. In other words, if future climate change is limited due to rapid mitigation measures (RCP 2. 6) the new strategy of reduction of irrigation water use can contribute to preserve Urmia Lake. The next step of this study assessed the quantitative impacts of ULRP by introducing a constructive framework. The framework depicts real water saving by distinguishing between water withdrawals, depletion, and demand in the context of uncertainties in future demand and supply. The results showed that although the ULRP helps to increase inflow by up to 57 % it is unlikely to fully reach its target for three main reasons. The first reason is decreasing return flows due to increasing irrigation efficiency. The second reason is increased depletion which is due to neglecting the fact that agricultural water demand is currently higher than available water for agriculture. The third reason is ignoring the potential impact of climate change. However, there still can be some additional none-quantifiable barriers and challenges that may cause the failure of the restoration plan. Therefore, in the last step, this study used two types of qualitative data to explore these aspects: first, the opinions from 40 experts and the in-situ observation of some of the ULRP implementation practices. The results indicate a number of challenges for the ULRP implementation including the water use regulations and the agricultural measures. In addition, (water) demand-side measures such as crop pattern changes were more supported, as opposed to supply-side measures. This thesis showed that the sustainable approach to preserve Urmia Lake should incorporate both demand management (considering socioeconomic complexity) and flexible supply management strategies (to deal with uncertainties in climate variability and change) in a participatory approach. To be prepared for the future, also scenarios with reduced inflow into Urmia Lake, either due to climate change or water resources development, need to be considered to deal with considerable amounts of variability in the current system and with future changes in climate and socioeconomic conditions...|$|R

In this study, we add a novel <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> to the recently released community land model 4. 0 and simulate irrigation in two ways: first, by spraying water above a canopy similar to precipitation to simulate spray irrigation; second, by directly adding water on the ground to simulate flood irrigation. Differences between coupled irrigation and control runs and differences between two irrigation patterns are analyzed globally and in three heavily irrigated countries: the USA, India, and China. Our results show that spray irrigation has greater impacts than flood irrigation on nearsurface climate. Spray and flood irrigation respectively increase evapotranspiration by 4. 33 w/m 2 and 3. 36 w/m 2 and 2 m relative humidity by 0. 36 % and 0. 14 %. In addition, spray and flood irrigation respectively decrease sensible heat flux by 2. 86 w/m 2 and 2. 43 w/m 2, ground temperature by 0. 13 K and 0. 12 K, daily maximum of average 2 m temperature by 0. 1 K and 0. 04 K, soil temperature in top 10 cm of soil by 0. 22 K and 0. 12 K, and vegetation temperature by 0. 12 K and 0. 06 K averaged over irrigated land.

A simulation platform that captures these complex elements {{can be used to}} inform policy and best management practices to promote sustainable agriculture. We have developed a tightly coupled framework using the macroscale variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrologic model and the CropSyst agricultural model. A mechanistic <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> was also developed for inclusion in this framework. Because VIC–CropSyst combines two widely used and mechanistic models (for crop phenology, growth, management, and macroscale hydrology), it can provide realistic and hydrologically consistent simulations of water availability, crop water requirements for irrigation, and agricultural productivity for both irrigated and dryland systems. This allows VIC–CropSyst to provide managers and decision makers with reliable information on regional water stresses and their impacts on food production. Additionally, VIC–CropSyst is being used in conjunction with socioeconomic models, river system models, and atmospheric models to simulate feedback processes between regional water availability, agricultural water management decisions, and land–atmosphere interactions. The performance of VIC–CropSyst was evaluated on both regional (over the US Pacific Northwest) and point scales. Point-scale evaluation involved using two flux tower sites located in agricultural fields in the US (Nebraska and Illinois). The agreement between recorded and simulated evapotranspiration (ET), applied irrigation water, soil moisture, leaf area index (LAI), and yield indicated that, although the model is intended to work on regional scales, it also captures field-scale processes in agricultural areas...|$|E
30|$|The {{modeling}} system developed {{for this research}} was comprised of five modules: (1) hydrologic; (2) reservoir; (3) irrigation; (4) plant growth; and (5) economic (Fig.  3). The first module, hydrologic, allowed streamflow into the reservoir and initial reservoir volume from spring freshet {{to be added to}} the model. The reservoir module then calculated reservoir output based on preexisting dike parameters, evapotranspiration processes, runoff, and withdrawals taken for irrigation purposes. The <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> consisted of irrigation withdrawals and precipitation during the growing season informing water volume available for crops. The plant growth module modeled crop yields using water sufficiency curves and maximum crop yields specific to each crop. In the crop yield simulation, it was assumed that all other crop production inputs, including fertilizers and pesticides, were provided at optimal levels such that available water was the only constraint on crop production The economic module used crop yield outputs in combination with crop prices, crop production costs, and infrastructure costs to determine net revenue for each simulation year.

IDMM (Irrigation District Management Model), a user friendly, GIS based, menu driven personal computer software program, was developed as a planning and management tool for improved water use and crop growth production in irrigation districts. It consists of IRDDESS (Irrigation District Decision Support System), a crop growth and district simulation model that was integrated into ArcView GIS software. To demonstrate the usefulness of the model, its predictions were compared with those observed in real systems with similar situations. The three simulation modules of IDMM were tested for two locations in the Brownsville Irrigation District (BID) in Texas. The POTPROD (potential production) simulation module, was used to simulate daily crop dry matter production and irrigation regimes during one season for four crops: maize, soybean, sorghum, and cotton. Generally, the larger irrigation volumes and more frequent irrigations resulted in the highest yields. The SIMDIRT (simulation under different <b>irrigation</b> treatments) <b>module</b> estimates potential yield under any combination of irrigation regimes. It was tested for sorghum for one crop season with eleven different irrigation regimes. Results show that actual yields were within 4 % of predicted in three of the irrigation regimes.

Proper water management in each farmer's field is important in improving the overall performance of an irrigation district; consequently IDMM's capabilities were demonstrated at the farm and the irrigation district levels.

In the EU-project "SAFIR 1 " a model system was developed that combines irrigation management with risk evaluation, building on research findings from the different research groups in the SAFIR project. The system applies to field scale irrigation management and aims at assisting users in identifying safe modes of irrigation when applying low quality water. The cornerstone in the model system is the deterministic "Plant-Soil-Atmosphere" model DAISY, which simulates crop growth, water and nitrogen dynamics and if required heavy metals and pathogen fate in the soil. The <b>irrigation</b> and fertigation <b>module</b> calculates <b>irrigation</b> and fertigation requirements based on DAISY's water and nitrogen demands. A Water Source Administration module keeps track of water sources available and their water quality, as well as water treatments, storage, and criteria for selection between different sources. At harvest, the soil concentrations of heavy metals and pathogens are evaluated and the risk to consumers and farmers assessed. Crop profits are calculated, considering fixed and variable costs of input and output. The user can run multiple "what-if" scenarios that include access to different water sources (including wastewater), water treatments, irrigation methods and irrigation and fertilization strategies and evaluate model results in terms of crop yield, water use, fertilizer use, heavy metal accumulation, pathogen exposure and expected profit.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{reliability}} of a hydrological modeling framework in a mesoscale (1515  km 2) catchment of the dry Andes (30 ° S) where irrigation water use and snow sublimation represent {{a significant part of}} the annual water balance. To this end, a 20 -year simulation period encompassing a wide range of climate and water-use conditions was selected to evaluate three types of integrated models referred to as A, B and C. These models share the same runoff generation and routing module but differ in their approach to snowmelt modeling and irrigation water use. Model A relies on a simple degree-day approach to estimate snowmelt rates and assumes that irrigation impacts can be neglected at the catchment scale. Model B ignores irrigation impacts just as Model A but uses an enhanced degree-day approach to account for the effects of net radiation and sublimation on melt rates. Model C relies on the same snowmelt routine as Model B but incorporates irrigation impacts on natural streamflow using a conceptual <b>irrigation</b> <b>module.</b> Overall, {{the reliability of}} probabilistic streamflow predictions was greatly improved with Model C, resulting in narrow uncertainty bands and reduced structural errors, notably during dry years. This model-based analysis also stressed the importance of considering sublimation in empirical snowmelt models used in the subtropics, and provided evidence that water abstractions from the unregulated river are impacting on the hydrological response of the system. This work also highlighted areas requiring additional research, including the need for a better conceptualization of runoff generation processes in the dry Andes. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{potential}} large-scale irrigation on the West African monsoon using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology regional climate model (MRCM). A new <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> is implemented to assess {{the impact of}} location and scheduling of irrigation on rainfall distribution over West Africa. A control simulation (without irrigation) and eight sensitivity experiments (with irrigation) are performed and compared to discern the effects of irrigation location and scheduling. It is found that the irrigation effect on soil moisture could force significant changes in spatial distribution and magnitude of rainfall, depending on the latitudinal location of irrigation. In general, the large irrigation-induced surface cooling owing to anomalously wet soil tends to suppress moist convection and rainfall, which in turn induces local subsidence and low-level anticyclonic circulation. These local effects are dominated by a consistent reduction of local rainfall over the irrigated land, irrespective of its location. However, the remote response of rainfall distribution to irrigation exhibits a significant sensitivity to the latitudinal position of irrigation and the intraseasonal variation of supplied irrigation water. The low-level northeasterly airflow associated with an anticyclonic circulation centered over the irrigation area, induced at optimal location and timing, would enhance the extent of low-level convergence areas through interaction with the prevailing monsoon flow, leading to a significant increase in rainfall. As the location of the irrigation area is moved from the coast northward, the regional rainfall change exhibits a significant decrease first, then increases gradually to a maximum corresponding to irrigation centered around 20 °N, before it declines again.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} modelling {{efforts have}} integrated {{food and water}} considerations at the farm or river basin level, very few agro-economic models are able to jointly assess water and food policies at the global level. The present report explores the feasibility of integrating water considerations into the CAPRI model. First, a literature review of modelling approaches integrating food and water issues has been conducted. Three agro-economic models, IMPACT, WATERSIM and GLOBIOM, have been analysed in detail. In addition, biophysical and hydrological models estimating agricultural water use have also been studied, in particular the global hydrological model WATERGAP and the LISFLOOD model. Thanks to the programming approach of its supply module, CAPRI shows a high potentiality to integrate environmental indicators {{as well as to}} enter new resource constraints (land potentially irrigated, irrigation water) and input-output relationships. At least in theory, the activity-based approach of the regional programming model in CAPRI allows differentiating between rainfed and irrigated activities. The suggested approach to include water into the CAPRI model involves creating an <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> and a water use module. The development of the CAPRI water module will enable to provide scientific assessment on agricultural water use within the EU and to analyze agricultural pressures on water resources. The feasibility of the approach has been tested in a pilot case study including two NUTS 2 regions (Andalucia in Spain and Midi-Pyrenees in France). Preliminary results are presented, highlighting the interrelations between water and agricultural developments in Europe. As a next step, it is foreseen to further develop the CAPRI water module to account for competition between agricultural and non-agricultural water use. This will imply building a water use sub-module to compute water use balances. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E

Two forms of treatment of the irrigation water were carried out: one with a chemical product (chlorine) and the other with none. The research used two different filter media: two for each treatment together with a fertigation technique with organic products in both types of treatment. The chemical treatment of the irrigation water was done by chlorination, in which the source of chlorine was sodium hypochlorite. Water from an open reservoir was used, in which a drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> was installed. The temporal variation in water quality over one year was analyzed, taking into consideration the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of water that can cause clogging problems in emitters. The results showed that, in irrigation water, the pH and iron chemical parameters presented an average risk of clogging, and the hydrogen sulfide parameters presented a high risk. The performance of the filters was analyzed by comparing the concentrations of the effluent on the disc and non-woven synthetic fabric filters in relation to the effluent's physical and biological parameters. An attempt was made to follow head loss evolution in relation to the volume filtered by the filters so as to make a comparative analysis. It could be seen that the evolution of head loss was more significant and quicker with the non-woven synthetic fabric filter than with the disc filter The level of clogging in the emitters was calculated by means of a uniform distribution index.

A finer-resolution version (0. 05 ° × 0. 05 °) of the continental-scale hydrological model PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) was {{set up for the}} Limpopo River basin, one of the most water-stressed basins on the African continent. An <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> was included to account for large irrigated areas of the basin. The finer resolution model was used to analyse hydrological droughts in the Limpopo River basin in the period 1979 – 2010 with a view to identifying severe droughts that have occurred in the basin. Evaporation, soil moisture, groundwater storage and runoff estimates from the model were derived at a spatial resolution of 0. 05 ° (approximately 5 km) on a daily timescale for the entire basin. PCR-GLOBWB was forced with daily precipitation and temperature obtained from the ERA-Interim global atmospheric reanalysis product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Two agricultural drought indicators were computed: the Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (ETDI) and the Root Stress Anomaly Index (RSAI). Hydrological drought was characterised using the Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) and the Groundwater Resource Index (GRI), which make use of the streamflow and groundwater storage resulting from the model. Other more widely used meteorological drought indicators, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), were also computed for different aggregation periods. Results show that a carefully set-up, process-based model that makes use of the best available input data can identify hydrological droughts even if the model is largely uncalibrated. The indicators considered are able to represent the most severe droughts in the basin and to some extent identify the spatial variability of droughts. Moreover, results show the importance of computing indicators that can be related to hydrological droughts, and how these add value to the identification of hydrological droughts and floods and the temporal evolution of events that would otherwise not have been apparent when considering only meteorological indicators. In some cases, meteorological indicators alone fail to capture the severity of the hydrological drought. Therefore, a combination of some of these indicators (e. g. SPEI- 3, SRI- 6 and SPI- 12 computed together) is found to be a useful measure for identifying agricultural to long-term hydrological droughts in the Limpopo River basin. Additionally, it was possible to undertake a characterisation of the drought severity in the basin, indicated by its time of occurrence, duration and intensity.

40|$|Urbanization is a {{demographic}} trend worldwide. It is found {{that half of}} all cities with populations greater than 100, 000 are located in water stressed watersheds and are heavily dependent on imported water. Urban irrigation can exceed natural precipitation in these cities and {{is an important component}} of the water cycle. For instance, 14 - 30 % of municipal water consumption in California is used for irrigation. Hence, understanding and quantifying the potential influence of urban anthropogenic soil moisture contribution on local and regional hydrological cycle is an imperative step toward sustainable and better managed water resources in water scarce regions. The first part of current work examines the influence of irrigation on urban hydrological cycles through development of an irrigation scheme within the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) - Urban Canopy Model (UCM) system. The model is run at a 30 -m resolution for a two year period over a study domain in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. A sensitivity analysis indicates significant sensitivity relative to both the amount and timing of irrigation on diurnal and monthly energy budgets, hydrological fluxes and state variables. Monthly residential water use data and three estimates of outdoor water consumption are used to calibrate the developed irrigation scheme. Model performance is evaluated using a previously developed MODIS-(Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) -Landsat evapotranspiration (ET) and Landsat Land Surface Temperature (LST) products as well as hourly ET observations through the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS). Results show that the Noah LSM-UCM realistically simulates the diurnal and seasonal variations of ET when the <b>irrigation</b> <b>module</b> is incorporated. However, without irrigation, the model produces large biases in ET simulations. The ET errors for the non-irrigation simulation are - 56 and - 90 mm/month for July 2003 and 2004, respectively, while these values reduce to - 6 and - 11 mm/month over the same two months when the proposed irrigation scheme is adopted. Results also show that the irrigation-induced increase in latent heat flux leads to a decrease in LST of about 2 °C in urban parks. The developed modeling framework can be utilized for a number of applications, ranging from outdoor water use estimation to climate change impact assessments. In the second part of this work we investigate the utility of remote sensing based surface parameters in the Noah-UCM for a more accurate representation of developed surfaces in this modeling framework. Landsat and fused Landsat-MODIS data are utilized to generate high resolution (30 m) monthly spatial maps of green vegetation fraction (GVF), impervious surface area (ISA), albedo, leaf area index (LAI), and emissivity in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The gridded remotely sensed parameter datasets are directly substituted for the land-use/lookup table based values in the Noah-UCM modeling framework. Model performance in reproducing ET and LST fields is evaluated utilizing Landsat based LST and ET estimates from CIMIS stations as well as in-situ measurements. Our assessment shows that the large deviations between the spatial distributions and seasonal fluctuations of the default and measured parameter sets lead to significant errors in the model predictions of monthly ET fields (RMSE= 22. 06 mm/month). Results indicate that implemented satellite derived parameter maps, particularly GVF, enhance the Noah-UCM capability to reproduce observed ET patterns over vegetated areas in the urban domains (RMSE= 11. 77 mm/month). GVF plays the most significant role in reproducing the observed ET fields, likely due to the interaction with other parameters in the model. Our analysis also shows that remotely sensed GVF and ISA improve the model capability to predict the LST differences between fully vegetated pixels and highly developed areas. In the third part we explicitly address the impacts of urban irrigation by integrating the developed irrigation scheme within the coupled framework of the WRF-UCM over the semi-arid Los Angeles metropolitan area. We focus on the impacts of irrigation on the urban water cycle and atmospheric feedback in arid and semi-arid cities. Our objective is to build upon previous work, focusing on improving the representation of irrigated urban vegetated in the numerical weather prediction models which are now standard tools to study urban-atmosphere interactions. Our results demonstrate a significant sensitivity of WRF-UCM simulated surface turbulent fluxes to the incorporation of irrigation. Introducing anthropogenic moisture, the vegetated pixels show increased latent heat fluxes and decreased sensible and ground heat fluxes confirming irrigation induced shift in the energy partitioning toward elevated latent heat fluxes. The evaluation of the model performance via comparison against CIMIS based reference ET indicates that WRF-UCM, after adding irrigation, performs reasonably during the course of the month, tracking day to day variability of ET with notable fidelity. In the absence of irrigation, simulated ET fluctuations are similar to the CIMIS based ET and irrigated case, in the first few days of simulations. Toward the end of the month, however, the differences between simulated ET and CIMIS based ET 0 become more significant in the not irrigated case. This is due to fact that, in the not irrigated simulation, the soil moisture is the only source of water in the absence of irrigation and significant precipitation. In the course of simulation, the soil moisture sorted in the soil layers is consumed, resulting in considerable decreases in the soil moisture levels in all layers. The soil moisture depletion leads to reduced latent heating and cooling effects of urban vegetation. Analysis of these results indicates the importance of accurate representation of urban irrigation in water scarce regions such as Los Angeles metropolitan area. Moreover, it is found that the initial soil moisture level plays a principal role in disguising the real impacts of irrigation in urban domains and to see the actual impacts of urban irrigation the simulations should be conducted for a longer period of time than one month which is rare in WRF-UCM studies...|$|E
