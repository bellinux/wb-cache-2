5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1783 by Johann Gottlob Schneider as Testudo picta, the painted turtle was called Chrysemys picta first by John Edward <b>Gray</b> <b>in</b> 1855. The four subspecies were then recognized: the eastern by Schneider in 1783, the western by <b>Gray</b> <b>in</b> 1831, and the midland and southern by Louis Agassiz in 1857.|$|E

5|$|There are two subspecies, {{which are}} highly similar and of dubious validity. The {{nominate}} subspecies S. n. nigrescens occurs on the Pacific coastal region from British Columbia to northern California, while S. n. halseii, described by Giraud in 1841, occupies the inland parts of its range. S. n. halseii birds are slightly {{larger and more}} <b>gray</b> <b>in</b> their upperparts.|$|E

5|$|After the Iron Age {{occupation}} {{may have}} {{continued into the}} Roman era indicated by the discovery of pottery fragments, a small stone statue of Mars possibly from a Roman temple and coins of Claudius Gothicus and Valentinian II. The site may still have been occupied into the Anglo-Saxon period. Several of the finds were uncovered during excavations by Harold St George <b>Gray</b> <b>in</b> 1922, although the coin dating from around 370 was discovered in 1945 and a Romano-British relief in the inner defensive ditch in 1974. The relief was given to North Somerset Museum, and loaned to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} 2/19th and 2/20th Battalions, it was {{assigned}} to the 22nd Brigade, which formed part of the 8th Division. The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 18th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were purple over green, in a diamond shape, although a border of <b>gray</b> <b>in</b> an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval shape designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division.|$|E

5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} {{the construction of}} a large number of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. In diameter it measures 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 inches) across. Around thirty small gritstones remain as part of the circle, which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George <b>Gray</b> <b>in</b> 1905.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies of}} morphology, the bluebuck has {{historically}} been classified as either a distinct species or as a subspecies of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English zoologist George Robert <b>Gray</b> <b>in</b> 1821. The Austrian zoologist Franz Friedrich Kohl pointed out the distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.|$|E
5|$|First officially {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum, Hydnum repandum was sanctioned by Elias Fries in 1821. The species has been shuffled to several genera: Hypothele by Jean-Jacques Paulet in 1812; Dentinum by Samuel Frederick <b>Gray</b> <b>in</b> 1821; Tyrodon by Petter Karsten in 1881 Sarcodon by Lucien Quélet in 1886. After a 1977 nomenclatural proposal by mycologist Ronald H. Petersen was accepted, Hydnum repandum became the official type {{species of the}} genus Hydnum. Previously, supporting arguments for making H.repandum the type were made by Marinus Anton Donk (1958) and Petersen (1973), while Zdeněk Pouzar (1958) and Kenneth Harrison (1971) thought that H.imbricatum should be the type.|$|E

5|$|In Bronze Age Britain {{this was}} an {{important}} seaport. Eleven Bronze Age Britain round barrows sit on the promontory with two more a little further inland. Eleven of the round barrows were excavated; three by Bushe Fox in 1911–12 and eight by Harold St George <b>Gray</b> <b>in</b> 1919 and 1922. Two appear to be undisturbed. Numerous finds including Early Bronze Age axes and cremation urns were recovered from these tumuli, which have been consistently found to be between 3500 and 4000 years old.|$|E
