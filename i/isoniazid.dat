5|$|The {{recommended}} {{treatment of}} new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010, is {{six months of}} a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, <b>isoniazid,</b> pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and <b>isoniazid</b> for the last four months. Where resistance to <b>isoniazid</b> is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|Several {{medications}} can worsen pre-existing acne, {{with examples}} being lithium, hydantoin, <b>isoniazid,</b> glucocorticoids, iodides, bromides, and testosterone.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug <b>isoniazid,</b> which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. <b>Isoniazid</b> is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor <b>isoniazid</b> {{increases the risk of}} hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and <b>isoniazid.</b> Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive <b>isoniazid</b> preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, <b>isoniazid,</b> paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patientâ€™s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are <b>isoniazid</b> and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
25|$|If the {{organism}} {{is known to}} be fully sensitive, then treatment is with <b>isoniazid,</b> rifampicin, and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by <b>isoniazid</b> and rifampicin for four months. Ethambutol need not be used.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, {{learning}} of the stimulating side effects of <b>isoniazid,</b> the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that <b>isoniazid</b> improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term antidepressant to describe its action. A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his pulmonology colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952 (before Lurie and Salzer), Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported {{the positive effect of}} <b>isoniazid</b> on depressed patients. The mode of antidepressant action of <b>isoniazid</b> is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of diamine oxidase, coupled with a weak inhibition of monoamine oxidase A.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{antibiotics}} like rifapentine, rifampicin, rifabutine, <b>isoniazid,</b> nitrofurantoin and, possibly, metronidazole.|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide is also {{available}} as part of fixed-dose combinations with other TB drugs such as <b>isoniazid</b> and rifampicin (Rifater is an example).|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, <b>isoniazid,</b> erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis it is often used together with rifampin, <b>isoniazid,</b> and either streptomycin or ethambutol. It is not generally recommended {{for the treatment of}} latent tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Drug-induced lupus {{erythematosus}} is a (generally) reversible condition that usually occurs in people {{being treated for}} a long-term illness. Drug-induced lupus mimics SLE. However, symptoms of drug-induced lupus generally disappear once the medication that triggered the episode is stopped. More than 38 medications can cause this condition, {{the most common of}} which are procainamide, <b>isoniazid,</b> hydralazine, quinidine, and phenytoin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isoniazid</b> {{resistance}} accounts 6.9% of isolates in the UK (2010). Worldwide, it is {{the most}} common type of resistance encountered, hence the current recommendation of using HREZ at the beginning of treatment until sensitivities are known. It is useful to know of current reported outbreaks (like the current outbreak of INH-resistant TB in London).|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} regimen is 2HRE/7HR, {{for which}} there is excellent clinical trial evidence. The 1994 US CDC guidelines for tuberculosis erroneously cite Slutkin as evidence that a nine-month regimen using only <b>isoniazid</b> and rifampicin is acceptable, but almost all of the patients in that study received ethambutol for the first two to three months (although this is not obvious from the abstract of that article). This mistake was rectified in the 2003 guidelines.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{pellagra}}, primary and secondary. Primary pellagra {{is due to a}} diet that does not contain enough niacin and tryptophan. Secondary pellagra is due to a poor ability to use the niacin within the diet. This can occur as a result of alcoholism, long term diarrhea, carcinoid syndrome, Hartnup disease, and a number of medications such as <b>isoniazid.</b> Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and may be assisted by urine testing.|$|E
25|$|In 1944 Albert Schatz, Elizabeth Bugie, and Selman Waksman {{isolated}} streptomycin {{produced by}} a bacterial strain Streptomyces griseus. Streptomycin was the first effective antibiotic against M. tuberculosis. This discovery is generally considered {{the beginning of the}} modern era of tuberculosis, although the true revolution began some years later, in 1952, with the development of <b>isoniazid,</b> the first oral mycobactericidal drug. The advent of rifampin in the 1970s hastened recovery times, and significantly reduced the number of tuberculosis cases until the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{researchers}} {{theorized that}} depression {{was caused by}} a chemical imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of reserpine and <b>isoniazid</b> in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms. During the 1960s and 70s, manic-depression came to refer to just one type of mood disorder (now most commonly known as bipolar disorder) which was distinguished from (unipolar) depression. The terms unipolar and bipolar had been coined by German psychiatrist Karl Kleist.|$|E
25|$|If {{patients}} are discovered to be infected with an isoniazid-resistant strain of TB having completed 2 months of HREZ, {{then they should}} be changed to RE for a further 10 months, {{and the same thing}} if the patient is intolerant to <b>isoniazid</b> (although 2REZ/7RE may be acceptable if the patient is well supervised). The US recommendation is 6RZE with the option of adding a quinolone such as moxifloxacin. The level of evidence for all these regimens is poor, and there is little to recommend one over the other.|$|E
25|$|After {{attending}} {{a conference on}} tuberculosis, Dr. Meyers learned of a procedure that was new in the United States. This operation required the removal of ribs and the upper lobe of her more infected lung, followed by another operation to remove {{the rest of the}} lung. Madonna Swan {{was one of the first}} patients to undergo this new procedure and much was learned about the treatment of TB from her experiences. Following the successful removal of lung and ribs, they were able to treat her remaining lung with an antibiotic designed to kill the TB bacteria (INH, <b>Isoniazid).</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{chemical}} agents, including medications, industrial toxins, and herbal {{and dietary}} supplements, can cause hepatitis. The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury varies from acute hepatitis to chronic hepatitis to acute liver failure. Toxins and medications can cause liver injury {{through a variety}} of mechanisms, including direct cell damage, disruption of cell metabolism, and causing structural changes. Some drugs such as paracetamol exhibit predictable dose-dependent liver damage while others such as <b>isoniazid</b> cause idiosyncratic and unpredictable reactions that vary among individuals. There are wide variations in the mechanisms of liver injury and latency period from exposure to development of clinical illness.|$|E
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate is toxic and {{potentially}} carcinogenic. Nevertheless, the short-term side effects reported in various clinical trials are relatively mild: minor nausea and vomiting, dizziness and excitement, polyneuritis (inflammation of the nerves) and difficulties in fine muscle control (such as writing). However, more serious, even fatal side effects {{have been reported}} in rare cases: one patient developed fatal liver and kidney failure, and another developed serious symptoms of neurotoxicity. These side effects and other reports of hydrazine toxicity are consistent with the hypothesis that hydrazine {{may play a role in}} the toxicity of the antibiotic <b>isoniazid,</b> which is thought to be metabolized to hydrazine in the body.|$|E
25|$|Despite these achievements, {{there were}} signs of {{difficulties}} elsewhere in the country's tuberculosis control program. In the half of China that did not implement the project funded by the World Bank, the prevalence of tuberculosis did not fall during the 1990s. Thus, the fall in tuberculosis prevalence for the entire country slowed to 2.5% per year during the 1990s. The 2000 national tuberculosis survey revealed that one in ten patients with tuberculosis had multi-drug resistant (MDR) disease â€” i.e., resistant to both <b>isoniazid</b> and rifampicin. Other studies confirmed a serious epidemic of MDR tuberculosis in several Chinese provinces, with rates of multidrug resistance in previously untreated cases that were five to ten times higher than the global mean.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} cause of neuropathy is INH. The peripheral neuropathy of INH {{is always a}} pure sensory neuropathy and finding a motor component to the peripheral neuropathy should always prompt a search for an alternative cause. Once a peripheral neuropathy has occurred, INH must be stopped and pyridoxine should be given at a dose of 50mg thrice daily. Simply adding high dose pyridoxine to the regimen once neuropathy has occurred will not stop the neuropathy from progressing. Patients at risk of peripheral neuropathy from other causes (diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, renal failure, malnutrition, pregnancy, etc.) should all be given pyridoxine 10mg daily {{at the start of}} treatment. Please refer to the entry on <b>isoniazid</b> for details on other neurological side effects of INH.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} to agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals and is also an important solvent and reagent. Pyridine is added to ethanol to make it unsuitable for drinking (see denatured alcohol). It is used in the in vitro synthesis of DNA,O 70:20:10)|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/ProductDetail.do?D7=0=SEARCH_CONCAT_PNO%7CBRAND_KEY=59706%7Csial=0=ON=SPEC|publisher=Sigma-Aldrich|accessdate=28 November 2011}} in the synthesis of sulfapyridine (a drug against bacterial and viral infections), antihistaminic drugs tripelennamine and mepyramine, as well as water repellents, bactericides, and herbicides. Some chemical compounds, although not synthesized from pyridine, contain its ring structure. They include B vitamins niacin and pyridoxine, the anti-tuberculosis drug <b>isoniazid,</b> nicotine and other nitrogen-containing plant products. Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar and as a byproduct of coal gasification. However, increased demand for pyridine resulted in the development of more economical methods of synthesis from acetaldehyde and ammonia, and more than 20,000 tonnes per year are manufactured worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, <b>isoniazid,</b> dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
