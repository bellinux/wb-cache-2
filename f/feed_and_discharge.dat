Fixed bed and fluidized bed are typical installations (Schmidt and Kaminsky 2001; Shen and Zhang 2003; Liu et al. 2008), which are generally considered suitable for laboratory research. Rotary barrel device (or rotary kiln) is an optional scheme for continuous processing of materials (Fortuna et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2006; Sun et al. 2017). The rotary barrel device usually fixes up the heating unit on the outer side, heating the material through heat conduction. The whole equipment is usually larger and the heating may not be efficient. On the other hand, continuous <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharging</b> are not very convenient because of the rotary kiln structure characteristic.

This model yields for one space dimension a first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation for the settling and a second-order parabolic partial differential equation for the consolidation of the sediment, where the location of the interface with the change from one equation to the other is in general unknown beforehand.

METHODS: Fifty-one newborns hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital in Southern Brazil, between July 2012 and March 2013, were evaluated. The evaluation of oral feeding skills, according to Lau and Smith, was applied after prescription for starting oral feeding. The oral feeding performance was analyzed using the following variables: days taken to start independent oral <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> hospital <b>discharge.</b> Growth was measured by weight, length, and head circumference, using the curves of Fenton, at birth, first <b>and</b> independent oral <b>feeding,</b> <b>and</b> hospital <b>discharge.</b> RESULTS: At birth, 71 % preterm infants were proper for gestational age, {{most of them were}} males (53 %), with average of 33. 6 (± 1. 5) weeks of gestational age. The gestational age in the assessment did not influence the oral feeding performance of the premature infant and did not differ between levels.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a three-catalytic-reactor network, where an exothermic irreversible reaction occurs, is studied. The network is operated by periodically switching <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharge</b> positions (with the period being 1). We analyzed {{the effect of}} two different switch strategies and observed different spatio-temporal patterns. Such differences result from the different spatio-temporal symmetry that is induced by the switch strategies. Their effect on the stability is studied by comparing the stability range of T-periodic regimes as the switch time is varied for different values of the feed temperature. This analysis is conducted by a numerical continuation technique based on the spatio-temporal symmetry of the forced system. For low (ambient) feed temperature, the stability ranges of a diabatic reactor conform to criteria previously proposed for adiabatic reactors [Sheintuch, M; Nekhamkina, O. AIChE J. 2005, 51, 224].

The vibration spectrum before and after feed are compared to estimate the actual grinding status of the ore inside the mill. A limiting threshold level for the intensity is identified from the spectral analysis to monitor the desired grinding status of the ore. The high frequency (ZigBee) transmission loss due to diffraction is also compensated by the novel arrangement of the sensor transceiver.

In his book La Sucrerie de Cannes Hugot gives a formula showing {{the relationship between the}} various variables affecting the extraction of juice from cane (bagasse) which passes a set of parallel cylindrical rollers.

40|$|Traceability is {{the means}} to {{identify}} and follow real or imaginary lots through a process chain. It gives the opportunity to back-track a chain of events, or to predict process outcomes given the origin of a lot. Traceability {{can be used in}} different areas, e. g., in the middle of 1990 ´s traceability was a hot subject when different cases of food-carried diseases were exposed, but traceability is also used in other process industries to follow material and products during the processing. There is, however, a lack of traceability in continuous processes to compared with batch processes; The reason is that it is more complicated to identify a lot, and reach good traceability, in continuous process just because of they are contiguous. In this work, an example is the continuous ore beneficiation process at LKAB (Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB, Sweden) Malmberget. The purpose is to trace the ore through the grinding sections by parameters and signatures like particle mineralogy, mineral associations and particle texture. To follow the material through the different process steps, analytical methods like optical microscopy and Particle Texture Analysis (PTA) are used In paper I, different traceability methods to achieve traceability in continuous processes are explained. The advantages and disadvantages are presented for each method. Paper II is showing the relations between the materials that comes into the grinding circuits.

We describe a simple technique of excision duodenoplasty (ED) that results in a fixed open anastomosis, which facilitates early commencement of <b>feeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharge</b> from hospital. A retrospective case-note review (1981 - 2000) was undertaken to compare the results of ED with side-to-side duodenoplasty (SSD) and diamond-shaped anastomosis (DD). The outcome measures were days to commencement of feeds, duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and length of hospital stay. In ED a 1. 0 to 1. 5 -cm elleptical segment of dilated duodenum is excised. A longitudinal incision is made in the smaller distal duodenum. A side-to-side one-layer anastomosis is performed. The wall of the proximal duodenal stump is thick, and excision of the ellipse keeps the anastomosis open by preventing apposition or the opposing walls. This facilitates good drainage across the anastomosis. The time to onset of feeding was longer after SSD (median 7 days) compared to ED (5 days) and DD (5 days). The total duration of TPN was also longer for SSD (9 days) in comparison to ED (7 days) and DD (7 days). Although the duration of hospital stay was more for SSD (18 days) than ED (13 days) and DD (16 days), this difference was not statistically significant.

The pilot plant includes an automated process control and data acquisitioning system. The {{primary purpose of the}} pilot plant is to evaluate the performance {{of a large number of}} inter-connected {{centrifugal contactor}}s and obtain temperature profile measurements within a 30 -stage cascade. Additional solvent extraction flowsheet testing using stable surrogates is also being considered. Preliminary hydraulic testing was conducted with all 30 contactors interconnected for continuous counter-current flow. Hydraulic performance and system operational tests were conducted successfully but with higher single-stage rotor speeds found necessary to maintain steady interstage flow at flowrates of 1 L/min and higher. Initial temperature profile measurements were also completed in this configuration studying the performance during single aqueous and two-phase counter-current flow at ambient and elevated inlet solution temperatures. Temperature profile testing of two discreet sections of the cascade required additional <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharge</b> connections. Lamp oil, a commercially available alkane mixture of C 14 to C 18 chains, and tap water adjusted to pH 2 were the solution feeds for all the testing described in this report. Numerous temperature profiles were completed using a newly constructed 30 -stage centrifugal contactor pilot plant. The automated process control and data acquisition system worked very well throughout testing. Temperature data profiles for an array of total flowrates (FT) and contactor rpm values for both single-phase and two-phase systems have been collected with selected profiles and comparisons reported. Total flowrates (FT) ranged from 0. 5 - 1. 4 L/min with rotor speeds from 3500 - 4000 rpm. Solution inlet temperatures ranging from ambient up to 50 ° C were tested. Ambient temperature testing shows that a small amount of heat is added to the processed solution by the mechanical energy of the contactors. The temperature profiles match the ambient temperature of the laboratory but are nearly 10 ° C higher toward the middle of the cascade. Heated input solution testing provides temperature profiles with smaller temperature gradients and are more influenced by the temperature of the inlet solutions than the ambient laboratory temperature.

40|$|During this {{research}} study, a pumped flow biofilm reactor (PFBR) technology developed at NUI Galway for decentralised wastewater treatment was examined at laboratory scale and field scale. The PFBR technology comprised two reactor tanks (<b>Feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>Discharge</b> Reactors), each containing stationary biofilm media modules, with aeration provided by alternately transferring the wastewater {{between the two}} reactor tanks. The aims of {{this research}} include: (i) to investigate {{the characteristics of the}} PFBR in nutrient removal when treating high strength wastewater; (ii) to examine the emission and generation of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in the PFBR when treating wastewater; and (iii) to characterise a field-scale PFBR when treating municipal wastewater arising from a typical Irish town at the NUI Galway Water Research Facility (WRF) in terms of performance, energy consumption, and sludge yield. The laboratory-scale PFBR was operated while treating a high strength synthetic domestic wastewater containing a high phosphorus concentration in a 15 -hour treatment cycle and monitored for carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal over a study period of 195 days. A number of detailed phase studies were also carried out. On average, the total chemical oxygen demand (CODt), filtered total nitrogen (TNf) and ammonium-nitrogen (NHÂ¬ 4 +-N) removal efficiencies were 97 %, 82 % and 99 %, respectively. Enhanced biological phosphorus removal was observed with an average orthophosphate-phosphorus removal of 43 % achieved. Detailed analysis on P release and uptake rates were also carried out and showed that with an extended aeration period, further P could be removed. The generation and emission of N 2 O in the laboratory-scale PFBR was also investigated while treating a high-strength synthetic domestic wastewater. Carbon and nutrient (N and P) removals during a phase study (when operating at steady-state) were examined and compared with the nutrient removal study. Mass transfer coefficients (K), describing the transfer of soluble N 2 O from the liquid phase to the atmosphere due to molecular diffusion in quiescent conditions and enhanced diffusion in bulk fluid circulation conditions, were calculated. The overall generation (G) and emission (Q) of N 2 O in the PFBR while treating synthetic wastewater was then calculated and it was determined that 2. 0 % of the influent total nitrogen was removed through N 2 O emission. The field-scale PFBR was operated and examined during two studies (Studies 1 and 2) treating 25 - 29 m 3 municipal wastewater per day at the NUI Galway WRF. In the 100 -day Study 1, an average 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) removal efficiency of 94 % was achieved, while in 34 -day Study 2, the BOD 5 removal efficiency was up to 95 %. Suspended solids (SS) effluent concentrations were 14 and 9 mg SS/l in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. NH 4 +-N removal efficiencies for Studies 1 and 2 were 80 % and 82 %, respectively. A number of additional parameters were monitored at the field-scale PFBR, including: energy; flow; dissolved oxygen; oxidation-reduction potential; and pH, as well as operational and maintenance requirements. The PFBR has been shown to offer a viable solution for decentralised wastewater treatment due to ease of operation, simple maintenance, low running costs and low sludge yield...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput saw gins. The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a micronaire value of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharge</b> of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform vertical feed results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each feed hopper is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a nip point allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} feed hopper. Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand apron, modifying the conveyor distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the feed hopper motor. Eliminating the uneven lateral feed has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Malnutrition is an {{important}} problem following esophagectomy. A surgically placed jejunostomy secures an enteral feeding route, facilitating <b>discharge</b> with home-tube <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> long-term nutritional support. However, specific complications occur, and data are lacking that support its use over other enteral feeding routes. Therefore routine jejunostomy tube <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharge</b> with home-tube <b>feeding</b> was evaluated, with emphasis on weight loss, length of stay and re-admissions. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer, with gastric tube reconstruction and jejunostomy creation, were analyzed. Two different regimens were compared. Before January 07, 2011 patients were discharged when oral intake was sufficient, without tube feeding. After that discharge with home-tube feeding was routinely performed. Logistic regression analysis corrected for confounders. Results: Some 236 patients were included. The median duration of tube feeding was 35 days. Reoperation for a jejunostomy-related complication was needed in 2 %. The median body mass index (BMI) remained stable during tube feeding. The BMI decreased significantly after stopping tube feeding: from 25. 6 (1 st- 3 rd quartile 23. 0 - 28. 6) kg/m 2 to 24. 4 (22. 0 - 27. 1) kg/m 2 at 30 days later [median weight loss: 3. 0 (1. 0 - 5. 3) kg; 3. 9 % (1. 5 - 6. 3 %) ]. Weight loss was not affected by the duration of tube feeding duration. Routine home-tube feeding did not affect weight loss, admission time or the readmission rate. Conclusions: Weight loss following esophagectomy occurs once that tube feeding is stopped, independently from the time interval after esophagectomy. Moreover routine discharge with hometube feeding does not reduce length of stay or readmissions. These findings question the value of routine jejunostomy placement and emphasize {{the need for further}} research...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to design and develop the {{hydraulic}} model for control oriented injector model for single cylinder four-stroke engine using Matlab Simulink. Injector plays significant role in determining engine performance by controlling the fuel supplied consequently the air to fuel ratio. In order to achieve acceptable accuracy for abroad range of engine speed the control of injection process must be carefully studied. The model consist of hydraulic, electromagnetic and mechanical model. This thesis is carried out with purpose to produces a reliable hydraulic model {{that can be used}} to study the control process. Reasonable mass flow rate data need to be determine by the model based on predetermined boundary condition. The fuel injector based on HDEV 5 were design using Matlab Simulink. The are two different Matlab Simulink design the fuel flow rate coresponding to the radius/diameter ratio and the fuel flow rate corresponding to the needle-seat relative displacement. Based on the graph and explanation, comparison between fuel flow rate and r/d ratio and fuel flow rate and needle-seat relative displacement are made. The result show that there is cavitation occur at r/d = 0. 02 and effect the flow rate of the fuel injected. While in the injector opening phase, the fuel flow rate is slightly increase before the injector reached the transition value. The model of flow through the control volume <b>feeding</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharge</b> holes was further detailed as it was shown to play an important role in determining the flow regime in the orifice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the study of power {{consumption}} in the discharging process of polymer particulate solids in a vane plasticization extruder. The structure and operating principle of the innovational vane extruder are completely different with conventional screw extruders. The process of conveying materials in vane extruder is based on volume transportation. Solids conveying zone is {{the first section of}} polymer processing in extruder. Large amounts of energy are consumed in the zone. The solids conveying process is composed of <b>feeding,</b> compacting <b>and</b> <b>discharging</b> process in the vane extruder. The discharging process is very unique and worthy of further study because of the particularity of the vane extruder. A mathematical model has been developed to analyze the power consumption in the process. The model shows the structural parameters have significant influence on the power consumption. In addition, the model is verified by experimental results...|$|R
