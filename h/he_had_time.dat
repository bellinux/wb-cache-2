5|$|The {{film was}} a success, {{securing}} three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Sound Recording and Best Supporting Actor for Lemmon, who won. While Cagney was not nominated, he had thoroughly enjoyed the production. Filming on Midway Island {{and in a}} more minor role meant that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to relax and engage in his hobby of painting. He also drew caricatures of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> and money to make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that {{he knew nothing about}} Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; at first <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> {{to appear in}} charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans {{to send it to}} France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E
5|$|With {{the energy}} and impetuosity noted by Lang, Henson worked {{continually}} {{over the next seven}} years to improve the parish, restoring the fabric of the church, opening clubs for his parishioners, and holding popular open-air services in the vicarage grounds. At Barking his high-church leanings were welcomed, and he was invited to preach from time to time at St Alban's Holborn, a central London bastion of Anglo-Catholicism. He was never physically strong, and his relentless work at Barking put a strain on his physique. In 1895 he accepted an offer from Lord Salisbury of a less arduous post, the chaplaincy of St Mary's Hospital, Ilford, which he held until 1900. In 1895 and 1896, Henson was select preacher at Oxford, and from 1897 he served as chaplain to John Festing, Bishop of St Albans. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> for writing; between 1897 and 1900 he published four books, ranging from purely theological studies to analyses of Church politics. His beliefs had changed from his early high-churchmanship to a broad-church latitudinarianism; his 1899 Cui bono? set out his concerns about the strict ritualists in the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church.|$|E

25|$|In 1736, the {{explorer}} James Cook's {{family moved to}} Airey Holme Farm at nearby Great Ayton.

25|$|When Scheiner went to Rome in 1624, friends {{asked him}} to write about his solar observations. At last <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> for {{mathematical}} books, among them Galilei’s Il saggiatore, which contains Galileo's work on sunspots. This was similar to Scheiner's own work (unsurprisingly, since both were observing at the same time) but led to allegations from both of plagiarism by the other, and to a deep enmity between the two scientists.|$|E
25|$|Writing to Darwin in 1871, Matthew {{enclosed}} {{an article}} {{he had written}} for The Scotsman and, as well as wishing that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to write a critique of The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, expressed the belief that {{there is evidence of}} design and benevolence in nature, and that beauty cannot be accounted for by natural selection. Such a belief is mainstream natural theology, and reveals how far Matthew was from Darwin in realising the potential of evolutionary explanations: for him as well as others, man was the sticking-point.|$|E

25|$|Alfredsson {{was arguably}} Ottawa's {{best player in}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, which the Senators {{ultimately}} lost to the Anaheim Ducks in a five-game series. In a controversial incident in game four, an Alfredsson slap shot hit Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer {{at the end of the}} second period, leading to speculation that Alfredsson intended to injure Niedermayer. Alfredsson dismissed the notion, saying that he had glanced up at the clock to see if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to move in for a better shot, and then quickly fired in the heat of an important game.|$|E
25|$|Even though López did not {{participate}} in the 1941 event, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to join the Venezuelan league after returning from Cuba. He was unquestionably the dominant pitcher in the circuit, fashioning a ledger of 9-4 with 55 strikeouts and a 0.67 ERA to win the pitching Triple Crown, while handling a 121-inning work in his first full season for Magallanes, allowing also only nine earned runs on 67 hits and 22 walks. As an ace pitcher and cleanup hitter, he also hurled two no-hitters, led in innings pitched, and smashed the only home run of the tournament. Although this was a wasted effort, because of the fact of his team lost the final and decisive game to the eventual champions Patriotas de Venezuela.|$|E
25|$|From the 1902 season, Johnson began {{appearing}} in County Championship matches for Somerset. His qualification {{for the county}} would {{appear to have been}} fairly flimsy: there is a story, which is also told of a later Somerset cricketer, Tom Lowry, that the county put his birthplace down as Wellington, which was true, without bothering to volunteer that it was not, in fact, the town of that name in Somerset. Employed as a stockbroker, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> for fairly regular appearances in 1902 and 1903, fewer in 1904 and 1905, and then more again in 1906. From then until the First World War, Johnson appeared in only a handful of matches in each season, but for five seasons from 1921 to 1925 he was nearly always in the Somerset side, finally retiring after a few unsuccessful matches in 1927.|$|E

25|$|Garry Sobers, the West Indies' {{captain and}} their best cricketer, caused {{controversy}} by {{playing in a}} double-wicket competition in Rhodesia in September 1970. Although Sobers spent only 48 hours in Salisbury, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> for a meal with the prime minister, Ian Smith, and described him as a great man to talk to. Sobers' statement and his participation in the tournament gave Caribbean politicians {{an opportunity to make}} clear their hatred of apartheid and racism. The Guyanese prime minister, Forbes Burnham, said Sobers was not welcome in his country until there was an apology. The Jamaican government called for his resignation as captain. The Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, forbade the Indian cricket team to tour the West Indies until the matter was sorted out. Sobers initially argued that he had done nothing wrong as he was a cricketer, not a politician, but ultimately apologised in October 1970 when the scandal threatened to break the West Indies team.|$|E
25|$|On April 23, 1864, when Steele {{received}} the dispatch from Banks asking that he join Banks {{so they could}} move again on Shreveport, Steele responded {{that he was in}} no position to join Banks. He also noted that he now faced not only Confederate cavalry but Sterling Price's returned infantry and additional infantry under Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had joined Price with some of the infantry which had been with Taylor at the battle of Pleasant Hill. Brigadier-General Thomas Churchill’s Arkansas division and Brigadier-General Mosby Parsons's Missouri division had returned to Price's command. They were followed by Major-General John Walker’s larger Texas division with Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had decided that Steele was a bigger threat, and a bigger prize, than Banks when Banks continued to retreat after the battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, 1864. Kirby Smith thought he could destroy Steele's force and perhaps still turn back and trap Banks later. Taylor vehemently disagreed with this decision and wanted to attack Banks immediately. Nonetheless, Taylor could not convince Kirby Smith to change his plan. As Banks appeared to be waiting for the naval force at Alexandria, Louisiana, Kirby Smith became even more certain that his decision was correct and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to execute it.|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{diagnosis}} as an [...] "embuggerance" [...] {{in a radio}} interview, Pratchett appealed to people to [...] "keep things cheerful" [...] and proclaimed that [...] "we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism." [...] He stated he felt <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> for [...] "at least a few more books yet", and added that while he understood the impulse to ask [...] "is there anything I can do?", in this case he would only entertain such offers from [...] "very high-end experts in brain chemistry." [...] Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software.|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{historic}} championship title, Gore was not {{enthusiastic about}} the new sport of lawn tennis. In 1890, thirteen years after winning his championship title, he wrote: [...] "...it is want of variety that will prevent lawn tennis {{in its present form}} from taking rank among our great games... That anyone who has really played well at cricket, tennis, or even rackets, will ever seriously give his attention to lawn tennis, beyond showing himself to be a promising player, is extremely doubtful; for in all probability the monotony of the game as compared with others would choke him off before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to excel in it." [...] He did return for the 1878 Championship to defend his title in the Challenge Round but lost in straight sets to Frank Hadow, a coffee planter from Ceylon, who effectively used the lob to counter Gore's net play. It was Gore's last appearance at the Wimbledon Championships.|$|E

Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) had taken an interest in Kate {{and he did not}} like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle. McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate, it forced Mark {{to come up with a}} plan to get closer to his ex-girlfriend. McGregor said, [...] "He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through!" [...] Mark later asked Lucas for his advice, but Lucas was not much help. Both Kate and Mark wanted to get back together and Brewer said, [...] "They both have a lot of history, such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which really hurts Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward." [...] The actress believed Mark was [...] "the one" [...] for Kate as they were both academic and focused.|$|E
500|$|The {{management}} professor Peter Drucker credits Kafka {{with developing}} the first civilian hard hat while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, {{but this is}} not supported by any document from his employer. His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a , literally [...] "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store. In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term [...] ("The Close Prague Circle") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.|$|E
