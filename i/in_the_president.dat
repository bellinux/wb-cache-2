5|$|Singapore has a multi-party {{parliamentary}} system of representative democracy {{in which the}} President of Singapore {{is the head of}} state and the Prime Minister of Singapore is the head of government. Executive power is vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Cabinet. Cabinet has the general direction and control of the government and is collectively responsible to the Parliament. There are three separate branches of government: the legislature, executive and judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>President</b> of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} Government of Singapore as the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. The {{executive}} authority of Singapore is vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and is exercisable by him {{or by the}} Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role {{in the executive branch}} of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergence}} {{of political parties}} and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of 1796 and 1800. In 1796, Federalist Party candidate John Adams won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was Democratic-Republican Party candidate Thomas Jefferson, the Federalists' opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and vice president not being of the same political party.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difference}} with similar offices {{is that the}} overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the Council of Ministers.

25|$|Article II of the Confederate States Constitution vested the {{executive}} {{power of the}} Confederacy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> The power included the execution of law, alongside the responsibility of appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate.

25|$|The 2005 Kenyan {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 21 November 2005. The main issue of contention in the Constitution review process was how much power should be vested in the Kenyan Presidency. In previous drafts, those who feared a concentration of power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> added provisions for European-style power-sharing between a ceremonial President elected via universal suffrage and an executive Prime Minister elected by Parliament. The draft presented by the Attorney General Amos Wako for the referendum retained sweeping powers for the Presidency.|$|E

25|$|On April25, a {{majority}} of voters expressed confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and called for new legislative elections. Yeltsin termed the results a mandate for him to continue in power. Before the referendum, Yeltsin had promised to resign, if the electorate failed to express confidence in his policies. Although this permitted the president to declare that the population supported him, not the parliament, Yeltsin lacked a constitutional mechanism to implement his victory. As before, {{the president had to}} appeal to the people {{over the heads of the}} legislature.|$|E
25|$|Executive {{power is}} vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Cabinet of ministers. The President however is not {{politically}} responsible {{for carrying out}} his duties and all his orders have to be signed by the Prime Minister or by the appropriate Minister who thereby becomes responsible for this order. There are two exceptions to this rule - the President can single-handedly decide to dissolve the Saeima and when a new government is formed {{it is up to}} him to choose a new Prime Minister.
