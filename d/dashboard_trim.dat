2500|$|At {{the same}} time in Japan, Toyota {{released}} the 14R-60 model limited to 100 units, inspired by the GT86 TRD Griffon Project of 2013. Its engine power remains the same as the standard models despite featuring various drivetrain changes such as twin central exhausts, a TRD mechanical LSD, a short-shifter, and revised gearing for the six-speed manual transmission. Other changes include extra body reinforcement, a variable-height coil-over spring suspension setup and more rigid suspension bushings. A TRD bodykit with carbonfibre components is complemented by 18inch magnesium wheels and, overall, 14R-60 model results lighter than the base model. Inside there are race-style bucket seats with four-point belts, an Alcantara-clad steering wheel, carbonfibre <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> and yellow piping and highlights. Price-wise, this Japan-only model is listed for , which is significantly higher than the [...] for the base RC model or [...] for the top-of-the-range GT Limited.|$|E
50|$|For {{model year}} 2009, the XLR {{added a new}} front fascia, new rear fascia, and chrome side fender vents. Inside, Alcantara - a suede-like {{microfiber}} material - was added for the headliner. The interior added new instrument cluster trim rings with revised graphics, (removal of the Bulgari logo) and new wood <b>dashboard</b> <b>trims.</b> Production of the XLR ended {{in the spring of}} 2009, with the final example completed on March 31.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2013, Volvo debuted a {{refreshed}} {{version of}} the XC60, to be released for the 2014 model year. Exterior updates are primarily cosmetic, with changes to the grille and front driving lights, loss of black cladding along the lower doorsills, and {{minor changes to the}} exhaust tips and taillights. Interior updates include new materials and <b>dashboard</b> <b>trims,</b> available paddle shifter on the T6 model, and introduction of a 7" [...] touch-screen display.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{a version}} of Nissan Note {{inspired}} by multi-sports brand [...] "adidas", with user-changeable treatment on the front/rear bumpers; fabrics and rubber materials used on <b>dashboard,</b> door <b>trim,</b> etc.|$|R
2500|$|In 1977 a 2.0-litre {{model was}} added. Launched at the March Geneva Motor Show, the Alfetta 2000 {{replaced}} the outgoing Alfa Romeo 2000. This range-topping Alfetta was [...] {{longer than the}} others, owing to a redesigned front end with square headlights and to larger bumpers with polyurethane inserts; the rectangular tail light clusters and C-pillar vents were also different. Inside there were a new dashboard, steering wheel and upholstery materials. Just a year later, in July 1978, the two-litre model was updated becoming the Alfetta 2000 L. Engine output rose from 122PS to 130PS (DIN); inside upholstery was changed again and <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> went from brushed aluminium to simulated wood. The Alfetta 2000 was sold as the Alfa Romeo Sport Sedan in the United States, where [...] "Alfetta" [...] {{did not have the}} same cachet as in Europe. The 2000 received fuel injection in 1979.|$|E
50|$|Aero Style - This included: More {{aggressive}} front lip, rear lip, spoiler {{and side}} skirts. Larger alloy wheels, Silver <b>Dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> and leather interior.|$|E
50|$|The term usually {{refers to}} {{thermoplastic}} materials rather than thermosetting ones. Examples of engineering plastics include {{acrylonitrile butadiene styrene}} (ABS), used for car bumpers, <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> and Lego bricks; polycarbonates, used in motorcycle helmets; and polyamides (nylons), used for skis and ski boots.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} binnacle of the XJ40 and X300 {{was replaced}} on the X308 with three large, separate gauges set into recesses in the curved <b>dashboard.</b> Door <b>trim</b> {{and the design}} of the center console were also slightly revised.|$|R
25|$|The 1969 XW Falcon {{introduced}} bolder styling {{which featured}} raised ridges down each front guard and a 'buttressed' c-pillar (although the rear windscreen was not relocated), {{which made the}} cars appear larger than the XR/XT models. A new <b>dashboard</b> and <b>trim</b> variations also appeared. Factory-fitted fully integrated air conditioning was made available as an option for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Base model {{cars were}} well equipped, but deleted certain {{features}} such as the navigation system and Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS), and substituted plastic simulated wood for the <b>dashboard</b> maple wood <b>trim.</b>|$|R
50|$|Comparing to Pars, the ELX {{features}} smart instrument cluster, multi-purpose Persian-reading dashboard telematics, alarm with door auto-lock, park assistant, electric Recaro cloth seats {{equipped with}} heater/cooling fan, luxury <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim,</b> passenger illuminated vanity mirror, {{a more powerful}} 16 valve engine, 4-disc brakes with ABS/EBD, and finally rally alloy wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{car came}} with {{a long list of}} {{standard}} equipment (including leather seats, <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> made of Taiwanese camphor laurel wood, and headrests) and was very expensive for Japanese standards. This concerned also the less luxurious 1800N version added in 1971, powered by a simpler 1.8 L SOHC carbureted engine.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with a major}} {{facelift}} for the 2010 model year, the top end Outlander XLS (GT in the US) {{introduced a}} new colour MFD dashboard display and the Mitsubishi S-AWC AWD system. The lower trims retain the previous MFD and the less advanced AWC AWD system. Likewise, the interior was also slightly revised to incorporate leather into the <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> and doors.|$|E
50|$|Proton made {{minor changes}} to the taillights, bumpers, and <b>dashboard.</b> Five <b>trim</b> levels were available. The 1.6 and 1.8 litre model(4G92/4G93) were {{equipped}} with rear disc brakes, front and rear armrests, electric mirrors, folding rear seats, electric windows on all doors, and a high quality interior. Proton redesigned the saloon to make a five-door hatchback variant during the mid 1990s, basing the car on the saloon Wira and sporting similar tail lights.|$|R
50|$|Produced {{for only}} one year between 1973 and 1974, the 3000ML was a special luxury version of the 3000M that {{included}} a walnut veneer <b>dashboard,</b> leather <b>trim,</b> Wilton carpets, sunroof, and high-backed seats of a style different from {{those found in the}} standard cars. It also featured extra soundproofing and a roof liner made using West of England cloth. A total of 654 naturally aspirated 3000Ms were built, including both the standard and luxury trim levels.|$|R
25|$|The Caprice was {{intended}} {{to compete with the}} Ford LTD, Plymouth VIP, AMC's Ambassador DPL, and even the smaller Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. These models included luxuriously upholstered interiors with simulated wood <b>dashboard</b> and door-panel <b>trim,</b> thicker carpeting, sound insulation, courtesy lighting, and more upscale exterior trims.|$|R
50|$|Inside, the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph and the Bentley Arnage {{were similar}} but quite {{distinct}} from one another. In the Seraph, the gear selector was column-mounted and the gauges followed a traditional Rolls-Royce layout (for example, {{there was no}} tachometer). In both cars, the seats and dashboard were upholstered in Connolly Leather, with <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> and folding picnic trays for rear passengers faced with glossy burl walnut veneer.|$|E
5000|$|... 1952 - Outer {{door handles}} are now push button type {{as opposed to}} the {{previous}} turn down style. Speedometer now reads to 90 mph and <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> is painted instead of chrome. Mid-year, Chevrolet stops using the 3100-6400 designation on the hood and changes to maroon window and wiper knobs. New serial number codes: KP ½ ton, KR ¾ ton, & KS 1 ton.|$|E
5000|$|In recent years, {{spurred on by}} {{the growing}} {{aftermarket}} use of dash kits, many automakers have taken the initiative to add more stylistic elements to their dashboards. One prominent {{example of this is}} the Chevrolet Sonic which offers both exterior (e.g., a custom graphics package) and interior cosmetic upgrades. In addition to OEM <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> and upgrades a number of companies offer domed polyurethane or vinyl applique dash trim accent kits or [...] "dash kits." ...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{a higher}} price, the GAZ-3102 enjoyed {{relatively}} good sales, and remained in demand. Compared to the GAZ-31029, {{it had a}} notably higher reputation for build quality. When the former was to be retired, and replaced with the GAZ-3110, the 3102 was fitted with 3110 upgrades, but not upgraded externally, as its look had become classic. The upgrades included a 5-speed gearbox, fuel-injected ZMZ-406 engine, ventilated Lucas disc brakes, a single rear axle, power steering, new electric <b>dashboard</b> and <b>trim.</b> In fact, all these features would be first tested on the GAZ-3102, before being introduced to the mass-produced Volga.|$|R
50|$|Borealis {{supplies}} {{polyolefin plastic}} materials for engineering {{applications in the}} automotive industry. Plastic materials replace conventional materials such as metal, rubber and engineering polymers. In automotive vehicles, Borealis’ polyolefin plastic materials are used {{in a wide range}} of exterior, interior, and under-the-bonnet applications, including bumpers, body panels, <b>trims,</b> <b>dashboards,</b> door claddings, climate control and cooling systems, air intake manifolds and battery cases.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was luxurious with polished walnut for the <b>dashboard</b> and door <b>trims</b> and leather seats, {{individual in the}} front and a bench at the rear with a central fold down arm rest. There were also adjustable arm rests on the front doors. A heater, radio and built in hydraulic jacks were standard equipment. Single or two tone paint schemes were available.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 and 2006, {{all models}} came {{standard}} with [...] "genuine curly maple wood dashboard trim." [...] With {{the introduction of}} three trim levels, the genuine curly maple wood <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> now only appeared on the two higher level cars: the Technology Package and the Technology Package with CMBS/PAX. OnStar was deleted as a feature from all trim levels. Colors were added and deleted. MSRP increased by $100 from the roughly equivalent 2006 trims.|$|E

5000|$|All R/Ts {{were built}} in Mexico. A total of 1,208 were sold in the U.S. in 1991 [...] - [...] 774 in red and 434 in white. An {{additional}} 191 were sold in the U.S. in 1992 [...] - [...] 92 red, 68 white, and 31 silver. The only discernible changes for 1992 were a lower first gear ratio for reduced turbo lag, woodgrain <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> as used on the Chrysler LeBaron sedan, blacked out upper and lower grille inserts, clear rather than amber lenses for the front parking and turn signal lights, and a speedometer calibrated to 150 mph rather than 120 mph.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1977, the 132 {{received}} a further facelift. New plastic [...] "safety" [...] bumpers {{were introduced to}} the model, and the gearing of the steering was raised, supported by the addition of servo-assistance. Inside were a new <b>dashboard</b> and seat <b>trims.</b> At this point, with the 130 having been discontinued, the 132 became the [...] "flagship" [...] of the Fiat range.|$|R
50|$|A special Exclusive {{grade was}} {{introduced}} for 2016 which {{comes with a}} new bodykit integrated with LED daytime running lights, black leather seats, grey <b>dashboard</b> and door <b>trim,</b> piano black steering wheel and gearlever trim {{as well as a}} T-Connect infotainment system with a seven-inch touchscreen and Bluetooth connectivity.

25|$|Standard features, {{which focused}} on comfort and luxurious appearance, {{included}} deluxe exterior trim, individual reclining front seats, front and rear center armrests when bucket seats were selected, and interiors from AMC's two-door Ambassador model, including dashboard and instrument panel. On the Marlin, the <b>dashboard</b> was <b>trimmed</b> with engine-turned aluminum. Interior door panels were finished with carpeting and stainless steel trim, when many cars at the time had cheaper stamped vinyl glued to cardboard. Retractable front seatbelts were optional. The reclining bucket seats could be ordered with headrests. The Marlin {{was also one of}} the first American automobiles with front disc brakes (four-piston design, by Bendix) as standard. It had drum brakes without servo assistance on the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Engine bonnet, {{boot lid}} and the fixed hard top are fibreglass, painted matt black, {{the rear window}} is perspex and the doors aluminium. Front and rear bumpers were deleted and {{replaced}} by simple rubber bumperettes. A single matte black wing mirror was fitted.Matte black wheel arch extensions house 185/70 VR 13 Pirelli CN 36 tyres on 5.5 J × 13" [...] four-spoke alloy wheels.Inside centre console, rear occasional seats, and glovebox lid were eliminated; while new features were anodised aluminium <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim,</b> a small three-spoke leather-covered Abarth steering wheel, and Recaro corduroy-and-leather bucket seats as an extra-cost option.The car carries Fiat badging front and rear, Abarth badges and [...] "Fiat Abarth" [...] scripts on the front wings, and Abarth wheel centre caps.Only three paint colours were available: Corsa red, white, and light blue.|$|E
50|$|Introduced for the 1977 model year, the Lincoln Continental Mark V {{was a major}} {{revision}} of the Mark IV. The rounded styling of the previous generation {{gave way to a}} sharper-edged look. Interior design remained similar to the Mark IV, with variants in the seat patterns and <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> (while retaining the general dashboard layout of the IV) being the primary differences. As the Ford Thunderbird was downsized and based upon the intermediate chassis utilized by the Ford LTD II and Mercury Cougar XR7, the Mark V utilized its own chassis. The Mark V was larger and more complex than its predecessor, coming just ten inches short of 20 ft long. The electrical system and mechanical componentry shared less in common with other Ford products, and was harder to service than the corresponding equipment on the Mark IV.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand {{importer}} and CKD assembler Todd Motors {{also created}} {{its own unique}} versions of the Arrow line. The single 1967 launch version (1725 cc aluminium head engine with four-speed manual transmission or three-speed Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission with twin front seats) was almost identical to its UK counterpart but Todd started to use its own upholstery designs from the 1969 rectangular headlight update. For 1970, it added a silver rear trim panel and a 'by Chrysler' boot lid badge to the Hunter saloon and introduced the estate although this had a lower specification than the saloon - an iron head 1725 cc engine, no automatic option, simpler <b>dashboard</b> <b>trim</b> (no locking glovebox), interior door pull handles instead of armrests (sedans had them on the three passenger doors), painted rather than bright metal door window frame trim and fixed rather than opening front quarter-lights.|$|E
50|$|From 1966 to 1969, {{a luxury}} {{version of the}} Fury, called the Plymouth VIP (marketed as the Very Important Plymouth in 1966) was fielded, in {{response}} to the Ford LTD, Chevrolet Caprice, and the AMC Ambassador DPL. These models came with standards such as full wheel covers, vinyl tops, luxuriously upholstered interiors with walnut <b>dashboard</b> and door-panel <b>trim,</b> a thicker grade of carpeting, more sound insulation, and full courtesy lighting.|$|R
50|$|The {{windscreens}} {{were now}} bonded; {{all of these}} changes increased torsional rigidity considerably while still allowing a deeper opening for the bootlid of the sedan. The taillights were also redesigned and the trim piece between them removed, all {{in the image of}} the bigger 605. The interior was also redone, with an allnew <b>dashboard</b> and door <b>trim,</b> inheriting lots of detail parts as well as the overall appearance from the 605.|$|R
50|$|This {{generation}} Town & Country {{shared the}} Plymouth Voyager's headlight and taillight clusters; the Dodge Caravan had its own. The Town & Country was set apart {{on the exterior}} by its chrome (later body colored) waterfall grille, crystal pentastar hood ornament, body colored side mirrors, body side cladding, and unique alloy wheels. The interior of the Town & Country included standard leather seating surfaces, woodgrain <b>dashboard</b> and door <b>trim,</b> {{as well as a}} digital instrument cluster.|$|R
