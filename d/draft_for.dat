5|$|The Pirates {{have failed}} once in signing a draft pick. This {{occurred}} in 2012, when the Pirates selected RHP Mark Appel from Stanford University, who sought a significant bonus which, {{according to new}} MLB rules, would have cost the Pirates a future draft pick.

5|$|At his Pro Day workout, Vick ran the 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds; {{his time}} has been clocked as low as 4.25, which is the fastest-ever for an NFL quarterback. Vick was {{selected}} first in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons, becoming the first African-American quarterback to be taken with the top pick.

5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its <b>draft</b> <b>for</b> stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the die. All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require <b>draft</b> <b>for</b> the proper ejection of the casting from the die. Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military <b>draft</b> <b>for</b> peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E

5|$|Eragon is {{the first}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. After writing the first <b>draft</b> <b>for</b> a year, Paolini spent a second year {{rewriting}} and fleshing out the story and characters. His parents saw the final manuscript and in 2001 decided to self-publish Eragon; Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. By chance, the book was discovered by Carl Hiaasen, who got it re-published by Alfred A. Knopf. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003.|$|E
5|$|For a given tonnage, {{the second}} factor which governs the ship's {{dimensions}} {{is the size of}} the ports and waterways it will travel to. For example, a vessel that will pass the Panama Canal will be limited in its beam and <b>draft.</b> <b>For</b> most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, with an average of 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after {{disagreements}} between Disney's Michael Eisner and Pixar's Steve Jobs {{over the}} distribution of Pixar's films, Disney announced {{that they would be}} creating a new animation studio, Circle 7 Animation, to make sequels to the seven Disney-owned Pixar films (which consisted of the films released between 1995 and 2006). The studio had put Toy Story 3 and Monsters University into development, and had hired screenwriter Laurie Craig to write a <b>draft</b> <b>for</b> Finding Dory. Circle 7 was subsequently shut down after Robert Iger replaced Eisner as CEO of Disney and arranged the acquisition of Pixar.|$|E
