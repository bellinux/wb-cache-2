40|$|A post-sale {{restraint}} is {{a condition}} or contract provision that operates after a good has been sold. In antitrust law these restraints are roughly divided into two classes, “intrabrand” and “interbrand. ” An intrabrand restraint limits the way a firm can distribute the restricted property. For example, resale price maintenance controls the price at which goods can be resold. Intrabrand nonprice restraints place other types of limits, such as the places from which goods can be sold, the uses for which they can be sold, and the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>buyers.</b> By contrast, an interbrand restraint limits a purchaser’s right to deal in the goods of rivals. “Exclusive dealing” involves a buyer’s promise not to purchase competing goods from anyone else, and “tying” refers to a buyer’s promise {{to take a second}} product from this seller as well. Intellectual property policy also has a set of rules that limit post-sale restraints. Many of these are addressed under the rubric of intellectual property “misuse,” whose rules are similar but not identical to antitrust rules. A third rule, the IP “exhaustion” or “first sale” requirement, applies to these same restraints as well. Unlike both antitrust doctrine and misuse doctrine, the first sale rule refuses to enforce post-sale restraints without querying into anticompetitive effects, economic benefits or impact on innovation. Whatever policy justifications the judge made first sale rule may have, they were not made apparent in the Supreme Court’s 2008 Quanta decision. At this writing the Supreme Court has granted certiorari in another post-sale restraint decision, this one involving copyright law and resale price maintenance. Quanta ended a trend in both the Supreme Court and Federal Circuit of using the law of post-sale restraints to prohibit unreasonable limitations on competition or innovation, while permitting the market to govern their use otherwise. Instead the Court reverted to a per se rule that refuses to enforce post-sale restraints without regard to economic consequences. While rationales exist for the first sale doctrine, these pertain to whether breach of contract suits or infringement actions are better devices for downstream enforcement of IP restraints and the extent of notice communicated to downstream infringers. But these considerations were also irrelevant to the per se rule that the Supreme Court adopted. This paper critiques this approach to first sale doctrine, concluding that it lacks a coherent policy justification and that it undermines a decades long trend toward increasing sophistication in the analysis of vertical restraints involving intellectual property rights...|$|E

Abstract: Evidence on adverse selection in slave markets remains inconclusive.

In addition to slave characteristics, the acts document the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> and sellers. We use this information to determine whether the <b>buyer</b> <b>of</b> a slave was related (e. g. a relative or a spouse) to the original slave owner, and thus most likely better–informed than other bidders.

40|$|Much {{of modern}} {{micro-economics}} is built from {{the starting point}} of the perfectly competitive market. In this model there are an infinite number <b>of</b> agents — <b>buyers</b> and sellers, none of whom has the power to influence the price by his actions. The good is well-defined, indeed it is perfectly standardized. And any interactions agents have is mediated by the market. That is, all transactions are anonymous, {{in the sense that the}} <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> and seller are unimportant. Effectively, the seller sells “to the market” and the buyer buys “from the market”. This follows from the standardization of the good, and the fact that the market imposes a very strong discipline on prices. Implicit here is one (or both) of two assumptions. Either all agents are identical in every relevant respect, apart, possibly, from the prices they ask or offer; or every agent knows every relevant detail about every other agent. If the former, then obviously my only concern as a buyer is the prices asked by the population of sellers since in every other way they are identical. If the latter, then each seller has a unique good, and again what I am concerned with is the price of it.

For copyright infringement, our proposed scheme enables the seller to identify the specific buyer from whom an illegal copy of the watermarked image has originated, and further prove this fact to a third party. For multiple ownership claims, our scheme enables a legal seller to claim his/her ownership {{in the court of}} law. We will show that the combination of cryptography with watermarking not only increases the security of the overall scheme, but it also enables to associate <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> buyer/seller with their respective watermarked images.|$|R

Over eighteen months in 1964 and 1965, agents secretly working for Disney attorneys purchased 27,400 acres of Florida ranchland, swamp, scrub woods and road frontage for an average price of only R5.20 per acre ($5 million total). It is unlikely that Disney {{would have been able to}} acquire the land except at prohibitively high prices of hundreds of thousands of dollars per acre had the sellers known their buyer's identity, given the prices at which nearby land sold after Disney completed its acquisitions and publicly announced its plan.

The third paper (published in Financial History Review) explores the question of art acting as a capital flight tool by focusing on a very particular episode in history: the monetary reform that occurred in Belgium after the Second World War and drastically reduced the money supply.

It deals with two main issues: capital structure decisions in financially distressed firms and the role <b>of</b> the investor <b>identity</b> on the acquisition performance. The first essay is a literature review about equity issues as a means to recover from financial distress. The study provides, firstly, an overview of the extant literature on capital structure theory and financial distress in order to deepen the understanding of how a firm can resolve its financial constraints. On the one hand, {{some of the most important}} contributions in capital structure theory are reviewed with a specific focus on equity issues. On the other hand, financial distress is discussed examining the main solutions adopted by distressed firms in order to reorganize (i. e. formal in court proceedings and private reorganizations). Finally, it is discussed a possible gap in capital structure theory and financial distress literature arguing that most of previous research, in the attempt to explain the occurrence of equity issues, just focused on firm specific determinants. With the aim to provide a further perspective for future research, the study examines a series of contributions that consider how capital structure decisions can be affected by external determinants related to the legal system in which the firm operates. These works are aggregated to the discussion in order to suggests a conceptual framework suitable to explain equity issues in financial distress through the integrations of capital structure theory with Law literature. The second essay is a theoretical and empirical investigation on equity issues in distressed firms. Specifically, I explore the effectiveness of equity issue as a means to recover from distress. I argue the relationship between equity issues and recovery controlling for the legal system in which the firm operates. Central to the thesis is the role of the Bankruptcy Law on the firm’s propensity to issue equity which varies according to the legal protection of the creditors. Controlling for this exogenous factor allows me to explain how recovery is affected by the issuance of equity. This study contributes to both capital structure theory and financial distress literature providing evidence on how the capital structure decision to issue equity can drive the process of firm’s recovery from distress. Then, it suggests an alternative explanation of the decision to issue equity in distress arguing the relevance of the legal system as a determinant of this choice. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 70 firms that recovered from financial distress in 49 countries. The sample is divided in to 34 distressed firms who recovered issuing equity and 36 firms who recovered without an equity issue. Results show that the legal system matters for understanding the occurrence of equity issues in distress; they are more likely to occur in countries with a debtor friendly legal system. Conditionally to the incidence of the law on the firm’s choice to issue equity, equity issues positively affect the firm’s recovery from distress. The third study is a theoretical and empirical examination about the relationship between the buyer identity and the acquisition performance. This relationship is argued advancing and testing the idea that different <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buyer,</b> specifically strategic or financial investors, have different effects on the performance of the target firm after an acquisition. We suggest that the different resource and knowledge base <b>of</b> the <b>buyer,</b> i. e. its identity, drives the target performance: on the one hand it affects the innovative output and so the patenting activity of the target, on the other hand it has an impact on the economic results of the acquired firm. This study contributes to literature on M&A by providing a complementary explanation of M&A performance, unraveling how the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buyer</b> can play a significant role in driving post-acquisition performance. Moreover, it suggests a more complete analysis of the deal’s output considering both the innovative and the economic output. The study relies on a sample of 234 acquisitions in any industry completed between 2006 and 2011. Results show that the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buyer</b> has a direct effect on the performance of the target firm after the acquisition. The results also highlight how identity has a different impact regarding to the different measures of performance: whilst the strategic buyers, moved by the interest for additional knowledge and technology, tend to integrate their capabilities with target fostering innovative processes and improving the innovative performance, the financial buyers use to undertake deals in order to maximize their profits at the expense of the innovative performance. Different evidences emerge for the economic performance of the involved firm which is positively affected by financial buyers respect to strategic ones since they induce the target firm to undertake highly risky and long term investments in R&D.

Obtaining clues from the bootblack, Geralt and Regis discover Dettlaff's hideout, and Geralt finds evidence that Dettlaff is being blackmailed into the killings. Rhenawedd, Dettlaff's human lover, has been kidnapped and the kidnappers are forcing Dettlaff to murder the knights. Regis stays behind to wait for Dettlaff to return, while Geralt reports to Henrietta and de la Tour. From the wine stain on one of the pieces of paper the kidnappers sent Dettlaff naming his victims, Henrietta was able to identify the wine as one reserved solely for the ducal table. Geralt, Henrietta, and de la Tour visit the ducal winery, and its maker confesses to selling a barrel of the wine to a mysterious buyer. Learning that the buyer has arranged for another barrel, Geralt and de la Tour mount an ambush on the collection party. Geralt interrogates a captured member of the party, who divulges the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the mysterious <b>buyer</b> as The Cintrian.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the short-term market and the long-term operating performance of Chinese seasoned equity issues (Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEOs)). Employing data for 596 rights offerings and 181 private placements for the period 1998 to 2004, we find significant positive short-term market reaction for both rights offerings and private placements; however, the long-term operating performance of the firms offering private placements is significantly better than the rights offering firms. In China, firms issuing rights offerings are required to adhere to strict rules set by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). These firms must meet minimum standards with respect to earnings and profitability before being permitted to issue rights offerings. Firms issuing private placements {{are not required to}} meet the same strict earnings/profitability requirements. Our results suggest that the regulatory oversight is important for the short-term market reaction of the equity issuing firms. However, it is not a determinant of the long-term performance of the firms. Also, our results provide some evidence that firms issuing rights offerings may manipulate their past earnings and profitability measures in order to reach the requirements set forth by the CSRC. The <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the equity <b>buyer</b> seems to be a better determinant of the long-term profitability of the equity issuing firms. ...|$|R

We first identify two chan-nels <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> power, which allows larger buyers to obtain discounts. We subsequently exam-ine the effects <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> {{power on the}} supplier's incentives and on social welfare. Contrary to some informal claims in the policy debate on buyer power, {{we find that the}} exercise <b>of</b> <b>buyer</b> power-even though reducing supplier's profits- may often increase a supplier's incentive to undertake welfare enhancing activities...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of peer usage on {{consumer}} demand for efficient cookstoves with a randomized controlled trial in rural Uganda. We testifthe neighbors <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> who ordered and received a stove are more likely to purchase an efficient cookstove than the neighbors <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> who ordered but have not yet received a stove. We find that neighbors <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> who have experience with the stove are not detectably more likely to purchase a stove than neighbors <b>of</b> <b>buyers</b> who have not yet received their stove. We do find evidence of peer effects in opinions about efficient cookstoves. Knowing that a prominent member of the community has the efficient stove predicts 17 – 22 percentage points higher odds of strongly favoring the stove. But this more favorable opinion seemingly has no impact on purchase decisions...|$|R
