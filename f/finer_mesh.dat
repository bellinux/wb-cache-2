The second grid (and so on for any other grids, 3rd, 4th, etc.) is a relatively much <b>finer</b> <b>mesh</b> that spans a sub-domain of the system containing the region that requires fine resolution like the channel pore.

The Poisson equation is solved again for the finer meshes using the new boundary conditions.

2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler neck moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972–73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} the tail light panel just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much <b>finer</b> <b>mesh</b> pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width red lens across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|E

40|$|Many {{problems}} of interest {{are characterized by}} two distinctive and disparate scales and a huge multiplicity of similar small scale elements. The corresponding scale-dependent solvability manifests itself in the high gradient flow around each element needing a <b>fine</b> <b>mesh</b> locally and the similar flow patterns among all elements globally. In a block spectral approach making use of the scale-dependent solvability, the global domain is decomposed into {{a large number of}} similar small blocks. The mesh-pointwise block spectra will establish the block-block variation, for which only a small set of blocks need to be solved with a <b>fine</b> <b>mesh</b> resolution. The solution can then be very efficiently obtained by coupling the local <b>fine</b> <b>mesh</b> solution and the global coarse mesh solution through a block spectral mapping. Previously the block spectral method has only been developed for steady flows. The present work extends the methodology to unsteady flows of short temporal and spatial scales (e. g. those due to self-excited unsteady vortices and turbulence disturbances). A source term based approach is adopted to facilitate a two-way coupling in terms of time-averaged flow solutions. The global coarse base-mesh solution provides an appropriate environment and boundary condition to the local <b>fine</b> <b>mesh</b> blocks, whilst the local <b>fine</b> <b>mesh</b> solution provides the source terms (propagated through the block spectral mapping) to the global coarse mesh domain.
