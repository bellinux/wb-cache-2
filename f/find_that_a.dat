5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category.

5|$|The year 1720 {{brought an}} end to {{external}} threats to Rogers' rule. With Spain and Britain at peace again, the Spanish made no further move against the Bahamas. Vane never returned, having been shipwrecked and captured in the Bay Islands—a year later, he was hanged in Jamaica. This did not end Rogers' problems as governor. Overextended from financing New Providence's defences, he received no assistance from Britain, and merchants refused to give him further credit. His health suffered, and he spent six weeks in Charleston, South Carolina, hoping to recuperate. Instead, he was wounded in a duel with Captain John Hildesley of HMS Flamborough (1707), a duel caused by disputes between the two on New Providence. Troubled {{by the lack of}} support and communication from London, Rogers set sail for Britain in March 1721. He arrived three months later to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new governor had been appointed, and his company had been liquidated. Personally liable for the obligations he had contracted at Nassau, he was imprisoned for debt.|$|E

25|$|After delaying {{for several}} weeks in Tullahoma, Rosecrans planned to flush Bragg out of Chattanooga by {{crossing}} the Tennessee River, heading south, and interdicting the Confederate supply lines from Georgia. He began operations on August 18 and used a two-week bombardment of Chattanooga as a diversion. The Confederate high command reinforced Bragg with a division from Mississippi {{as well as a}} corps previously of the Army of Northern Virginia commanded by James Longstreet. Rosecrans pursued Bragg into the rugged mountains of northwestern Georgia, only to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> trap had been set. Bragg started the Battle of Chickamauga (September 1920, 1863) when he launched a three-division assault against Rosecrans's army. A command misunderstanding allowed a major gap to appear in the Union line as reinforcements arrived, and Longstreet was able to drive his corps into that gap and send the Union Army into retreat. If not for the defensive stand by a portion of the line led by the Union XIV Corps, commanded by Major General George H. Thomas ("The Rock of Chickamauga"), the Union Army would have been completely routed. Rosecrans, devastated by his defeat, withdrew his army to Chattanooga, where Bragg besieged it, occupying the high ground dominating the city.|$|E

Building on recent research <b>that</b> <b>finds</b> internet search terms to be useful predictors of health epidemics and economic activity, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> increase in a state’s unemployment rate decreases Google searches for “global warming” and increases searches for “unemployment,” and that the effect differs according to a state’s political ideology. From national surveys, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> increase in a state’s unemployment rate {{is associated with a}} decrease in the probability that residents think global warming is happening and reduced support for the U. S to target policies intended to mitigate global warming. Finally, in California, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> increase in a county’s unemployment rate is associated with a significant decrease in county residents choosing the environment as the most important policy issue. Beyond providing the first empirical estimates of macroeconomic effects on environmental concern, we discuss the results in terms of the potential impact on environmental policy and understanding the full cost of recessions. ...|$|R
