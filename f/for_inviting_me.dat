I {{would like}} to take a moment from this very public {{ceremony}} to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them."

40|$|This chapter raises {{questions}} concerning genetic and areal relatedness among languages of Mainland South-east Asia (hereafter MSEA), 1 mainly {{with reference to}} a widespread pattern of grammatical polyfunctionality involving a verb ACQUIRE. Although data are mostly from Sinitic and Tai, the issues of genetic versus areal relatedness arise across and throughout the five or more language families in the region. I begin with introductory comments on the geographical, linguistic, and cultural situation of MSEA, including discussion of MSEA as a linguistic area. In § 2, I present data from a synchronic case study of a polyfunctional verb ACQUIRE in MSEA languages, concentrating on two Tai languages (Lao and Northern I {{would like to thank}} the editors <b>for</b> generously <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> to contribute.

40|$|First and foremost, {{my deepest}} {{thanks to my}} parents, Mary Ann and Ed Wagner, for their love and support. Without their {{guidance}} and understanding this wouldn’t be possible. Therefore, I dedicate this dissertation to them. I {{would like to thank}} the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) for their support of this research. I would specifically like to thank Alan Schultz <b>for</b> continually <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> back to NRL to pursue my research interests in robotics over the summer in the AI lab. Frank Pipitone and Behrooz Kamgar-Parsi also provided interesting discussions on range-based vision and face recognition, as well as work related to my research topic. Lastly, I would like to extend my gratitude to Keith Mattingly, without whose help life at NRL would have been much more complicated. My journey at CNS started with Paolo Gaudiano in the Neurobotics Laboratory. This provided the gateway to the collaboration with NRL. For this I am greatly indebted. Eric Schwartz deserves many thanks for initially helping me get into the Ph. D. program, but especially for taking me on as his advisee when Paolo had left the department. I’ve learned a lot from him...|$|R

60|$|It {{was quite}} clear that Mr. Joshua Brigham {{regarded}} these transactions as so many Pragmatic Sanctions, that were to clear the moral and legal atmospheres of any atoms of difficulty that might exist in the forms of old opinions, to his getting easily out of debt, in the one case, and suddenly rich in the other. I dare say I looked bewildered, but I certainly felt so, at thus finding myself {{face to face with}} a low knave, who had a deliberate intention, as I now found, to rob me of a farm. It is certain that Joshua so imagined, <b>for,</b> <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> to walk down the road with him a short distance, he endeavored to clear up any moral difficulties that might beset me, by pursuing the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "How do {{you like}} Belgium, Monsieur?" [...] asked she, in an accent of the {{broadest}} Bruxellois. I could now well distinguish {{the difference between the}} fine and pure Parisian utterance of M. Pelet, for instance, and the guttural enunciation of the Flamands. I answered politely, and then wondered how so coarse and clumsy an old woman as the one before me should be {{at the head of a}} ladies' seminary, which I had always heard spoken of in terms of high commendation. In truth there was something to wonder at. Madame Reuter looked more like a joyous, free-living old Flemish fermiere, or even a maitresse d'auberge, than a staid, grave, rigid directrice de pensionnat. In general the continental, or at least the Belgian old women permit themselves a licence of manners, speech, and aspect, such as our venerable granddames would recoil from as absolutely disreputable, and Madame Reuter's jolly face bore evidence that she was no exception to the rule of her country; there was a twinkle and leer in her left eye; her right she kept habitually half shut, which I thought very odd indeed. After several vain attempts to comprehend the motives of these two droll old creatures <b>for</b> <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> to join them at their gouter, I at last fairly gave it up, and resigning myself to inevitable mystification, I sat and looked first at one, then at the other, taking care meantime to do justice to the confitures, cakes, and coffee, with which they amply supplied me. They, too, ate, and that with no delicate appetite, and having demolished a large portion of the solids, they proposed a [...] "petit verre." [...] I declined. Not so Mesdames Pelet and Reuter; each mixed herself what I thought rather a stiff tumbler of punch, and placing it on a stand near the stove, they drew up their chairs to that convenience, and invited me to do the same. I obeyed; and being seated fairly between them, I was thus addressed first by Madame Pelet, then by Madame Reuter.|$|E

40|$|Acknowledgements First I want {{to thank}} my {{supervisor}} Jan Smith. A few years ago he suggested to me that I start studying pointfree topology as an approach to constructive mathematics. Since then he has repeatedly encouraged me to continue investigating this area. The suggestions and the response I have got from him during our discussions have been valuable for me. But most importantly, he has always shown enthusiasm in my work. Two more people have influenced my work considerably. Many ideas that I have used are due to Thierry Coquand. Thierry also invented the logical framework Half that was suitable for my kind of formalisation. The last two years I have also had an inspiring collaboration with Sara Negri, one that I hope to continue. Dan Synek is worthy a great praise for implementing a type-checker and an emacs-interface to Half. He made the system fast enough that my formalisations could be carried through. I am grateful to Giovanni Sambin <b>for</b> generously <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> to Padova. Giovanni has developed the particular notion of formal space that I have been using. His papers and lectures during his visits in Gothenburg have also contributed to my work. On the invitation of Jan von Plato, I have paid two very pleasant visits to the Department of Philosophy in Helsinki. Both times I had interesting discussions with Jan and his colleagues...|$|R

I thank Dr. James Amburgey {{for taking the time to}} help me understand filtration theory through his very thorough emails. And I thank Dr. Guangxuan Zhu for his steady help throughout this project, especially for teaching me how to use the Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. I would also like to acknowledge my fellow students who helped. I thank Patricia Taboada-Serrano for teaching me about DLVO theory and force potential curves. I thank Jed Costanza for helping me to setup my filtration column correctly, and for our encouraging discussions about research. And I thank my other group members, Viriya Vithayaveroj and Chiahung Hou, for answering my questions about the lab and putting up with all of the noise my experiments made. I especially thank Justin Clark for helping me in the lab with experiments. The Environmental Engineering support staff also deserve recognition. I thank Andrea Be and Therese Rehkopf for their cheerful, reliable support with paperwork and ordering supplies. I thank my wife Kelly who has encouraged me and has worked hard to support me in graduate school. And thanks be to the God of Abraham from whom all blessings flow. ii...|$|R

Five {{minutes later}} {{they were on their}} feet for her to take leave, {{standing}} together in an affability that had succeeded in surviving a further exchange of remarks; only with the emphasised appearance on Waymarsh's part of a tendency to revert, in a ruminating manner and as with an instinctive or a precautionary lightening of his tread, to an open window and his point of vantage. The glazed and gilded room, all red damask, ormolu, mirrors, clocks, looked south, and the shutters were bowed upon the summer morning; but the Tuileries garden and what was beyond it, over which the whole place hung, were things visible through gaps; so that the far-spreading presence of Paris came up in coolness, dimness and invitation, in the twinkle of gilt-tipped palings, the crunch of gravel, the click of hoofs, the crack of whips, things that suggested some parade of the circus. [...] "I think it probable," [...] said Mrs. Pocock, [...] "that I shall have the opportunity of going to my brother's I've no doubt it's very pleasant indeed." [...] She spoke as to Strether, but her face was turned with an intensity of brightness to Madame de Vionnet, and there was a moment during which, while she thus fronted her, our friend expected to hear her add: [...] "I'm much obliged to you, I'm sure, <b>for</b> <b>inviting</b> <b>me</b> there." [...] He guessed that for five seconds these words were on the point of coming; he heard them as clearly {{as if they had been}} spoken; but he presently knew they had just failed--knew it by a glance, quick and fine, from Madame de Vionnet, which told him that she too had felt them in the air, but that the point had luckily not been made in any manner requiring notice. This left her free to reply only to what had been said.|$|E

40|$|Some {{years ago}} I was {{introduced}} to the area of dialogue systems, and I was lucky it was by somebody who enjoys working with them. Since then, in his enthusiasm I have had a splendid referent. If the role of a supervisor is to guide and advice, it can not be in any other way rather than encouraging to develop the own ideas freely. Thank you Ramón. And to work freely it is necessary to go out of our laboratory, stop staring at our screen and find out what the others do, so that we can enrich our own contributions.
