40|$|A {{method for}} gas-free filling of water circuit {{heating and cooling}} systems is {{developed}} in this work. Even large systems can quickly be filled without using venting screws. The system, evacuated to a low-end pressure, is filled with degassed water. For the <b>evacuated</b> <b>system,</b> the leakage constant (increase of pressure per time) is measured. It is constant during the filling process until the critical pressure ratio (0. 53) is reached. The <b>evacuated</b> <b>system</b> is filled using a mobile vacuum-boiling device, which removes over 99 % of the gases dissolved in warm tap water. The capacity of about 4 m³/h results in a short filling time. The main factor increasing the air concentration in the system is the leakage during filling. A model is derived which enables easy calculation of the air or nitrogen concentration in the system after filling, using the variables end pressure, the vapour pressure in the system, leakage constant and filling time. The oxygen in air disappears quickly in a radiator system due to corrosion. The calculated nitrogen concentration in the system is mostly below 0. 5 mol/m³, which guarantees that the nitrogen remains dissolved in water even at a temperature of 70 °C, provided the minimum pressure in the system is greater than 146 kPa. Another important result is that, even in open systems, the nitrogen gas absorption from the atmosphere into the system stops {{at a level of}} about 0. 5 mol/m³; therefore, no degassing afterwards is needed. The theoretical study shows that the micro-bubble separators in radiator systems connected to district heating are ineffective because of too low surface temperatures on the secondary side. New formulae are derived for heating curves and radiator sensitivity using different heat transfer models. Radiator sensitivity is a concept introduced by Trüschel (2002) in his doctoral thesis. New and efficient methods for adjusting the balancing valves to accommodate cases with and without pipework drawings are presented. In certain buildings where pressure drops in the pipework are very small, only presettable radiator valves are required, making the balancing of valves unnecessary. The methods presented here have been tested successfully in hundreds of buildings...|$|E

40|$|For {{the future}} linear {{accelerator}} TESLA the demanded accuracy for the {{alignment of the}} components is 0. 5 mm horizontal and 0. 2 mm vertical, both on each 600 m section. Other accelerators require similar accuracies. These demands can not be fulfilled with open-air geodetic methods, mainly because of refraction. Therefore the RTRS (Rapid Tunnel Reference Surveyor), a measurement train performing overlapping multipoint alignment on a reference network is being developed. Two refraction-free realizations of this concept are being developed at the moment: the first one (GeLiS) measures the horizontal co-ordinates using stretched wires, combined with photogrammetric split-image sensors in a distance measurement configuration. In areas of the tunnel where the accelerator is following the earth curvature GeLiS measures the height using a new hydrostatic leveling system. The second concept (LiCAS) is based on laser straightness monitors (LSM) combined with frequency scanning interferometry (FSI) in an <b>evacuated</b> <b>system.</b> LiCAS measures both co-ordinates with respect to its LSM-beam and is thus suitable for geometrically straight tunnel sections. Both measurement systems will be placed on a train, which could do the reference survey autonomously...|$|E
40|$|We have designed, constructed, and {{evaluated}} an environmental chamber that has in situ dynamic control of temperature (25 to 90 °C) and relative humidity (0 % to 95 %).

40|$|Abstract- This {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} adding trace levels of contaminants to an otherwise <b>evacuated</b> <b>system,</b> leads to rapid onset {{of damage to}} optical elements {{in the presence of}} 1064 nm laser radiation. Specifically, 1064 nm radiation from a pulsed laser having approximately 800 mJ/cm 2 average power (< 1. 5 J/cm 2 peak power) illuminated fused silica windows used to seal a vacuum chamber, with a pressure < 1. 0 x 10 - 3 torr. In the absence of any contamination the windows were demonstrated to show no signs of damage up to 700, 000 laser pulses. When gas phase toluene was introduced into the system at varying concentrations (< 1. 0 x 10 - 3 - 3. 1 x 10 - 1 torr), the onset of damage was seen to be a function of the toluene concentration, and damage was seen to occur as rapidly as 30, 000 laser pulses. This phenomenon was also observed when the windows had a commercially applied coating of MgF 2 applied to the surface in the vacuum system Similar experiments using acetone as the contaminant led to no observed damage for either optic, even at high concentrations.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of a {{linear electron accelerator}} in providing short bunches of relativistic electrons for injection into interwave sources such as magnetic undulators and Cerenkov couplers is pointed out. Shorter bunch lengths can result in coherent radiation at shorter wavelengths. An experimental example of this effect is given, and {{the design of a}} linac to produce short electron bunches is then described. The historical background to the choice of a dielectric disc-loaded slow-wave structure is explained together with the reasons for adopting a 2 MeV beam energy and a 1. 8 cm operating wavelength. Periodically loaded waveguides and their mode of operation as linac slow-wave structures are described, and the reasons for favouring travelling-wave operation with a phase change per periodic length of π/ 3 radians are given. Phase space concepts applied to the design of the electron buncher and main accelerator section are shown to give an accurate description of the fields and wave velocities required for good bunching and small bean energy spread. The theoretical design to give an effective bunch length of 0. 3 mm is described. Measurements and proving tests at high and low R. F. power, and the investigation of physical and chemical properties relating to linac fabrication and operation indicate that certain titania and magnesium titanate ceramics are suitable as loading material, provided that some precautions are taken against surface breakdown, this appears to be initiated by sparking between the dielectric-loading disc rims and the metallic wall of the linac structure. The sparking can be greatly- reduced by grinding the rims to a fine finish and metallizing them with copper. Surface breakdown can be inhibited by coating the discs with a thin protective layer of lead borate glaze or P. T. F. F. Electron multipactor resonances between discs are largely avoided by excluding oil from the <b>evacuated</b> <b>system.</b> The dielectric surface conductivity is very low and so a well focused electron beam is essential if surface charging is to be avoided. Theoretical and experimental results for the test structures are not in close agreement, especially for shunt impedance. Ohmic losses are about four times higher than the theory suggests. This is thought to be due partly to inexact boundary-matching of fields in the theory, and partly to surface effects giving rise to a relatively high resistivity in the waveguide wall. Practical test cavities give consistent and repeatable results, and the necessary high degree of physical accuracy has been attained in their construction. A practical design and fabrication method is given for the main accelerator section, and the proposed physical realisation of the buncher-accelerator system is described. </p...|$|E

The prevalence of hemolyzed specimens is high in the emergency department (ED). We previously showed that collecting blood {{by means of a}} closed system entailing manual aspiration of blood instead of using conventional <b>evacuated</b> <b>systems</b> was effective to cut-down by nearly half the rate of hemolysis. Aim of this real world study was to verify whether longterm replacement of standard <b>evacuated</b> blood collection <b>systems</b> may be really effective to reduce the burden of spurious hemolysis. Starting from May 2014 in the ED of our Hospital vacuum tubes were replaced with S-Monovette serum tubes. We compared data about hemolyzed specimens entered in the two years before the implementation of the new device (i. e., 2012 and 2013) and the two years after introducing SMonovette in manual aspiration mode (i. e. 2015 and 2016). The year 2014 was not considered due to mixed data. The rate of hemolyzed specimens decreased from 4. 36 % to 3. 07 % with the use of S-Monovette in manual aspiration mode (Chi squared, 183. 8; P< 0. 001). The likelihood of obtaining hemolyzed specimens was hence reduced by approximately 30 % (relative risk, 0. 707), with an expected economic saving of approximately 510 €/year. The results of this real-world study demonstrate that the use of an alternative closed device encompassing manual aspiration for drawing blood from intravenous catheters may reduce hemolyzed samples by approximately 30 %, so representing a valuable perspective for safeguarding patient safety and improving ED efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Solar thermal {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} renewable energy technologies, and solar water heating {{is one of the}} most popular solar thermal systems. Based on the considerations on the existing barriers of the solar water heating, this research will propose a novel façade-based solar water heating system employing a unique loop heat pipe (LHP) structure with top-level liquid feeder, which will lead to a façade-integrated, low cost, aesthetically appealing and highly efficient solar system and has considerable potential to provide energy savings and reduce carbon emissions to the environment. The research initially involved the conceptual design of the proposed system. The prefabricated external module could convert the solar energy to heat in the form of low-temperature vapour. The vapour will be transported to indoors through the transport line and condensed within the heat exchanger by releasing the heat to the service water. The heated water will then be stored in the tank for use. An analytical model was developed to investigate six limits to the loop heat pipe’s operation, i. e., capillary, entrainment, viscous, boiling, sonic and filled liquid mass. It was found that mesh-screen wick was able to obtain a higher capillary (governing) limit than sintered-powder. Higher fluid temperature, larger pipe diameter and larger exchanger-to-pipes height difference would lead to a higher capillary limit. Adequate system configuration and operating conditions were suggested as: pipe inner diameter of 16 mm, mesh-screen wick, heat transfer fluid temperature of 60 oC and height difference of 1. 5 m. This research further developed a computer model to investigate the dynamic performance of the system, taking into account heat balances occurring in different parts of the system, e. g., solar absorber, heat pipes loop, heat exchanger, and tank. Data extracted from two previously published papers were used to compare with the established model of the same setups, and an agreement could be achieved under a reasonable error limit. This research further constructed a prototype system and its associated testing rig at the SRB (Sustainable Research Building) Laboratory, University of Nottingham and conducted testing through measurement of various operational parameters, i. e., heat transfer fluid temperature, tank water temperature, solar efficiency and system COP (Coefficient of Performance). Two types of glass covers, i. e., evacuated tubes and single glazing, were applied to the prototype, and each type was tested on two different days of 8 hours from 09 : 00 : 00 to 17 : 00 : 00. By comparison of the measurement data with the modelling results, reasonable model accuracy could be achieved in predicting the LHP system performance. The water temperature remained a steady growth trend throughout the day with an increase of 13. 5 oC for the <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>system</b> and 10. 0 oC for the single glazing system. The average testing efficiencies of the <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>system</b> were 48. 8 % and 46. 7 % for the two cases with the testing COPs of 14. 0 and 13. 4, respectively. For the single glazing system, the average testing efficiencies were 36. 0 % and 30. 9 % for the two cases with the COPs of 10. 5 and 8. 9, respectively. Experimental results also indicated that the <b>evacuated</b> tube based <b>system</b> was the preferred system compared to the single glazing system. This research finally analysed the annual operational performance, economic and environmental impacts of the optimised <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>system</b> under real weather conditions in Beijing, China by running an approved computer model. It was concluded that the novel system had the potential to be highly-efficient, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly through comparison with a conventional flat-plate solar water heating system.
