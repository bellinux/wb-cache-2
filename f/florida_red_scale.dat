It is a beneficial insect, and is useful in both natural wood stands and commercial forests such as orchards and citrus groves. It is beneficial against non native species.

40|$|Israeli {{citriculture}} occupies 18, 000 ha. Annual citrus {{production in}} Israel totals 600, 000 mt with 31 % exported fresh. Citrus is Israel’s number one fresh fruit export {{and must be}} free of pests and blemishes. Pest management in citrus groves in Israel is more-or-less satisfactory biological control of most aphids, scales, whiteflies, and mites [1]. Insecticides are used to control four primary pest species for which biological controls are insufficient: Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), citrus mealybug, citrus rust mite, and California red scale. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Israel’s citrus groves {{has been based on}} the judicious use of relatively selective insecticides, in combination with biological control. It has been estimated that 100 % of the citrus in Israel is managed with IPM [2]. Cottony-cushion scale had a devastating effect on citrus groves in Israel in the early 1900 s and has been kept under effective control by the predatory vedalia beetle introduced in 1912. When Green’s mealybug appeared as a serious pest of citrus in the 1930 ’s it was controlled by a parasite introduced in 1940 from Japan [3]. Another parasite introduced in 1952 from the USA controlled the long-tailed mealybug. The <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> <b>scale,</b> considered the most important pest of Israel in the 1950 s, was brought under complete control in most areas by a parasite imported from Hong Kong [3].

40|$|This {{research}} integrates theoretical frameworks of risk perception, social amplification of risk, and {{the role}} of place-specific contexts in order to explore the various perceptions surrounding <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tides. <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tides are naturally occurring events that are increasing in frequency, duration, and severity. This has implications for public health, the local economy, and ecosystem health. While many of the negative impacts of <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tides are not easily controlled, some of the secondary impacts may be mitigated through individuals 2 ̆ 7 responses. However, public perception and consequent reactions to <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tides have not been investigated. This research uses questionnaire surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to explore the various perceptions of the risk surrounding red tides. Surveys and interviews were conducted along two Florida west coast beaches. The results indicate that the underlying foundations of the social amplification of the risk framework are applicable to understanding how individuals form perceptions of risk relative to red tide events. There are key differences between the spatial locations of individuals and corresponding perceptions, indicating that place-specific contexts are essential to understanding how individuals receive and interpret risk information. The results also suggest that individuals may be lacking efficient and up-to-date information about <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tides and their impacts because of inconsistent public outreach. Overall, social and spatial factors appear to be influential as to whether individuals amplify or attenuate the risks associated with <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tides...|$|R

40|$|Symptoms {{consistent}} with inhalation toxicity {{have long been}} associated with <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tides, and various causal agents have been proposed. Research since 1981 has centered {{on a group of}} naturally occurring trans-fused cyclic polyether compounds called brevetoxins that are produced by a marine dinoflagellate known as Karenia brevis. Numerous individual brevetoxins have been identified from cultures as well as from natural bloom events. A spectrum of brevetoxin derivatives produced by chemical modification of the natural toxins has been prepared {{to examine the effects of}} functional group modification on physiologic activity. Certain structural features of natural and synthetic derivatives of brevetoxin appear to ascribe specific physiologic consequences to each toxin. Differential physiologic effects have been documented with many of the natural toxins and derivatives, reinforcing the hypothesis that metabolism or modification of toxin structures modulates both the specific toxicity (lethality on a per milligram basis) and potentially the molecular mechanism(s) of action. A series of naturally occurring fused-ring polyether compounds with fewer rings than brevetoxin, known as brevenals, exhibit antagonistic properties and counteract the effects of the brevetoxins in neuronal and pulmonary model systems. Taken together, the inhalation toxicity of <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tides would appear to depend on the amount of each toxin present, as well as on the spectrum of molecular activities elicited by each toxin. Toxicity in a bloom is diminished by the amount brevenal present.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of a natural androgen, 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11 betaOHA 4), on sex-reversed fry of the <b>Florida</b> <b>red</b> tilapia. In a first approach, the optimal dosage and {{duration}} were determined in the laboratory. The sex-reversal treatment was applied on post-yolksac stage fry (10 days after fertilisation at 27 degreesC. Dosages of 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg of 11 betaOHA 4 kg(- 1) of food were used during periods ranging from 10 to 35 days. Dosages of 40 or 50 mg of 11 betaOHA 4 kg(- 1) of food during 21 - 35 days significantly increased the male percentage in sex-reversed groups in comparison to control groups. A lower but still significant deviation of the male percentage was observed when a dosage of 40 mg kg- 1 was given during at least 28 days. Lower dosages did not significantly affect the sex ratio of treated groups. Based on the results of these observations, a follow-up study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of this natural androgen for an intensive production of sex-reversed fry. Optimal dosage (50 mg kg- 1) and treatment duration (28 days) were applied to increasing stocking density of fry (8000 - 11, 000 fish m(- 2)), producing a mean male percentage of 99. 1 % on the 510, 000 treated fry.
