40|$|Modeling of real {{behavior}} of structural systems requires complex assumptions, which have, as consequences, nonlinear stress-strain state. One {{of the causes}} of nonlinear behavior is geometric nonlinearity. Determining of critical load parameter by standard bifurcation buckling solution is appropriate for solving stability problems if the longitudinal and lateral load ratio is small. In case that structure has large displacements, it is necessary to use incremental-iterative solution. The main advantage of this concept is possibility to verify changes in: loads, mechanical-reological properties of material, geometry of structural system, and modeling effect of those changes on structural behavior.

40|$|In this thesis, {{graphene}} (i. e. monolayer carbon film) {{and carbon}} clusters supported on {{a transition metal}} surface are systematically studied by local probe techniques, {{with respect to their}} structures, electronic properties and formation mechanisms. The main tools used are low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM and STS), which are introduced in Chapter 2. The mechanism of the resonance tunnelling at electron energies higher than the work function of the surface is discussed in detail, and a qualitative explanation of the Gundlach oscillations in the corresponding spectroscopy is presented. Epitaxial graphene synthesised on the Rh(111) surface by ethylene dehydrogenation is investigated by STM in Chapter 4. Such carbon film exhibits a hexagonal Moiré pattern due to a lattice mismatch between graphene and the rhodium substrate. The periodicity and local registries of the graphene/Rh(111) superstructure are carefully analysed. Based on a thorough discussion about the “commensurate vs. incommensurate” nature of the Moiré pattern in surface science field, the graphene/Rh(111) system is identified to have a non-simple-commensurate superstructure. The surface electronic properties and <b>geometric</b> <b>buckling</b> of graphene/Rh(111) are investigated by resonance tunnelling spectroscopy (RTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in Chapter 5. Spectroscopy measurements reveal a modulation of the electronic surface potential (or work function Φ) across the supercell of epitaxial graphene. Based on the microscopy/spectroscopy data and the extended DFT calculations, we examined the electronic coupling of the various local C-Rh registries, and identified both experimentally and theoretically the local atomic configurations of maximum and minimum chemical bonding between graphene and the rhodium substrate. We studied in Chapter 6 the growth mechanism of graphene on Rh(111) at elevated temperatures. This part starts by investigating the dehydrogenation of ethylene into ethylidyne. When the dehydrogenation process is complete, monodispersed carbon species, identified as 7 C 6, are found to dominate the cluster population on the rhodium terraces. A significant coalescence of the 7 C 6 clusters into graphene islands occurs at temperatures higher than 873 K. The structural and electronic properties of the 7 C 6 carbon clusters are examined by high-resolution STM and STS, and compared with coronene molecules, i. e. the hydrogenated analogues of 7 C 6. DFT calculations are further used to explain the stability of 7 C 6 supported on the Rh(111) surface, and also the structural characteristics of such magic-sized carbon clusters.

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the development of}} a fiberglass-foam composite sandwich structure with the introduction of delamination arrestment keys; therefore, a study of an initially delaminated composite sandwich structure was the experimental analysis on multiple configurations in how the arrestment keys are placed. The first part of this thesis research was to the experimental design and manufacturing of the composite sandwich plates. These plates were later cut down to the specific test dimensions and manufacturing processes for the composite sandwich plates and test specimens were created. The composite sandwich plates were manufactured using a vacuum resin infusion process. The dimensions of the composite layup are 14 inches in length with a width of 10. 75 inches. The width size has margin to account for machining. The actual dimensions of the test specimen after it is prepared are 14 inches by 0. 75 inches. The test anvil length is 11 inches and is used to perform tests to determine mechanical characteristics of the structures under buckling loading. These plates provide approximately 9 to 13 specimens per each case. All the test specimens have 4 plies of 18 oz fiberglass woven roving fabric from Jamestown Distributors, a LAST-A-FOAM FR- 6710 foam core, and 5 to 1 ratio of West Systems 105 / 206 epoxy. Also, a non-porous material was integrated into the structure to create an initial delamination in some of the case studies. The integration of the delamination arrestment keys involve milling the foam core to provide the necessary grooves for key placements before the structure is vacuumed and epoxy is flowed. The arrestment keys are made of unidirectional fiberglass strand and the West Systems 105 / 206 epoxy using a wet layup process. In addition, fiberglass woven roving specimens were created to see the material characteristics under compression and tensile loading. The same is created to determine the material properties of the foam core, wood boundary core, and arrestment keys under compression loading. The second part to this thesis investigation is the experimental testing of the test specimens with all different variables considered. Those variables includes determining the final solid cure duration of the fiberglass skin, the geometric lengths between pure compression and pure buckling, behaviors of different initial delamination size, effects of continuous and discontinuous arrestment keys parallel and perpendicular to the in-plane loading, and material properties. The final solid cure duration differ from what the manufacturer gave on their epoxy. This experiment testing followed ASTM D- 3039 standard to see the differences in elastic modulus over duration of 15 days. The resulting data shows that the test specimen fully cures after 13 to 14 days. The test specimens in search of the <b>geometric</b> <b>buckling</b> length for this investigation did not follow ASTM C- 364 standard in full, but follows a variation of the ASTM C- 364 standard in order to support buckling loading condition and the limited accessibility of the test equipments. Instead, the modifications are found with a different test jig design and test specimen configuration. The test jig was created to provide a pinned condition with a 0. 25 inch diameter. The test specimen is laid up with a foam and wood cores. Two wood cores are laid at each edge of the foam core to increase loading capacity and holes are drilled through the wood cores to create a pinned-pinned case for the optimum buckling condition. The results detailing the <b>geometric</b> <b>buckling</b> show that after 9 inches anvil length there is no compression; only buckling occurs with a cross-sectional dimension of 0. 75 inch by 0. 575 inch. The 11 inch foam length was chosen for convenience of machining. This modified setup was also used for testing the different configuration with the embedded arrestment keys. The multiple different configurations completed for these test specimens under unstable loading, the experiment results show that a continuous arrestment key embedded significantly improve the loading capacity over a perfectly sound non-delaminated specimen and maintain the majority of loading capacity even with an introduced delamination. The embedded continuous key also provided a higher horizontal displacement capability before fracture in comparison to the initially delaminated test specimens. As for the test specimens used to determine the material characteristics, ASTM D- 3410 and modified ASTM C- 364 standards were followed. The test specimens had a fiber volume fraction of approximately 0. 60, which details the brittle failure under tensile and compression loading. The results also show that the fibrous fiberglass test specimens have a higher ultimate strength in compression or buckling then in tension. All of the experimental testing was completed in the Aerospace Engineering Structural/Composite Lab at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, California. Therefore, an introduction of a continuous arrestment key parallel to the in-plane loading and embedded into the composite sandwich structure provided a significant increase in loading and buckling capabilities in comparison to the control test specimens with and without an initial delamination and no embedded key. The continuous key placed parallel to the load vector increased the structural strength with an increase of 126 % from a 1 -inch delaminated structures and only an 11 % drop from non-delaminated structures. That is, 1 -inch and 2 -inch delaminated structures showed a 61 % drop and 81 % drop from non-delaminated structures. Some configurations have reduced or arrested of the delaminated region...|$|E

Solutions are therefore dependent on the magnitude of applied loads and the direction of resulting internal member forces (whether they are compression or tension). Direct differentiation is used in the sensitivity analysis, and analytical expressions for the associated derivatives are derived in a form that is computationally efficient.

40|$|Thin-walled {{cylindrical}} shell structures often have buckling as the critical failure mode, and the buckling of such structures {{can be very}} sensitive to small <b>geometric</b> imperfections. The <b>buckling</b> analyses of an 8 -ft-diameter, 10 -ft-long honeycomb-core composite cylinder loaded in pure axial compression is discussed in this document. Two loading configurations are considered configuration 1 uses simple end conditions, and configuration 2 includes additional structure that may more closely approximate experimental loading conditions. Linear eigenvalue buckling analyses and nonlinear analyses with and without initial geometric imperfections were performed on both configurations. The initial imperfections were introduced in the shell by applying a radial load at the midlength of the cylinder to form a single inward dimple. The critical bifurcation buckling loads are predicted to be 924, 190 lb and 924, 020 lb for configurations 1 and 2, respectively. Nonlinear critical buckling loads of 918, 750 lb and 954, 900 lb were predicted for geometrically perfect configurations 1 and 2, respectively.

40|$|Tension, {{compression}} and impact properties of a polyurethane encapsulant foam have been measured {{as a function}} of foam density. Significant differences in the behavior of the foam were observed depending on the mode of testing. Over the range of densities examined, both the modulus and the elastic collapse stress of the foam exhibited power-law dependencies with respect to density. The power-law relationship for the modulus was the same for both tension and compression testing and is explained in terms of the elastic compliance of the cellular structure of the foam using a simple <b>geometric</b> model. Euler <b>buckling</b> is used to rationalize the density dependence of the collapse stress. Neither tension nor compression testing yielded realistic measurements of energy absorption (toughness). In the former case, the energy absorption characteristics of the foam were severely limited due to the inherent lack of tensile ductility. In the latter case, the absence of a failure mechanism led to arbitrary measures of energy absorption that were not indicative of true material properties. Only impact testing revealed an intrinsic limitation in the toughness characteristics of the material with respect to foam density. The results suggest that dynamic testing should be used when assessing the shock mitigating qualities of a foam...|$|R

That study also provided comparison of experimental results with numerical predictions from a research code making use of a new thermoelastic model for shape memory alloy hybrid composite (SMAHC) structures.

However, deficiencies in the experimental-numerical correlation were noted and hypotheses for the discrepancies were given for further investigation.

40|$|The {{important}} role of geometric imperfections on the decrease of the buckling load for thin-walled cylinders had been recognized already by the first authors investigating the theoretical approaches on this topic. However, there are currently no closed-form solutions to take imperfections into account already during the early design phases, forcing the analysts to use lower-bound methods to calculate the required knock-down factors (KDF). Lower-bound methods such as the empirical NASA SP- 8007 guideline are commonly used in the aerospace and space industries, while the approaches based on the Reduced Stiffness Method (RSM) have been used mostly in the civil engineering field. Since 1970 s {{a considerable number of}} experimental and numerical investigations have been conducted to develop new stochastic and deterministic methods for calculating less conservative KDFs. Among the deterministic approaches, the single perturbation load approach (SPLA), proposed by Hühne, will be further investigated for axially compressed fiber composite cylindrical shells and compared with four other methods commonly used to create <b>geometric</b> imperfections: linear <b>buckling</b> mode-shaped, <b>geometric</b> dimples, axisymmetric imperfections and measured geometric imperfections from test articles.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the present work nonlinear contact finite elements (»Nllink« elements) offered by SAP 2000 commercial software program are presented. The behaviour of the most typical elements (linear and nonlinear axial springs, axial springs of the »Gap«, »Hook« and »Plastic« types and also linear and nonlinear springs in shear and bending direction) is shown in simple examples. Such springs are then used for the modeling the behaviour of structural elements with imperfect connections, among which the connections in layered beams are presented in detail (cantilever, T beam, layered timber beam with nailed interfaces). Nonlinearities in restraints and groundwork are also modeled with the presented springs (beam, base plate). Last of all, an example of a stone wall with cracks modeled with springs is analysed. Different types of analyses are used: linear analysis, nonlinear analysis (geometric linear and <b>geometric</b> nonlinear) and <b>buckling</b> analysis. The results of our models are compared with the available data and only small deviations are noticed. It is evident that using the presented method of modeling, which takes imperfect connections into account, we can describe the actual behaviour of structural elements with much more precision. Such modeling therefore appears highly sensible and practical to use, especially with the SAP 2000 program, which, in this respect, is highly advantageous and easy to use. The differences in the behaviour and, consequently, in the strength between structural elements with perfect and imperfect connections respectively, are considerable, which is particularly emphasized with the example of layered timber beam with nailed interfaces. The properties of interfaces between layers must obviously be known in such modeling...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and {{effective}} numerical approach is presented {{on the basis of}} the Member Discrete Element Method (MDEM) to investigate static and dynamic responses of steel frames with semi-rigid joints. In the MDEM, structures are discretized into a set of finite rigid particles. The motion equation of each particle is solved by the central difference method and two adjacent arbitrarily particles are connected by the contact constitutive model. The above characteristics means that the MDEM is able to naturally handle structural geometric nonlinearity and fracture. Meanwhile, the computational framework of static analysis is consistent with that of dynamic analysis, except the determination of damping. A virtual spring element with two particles but without actual mass and length is used to simulate the mechanical behaviors of semi-rigid joints. The spring element is not directly involved in the calculation, but is employed only to modify the stiffness coefficients of contact elements at the semi-rigid connections. Based on the above-mentioned concept, the modified formula of the contact element stiffness with consideration of semi-rigid connections is deduced. The Richard-Abbort four-parameter model and independent hardening model are further introduced accordingly to accurately capture the nonlinearity and hysteresis performance of semi-rigid connections. Finally, the numerical approach proposed is verified by complex behaviors of steel frames with semi-rigid connections such as <b>geometric</b> nonlinearity, snap-through <b>buckling,</b> dynamic responses and fracture. The comparison of static and dynamic responses obtained using the modified MDEM and those of the published studies illustrates that the modified MDEM can simulate the mechanical behaviors of semi-rigid connections simply and directly, and can accurately effectively capture the linear and nonlinear behaviors of semi-rigid connections under static and dynamic loading. Some conclusions, as expected, are drawn that structural bearing capacity under static loading will be overestimated if semi-rigid connections are ignored; when the frequency of dynamic load applied is close to structural fundamental frequency, hysteresis damping of nonlinear semi-rigid connections can cause energy dissipation compared to rigid and linear semi-rigid connections, thus avoiding the occurrence of resonance. Additionally, fracture analysis also indicates that semi-rigid steel frames possess more anti-collapse capacity than that with rigid steel frames...|$|R

Military belt- cingulum militare, was the inseparable part of {{the equipment}} and valuable property ofRoman soldier. It consisted of wider military belt, decorated and secured with the metal rectangularplates fastened by a D-shaped buckle. This buckle type is, because of its shape, also known as apelta shaped cingulum buckle. The same as metal plates, the belt buckles were usually made of alloycopper or brass by casting or forging. Often they were tin or silver plated, and could be decorated byhammering, carving, hallmarking and inserting niello by varying diff erent plant and <b>geometric</b> motifs. Cingulum <b>buckles</b> as other parts of a military belt have mostly been found on the militarylocations from Brittania, through Germania, Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia to Maesia. They can be foundalong {{the borders of the}} Roman Empire where numerous castrums and castelli were situated nextto the fortifi ed Roman Limes, {{as well as in the}} areas within the borders as the Italian examples show(Herculaneum, Aquileia). Dalmatian fi nds also belong to this context (Salona, Tilurium, Burnum,Epidaurum). Five buckles that typologically belong to the military belt buckles of the 1 st century originatefrom Salona, the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia. However, Salona buckles diff er fromone another whether in mode of manufacture or in decoration, so each one represents a variant ofcingulum D-shaped buckles. Buckle that is catalogued as no. 1 (picture 1) is made of bronze plate and it is decorated by silvercoating, and by its shape it fi ts with the buckles that are known in literature as Krempenschallebuckle with accentuated edge. The next buckle catalogued under the catalogue number 2 (picture 2) represents the transitive type between metal sheet buckles and completely cast ones. Castbuckle cat. no. 3 (pictures 3 a, 3 b) diff ers from the two previous ones in form, since the endings ofthe spindle have no spiral endings. This is the only buckle that has a lily-shaped tongue preserved. Buckle decorated with niello (cat. no. 4, picture 4) is interesting because the identical concept of thedecoration can be found on the buckle from the Hod Hill site in Britain. Buckle with cat. no. 5 (picture 5) is characteristic for the kidney-shaped forms within the semi-circular frame that were formed byelongating the swirl to the inner {{part of the}} bow. These buckles could have belonged to the cingulum of active soldiers who performed civil dutiesin Salona, or to the veterans settled in the town area who carried a military belt as their privateproperty. In that situation, military belt was a clear status symbol. Although everything leads to theconclusion that Salonitan buckles were owned by soldiers, the possibility of their civil use should notbe eliminated. It is more diffi cult to defi ne a workshop that could have produced Salonitan buckles. It is a factthat similar examples appear in distant areas of the Empire and that is without doubt connected tothe great fl uctuation of the armies. Buckles with the identical concept of decoration from Salona (cat. no. 4, picture 4) and Hod Hill in Britain are interesting in this context. Another buckle comes from HodHill, which is by its form, its workmanship and decoration connected to an analogous buckle from themilitary camp Tilurium. There was a workshop in Salona, the capital of the province, which produced and treated metal. It was situated between the forum and curia and it may have produced objects for military purposethat would include metal parts of the belts. Inscriptions that state their associations such as collegiumfabrum, collegium fabrum Veneris and collegium fabrum et centonariorum, witness the existence ofthe craftsmen that worked with metal in Salona. The closeness of the military camps Tilurium andBurnum that were situated near Salona, should be taken into consideration when discussed aboutthe place where buckles found in Salona could have been produced. Workshops probably existedclose to the camps, as is the case with many military camps all over the Empire...|$|R
