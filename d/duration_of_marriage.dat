60|$|Socialism has {{not even}} worked out what are the {{reasonable}} conditions of a State marriage contract, {{and it would be}} ridiculous to pretend it had. This is not a defect in Socialism particularly, but a defect in human knowledge. At countless points in the tangle of questions involved, the facts are not clearly known. Socialism does not present any theory whatever about the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> whether, as among the Roman Catholics, it should be absolutely for life, or, as some hold, for ever; or, as among the various divorce-permitting Protestant bodies, until this or that eventuality; or even, as Mr. George Meredith suggested some years ago, for a term of ten years. In these matters Socialism does not decide, and it is quite reasonable to argue that Socialism need not decide. Socialism maintains an attitude of neutrality. And the practical effect of an attitude of neutrality is to leave these things as they are at present. The State is not urgently concerned with these questions. So long as a marriage contract provides for the health and sanity of the contracting parties, and for their proper behaviour so far as their offspring is concerned, and for so long as their offspring need it, the demands of the community, as the guardian of the children, are satisfied. That certainly would be the minimum marriage, the State marriage, and I, for my own part, would exact nothing more in the legal contract. But a number of more representative Socialists than I are for a legally compulsory life marriage. Some--but they are mostly of the older, less definite, Social Democratic teaching--are for a looser tie. Let us clearly understand that we are here talking of the legal marriage only--the State's share. We are not talking of what people will do, but of how much they are to be made to do. A vast amount of stupid confusion arises from forgetting that. What was needed more than that minimum I have specified would be provided, I believe--it always has been provided hitherto, even to excess--by custom, religion, social influence, public opinion.|$|E

Using US state level panel data I provide evidence that after the adoption <b>of</b> unilateral divorce, <b>marriage</b> rates declined significantly and permanently in adopting states. This decline accounts for half of the initial gap in marriage rates between adopting and non-adopting states. The effect of unilateral divorce law is greatest for marriage rates amongst younger age cohorts, those marrying for the first time, and whites. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> that take place under unilateral divorce is also {{found to be significantly}} greater than those that occur under mutual consent.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> personality trait, gender and conflict resolution strategies of spouses in Makurdi, Nigeria. The research design employed was ex-post facto survey design. Purposive and convenience sampling techniques were used to select two hundred participants made up of 100 males and 100 females. Two standardized psychological instruments were used namely: Conflict Resolution Strategies Scale (CRSS) and The Big five Inventory (BFI). Data was analyzed using independent t-test, One-way Anova and multiple regression. Results showed that while <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> had no significant relationship with conflict resolution strategies of spouses, personality traits and gender showed significant relationship. The result also indicated a significant interactive relationship between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> personality traits, gender and conflict resolution strategies of spouses. It was then recommended that counsellors should put into consideration the interplay of <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> personality traits and gender when issues of conflicts arise {{with a view of}} assisting spouses in adopting helpful resolution strategies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is an invasive, uncomfortable, {{and painful}} procedure. Patients often {{experience}} considerable anxiety and stress before the procedure. In this study, we aimed {{to evaluate the}} effect of preprocedure anxiety on postprocedure pain scores and clinical outcomes in women undergoing HSG. Methods: This study {{was designed as a}} prospective randomized study. Women undergoing HSG were asked to complete the Beck Anxiety Inventory before the procedure. Patients were classified into two groups according to the anxiety score (Group 1 : anxiety score ≤ 25; n =  84 and Group 2 : anxiety score > 25, n =  25). All of the patients were asked to state the severity of their pain during the procedure using a visual analogue scale immediately after the procedure. Then, postprocedure pain scores and clinical features were evaluated. Data analyzed were: age, gravidity, parity, <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and infertility, body mass index, procedure time, amount of contrast media used, operator sex, history of surgery, educational level, and HSG results. Results: A total of 109 women were enrolled into this prospective study. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of age, body mass index, <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and infertility, procedure time, amount of contrast media used, operator sex, history of surgery, educational level, and patency of the one and/or two fallopian tubes (p >  0. 05). The median parity and pain scores after the procedure were lower in Group 1 (p  25. Logistic regression method demonstrated that higher parity, preprocedure anxiety score > 25, and male operator were risk factors for increased postprocedure visual analogue scale scores. Conclusion: According to this study, preprocedure anxiety levels have an effect on postoperative pain scores in women undergoing HSG procedure. Multiparity, male operator, and higher preprocedure anxiety scores also may have an effect on postoperative pain scores...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: In {{spite of}} the {{importance}} of marital satisfaction in couple relation, there is a little research in the Iranian context that examined the relationship between background factors and marital satisfaction. Thus, this study examined the relationship between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> number of children, years of education and family income with female marital satisfaction. Approach: The study was carried out among a sample of 337 wives in Shiraz City, Iran. The Kansas Marital Satisfaction (KMS) was used to measure marital satisfaction. The study employed correlations test to determine the relationships between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> number of children, years of education and family income with marital satisfaction. Results: The study found that there were no significant relationships between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and family income and marital satisfaction. There was a negative significant relationship between respondents age and number of children and marital satisfaction. There was a positive significant relationship between respondents years of education and marital satisfaction. The Multivariate Regression Analysis was used to answer the last objective.

The evidence presented here suggests that the likelihood of marital breakdown varies with the age at marriage and the timing of childbearing: this is consistent with previous research. This study is, however, the first in Britain to investigate the impact of women's work experience on the probabilities of marital dissolution and subsequent remarriage. Work experience is an important influence on women's earning capacity: the analysis indicates that in general, more work experience tends to increase the risk of marital dissolution, but it is also associated with quicker remarriage.

The output of the matching method is the difference between the survival functions of treated and untreated individuals at each time point.
