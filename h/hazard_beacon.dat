5000|$|Acrophobia is a {{significant}} modification to the Gyro Drop model, enough to be marketed as a distinct version, the [...] "Floorless, Tilting Gyro Drop". Instead of being seated on the round ride gondola, riders are fastened into special harnesses that partially resemble large bicycle seats. These harnesses allow the riders' legs to dangle freely, similar to using a parachute; hence, no [...] "floor."As the ride cycle begins, a winch system grabs the gondola and lifts it upwards. Shortly after, the gondola begins to slowly rotate, completing one revolution before reaching {{the top of the}} tower. As it approaches the top of the tower, Acrophobia's second innovation is revealedâ€”pneumatic pistons behind the harnesses tilt them outwards roughly 15 degrees past vertical. The intent is to [...] "force" [...] riders to look down and see how high they are. After a short delay, the winch releases the gondola, allowing it to free-fall back to the ground, where an array of braking systems slows it down and eventually allows it to come to a full stop, thus completing the cycle.Acrophobia is just over 200 feet in height, as evidenced by the FAA-mandated red <b>hazard</b> <b>beacon</b> {{at the top of the}} tower, although the actual drop height of the ride is approximately 161 feet.The ride cycle begins as the airgates open to allow the riders onto the ride and take their seats on the unit. Once all safety checks have been performed, attendants enter their chained safety zones and give the all clear signal. The Catcher comes down, winches the gondola and begins the ascent to the top of the tower. The 30 seat unit begins to rotate a full 360 degrees as it completes its revolution during the ascent. Once the catcher reaches the top of the tower, the operator teases and sometimes sings to the riders to encourage them to forget about the drop. After a few nerve-wracking seconds the gondola drops to the braking system in less than 3.5 seconds.|$|E

40|$|A {{low-cost}} collision {{hazard warning}} system suitable for implementation in both general and commercial aviation is presented. Laser beacon systems are used as sources of accurate relative position information that are not dependent on communication between aircraft or with the ground. The beacon system consists of a rotating low-power laser beacon, detector arrays with special optics for wide angle acceptance and filtering of solar background light, microprocessors for proximity and relative trajectory computation, and pilot displays of potential <b>hazards.</b> The laser <b>beacon</b> system provides direct measurements of relative aircraft positions; using optimal nonlinear estimation theory, the measurements resulting from the current beacon sweep are combined with previous data {{to provide the best}} estimate of aircraft proximity, heading, minimium passing distance, and time to closest approach...|$|R
