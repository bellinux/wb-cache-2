5|$|Pliny {{addresses}} {{magic in}} Book XXX. He {{is critical of}} the Magi, attacking astrology, and suggesting that magic originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health. He names Zoroaster of Ancient Persia {{as the source of}} magical ideas. He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of the}} Peloponnesian War.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

25|$|Injury on {{a winter}} tour of India ended Gover's run of success: in 1938, apart from a week in late May and early June when he {{achieved}} his best figures of 14 for 85 against Worcestershire, Gover was clearly unfit (despite periods of rest) and had so little venom his haul of wickets fell from 201 to just 86. Though he recovered somewhat in 1939 with increased fitness, it was already evident Gover would struggle to regain the speed and venom of his two great years. However, when county cricket resumed after World War II in 1946 Gover, at 38, bowled so well under unfavourable conditions that {{he played in the}} Third Test against India. With his strong physique <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> he was not chosen for either the 1936/1937 or 1946/1947 Ashes tours. He decided 1947 would be his last year in county cricket, but Gover was still regarded as the best fast bowler in England, and there were calls for him to be selected for the last Test when Harold Butler withdrew and Alec Bedser was out of form.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Gulistan {{left the}} {{possibility}} of conflict open between the two countries, thus being weak from the start. Russia's main priority before the war was {{to focus on the}} wars being fought with Napoleon, which explains the small numbers of troops it dedicated for the Russo-Persian War. The treaty of Gulistan was mainly a way for both countries to “gain a breath” so that the Russo-Persian War could end and they could focus on other issues. After the Treaty was signed, Persia started to rapidly build up its army once more, as Fath Ali Shah was fully devoted to regaining the lost territories. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> to no one when Fath Ali Shah ordered his military commander, Abbas Mirza, to start training troops in 1823, three years in advance of the second Russo-Persian War of the century, which was three times as much military preparation as he had devoted to the first War. The clergy in Persia also publicly announced that the jihad against Russia was not over. In 1826, once again Persia attacked the territories lost to Russia (with the British supporting the Persians). The second Russo-Persian War lasted two years and Persia lost 35,000 troops to Russia’s 8,000. Performing poorly in the war, Persia lost, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which resulted in the loss of modern-day Armenia and the remaining parts of contemporary Azerbaijan.|$|E
500|$|After a 20-year {{retirement}} {{from the film}} industry, O'Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy-drama Only the Lonely. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O'Hara stated of her return: [...] "Twenty {{years is a long}} time, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> how little changed. The equipment is lighter now, and they work a bit faster, but I hardly felt like I'd been away". She described Candy as [...] "one of my all-time favorite leading men", and was surprised by the extent of his talent, remarking that he was a [...] "comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent" [...] who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including The Christmas Box, Cab for Canada and The Last Dance, the latter her last film in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.|$|E

500|$|Lord Phillips {{said that}} the appeal raised the [...] "narrow issue" [...] of whether [...] "the act of {{preparing}} a joint witness statement is one in respect of which an expert witness enjoys immunity from suit", and the broader issue of whether [...] "public policy justifies conferring on an expert witness any immunity from liability in negligence {{in relation to the}} performance of his duties in that capacity." [...] He said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that the immunity had simply been accepted in the past and never challenged. He noted that the immunity dated back to Cutler v Dixon in 1585, over 400 years ago, before English tort law developed the modern law of negligence. It was originally a complete protection for witnesses against claims for defamation, before developing to cover protection from other tort claims. [...] He noted that it was difficult to draw the line at present between expert assistance that was immune from claim and that which was not: it might be that the earlier advice was negligent, not the evidence given in court resiling from that earlier advice, even if it was the later developments about which the client complained.|$|E
500|$|In 1931, Lowerhouse {{finished}} in equal fourth place, its best {{position in the}} league since 1908. Reviewing the season, the Burnley News gave credit to St Hill for the revival. Describing him as a dependable batsman, it stated {{that he had a}} big impact with the ball. He scored 288 runs at 14.40, with a top score of 46, [...] to finish third in the club batting averages. He topped the bowling averages with 68 wickets, 46 of which were bowled, at 12.20. By the following season, St Hill's wife had joined him in Lowerhouse. An end of season summary in the Burnley Express suggested that his batting had improved, and that he had surprised people with his ability. He played several longer innings, with a highest score of 85, and he scored runs by [...] "delightfully played cricket". He headed the batting and bowling averages for the club with 477 runs at 20.73 and 77 wickets at 13.87. However, the report stated that his bowling had been inconsistent and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that he ended with such a good average. Nevertheless, his figures stood comparison with other leading professionals in the Lancashire League. The club dropped to equal fifth in the league.|$|E

[...] Rubinstein adds, And surely <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that the theory of Music was to be taught {{for the first time}} in the Russian language at our Conservatory....

2500|$|As noted at {{the time}} by Titu Maiorescu, Kalinderu was {{responsible}} for placing his government in a humiliating position, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> that such a mission was entrusted to so unqualified an individual. Brătianu, who had taken over as Prime Minister, arrived in Berlin to personally supervise the negotiations, reportedly because the hastiness on the German side to seal off the deal [...] "inspired in him grave disquietude". According to one account, he viewed Kalinderu as incompetent, arranging for Eugeniu Carada to replace him as the actual negotiator, in all but name. Nevertheless, Kalinderu's authority in international law was recognized following his employment by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.

Edmonds thought that Haig wanted a decisive success and the capture of distant objectives on the first day, despite doubts that he withheld. Travers had written that the Edmonds draft was wrong, yet had formed the same conclusions as Edmonds. Travers had criticised the published draft, for failing to record that Haig had not resolved disagreements and problems among his subordinates, long before the offensive began; Green wrote that Edmonds had made the same criticism. Green wrote that judging the drafts of the volume [...] "pro-" [...] or [...] "anti-" [...] Haig or Gough was facile and led to inconsistent conclusions.

2500|$|Holman {{began his}} career in 1962 at KTBC-TV, Austin, TX, while {{attending}} the University of Texas, Austin, TX, where he was studying Radio & TV Broadcasting.

In 1964 while still at KTBC-TV he produced, directed, choreographed & danced in a [...] "music video" [...] before music videos had even been know or become popular. [...] That short B 16mm film got Holman this first job in New York City that same year as an Associate Producer of national TV & Radio commercials with Norman, Craig & Kummel Advertising, one of the largest advertising agencies in the world. [...] Within 3 months Holman was made a producer and produced over 100 TV & Radio commercials, a few of which became [...] "classic" [...] including Ajax Laundry Detergent's [...] "White Knight" [...] and Hertz Rent-A-Car's [...] "The Flying Man". [...] After 3 years, ABC Sports hired Holman to be a Unit Manager for [...] "Wide World of Sports" [...] covering sporting events in the U.S. and England including NBA basketball, NCAA football, Track & Field, Swimming & Diving, and PGA Golf tournaments, including the British Open in Blackpool, England. [...] After 3 years Holman was promoted by ABC to be the first Production Administrator assigned to a multiple of TV series & specials including [...] "The Dick Cavett Show", [...] "The Tony Awards", [...] "The Grammy Awards" [...] & [...] "The EMMY Awards". [...] While in this ABC position in 1973 Holman met Jim Henson.

[...] (Miss Piggy had not been [...] "born" [...] yet, nor was Kermit the Frog the host) [...] When ABC ordered a second TV special, [...] "The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence" [...] for a possible Muppet TV series in prime-time, Henson hired Holman away from ABC to be his associate producer for that second pilot. After the two Specials aired <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> to Henson and Holman to learn that the network [...] "passed" [...] on hiring the Muppets to be in prime-time. [...] The two other networks at the time – NBC and CBS – also [...] "passed". [...] "The Muppet Show" [...] was picked up as a syndicated TV series by several affiliates instead, and later became a hit in syndication. [...] "By the second season, the series was breaking syndication records and broadcasting in more than 100 countries. And it won several EMMY Awards."
