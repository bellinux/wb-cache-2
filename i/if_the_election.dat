5|$|In {{the wake}} of FN electoral success, the {{immigration}} debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 affaire du foulard {{was the first major}} test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following the event, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In {{the first round of the}} 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system (<b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> had used proportional representation, it would have won 64 seats).

25|$|High {{voter turnout}} is often {{considered}} to be desirable, though among political scientists and economists specializing in public choice, the issue is still debated. A high turnout is generally seen {{as evidence of the}} legitimacy of the current system. Dictators have often fabricated high turnouts in showcase elections for this purpose. For instance, Saddam Hussein's 2002 plebiscite was claimed to have had 100% participation. Opposition parties sometimes boycott votes they feel are unfair or illegitimate, or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> is for a government that is considered illegitimate. For example, the Holy See instructed Italian Catholics to boycott national elections for several decades after the creation of the state of Italy. In some countries, there are threats of violence against those who vote, such as during the 2005 Iraq elections, an example of voter suppression. However, some political scientists question the view that high turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system. Mark N. Franklin contends that in European Union elections opponents of the federation, and of its legitimacy, are just as likely to vote as proponents.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{findings}} of the report and Masuzoe's admission, public discontent continued to rise {{in the first half of}} June 2016, with at least 70 per cent of Tokyo residents seeking his resignation. Masuzoe lost the support of his former backers, the LDP and Komeito parties, as they feared negative consequences in the national House of Councillors election to be held on 10 July and the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election the following year. On the afternoon of 15 June 2016, a no-confidence motion jointly submitted by all parties, including the LDP and Komeito, was to be voted upon in the Metropolitan Assembly. Despite publicly stating his refusal to step down the previous day, citing more time for public consideration, Masuzoe ultimately submitted his resignation effective 21 June to assembly president Shigeo Kawai on the morning of 15 June 2016. Another reason Masuzoe gave for seeking to delay his resignation was the pending Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil, which he was scheduled to attend as the representative of Tokyo, the host of the 2020 Summer Olympics. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> of his replacement is held in July 2016, then the subsequent election will happen in July 2020, in the middle of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.|$|E

500|$|Almost all {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that Chamorro could not win. She was depicted as rich {{with no real}} experience.

In reality, her humility and provincial roots worked for her; she had run a family, a business and been part of the original Junta; the Sandinistas blocked payment of funds to her from the US while simultaneously claiming she received them; and she had long been vocal about her displeasure of US involvement in Nicaragua. According to Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa; Humberto Belli, an editor of La Prensa and later Minister of Education; and other writers such as Edward Sheehan and Shirley Christian who have written about the country, Nicaragua {{is one of the most}} religious countries in Latin America.

40|$|Since {{the allied}} {{invasion}} of Afghanistan in late 2001, {{there have been}} three presidential elections in Afghanistan, with the first democratic hand-over of power happening in 2014. Post-conflict elections have been widely debated by academics, with particular concern over the environment in which they are held and to which they contribute. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> are successful in producing a legitimate outcome, they can be used to further stability and nation building. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> are unsuccessful, then they risk a return to conflict. The lack of interference in the electoral process by politicians and non-relevant government agencies is one factor that adds to their legitimacy; if such interference occurs, the results are muddied. Legitimacy and unambiguous outcomes are crucial in determining the success of an election. This thesis explores the three Afghanistan presidential elections from 2004 - 2014 to assess <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> are helping to enable – in this respect, at least - a post-conflict, democratically viable state. This thesis contributes to the literature on post-conflict democracy building in a measured way, by focusing on the three Afghanistan presidential elections to gauge whether they have been successful and effective in enabling a democratically viable Afghanistan, or at the very least, demonstrate an increasing democratic integrity. The findings present significant challenges to reports that <b>the</b> three presidential <b>elections</b> in Afghanistan bode well for democratic consolidation. They suggest, rather, that these elections have been {{to a greater or lesser}} extent rife with fraudulent votes, corrupt candidates and officials, and corruption by representatives of the government such as <b>the</b> Independent <b>Election</b> Commission. <b>The</b> corrosive effects of corruption are not restricted to <b>the</b> presidential <b>elections,</b> but have become an increasing part of everyday life in Afghanistan. What makes the situation worse is that the international community supporting democratization is more inclined for an electoral result to emerge that to highlight the shortcomings of the process. My conclusion is that Afghanistan continues to face major challenges in conducting free and fair elections, and while <b>elections</b> are not <b>the</b> entire picture of democratization, they are its symbolic and genuine centrepiece. As long as this situation continues, democratization will be compromised, perhaps fatally...|$|R

500|$|There {{were rumors}} that some Russian {{politicians}} were seriously considering granting autonomy to Poland, and that Polish activists wished to incorporate Lithuanian lands into their autonomous region, {{calling on the}} historic tradition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In light of these rumors, {{the demands of the}} delegates were much more radical than were expected. Most demanded autonomy in ethnographic Lithuanian lands along with any border areas that would decide to join. The region would be governed by a democratically elected seimas in Vilnius and bound by federal ties with neighboring lands. The [...] "ethnographic Lithuanian lands" [...] at issue were not clearly defined, but resistance to tsarist authorities was to be organized in Kovno, Grodno, and Vilna Governorates; special attention was given to Suwałki Governorate. The Seimas' resolution, adopted on the second day, explicitly stated that Lithuanians from Suwałki Governorate had decided to join the fight for autonomous Lithuania. This was largely an attempt to prevent the potential Polish autonomous region from claiming Suwałki, then part of Congress Poland, for itself. The election to seimas was to be universal, equal, direct and secret; all persons were to be granted suffrage without regard to sex, religion, or nationality. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> had taken place, {{it would have been the}} first in Europe where women were granted an equal right to vote.|$|E
