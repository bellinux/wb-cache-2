40|$|The {{availability}} of {{increasing amounts of}} information on the World Wide Web generates problems of information overload, that lead to increasing efforts for information retrieval {{on the one hand and}} increasing portions of irrelevant information on the other. Research efforts address these problems. However, there is still a lack of common understanding of <b>information</b> <b>brokering</b> processes, tasks, and roles. Additionally, existing systems do not account for the meaning of context for information needs: while the importance of context for information needs is agreed on in the literature, a common framework for understanding, organising, and using contextual knowledge explicitly within <b>information</b> <b>brokering</b> processes is still missing. The central question underlying this work is the following: when we know about the context in which a person is currently situated and we know the context in or for which available information has been produced, how can we then use this knowledge to improve the individual's access to information? To address this question, this work performs a comprehensive analysis of <b>information</b> <b>brokering</b> processes in various domains and develops <b>information</b> <b>brokering</b> process, role, and task models of general applicability. Furthermore, the role context plays within these processes is analysed and a framework of contextualisation goals and appropriate contextualisation techniques is developed. Finally, a general context modelling framework is developed based on the definition of context modelling requirements. This context modelling framework provides guidelines for the explicit representation, assessment, and retrieval of contextual information in order to enhance <b>information</b> <b>brokering</b> processes with contextual information. The models proposed in this work are evaluated through the development of several <b>information</b> <b>brokering</b> environments and their application in different <b>information</b> <b>brokering</b> domains...|$|R

500|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} {{as to whether or}} not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character's paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the Batgirl Special specifically to retire the character and set her in place for The Killing Joke. Gail Simone included the character's paralysis in a list of [...] "major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered", dubbing the phenomenon [...] "Women in Refrigerators" [...] in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend's mutilated body in his refrigerator. Following the release of the graphic novel, comic book editor and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer John Ostrander. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability—the <b>information</b> <b>broker,</b> Oracle.|$|E

[...] Although Booster Gold makes several attempts to prevent the events which took place in Batman: The Killing Joke, he ultimately fails and Barbara Gordon's chronological history remains unchanged. Rip Hunter convinces him that Barbara's destiny is to become Oracle. Later, Batman reveals that he kept Joker's photos of Barbara and Booster Gold for years and waited until Booster Gold's correct age before confronting him. Batman then thanks Booster Gold for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship.|$|E
500|$|Barbara Gordon is the {{daughter}} of Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon, the sister of James Gordon Jr., and is initially employed as head of the Gotham City Public Library. Although the character appeared in various DC Comics publications, she was prominently featured in Batman Family which debuted in 1975, partnered with the original Robin, Dick Grayson. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of the character's Batgirl persona in Batgirl Special #1, the graphic novel [...] depicts the Joker shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in paraplegia. In subsequent stories, the character was reestablished as a computer expert and <b>information</b> <b>broker</b> known as Oracle. Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in Suicide Squad #23 (1989) and later became a featured lead of the Birds of Prey series. Reverting the character to her Batgirl persona, DC Comics relaunched its comic book titles in 2011 during The New 52 event, featuring her in the eponymous Batgirl monthly title as well as Birds of Prey. These changes were retained for the second company wide relaunch in 2016 known as DC Rebirth.|$|E
