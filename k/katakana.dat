5|$|Chinese uses {{traditional}} logograms {{for writing}} the unit names, while in Japanese unit names {{are written in}} the phonetic <b>katakana</b> script; in both cases, symbols are also written using the internationally recognised Latin and Greek characters.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities {{can also}} adopt flags of their own. The designs {{of the city}} flags {{are similar to the}} prefectural flags: a mon on a monocolored background. An example is the flag of Amakusa in Kumamoto Prefecture: the city symbol is {{composed}} of the <b>Katakana</b> character ア (a) and surrounded by waves. This symbol is centered on a white flag, with a ratio of 2:3. Both the city emblem and the flag were adopted in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Rozen Maiden {{received}} a sequel under the series' <b>katakana</b> title. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump between April 2008 and January 2014. Rozen Maiden has spun off anthology manga and novel stories, art books, and four anime series; the four anime series are titled Rozen Maiden, Rozen Maiden: Träumend, Rozen Maiden: Ouvertüre, and Rozen Maiden: Zurückspulen. Tokyo Broadcasting System were the producers for the anime with Nomad as the animation studio {{for the first}} three series and Studio Deen for Zurückspulen. The anime adaptions resulted in several audio disc releases and three video games.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{works of}} Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, {{all from the}} 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (Hiragana and <b>Katakana)</b> was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of Heian court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu {{is often described as}} the world's first novel.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Famicom's {{restricted}} hardware capabilities, the remake {{is entirely}} two-dimensional. Special compensation {{was made for}} some of the in-battle sprites such as Cloud Strife's, combining two 16x24 pixel sprites side-by-side instead of the usual single sprite to account for weapons such as Cloud's sword or Barret's gun. While most Japanese games use only 8x8-pixel hiragana or <b>katakana</b> fonts, and most Chinese games use 4-color 16x16-pixel tiles stored in dedicated CHR ROM pages, this game uses its own several-hundred 16x16-pixel monochrome font instead. The script itself is strewn in chunks across the code; {{at the beginning of each}} piece of text for dialog boxes is a three digit number preceded by an @-symbol, signifying which character portrait to display.|$|E
5|$|Rozen Maidens plot is {{continued}} in the sequel serialization which uses the <b>katakana</b> title of the series. Inside the N-field, Jun is forced into hiding by Kirakisho and contacts an adult version of himself from an alternate world. The adult Jun is able to free Shinku and unite the Rozen Maidens to defeat Kirakisho. Kirakisho returns and successfully captures all the Rozen Maidens' masters. The Rozen Maidens pursue her eventually resulting in most of their defeat except Shinku and Kirakisho. Shinku's sympathy towards Kirakisho's loneliness convinces the latter to surrender her Rosa Mystica. With all seven gathered, Shinku becomes Alice. Using her new powers, Shinku revives her sisters and is put into a coma in return.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese colonial era, Japanese {{settlers}} mainly used Japanese {{in their}} daily discourse, and Japanese was the lingua franca used for communication between Japanese and Palauans. English was also recognised as a co-official language along with Japanese, and many Japanese had at least some knowledge of the language as well. People of mixed Japanese-Palauan heritage were more competent in Japanese than to Palauan, especially those who attended mainstream primary schools. The Japanese also introduced {{the use of the}} <b>Katakana</b> script in Palauan, which was also used in informal settings. After the Japanese surrender, the use of Japanese was discouraged in place of Palauan and English. Most Japanese-Palauans use Palauan {{in their daily}} discourse in favour of Japanese or English, although Japanese was used more frequently among Japanese-Palauans than to those that do not have Japanese ancestry. As the number of Japanese tourists increased during the 1990s, Japanese was introduced as an elective subject to Palauan schools and in elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games {{have been changed}} to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and <b>katakana.</b> During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E
5|$|While {{writing in}} Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, {{the number of}} {{documents}} written locally increased in the 7th century; though {{most of them have}} been lost. By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to {{become an integral part of}} Japanese life. There were two major factors for this development: starting with the Taika Reforms (645–649) and continuing with the Asuka Kiyomihara Code (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the Daigakuryo ("University") founded under Emperor Tenchi. The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622). The Sangyō Gisho ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (shakyōjo) before 727. The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, from the early 8th century. While the phonogram orthography enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern kana, notably hiragana and <b>katakana</b> were developed in the Heian period.|$|E
5|$|As {{the plans}} for three {{different}} versions of the game appeared, the staff realized {{that it was impossible to}} write three storylines in-house. After searching through known video game writers, they decided to consider writers in other fields. The writer suggested by Maeda was Shin Kibayashi, who was famous in Japan for his work on multiple manga and television series. Kibayashi was initially approached by Kozaki through their shared editor, and was pitched the project by the staff in December 2012. Kibayashi was going to refuse the project as he had a tight work schedule, but after both he and his daughter played through a copy of Awakening provided by staff, Kibayashi decided to accept and wrote an initial draft story. Despite his initial minimal commitment of a ten-page summary for each storyline, he became fond of the characters and felt that 10 pages were not enough, and thus the full summary for Birthright extended to about 500 pages. After delivering his work, he then wrote summaries of equal length for Conquest and Revelation, driven by the need to create a high-quality story, partially to surpass his daughter's pressuring expectations, and ended up writing enough script to fill two books. While the Japanese titles for Birthright and Conquest were written in kanji, the third storyline's title was written in <b>katakana</b> to distinguish it from the other two. A great deal of the character traits for the royals of Hoshido and Nohr were contributed by Kibayashi. After he had done his work on the storylines, other writers took over much of the rest of the work. The main scenario writer for the Revelation storyline was Yukinori Kitajima, a writer associated with the Senran Kagura series. He and other staff from his company Synthese also wrote the support conversations for Birthright and Conquest. One of the principal writers for all three story routes was Nami Komuro, who had previously worked on Awakening.|$|E
25|$|Although {{often said}} to be obsolete, in fact the {{half-width}} <b>katakana</b> are still used in many systems and encodings. For example, the titles of mini discs can only be entered in ASCII or half-width <b>katakana,</b> and half-width <b>katakana</b> are commonly used in computerized cash register displays, on shop receipts, and Japanese digital television and DVD subtitles. Several popular Japanese encodings such as EUC-JP, Unicode and Shift JIS have half-width <b>katakana</b> code as well as full-width. By contrast, ISO-2022-JP has no half-width <b>katakana,</b> and is mainly used over SMTP and NNTP.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in usage between hiragana and <b>katakana</b> is stylistic. Usually, hiragana is the default syllabary, and <b>katakana</b> {{is used in}} certain special cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{establishing}} a writing {{system for a}} language, corpus planners {{have the option of}} using an existing system or creating a new one. The Ainu of Japan chose to adopt the Japanese language’s <b>katakana</b> syllabary as the writing system for the Ainu language. <b>Katakana</b> is designed for a language with a basic CV syllable structure, but Ainu contains many CVC syllables that cannot easily be adapted to this syllabary. As a result, Ainu uses a modified <b>katakana</b> system, in which syllable-final codas are consonants by a subscript version of a <b>katakana</b> symbol that begins with the desired consonant.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{table of}} <b>katakana</b> {{together}} with their Hepburn romanization and rough IPA transcription for their use in Japanese. <b>Katakana</b> with dakuten or handakuten follow the gojūon kana without them.|$|E
25|$|Encoded in {{this block}} {{along with the}} <b>katakana</b> are the nakaguro word-separation middle dot, the chōon vowel extender, the <b>katakana</b> {{iteration}} marks, and a ligature of コト sometimes used in vertical writing.|$|E
25|$|Male authors came {{to write}} {{literature}} using hiragana. Hiragana {{was used for}} unofficial writing such as personal letters, while <b>katakana</b> and Chinese were used for official documents. In modern times, the usage of hiragana has become mixed with <b>katakana</b> writing. <b>Katakana</b> is now relegated to special uses such as recently borrowed words (i.e., since the 19th century), names in transliteration, the names of animals, in telegrams, and for emphasis.|$|E
25|$|Pre-World War II {{official}} documents mix <b>katakana</b> and kanji {{in the same}} way that hiragana and kanji are mixed in modern Japanese texts, that is, <b>katakana</b> were used for okurigana and particles such as wa or o.|$|E
25|$|<b>Katakana</b> {{were also}} used for telegrams in Japan before 1988, and for {{computer}} systems – before the introduction of multibyte characters – in the 1980s. Most computers in that era used <b>katakana</b> instead of kanji or hiragana for output.|$|E

25|$|Today <b>katakana</b> is most {{commonly}} used to write words of foreign origin {{that do not have}} kanji representations, as well as foreign personal and place names. <b>Katakana</b> is also used to represent onomatopoeia and interjections, emphasis, technical and scientific terms, transcriptions of the Sino-Japanese readings of kanji, and some corporate branding.|$|E

25|$|Japanese {{names are}} usually written in kanji, which are {{characters}} usually Chinese in origin but Japanese in pronunciation. The kanji for a name {{may have a}} variety of possible Japanese pronunciations, hence parents might use hiragana or <b>katakana</b> when giving a birth name to their newborn child. Names written in hiragana or <b>katakana</b> are phonetic renderings, and so lack the visual meaning of names expressed in the logographic kanji.|$|E
25|$|Both the dakuten and handakuten glyphs {{are drawn}} identically in hiragana and <b>katakana</b> scripts. The {{combining}} characters are rarely used in full-width Japanese characters, as Unicode and all common multibyte Japanese encodings provide precomposed glyphs for all possible dakuten and handakuten character combinations {{in the standard}} hiragana and <b>katakana</b> ranges. However, combining characters are required in half-width kana, which does not provide any precomposed characters in order to fit within a single byte.|$|E
