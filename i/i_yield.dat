25|$|<b>I</b> <b>yield</b> {{neither to}} Senator Borah nor {{to any other}} man in admiration of the Farewell Address and of the great Fathers of the Republic; but I would not use them as a cover for party politics. Never did I sneer at the Farewell Address; but I believe that the greatness of Washington was due to his looking the facts of his day in the face, and {{determining}} his conduct thereby, instead of by utterances, however wise of {{a hundred and fifty}} years before. I will trust the American people not to mistake short-sightedness for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.|$|E

Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the melée. Around this time, King John and his son, Philip the Bold, found themselves surrounded. As written by Froissart, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "To whom shall <b>I</b> <b>yield</b> me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see him, I would speak with him". Denis replied; [...] "Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him". The king handed him his right gauntlet, saying; [...] "I yield me to you".|$|E

6000|$|Upon this Sir Blamor came to Sir Tristram and put {{his arms}} about his shoulders, and he said: [...] "Tristram, <b>I</b> <b>yield</b> myself to thee, but in love and not in hate.

You may have acted weakly, under my father's influence, but I am sure you acted for the best. Nobody knew what the fatal consequences of driving me out of England would be but myself--and I was not listened to. <b>I</b> <b>yielded</b> to my father, <b>I</b> <b>yielded</b> to you; {{and this is the}} end of it! ...|$|R
