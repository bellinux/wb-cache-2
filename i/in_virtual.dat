The aim is to create new Virtual Reality worlds for treating social phobia. Two cases were examined <b>in</b> a <b>virtual</b> environment to assess whether {{it was able to}} recreate social behavior of people. First, we examined if participants who enter a crowded room <b>in</b> the <b>virtual</b> environment prefer to take a seat in a chair that is close to them. Secondly, we investigated if participants <b>in</b> the <b>virtual</b> environment have the tendency to physically distance themselves from strangers when choosing a seat {{in a room full of}} strangers.

This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend, Rosemary, would not work. Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he does not have free will. Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what people tell him but to rely on himself to face his problems.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Venetian cities {{had been}} trying to antagonize Skanderbeg's allies against him in order to halt Aragonese {{expansion}} into the Eastern Mediterranean. In response, Alfonso sent Bernard Vaquer to be the governor of Krujë, only to be replaced later by Ramon d'Ortafà, whereas the commander of the garrison was Pedro Scuder with 100 men. Alfonso thus became the nominal ruler of Albania, although Skanderbeg's men made up the dominant majority of the anti-Ottoman forces, leaving Skanderbeg <b>in</b> <b>virtual</b> command of Albania. Venice continued its efforts to turn Skanderbeg's allies against Alfonso and Skanderbeg. George Arianiti resisted the Venetian plots and even cut himself off from Albanian politics. Paul Dukagjini, however, prepared for war against Skanderbeg.|$|E

Visual stabilization {{was assessed by}} comparing eyes-open to eyes-closed conditions while participants attempted to maintain balance {{in the presence of}} a stable visual scene. Visual stabilization <b>in</b> the <b>virtual</b> display was reduced compared to real world viewing. This difference was partially accounted for by the reduced field of view <b>in</b> the <b>virtual</b> display. When the retinal flow <b>in</b> the <b>virtual</b> display was removed by using dynamic random dot stereograms with single frame lifetimes (cyclopean stimuli), vision did not stabilize posture. There was also an overall larger stabilizing influence of vision when adopting more unstable stances (e. g., one-foot compared to side-by-side stance). Reducing the graphics latency of the virtual display by 63 did not increase visual stabilization <b>in</b> the <b>virtual</b> display. Other visual and psychological differences between real and virtual environments are discussed...|$|R

The gala, held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ran for five hours, and featured 120artists with Phil Collins topping the bill and Michael Caine as the gala chairman. The show raised over £75,000 for Terry-Thomas and Parkinson's UK. The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry-Thomas {{to move out of}} his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in Godalming, Surrey. He died there on 8 January 1990, at the age of 78. The funeral service was held at St. John the Baptist Church, Busbridge, where the theme from Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines was played; he was cremated at Guildford Crematorium.|$|E
5|$|Military failure abroad, and the {{associated}} fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems {{came to a head}} in the parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. Chamberlain William Latimer and Steward of the Household John Neville were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, who was seen to hold far too much power over the ageing king, was banished from court. Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March, was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt <b>in</b> <b>virtual</b> control of government. Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but at its next convocation, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.|$|E
