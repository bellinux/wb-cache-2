25|$|Chlorinated Polyethylene (PE-C) is an {{inexpensive}} material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It {{is used in}} blends with PVC because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene {{is embedded in the}} PVC matrix, thereby increasing the <b>impact</b> <b>resistance.</b> In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry.

25|$|PMMA is an {{economical}} {{alternative to}} polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance {{are more important}} than impact strength, chemical resistance and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and <b>impact</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E

40|$|The <b>impact</b> damage <b>resistance</b> of Fibre Metal Laminates (FML) is studied. FML is a {{new family}} of {{laminated}} materials which consist of thin aluminium layers bonded together by intermediate fibre/epoxy layers. Different glass fibre FML variants are compared with Al 2024 -T 3, and carbon/PEI composites. The effect of the relative glass/epoxy content in FML is determined. FML shows an equal to 15 % better minimum cracking energy at low velocity impact compared to monolithic aluminium, but behaves much better (2 - 3. 5 x higher minimum cracking energy) at high velocities. The <b>impact</b> damage <b>resistance</b> of FML increases with an increasing glass/epoxy content. This {{is partly due to}} the strain rate sensitivity of the glass fibres. FML are also superior because during impact delamination occurs, and the laminae consequently will be loaded in a more efficient membrane deformation compared to the dominant bending deformation of the monolithic material. Carbon/PEI thermoplastic composites have a poor <b>impact</b> damage <b>resistance...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In one {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by Santa Cruz Bicycles, it was shown that for a frame design with identical shape and nearly similar weight, the carbon frame is considerably stronger than aluminum, when subjected to an overall force load (subjecting the frame to both tension and compression), and impact strength. [...] While carbon frames can be lightweight and strong, they may have lower <b>impact</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to other materials, and can be prone to damage if crashed or mishandled. Cracking and failure can result from a collision, but also from over tightening or improperly installing components. These materials are also vulnerable to fatigue failure, a process which occurs with use {{over a long period}} of time. It is possible for broken carbon frames to be repaired, but because of safety concerns it should be done only by professional firms to the highest possible standards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physical}} properties of a polymer are strongly {{dependent on the}} size or length of the polymer chain. For example, as chain length is increased, melting and boiling temperatures increase quickly. <b>Impact</b> <b>resistance</b> also tends to increase with chain length, as does the viscosity, or resistance to flow, of the polymer in its molten state. Melt viscosity [...] is related to polymer chain length Z roughly as [...] ~ Z3.2, so that a tenfold increase in polymer chain length results in a viscosity increase of over 1000 times. Increasing chain length furthermore tends to decrease chain mobility, increase strength and toughness, and increase the glass transition temperature (Tg). This {{is a result of}} the increase in chain interactions such as Van der Waals attractions and entanglements that come with increased chain length. These interactions tend to fix the individual chains more strongly in position and resist deformations and matrix breakup, both at higher stresses and higher temperatures.|$|E
40|$|Concept of electrospun polymer {{nanofiber}} fabric interleaving {{to enhance}} dynamic properties, <b>impact</b> damage <b>resistance,</b> fracture toughness and resistance, and delamination onset life was evaluated. Polymer nanofabric interleaving increased the laminate thickness and weight by {{an order of}} 1 % {{and its impact on}} in-plane mechanical properties of the composite laminate would be statistically zero. On the other hand, its influence on interlaminar fracture toughness and <b>resistance,</b> <b>impact</b> damage <b>resistance,</b> and damping is substantial. Results of this study showed that interleaving AS 4 / 3501 - 6 composite laminate increased the damping by 13 %; reduced the impact damage size to one-sixth; increased fracture toughness and resistance by 1. 5 times and one-third, respectively; significantly increased delamination onset life; and increased GI threshold by two-thirds.

40|$|The {{quasi-static}} flexural {{and impact}} performance, up to projectile impact velocities of about 270 m s− 1, of fibre metal laminates (FMLs), which consist of relatively thin, alternately stacked, layers of an aluminium alloy and a thermoset glass fibre epoxy composite, have been investigated. The effects of varying (a) the yield strength, tensile {{strength and ductility}} of the aluminium alloy layer, (b) the surface treatment used for the aluminium alloy layers and (c) the number of layers present in the FML have been studied. It was found that increasing {{the strength of the}} aluminium alloy increases the quasi-static flexural strength of the FML, providing that good adhesion is achieved between the metal and the composite layers. Further, increasing the number of alternating layers of the aluminium alloy and fibre composite also somewhat increases the quasi-static flexural properties of the FML. In contrast, increasing the strength of the aluminium alloy had relatively little effect on the <b>impact</b> perforation <b>resistance</b> of the FML, but increasing the number of alternating layers of aluminium alloy and fibre composite did significantly increase the <b>impact</b> perforation <b>resistance</b> of the FML.

However, an extruded panel in which the fire resistance has been dramatically enhanced through the addition of a-hemihydrate gypsum is expected to become widely applied as a partition wall or interior material for buildings.
