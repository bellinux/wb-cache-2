Experiment 2 (n = 124) showed no beneficial effects of testing consisting of identical problem solving compared to restudying an identical example.

40|$|Tremendous {{advances}} in semiconductor process technology are creating new {{challenges for the}} <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> of today’s digital VLSI circuits. The complexity of state-of-the-art manufacturing processes does not only lead to greater process variability, it also makes today's integrated circuits more prone to defects such as resistive shorts and opens. As a consequence, some of the manufactured circuits {{do not meet the}} timing requirements set by the design specification. These circuits must be identified by <b>delay</b> <b>testing</b> and sorted out to ensure the quality of shipped products. Due to the increasing process variability, key transistor and interconnect parameters must be modelled as random variables. These random variables capture the uncertainty caused by process variability, but also the impact of modelling errors and variations in the operating conditions of the circuits, such as the temperature or the supply voltage. The important consequence for <b>delay</b> <b>testing</b> is that a particular <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> detects a <b>delay</b> fault of fixed size in only a subset of all manufactured circuits, which inevitably leads to the shipment of defective products. Despite the fact that this problem is well understood, today's <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> generation methods are unable to consider the distortion of the <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> results, caused by process variability. To analyse and predict the effectiveness of <b>delay</b> <b>tests</b> in a population of circuits which are functionally identical but have varying timing properties, statistical timing analysis is necessary.

Scan-based at-speed <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> is becoming an indispensable method for nanometer technology designs to target the timing-related failures. However, the <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> patterns that are generally generated cannot meet the specific requirements raised from manufacturing test experience. In this work, we develop techniques to target several practical test pattern issues. The first is Small-delay defect (SDD) pattern generation using timing-aware method or N-detect method is extremely time-consuming and requires very large memory to store the test data. This is not affordable for most IC companies thus {{both of them are}} rarely used in practice. The second issue is the widely used transition <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> patterns which are generated using 1 -detect method have very low SDD coverage which is not acceptable to guarantee low DPM level. A pattern set that has a compact size as well as satisfying SDD coverage is highly required. The third issue is comparing with functional <b>test</b> pattern, <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> pattern (structural test pattern) cannot provide a reliable result in the speed binning process because of inaccurate mimicking functional running status.

40|$|In {{conventional}} <b>delay</b> <b>testing,</b> {{two types}} of tests, transition <b>tests</b> and path <b>delay</b> <b>tests,</b> are often considered. The test clock frequency is usually set to a single pre-determined parameter equal to the system clock. This paper discusses the potential of enhancing test effectiveness by using multiple test sets with multiple clock frequencies. The two intuitions motivating our analysis are 1) multiple test sets can deliver higher test quality than a single test set, and 2) for a given set of AC delay patterns, a carefully-selected, tighter clock would result in higher effectiveness to screen out potentially defective chips. Hence, by using multiple test sets, {{the overall quality of}} AC <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> can be enhanced, and by using multiple-clock schemes the cost of adding the additional pattern sets can be minimized. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of this new <b>delay</b> <b>test</b> methodology with respect to different combinations of pattern sets and to different circuit characteristics. We discuss {{the pros and cons of}} multiple-clock schemes through analysis and experiments using a statistical delay evaluation and delay defectinjected framework. ...|$|R
