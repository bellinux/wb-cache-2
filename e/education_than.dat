5|$|Between {{the end of}} 1790 {{and summer}} of 1792 Metternich studied law at the University of Mainz, {{receiving}} a more conservative <b>education</b> <b>than</b> at Strasbourg, a city the return to which was now unsafe. In the summers he worked with his father, who had been appointed plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands. In March 1792 Francis succeeded his father Leopold as Holy Roman Emperor and was crowned in July, affording Metternich a reprisal of his earlier role of Ceremonial Marshall. To this he added the honour of opening the accompanying ball alongside Louise of Mecklenburg. In the meantime France had declared war on Austria, beginning the War of the First Coalition (1792–7) and making Metternich's further study in Mainz impossible. Now {{in the employment of}} his father, he was sent on a special mission to the front. Here he led the interrogation of the French Minister of War the Marquis de Beurnonville and several accompanying National Convention commissioners. Metternich observed the siege and fall of Valenciennes, later looking back on these as substantial lessons about warfare. In early 1794 he was sent to England on, ostensibly on official business helping Viscount Desandrouin, the Treasurer-General of the Austrian Netherlands, to negotiate a loan.|$|E
5|$|Post {{election}} {{polls showed}} that Humphrey lost the white vote with 38%, nine points behind Nixon, but won the nonwhite vote solidly, 85% to 12%, including 97% of African-Americans. African-Americans favored Humphrey {{because of his}} record on civil rights, and their desire to quickly end the war in Vietnam, where blacks were overrepresented. The racial divide in the election had widened since 1964, and was attributed to civil rights protests and race riots. Humphrey won 45% of the female vote, two points ahead of Nixon, but lost to the Republican among males, 41% to 43%. Voters with only a grade school education supported Humphrey 52% to 33% over Nixon, while Nixon won among both those with no higher <b>education</b> <b>than</b> high school (43% to 42%) and those who graduated from college (54% to 37%). Occupation demographics mirrored these numbers with manual-labor workers supporting Humphrey 50% to 37%, and with white-collar (47% to 41%) and professionals (56% to 34%) favoring Nixon. Humphrey won among young voters (under 30 years old) by 47% to 38%, and also edged Nixon among those between 30 and 49 years, with 44% to 41%. Nixon won among voters over 50 years, 47% to 41%. Catholics backed Humphrey with 59%, twelve points ahead of Nixon, but Protestants favored Nixon, 49% to 35%. Humphrey lost the Independent vote 31% to 44%, with 25% going to Wallace, and won a lower percentage among Democrats (74%) than Nixon won among Republicans (86%). This discrepancy {{was connected to the}} tough Democratic primary election that caused some former McCarthy, Kennedy or McGovern supporters to vote for Nixon or Wallace as a protest.|$|E

25|$|In 1891, {{wanting more}} education, Zitkála-Šá decided at age fifteen {{to return to}} the White's Indiana Manual Labor Institute. She planned to gain more through her <b>education</b> <b>than</b> {{becoming}} a house-keeper, as the school anticipated girls would do. She studied piano and violin, and started to teach music at White's when the teacher resigned. In June 1895 Zitkála-Šá was awarded her first diploma and gave a speech on women's inequality, which received high praise from the local paper.|$|E

He was also a critical figure in the Jewish Secondary Schools Movement, which had been started by Schonfeld during the Second World War to provide a more strictly Orthodox <b>education</b> <b>than</b> the diluted variant found in long-established foundations such as the Jews' Free School.|$|E

25|$|Education held special {{significance}} for a socialist of Wilson's generation, {{in view of}} its role in both opening up opportunities for children from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize {{the potential benefits of}} scientific advances. Under the first Wilson government, {{for the first time in}} British history, more money was allocated to <b>education</b> <b>than</b> to defence. Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the Robbins Report, a bipartisan policy already in train when Labour took power.|$|E
25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why {{women are more likely}} than men to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have children under the age of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less of an <b>education</b> <b>than</b> whites. There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.|$|E
25|$|Mary Jane Clairmont was a sharp-tongued {{woman who}} often quarrelled with Godwin and favoured her own {{children}} over her husband's daughters. She contrived to send her volatile and emotionally intense daughter to boarding school for a time, thus providing her with more formal <b>education</b> <b>than</b> her stepsisters.

25|$|Septimius Severus {{grew up in}} {{the town}} of Leptis Magna. He spoke the local Punic {{language}} fluently and possibly the Berber language too, but he was also educated in Latin and Greek, which he spoke with a slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus' education, but according to Cassius Dio the boy had been eager for more <b>education</b> <b>than</b> he had actually got. Presumably Severus received lessons in oratory: at age 17 he gave his first public speech.|$|E
25|$|Sonny Montes did {{not possess}} an {{advanced}} degree, as had Lopez, {{and he had}} far less experience working in higher <b>education</b> <b>than</b> had Lopez. Montez' organizing abilities and many contacts within the Chicano Movement were compensations. It was during the joint Montes-Romero administration that Colegio Cesar Chavez received accreditation candidacy on June 18, 1975, from the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. Sonny Montes retired as Colegio administrator in October 1977, citing personal and economic concerns. He was extended an invitation to serve on Colegio's board, which he accepted.|$|E
25|$|While Asian Americans have prospered {{and have}} a median {{household}} income and educational attainment exceeding that of Whites, the same cannot {{be said for the}} other races. African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans have considerably lower income and <b>education</b> <b>than</b> do White Americans. In 2005 the median household income of Whites was 62.5% higher than that of African American, nearly one-quarter of whom live below the poverty line. Furthermore, 46.9% of homicide victims in the United States are African American indicating the many severe socio-economic problems African Americans and minorities in general continue to face in the twenty-first century.|$|E

25|$|As a result, {{several generations}} of Franco-Ontarians grew up without formal {{education}} since the dropout rate for francophones was quite high during this period. Franco-Ontarians thus opted for jobs which did not require reading and mathematical skills, such as mining and forestry, and were virtually absent from white collar jobs. Sociologically, it meant that education was not a value transmitted to younger Franco-Ontarians. Although this has changed dramatically {{since the advent of}} funding for francophone high schools in the 1960s, according to the 2001 census, francophones in Ontario still tend to have a lower level of <b>education</b> <b>than</b> the general population.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} factor determining social mobility in Finland was education. Children who attained {{a higher level of}} <b>education</b> <b>than</b> their parents were often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. A tripling or quadrupling in any one generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum reflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. Obtaining advanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however, and the children of white-collar employees still were more likely to become white-collar employees themselves than were the children of farmers and blue-collar workers. In addition, children of white-collar professionals were more likely than not to remain in that class.|$|E
25|$|Joe L. Kincheloe and Shirley R. Steinberg {{have created}} the Paulo and Nita Freire Project for International Critical Pedagogy at McGill University. In line with Kincheloe and Steinberg's {{contributions}} to critical pedagogy, the project attempts to move the field to {{the next phase of}} its evolution. In this second phase, critical pedagogy seeks to become a worldwide, decolonizing movement dedicated to listening to and learning from diverse discourses of people from around the planet. Kincheloe and Steinberg also embrace Indigenous knowledges in education as a way to expand critical pedagogy and to question educational hegemony. Joe L. Kincheloe, in expanding on the Freire's notion that a pursuit of social change alone could promote anti-intellectualism, promotes a more balanced approach to <b>education</b> <b>than</b> postmodernists.|$|E
