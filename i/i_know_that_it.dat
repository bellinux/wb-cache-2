500|$|During the campaign, {{columnist}} Cal Thomas on Fox News labeled Michelle Obama as an [...] "Angry Black Woman" [...] {{and some}} web sites attempted to propagate this image, prompting her to respond: [...] "Barack and I {{have been in}} the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, {{and at the end of}} the day, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes with the territory." ...|$|E
500|$|A. I {{would like}} to say the {{following}} about this. The term [...] "special treatment" [...] (Sonderbehandlung) has various meanings. As Poliakov says, in Poliakov - Black or Red - I can give the page number right away...I have it in my files somewhere...he reproduces forms. On these forms it says, [...] "Re: Special Treatment" [...] - first of all for Poles suitable for Germanization (eindeutschungsfaehig), and the same word, special treatment, is also for Poles not suitable for Germanization, that is those to be sent from the Eastern Occupied Territories to the Generalgouvernement. So that is one meaning of special treatment (Sonderbehandlung). Special Treatment also means - I want to say this here in this context as well, although <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is known - also means all transports of Jews, the deportation transports.|$|E
500|$|The {{season finale}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West wrote that it [...] "was hands {{down one of}} the most satisfying hours of television I have ever had the pleasure of watching," [...] explaining that it created [...] "entirely new dynamics" [...] for the fourth season, hit [...] "all major beats," [...] and had [...] "real story progression" [...] and heart. Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was [...] "brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. It was filled with twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I’m being cliche but I don’t care. I am what I am – a full fledged Office addict who got exactly what she wanted, and in fact needed from the finale." [...] James Poniewozik of Time magazine voiced similar sentiments, believing the finale to be a [...] "good if not great season-ender, and if the conclusion didn't have the holy-crap factor of The Kiss last year, Pam’s closeup reaction to Jim’s return during her interview was–like everything Jenna Fischer does on this show–winning and sweet." [...] Poniewozik disliked how the season left Karen, calling it [...] "an uncharacteristic way to end this love triangle, which was distinguished by the writers’ refusal to make anyone the bad guy." ...|$|E

I was more worried about being a good, little actress {{and being able to}} cry and scream really good. I think {{everybody}} made such an amazing effort to make sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wasn't real. In between takes we would joke around and it was just fun. It didn't really bother me until I got to be older." ...|$|R
2500|$|But oh, if only {{we could}} do Hernani instead that would be tremendous. [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would mean a great deal of trouble for the poet but my first task would be to try and {{compensate}} him..... all he would have to do would be to condense and tighten up; the action is already there ready made, and it's all immensely good theatre. Tomorrow I'll write at length to Piave setting out all the scenes from Hernani which seem to me suitable.|$|E
2500|$|Randall Wallace, {{who wrote}} the screenplay, has {{acknowledged}} Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film. In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, [...] "Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart." [...] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella).|$|E
2500|$|On Bannicle or Bannack Hill {{there was}} an Admiralty {{telegraph}} station which was built in 1822 {{as part of a}} semaphore line between the Admiralty in London and Portsmouth. It was about 30 yards east of Hill House, but no trace of the station remains. William Cobbett in Rural Rides referred to the station when travelling through the hills of Hambledon. [...] "On one of these hills is one of those precious jobs, called semaphores. For what reason this pretty name is given to a sort of Telegraph house, stuck up at public expense upon a high hill; for what reason this outlandish name is given to the thing, I must leave the reader to guess; but as to the thing itself; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means this; a pretence for giving a good sum of public away every year..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Klee's artistic {{breakthrough}} came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with August Macke and Louis Moilliet and {{was impressed}} by the quality of the light there. [...] He wrote, [...] "Color has taken possession of me; no longer do I have to chase after it, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter." [...] With that realization, faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the [...] "cool romanticism of abstraction". In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, [...] and in many works combined them [...] successfully, as he did in one series he called [...] "operatic paintings". One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is The Bavarian Don Giovanni (1919).|$|E
2500|$|Campbell, however, {{had little}} luck {{overcoming}} the tremendous antipathy toward Mulroney, despite a substantial bounce from the leadership convention. Chrétien saw an opportunity, and on September 19, released the entire Liberal platform. The 112-page document, Creating Opportunity, quickly {{became known as}} the Red Book because of its bright red cover. It was a very specific and detailed statement of exactly what a Chrétien government would do in office. The Red Book gave the Liberals the reputation as the party with ideas, since none of the other parties had anything comparable. Paul Martin, the man who led the team that produced the Red Book was less complimentary about the Red Book in private as during his time in office as Finance Minister, he was often reported to have said: [...] "Don't tell me about the Red Book, I wrote the damn thing, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a lot of crap!".|$|E
2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E
