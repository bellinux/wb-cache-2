On 26 June 2009, Methodists celebrated the 120th year since Methodism arrived in Czarist Russia by erecting a new Methodist centre in Saint Petersburg. A Methodist presence was continued in Russia for 14 years after the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the efforts of Deaconess Anna Eklund. In 1939, political antagonism stymied the work of the Church and Deaconess Anna Eklund was coerced to return to her native Finland.After 1989, the Soviet Union allowed greatly increased religious freedoms and this continued after the USSR's collapse in 1991. During the 1990s, Methodism experienced a powerful wave of revival in the nation. Three sites in particular carried the torch—Samara, Moscow and Ekaterinburg.

40|$|A {{classification}} of the <b>extensions</b> of <b>degree</b> p 2 over Qp whose normal closure is a p-extension par Luca CAPUTO Résumé. Soit k une extension finie de Qp et soit Ek l’ensemble des extensions de degre ́ p 2 sur k dont la clôture normale est une p-extension. Pour chaque discriminant fixé, nous calculons le nombre des éléments de EQp qui ont un tel discriminant et nous donnons les discriminants et les groupes de Galois (avec leur fil-trations des groupes de ramification) de leurs clôtures normales. Nous montrons aussi que l’on peut generalizer cette méthode pour obtenir une classification des extensions qui appartiennent a ̀ Ek. Abstract. Let k be a finite extension of Qp and Ek be {{the set of}} the <b>extensions</b> of <b>degree</b> p 2 over k whose normal closure is a p-extension. For a fixed discriminant, we show how many exten-sions there are in EQp with such discriminant and we give the dis-criminant and the Galois group (together with its filtration of the ramification groups) of their normal closure. We show how this method can be generalized to get a {{classification of}} the extensions in Ek. 1. Notation, preliminaries and results. Throughout this paper, p is an odd prime and k will be a fixed p-adic field of degree d over Qp which does not contain any primitive p-th root of unity. If E is a p-adic field and L|E is a finite extension, then we say that L|E is a p-extension if it is Galois and its degree is a power of p. The aim of the present paper is to give a classification of the <b>extensions</b> of <b>degree</b> p 2 over Qp whose normal closure is a p-extension. This classification is based on the discriminant of the extension and on the Galois group and the discriminant of its normal closure. Let Ek be {{the set of the}} <b>extensions</b> of <b>degree</b> p 2 over k whose normal closure is a p-extension. Then for every L ∈ Ek, there exists a cyclic <b>extension</b> K|k of <b>degree</b> p, K ⊆ L and L|K is cyclic (of degree p). Furthermore, the converse is true: if K|k is a cyclic <b>extension</b> of <b>degree</b> p, then every cyclic <b>extension</b> L of <b>degree</b> p over K is an <b>extension</b> of <b>degree</b> p 2 over k whose normal closure is a p-extension (see Prop. 2. 1). Therefore, if K|k is a cyclic <b>extension</b> of <b>degree</b> p, we can ha l-...|$|R

In Section 2, we recall previous index calculus algorithms for ECDLP, in particular FPPR method attack on binary elliptic curves and previous work exploiting the symmetry of Semaev’s polynomials when the <b>extension</b> <b>degree</b> is composite. In Section 3, we describe our variant of FPPR method taking advantage of the symmetries even when the <b>extension</b> <b>degree</b> is prime. In Section 4, we provide experimental results supporting our method with respect to FPPR original attack. Finally in Section 5, we conclude the paper and we introduce further work.|$|E
