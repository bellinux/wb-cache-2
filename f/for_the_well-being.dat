5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} {{predator}}y fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of Jemima and her kin but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values {{are at the top}} of the tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours to the business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E

5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of}} life rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Arkwright had a {{reputation}} as a paternalistic employer who was concerned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of his employees and their families. A Sunday School was built at Cromford in 1785 and provided education to 200children. By 1789, the Cromford Estate was back in the ownership of the Arkwrights, who actively influenced its structure and construction. Cromford was given a market place to act as a new focus for the village. Arkwright organised a market every Sunday and as incentive to attend, gave annual prizes to those who attended most often. After Arkwright died in 1792 his son, Richard Arkwright junior, took over and sold most of his cotton mills outside Cromford and Matlock Bath. The mills in Cromford and Matlock Bath were probably retained to support the Willersley Estate. Societies and clubs were created in Cromford. The religious affairs of the community were of less interest to Arkwright, and it was not until 1797 that Arkwright junior established Cromford Church; his father had envisaged it as a private chapel for the Arkwright family at Willersley Castle. The family's attempts to make Cromford self-sustaining through establishing a market was successful, and the village expanded until about 1840. This was even though the mills had passed their zenith and begun to enter decline in this period.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of Autonomy {{is the ability}} of an individual to make a rational, un-influenced decision. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} autonomy is a general indicator of health. The progression of many terminal diseases are characterized by loss of autonomy, in various manners. For example, dementia almost always results in the loss of autonomy. Dementia is a chronic and progressive disease that attacks the brain and affects the ability to make judgments, can induce memory loss, cause a decrease in rational thinking and affect orientation. This makes autonomy an indicator for both personal well-being, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the profession.|$|E
25|$|Road-vehicle crashes that do {{not involve}} fire show how {{confusion}} could arise. The Fire Service Act 1975 grants authority to the New Zealand Fire Service for fires, {{as well as all}} other emergencies where it feels it can render assistance. The Police, however, have a common-law duty to protect life and property, as well as statutory enforcement authority of transport legislation. Likewise, the local ambulance service may feel it has primary responsibility, because it is responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of anyone injured by the incident. With each agency thinking that it is in charge, effective co-ordination may become difficult.|$|E

25|$|Teej is a {{significant}} festival for Hindu women, particularly in northern and western states of India. Parvati is the primary deity of the festival, and it ritually celebrates married life and family ties. It also celebrates the monsoon. The festival is marked with swings hung from trees, girls playing on these swings typically in green dress (seasonal color of crop planting season), while singing regional songs. Historically, unmarried maidens prayed to Parvati for a good mate, while married women prayed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of their husbands and visited their relatives. In Nepal, Teej is a three-day festival marked with visits to Shiva-Parvati temples and offerings to linga. Teej is celebrated as Teeyan in Punjab.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary group}} {{responsible}} for storm spotting in the U.S. {{is known as}} Skywarn. Many individuals hold Skywarn certification and/or amateur radio licenses.

A Skywarn group is {{either directly or indirectly}} affiliated or associated with the local weather office, and in many cases other agencies responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of individuals. Today, amateur radio still plays a key role, as most spotters opt to attain their radio licenses; however, cell phones are an ever increasingly popular means to directly relay information, along with other on-line spotter reporting protocols such as The Spotter Network.|$|E

25|$|People try to {{stay awake}} and eat toshikoshisoba, noodles to be eaten at midnight. People also visit Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Traditionally three are visited. This is called sansha-mairi. In the Imperial Palace at dawn on the 1st, the Emperor {{performs}} the rite of shihōhai (worship of the four-quarters), in which he offers prayers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of the nation. On January 2 the public is allowed to enter the inner palace grounds; the only other day this is possible is the Emperor's birthday (December 23). On the 2nd and 3rd days acquaintances visit one another to extend greetings (nenshi) and sip otoso (a spiced rice wine). Some games played at New Year's are karuta (a card game), hanetsuki (similar to badminton), tako age (kiteflying), and komamawashi (spinning tops). These games are played to bring more luck for the year. Exchanging New Year's greeting cards (similar to Christmas Cards) is another important Japanese custom. Also special allowances are given to children, which are called otoshidama. They also decorate their entrances with kagami mochi (two mochi rice balls placed {{one on top of}} the other, with a tangerine on top), and kadomatsu (pine tree decorations).|$|E
25|$|Throughout the years, Enríquez {{remained}} mostly {{focused in}} his role as a merchant, exploiting this distinction to move legal and smuggled products with success. He could easily use his privateering ships to launder goods that were otherwise illegal, investing the saving in land and properties. On occasion, he even received permission to openly import illegal merchandise. He used these exceptions to compensate for materials that were lacking in Puerto Rico. His enemies tried to expose him, but with little success. In 1718, they testified that Enríquez had smuggled clothes and other items hidden aboard the sloop La Gloria. Led by Pozo, the group launched another defamatory campaign against him. The attorney of San Juan even blamed him for a shortage of food, after he attempted to export 700 units of merchandise citing that the market was oversaturated. Due to this action the food was retained at port and spoiled. As a consequence, Enríquez deduced that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of his business, the best was to move and sell the merchandise as far away as possible. His sloops were sent in long voyages, with the incursions of La Aurora and El Aguila lasting periods of nearly two years and nine months respectively. They operated and moved merchandise between Habana, Santiago and Cartagena. These ships were in fact buying and selling contraband by veiling it as products captured by privateering. Upon returning to San Juan, both of these vessels arrived without any privateering spoils. Despite this, Enríquez gathered so much merchandise that it was unrivaled in Puerto Rico, selling anything that covered basic necessities of the citizens, ranging from food to brushes, razors, leather, locks and clothes. They also offered other commodities, such as playing cards, wines imported from Spain and equipment required for horse riding. Enríquez managed four warehouses, which besides storing merchandise were also used to manufacture anything that his ships needed. He divided them by class, separating the ones where food was stored from the ones where backup equipment was kept.|$|E
40|$|Orientation: A {{literature}} search <b>for</b> studies on <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of support staff {{of higher education}} institutions (HEIs) produced very little results. Appreciation was then used to identify elements that might enhance <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of a selected HEI’s support staff. Research purpose: The aim was to explore the strengths of a selected HEI that might serve as driving forces for enhancing its support staff’s <b>well-being.</b> Motivation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study: The lack of research on <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of support staff motivated the study. A need was identified to explore driving forces that might enhance their well-being. Research design, approach and method: A literature review guided by theoretical perspectives and theories on staff well-being was conducted. Subsequently, a qualitative action research design involving an Appreciative Inquiry (AI) workshop with support staff of an institution was followed. Main findings: The following strengths that might serve as driving forces <b>for</b> enhancing <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of <b>the</b> institution’s support services staff were identified: hard-working and dedicated support staff, positive relations among colleagues, a willingness to adapt to change,good remuneration and benefits, job security and a supportive work environment. Appreciative Inquiry {{was found to be}} well suited for identifying such strengths, as opposed to methods that focus on identifying problems or weaknesses of an organisation. As a result of this study, the relevant institution might react and build on these identified strengths towards promoting <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of its support staff. Practical/managerial implications: Institutions should make an effort to enhance staff well being. The results of the study could also be used to encourage HEIs to use AI to establish optimal staff <b>well-being.</b> Contribution/value add: <b>The</b> study confirmed the power of appreciation to identify the strengths that might serve as driving forces <b>for</b> enhancing <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> of support staff of an HEI. </p...|$|R
