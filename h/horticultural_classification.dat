5|$|Although many Lilium {{species such}} as Lilium martagon and Lilium candidum can be {{obtained}} commercially, the majority of commercially available lilies represent the products of a very diverse hybridisation program, which {{has resulted in a}} separate <b>horticultural</b> <b>classification,</b> including such groupings as Asian, Oriental and Orienpet. In addition to a very wide variety of heights, lilies can be obtained in many colours and combinations of colours, and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn. Because of the history of Liliaceae, many {{species such as}} Watsonia (bugle lily) that were previously classified in this family bear the name 'lily' but are neither part of the genus Lilium, or the Liliaceae family.|$|E

40|$|The wild origin, early {{breeding}} history, {{and diversity}} of the China Rose group, including R. chinensis and its varieties, cultivars, and hybrids, are largely unknown. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the genetic diversity and relationships of the China Roses with related species and hybrids, including information in support of, or refuting, the hypothesis that these roses are the hybrid result of the wild R. chinensis var. spontanea and R. odorata var. gigantea. Ninety Rosa accessions, including China Roses, a Miscellaneous Old Garden Rose, Noisettes, early Polyanthas, Bourbons, Teas, and species from Sections Indicae and Synstylae were surveyed using 23 microsatellite primer pairs. The trnH-psbA chloroplast intergenic spacer was also sequenced for the China Roses, Misc. Old Garden Rose, and the species to look specifically at maternal relationships. A total of 291 alleles were scored for the 23 microsatellites, with alleles per locus ranging from 6 - 22 and averaging 12. 65. A dendrogram based on Dice similarity and a three-dimensional Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoorA) graph were plotted with the data. In the cluster analysis, the similarity coefficients ranged from ~ 0. 15 - 0. 99, with the cultivated roses forming well-defined groups at about 0. 45 similarity. These groups generally reflected the American Rose Society <b>horticultural</b> <b>classifications.</b> A large number of sports and synonyms in the China Rose group were identified through this analysis as well. The PCoorA gave a better graphical representation of the relationships of the species and cultivars, and with the inclusion of the chloroplast sequence haplotypes, some maternal relationships could also be identified. This study shows that the cultivated China Roses are a closely related group and identified which accessions were likely Hybrid China Roses. The results also suggest that the China Roses were maternally derived from R. chinensis var. spontanea. Based on the microsatellites and chloroplast sequence haplotypes, the identity of the R. odorata var. gigantea accessions in this study are suspect, but the China Roses may also have this species in their background as the result of natural or artificial hybridization...|$|R
5000|$|Hardiness {{of plants}} {{describes}} {{their ability to}} survive adverse growing conditions. It is usually limited to discussions of climatic adversity. Thus a plant's ability to tolerate cold, heat, drought, flooding, or wind are typically considered measurements of hardiness. Hardiness of plants is defined by their native extent's geographic location: longitude, latitude and elevation. These attributes are often simplified to a hardiness zone. In temperate latitudes, the term most often describes resistance to cold, or [...] "cold-hardiness", and is generally measured by the lowest temperature a plant can withstand. Hardiness of a plant is usually divided into two categories: tender, and hardy. Some sources also use the erroneous terms [...] "Half-hardy" [...] or [...] "Fully hardy". Tender plants are those killed by freezing temperatures, while hardy plants survive freezing - at least down to certain temperatures, depending on the plant. [...] "Half-hardy" [...] is a term used sometimes in horticulture to describe bedding plants which are sown in heat in winter or early spring, and planted outside after all danger of frost has passed. [...] "Fully hardy" [...] usually refers to plants being classified under the Royal <b>Horticultural</b> Society <b>classifications,</b> and can often cause confusion to those not using this method.|$|R

40|$|Hybridization with {{introduced}} {{genetic resources}} is commonly practiced in ornamental plant breeding to introgress desired traits. The 19 th century was {{a golden age}} for rose breeding in France. The objective here was to study the evolution of rose genetic diversity over this period, which included the introduction of Asian genotypes into Europe. A large sample of 1228 garden roses encompassing the conserved diversity cultivated during the 18 th and 19 th centuries was genotyped with 32 microsatellite primer pairs. Its genetic diversity and structure were clarified. Wide diversity structured in 16 genetic groups was observed. Genetic differentiation was detected between ancient European and Asian accessions, and a temporal shift from a European to an Asian genetic background was observed in cultivated European hybrids during the 19 th century. Frequent crosses with Asian roses throughout the 19 th century and/or selection for Asiatic traits may have induced this shift. In addition, {{the consistency of the}} results with respect to a <b>horticultural</b> <b>classification</b> is discussed. Some horticultural groups, defined according to phenotype and/or knowledge of their pedigree, seem to be genetically more consistent than others, highlighting the difficulty of classifying cultivated plants. Therefore, the <b>horticultural</b> <b>classification</b> is probably more appropriate for commercial purposes rather than genetic relatedness, especially to define preservation and breeding strategies...|$|E
40|$|The inter-simple {{sequence}} repeat (ISSR) {{technique was}} evaluated for its applicability to cultivar identification and assessment of genetic relationships in rose. Nine ISSR primers that revealed informative patterns were selected to fingerprint (by Resophor agarose gel electrophoresis) 33 cultivars, including unrelated cultivars, sports and offspring obtained by sexual propagation from the same initial variety. A total of 159 fragments were generated using these nine primers, 149 of which (93. 7 %) were polymorphic. All 33 rose cultivars, except for the known colour sports, were differentiated. A Jaccard's dissimilarity coefficient matrix of the cultivars showed a low dissimilarity level between them (mean dissimilarity: 0. 45). An unweighted pair group method with the arithmetic averages dendrogram and principal coordinates analysis separated them into four main groups according to their <b>horticultural</b> <b>classification</b> and pedigree. The ISSR technique is therefore a potentially useful tool for cultivar identification and assessing genetic relationships in rose because it is simple, fast, cost-effective, reliable and highly discriminating...|$|E

40|$|The Chinese {{traditional}} chrysanthemum is {{a notable}} group of chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum 6 morifolium Ramat.) {{in which the}} phenotypic characteristics richly vary. At present, {{there is a serious}} controversy regarding homonyms and synonyms within this group. Moreover, the current international chrysanthemum classification systems are not comprehensive enough to be used on Chinese traditional chrysanthemums. Thus, we first identified a broad collection of 480 Chinese traditional chrysanthemum cultivars using the unique DNA fingerprints and molecular identities that were established by 20 simple sequence repeat markers. Five loci, which distinguished all of the selected cultivars, were identified as the core loci to establish unique fingerprints and molecular identities with 19 denary digits for each cultivar. A cluster analysis based on Nei’s genetic distance indicated that the selected cultivars were clustered according to their <b>horticultural</b> <b>classification.</b> Population structure analysis was subsequently performed with K values ranging from 2 to 14, and the most likely estimate for the population structure was ten subpopulations, which was nearly consistent with the clustering result. Principal component analysis was further performed to verify the classification results. On the basis of the Q-matrices of K = 10, a total of 19 traits were found to be associated with 42 markers. Taken together, these results can serve as starting points for the identification and classification of chrysanthemums based on the polymorphism of microsatellite markers, which is beneficial to promote the marker-assisted breeding and international communication of this marvelous crop...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to compare the growth {{dynamics}} of standard and genetically compact varieties of petunias. The experiment was conducted in the close cooperation with company Černý, Jaroměř. Firstly is introduced this plant genus in terms of origin, morphology as well as <b>horticultural</b> <b>classification.</b> Then is described in detail the plant production, included are also petunias' most common diseases and pests. This {{is followed by a}} chapter devoted to petunia breeding aiming for the compact growth as well as to chemical and non-chemical methods which enable the grower to maintain the compact habit of plants also in plant production of standard varieties of petunias. In {{the last part of the}} literature review are described the groups of genetically compact petunia varieties that were launched on the market till now. Finally is provided an economic comparison of genetically compact and standard varieties of petunias. Seeds of genetically compact varieties are more expensive, but the grower saves money for the morphoregulators and their application because it is not required to use. In the practical part are compared 28 varieties of petunias, 10 standard and 18 genetically compact, based on 8 aspects - plant height, diameter (width), earliness, vitality, number of true leaves, number of shoots, number of flowers and compactness. It was tested whether in the optimal date for sale and two weeks after this date are the genetically compact varieties significantly shorter than the standard varieties and whether the quality of these tested varieties is good also two weeks after the optimum, so the grower can still sell these plants to the customers...|$|E
