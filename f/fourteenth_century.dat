5|$|From {{the early}} <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Melbourne Castle was {{mainly in the}} {{possession}} of the Earls and Dukes of Lancaster or the crown. Improvements and repairs were made, notably by John of Gaunt, and the building was in generally good condition throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. John I, Duke of Bourbon, was kept at Melbourne for 19 years after his capture at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and the castle was considered as a possible prison for Mary, Queen of Scots, although events led to her incarceration elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|From the {{formation}} of the Kingdom of Alba in the tenth century, to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349, estimates based on the amount of farmable land suggest that the population may have grown from half a million to a million. Growth was probably punctuated by occasional crises, like the famines recorded in chronicles for 1154 and 1256. More significant was a series of poor harvests that affected Scotland and most of Europe in the early <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century</b> and widespread famines in 1315–16 and in the later 1330s.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century,</b> celadon was {{a prized}} import in East Africa, which was {{initially}} {{obtained from the}} Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by {{a large number of}} black on yellow Islamic wares and celadon. Also during the <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century,</b> local wares began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During {{the beginning and end of}} the fifteenth century, respectively, blue and white porcelain began to gradually replace celadon and monochrome Islamic wares completely replaced black on yellow types. During the same century, local wares began to change with the reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and a shift to long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants. In the following century, blue and white porcelain and monochrome Islamic wares became the dominant imports; a trend that began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Somerton {{dates back to}} the Anglo-Saxon era, when it was an {{important}} political and commercial centre. After the Norman conquest of England the importance of the town declined, despite being the county town of Somerset in the late thirteenth century and early <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Having lost county town status, Somerton then became a market town in the Middle Ages, whose economy was supported by transport systems using the River Parrett, and later rail transport via the Great Western Railway, and by light industries including glove making and gypsum mining.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} known to have been used for {{shipping}} in Roman times, when it was navigable to Bodiam and possibly further upstream. There are records of small boats reaching Etchingham during Saxon and Norman periods. Stone for building Bodiam Castle was transported along the river in the <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century,</b> and iron was shipped from Newenden or Udiam in the sixteenth century. A century later, an iron store was erected at Udiam. Maytham Wharf served Rolvenden, while Tenterden was served by Small Hythe.|$|E
5|$|Tradition {{has it that}} Dafydd ap Gwilym, one of the {{greatest}} of Welsh poets, was born at Brogynin, Penrhyncoch (at the time in Llanbadarn Fawr parish, and now part of the grouped benefice), early in the <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century,</b> when the parish covered the whole of northern Ceredigion. Dafydd records a number of local place-names in his poetry. He is also known for his connection with Strata Florida, thanks to the story that he was buried there, and to the copying of his poetry into Strata Florida manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|Blois died on 10 May 1206, and {{was buried}} in Lincoln Cathedral. In the early <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century,</b> he was still remembered well by the cathedral chapter and was {{described}} as learned and kindly by the 14th century writer John Schalby, who wrote a work {{on the lives of}} the bishops of Lincoln. Besides his kinsman William de Blois, another known relative was a nephew, William de Marum. Marum succeeded his uncle as rector in Durham. He was once identified with another William of Blois, who was a poet and the brother of Peter of Blois, but there is no evidence supports that identification.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which {{from the end of}} the <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century</b> regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. The degrees of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are the degrees offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} <b>fourteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Lihou {{may have become}} the origin of a local legend about a wealthy Bailiff of Guernsey who {{attempted}} to have an innocent peasant executed on false charges of theft of silver cups. In either 1302 or 1304, a priory servant called Thomas le Roer was alleged to have murdered one of the monks. The Bailiff and several assistants attempted to apprehend Le Roer {{but he did not}} surrender and was subsequently killed by Ranulph Gautier, one of the Bailiff's assistants. Gautier tried to find sanctuary in a nearby church and eventually fled to England, before returning to Guernsey when the king pardoned him. However, some years later Gautier was tortured to death in Castle Cornet, but it is not known why.|$|E
