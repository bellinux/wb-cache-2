5|$|The rollout of Amfleets {{throughout}} {{the system was}} restricted by the availability of locomotives with HEP or special generator cars. The first route outside the Northeast Corridor to receive Amfleets was the Washington–Martinsburg Blue Ridge, on December 1. By November 1976, 350 Amfleets had been delivered and 78% of Amtrak's short-haul trains used either Amfleets or equally-modern Turboliner trainsets. Routes using Amfleets outside the Northeast Corridor included the Blue Ridge, Colonial, Twilight Limited, Wolverine, Illinois Zephyr, Abraham Lincoln, State House, Illini, Shawnee, Black Hawk, San Joaquin, Mount Rainier, Pacific International, Puget Sound, and San Diegan. The Amfleet's modern HEP system proved invaluable during the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the short-distance Amfleet I coaches into long-distance service. Budd completed delivery of the Amfleet <b>I</b> <b>order</b> on June 9, 1977.|$|E
25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and <b>I</b> <b>order</b> what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E

By the morning of 25 April, out of ammunition and with nothing but bayonets to meet the attackers on the slopes leading up from the beach to the heights of Chunuk Bair, the 57th Infantry Regiment received orders from Kemal [...] "I do not order you to fight, <b>I</b> <b>order</b> you to die.

2500|$|The {{life history}} of Macrosoma heliconiaria was {{originally}} described from plants of Byttneria aculeata in Mexico. This was a historical breakthrough into {{the biology of}} hedylids. In this study, Kendall commented notably [...] "I thought the larvae might represent a satyr species, but when the first larva pupated I {{was sure it was}} a pierid. The first adult emerged as a complete surprise. The pupa...is secured by girdle and cremaster, not unlike a pierid". Macrosoma cascaria was later also reared on this plant in Panama. More life histories are now known. From these data, known host plants span a wide range of (according to the APG II system) rosid dicotyledonous plants, including the rosid order Myrtales family Melastomataceae (genera Miconia, Conostegia, and Ossaea), the eurosid <b>I</b> <b>order</b> Malpighiales, families Euphorbiaceae (Croton), and Malpighiaceae (Byrsonima), the eurosid II orders Sapindales, family Rutaceae (Zanthoxylum) and more commonly Malvales, family Malvaceae, tribes: Bombacoideae (Ochroma), Malvoideae (Hampea and also Hibiscus, Byttnerioideae (Byttneria aculeata, Theobroma) and Grewioideae (Luehea). The [...] "green lizard caterpillar" [...] Macrosoma tipulata attacks an economically important local fruit tree [...] "Cupuaçu" [...] (Theobroma grandiflorum) in Brazil and can defoliate saplings; the biology of this species has been studied and illustrated in some detail. The larva of this species lives about 15 days in 5 instars, the pupal stage lasts about 7 days and the adult lives about 10 days. M. tipulata and many other species can be found as adults through most of the year.|$|E
2500|$|In June of that year, Romania {{joined the}} attack on the Soviet Union, led by Germany in {{coalition}} with Hungary, Finland, the State of Slovakia, the Kingdom of Italy and the Independent State of Croatia. Antonescu had been made aware of the plan by German envoys, and supported it enthusiastically even before Hitler extended Romania an offer to participate. On 18 June 1941, Antonescu gave orders to his generals about [...] "cleansing the ground" [...] of Jews when Romanian forces entered Bessarabia and Bukovina. Right from the start, Antonescu proclaimed the war against the Soviet Union to be a [...] "holy war", a [...] "crusade" [...] in the name of Eastern Orthodox faith and the Romanian race against the forces of [...] "Judo-Bolshevism". The propaganda of the Antonescu regime demonized everything Jewish as Antonescu believed that Communism was invented by the Jews, and all of the Soviet leaders were really Jews. Reflecting Antonescu's anti-Slavic feelings, {{despite the fact that the}} war was billed as a [...] "crusade" [...] in defense of Orthodoxy against [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism", the war was not presented as a struggle to liberate the Orthodox Russians and Ukrainians from Communism; instead rule by [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism" [...] was portrayed as something brought about the innate moral inferiority of the Slavs, who thus needed to be ruled by the Germans and the Romanians. The Romanian force engaged formed a General Antonescu Army Group under the effective command of German general Eugen Ritter von Schobert. Romania's campaign on the Eastern Front began without a formal declaration of war, and was consecrated by Antonescu's statement: [...] "Soldiers, <b>I</b> <b>order</b> you, cross the Prut River" [...] (in reference to the Bessarabian border between Romania and post-1940 Soviet territory). A few days after this, a large-scale pogrom was carried out in Iași with Antonescu's agreement; thousands of Jews were killed in the bloody Iași pogrom. Antonescu had followed a generation of younger right-wing Romanian intellectuals led by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu who in the 1920s-30s had rejected the traditional Francophila of the Romanian elites and their adherence to Western notions of universal democratic values and human rights. Antonescu made it clear that his regime rejected the moral principles of the [...] "demo-liberal world" [...] and he saw the war as an ideological struggle between his spiritually pure [...] "national-totalitarian regime" [...] vs. [...] "Jewish morality". Antonescu believed that the liberal humanist-democratic-capitalist values of the West and Communism were both invented by the Jews to destroy Romania. In a lengthy speech just before the war, Antonescu attacked democracy in the most violent terms as it allowed Jews equal rights and thus to undercut the Romanian [...] "national idea". As such, Antonescu stated what was needed was a [...] "new man" [...] who would be [...] "tough", [...] "virile" [...] and willing to fight for an ethnically and religiously [...] "pure" [...] Romania. Despite his quarrel with Sima, much of Antonescu's speech clearly reflected the influence of the ideas of the Iron Guard that Antonescu had absorbed in the 1930s. Antonescu's anti-Semitism and sexism went so far that he tacitly condoned the rape of Jewish women and girls in Bessarabia and northern Bukovinia by his forces under the grounds that he was going take away all of the property that the Jews had [...] "stolen" [...] from the Romanians, and as far he was concerned, Jewish females were just another piece of property. Since the Jewish women were going to exterminated anyway, Antonescu felt there was nothing wrong about letting his soldiers and gendarmes have [...] "some fun" [...] before shooting them.|$|E
