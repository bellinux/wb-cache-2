5|$|Breaking with tradition, the Fighting Irish {{announced}} in June {{that they would}} be wearing their alternative green jerseys instead of blue against USC; Weis noted that it was in honor of the 1977Irish team that switched to green jerseys before defeating the Trojans en route to a national championship (Weis was a student at Notre Dame at the time). Previously, the Irish did not let the public <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> would be wearing their green jerseys.|$|E
25|$|We {{had many}} of these half-orcs to deal with at Helm’s Deep. It seems plain now that that Southerner was a spy of Saruman’s; but whether {{he was working with}} the Black Riders, or for Saruman alone, I do not know. It is {{difficult}} with these evil folk to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are in league, and when they are cheating one another.|$|E
25|$|Further to {{what has}} been {{mentioned}} it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will come a time when a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing method used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E

That his sense perceptions were transmitted to his brain and there translated, classified, and labeled was something quite beyond him.

25|$|The Rawk {{is a large}} boulder {{donated by}} members of Alpha Phi Omega in 1973 and painted nearly every day by {{students}}, who {{use it as a}} giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.|$|E
25|$|By 18:42 on 27 August {{there had}} been two {{earthquakes}} in the caldera above M5 and about 1300 events {{in the range of}} M2-3 around the tip of the dyke which had propagated a further 1km to the north and now extended some 13km past the edge of the glacier. Approximately another 20million cubic metres of magma had entered the dyke over the previous 24 hours. The intrusion of the dyke was now causing stress changes over a large area {{to the north of the}} dyke's extent. A M4.5 event was recorded just east of the Askja caldera, which had been showing signs of increased geothermal activity since April 2012. At 20:50, scientists on a surveillance flight reported a 4–6km line of 10–15m deep cauldrons to the south of the Bárðarbunga caldera, which were possibly a result of melting or a sub glacial eruption, although they didn't <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had formed. No heightened tremor level was observed.|$|E
500|$|After {{the final}} whistle Gillingham's {{temporary}} captain Adrian Pennock received the winners' trophy jointly with the team's usual captain, Paul Smith, {{who had come}} on as a substitute. [...] Peter Taylor commented that [...] "These players, especially {{the ones that were}} here last year, deserved it. [...] All season they've shown unbelievable character, and that's what they have done today. They never <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are beaten." [...] John Benson, commenting particularly on the goal which Wigan felt they were denied, said that [...] "You feel cheated, but decisions like {{that are part of the}} game".|$|E

500|$|Shira Chess {{describes}} the Slender Man {{as a metaphor}} for [...] "helplessness, power differentials, and anonymous forces." [...] Peck sees parallels between the Slender Man and common anxieties about the digital age, such as feelings of constant connectedness and unknown third-party observation. Similarly, Tye Van Horn, a writer for The Elm, has suggested that the Slender Man represents modern fear of the unknown; in an age flooded with information, people have become so unaccustomed to ignorance that they now fear what they cannot understand. Troy Wagner, the creator of Marble Hornets, ascribes the terror of the Slender Man to its malleability; people can shape it into whatever frightens them most. Tina Marie Boyer noted that [...] "The Slender man is a prohibitive monster, but the cultural boundaries he guards are not clear. Victims do not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have violated or crossed them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} using an in-house multi-platform proprietary engine called ASKA (tri-Ace Superlative Knowledge-based Architecture), {{developed by a}} team led by Gotanda. The engine was in development since 2005 and was used for three different games in tandem: Resonance of Fate, Infinite Undiscovery and [...] While the staff were satisfied with its performance, it had to be customized for this game's specific needs. The engine employs multiple advanced graphics and lighting techniques, including high-dynamic-range rendering, and multiple layered shader tools to manage graphical layers and shadow effects. Motion blur effects were implemented using techniques {{similar to those of the}} second-generation CryEngine. Creating realistic blurring during camera movement was complicated by graphical inconsistencies generated by ASKA's structure. A separate graphics buffer system was designed to address the issue. Environments and characters employ a relatively low number of polygons in order to free up resources to render the main cast, whose character models use at least four times as many polygons as models in the PlayStation 2 era. The main characters' faces use 40 bones for facial movement and their hair use 250. This enables more detailed facial expressions compared to the [...] "doll"-like facial movements of earlier video game characters. Character hair uses additional shaders and layered textures to give it a lifelike appearance and behavior. The physics simulation was similar to that used for , but improved and expanded to suit the new hardware's capacity. There were minor differences between the graphical effects and performances of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 titles. Shadow and blurring effects were more sophisticated on 360. The estimated frame rate of 30fps was identical across both versions. The team managed to fit all the game's content onto a single disc for both versions while keeping load times short. This was due to the staff not wanting players to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had reached the halfway point, prolonging the sense of adventure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, Kournikova and Fedorov {{were married}} in Moscow. Fedorov claimed he and Kournikova {{were married in}} 2001, and divorced in 2003.

2500|$|On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver in another room of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, [...] "There you are — electronic television!" [...] The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a motor-generator; so the television system now had no mechanical parts. [...] That year Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images using his television system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Pem.|$|E
