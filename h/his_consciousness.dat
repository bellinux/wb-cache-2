Olivia requests to enter the tank regardless, and she makes a last encounter with Scott, where he tells her he loved her and was going to marry her. She bids farewell to <b>his</b> <b>consciousness,</b> which has finally left her own.|$|E

50|$|Unlike time flashes, {{during a}} {{temporal}} displacement, time is actually being changed. For example, {{the events of}} Desmond's displacement are {{different from that of}} the original events before he got to the Island. During the displacement, the person can either have their consciousness from the past in both times, or the present in both times (Desmond's experienced <b>his</b> 1996 <b>consciousness,</b> while Minkowski experienced <b>his</b> present <b>consciousness).</b>|$|R
60|$|Michael {{looked up}} with pricked ears, and with {{eyes filled with}} query as all <b>his</b> {{intelligent}} <b>consciousness</b> suffused them.|$|R
5|$|Akane {{explains}} that Sigma, after his abduction in 2028, had <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> transported into his elder self's body in 2074, while his elder self's consciousness was transported into the younger Sigma's body in 2028. The {{goal of the}} AB project was to enable the elder Sigma to prevent the Radical-6 outbreak in 2028 with his future knowledge; Dio sought to stop the project. Akane makes Phi and Sigma's consciousnesses jump to 2029, after the outbreak. Sigma, as Zero Sr., spends the next 45 years developing the AB project together with Akane, while Phi is kept in cold sleep. Sigma creates Kyle as a spare, in case his own body gets damaged. When they again arrive at 2074, Sigma and Phi jump back to 2028 to infiltrate the Mars mission test site.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{the mysterious}} {{character}} River Song (Alex Kingston) summons alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to Roman Britain in 102 AD, where underneath Stonehenge lies a fabled prison called the Pandorica that legend tells holds the most fearsome {{being in the}} whole universe. However, it is discovered that the Doctor has been put in a trap by an alliance of his greatest enemies to save the universe from cracks in time that were caused by the Doctor's space-time vessel the TARDIS. Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence {{from one of the}} cracks in the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with <b>his</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E
60|$|He paused anxiously, for in his then {{confused}} {{state of}} mind he doubted how much of <b>his</b> late <b>consciousness</b> had been real or visionary.|$|R
50|$|Gaon also {{focuses on}} those {{who live on the}} urban periphery, the street people, immigrants, and prostitutes. His {{paintings}} go beyond the immediate perception of these subjects, to uncover the inherent contradictions both in his subjects psyche and social position, and in <b>his</b> own <b>consciousness.</b> <b>His</b> subjects display a noble and prophetic character, as if spiritually from a bygone era yet awkwardly entrenched in a harsh contemporary reality.|$|R
5000|$|A robot {{created by}} Crouch under Bedlam's orders who {{suffered}} a failure that brought him <b>his</b> own <b>consciousness.</b> After that, he becomes a friend for Ed and the Dojo.|$|R
5|$|Vincent and the WRO {{launch a}} {{full-scale}} assault on Deepground's headquarters in Midgar. While Reeve's team battles the Deepground soldiers {{and attempt to}} destroy the Mako reactors which serve {{as a means to}} revive Omega, Vincent heads to Deepground's centre of operations to confront Weiss. He is surprised to find Weiss slumped in his chair, dead. However, as Omega begins to manifest itself, Weiss seems to revive, and confronts Vincent. It is revealed that Weiss is possessed by Hojo; before Hojo was killed in the Mako Cannon three years earlier, he uploaded <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> into the Worldwide Network, then took possession of Weiss's body while he was online attempting to find a cure for the virus with which the Restrictors had infected him. Hojo/Weiss and Vincent battle to a standstill. However Nero, who had been defeated earlier by Vincent, emerges from the Lifestream and destroys Hojo. Nero then merges with Weiss in order to help him fuse with Omega, just as Vincent is fused with Chaos.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom Come {{universe}} {{features a}} version of Nabu {{who is able to}} channel <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> through the helmet and cloak without the need for a host body. This version of Fate sides with Batman's group and is amongst the survivors {{at the end of the}} final battle.|$|E
25|$|Bede's {{account of}} Chad's death {{strongly}} confirms the main themes of his life. Primarily {{he was a}} monastic leader, {{deeply involved in the}} fairly small communities of loyal monks who formed his mission teams, his brothers. <b>His</b> <b>consciousness</b> was strongly eschatological: focussed on the last things and their significance. Finally, he was inextricably linked with Cedd and his other actual brothers.|$|E
50|$|Upon <b>his</b> regaining <b>consciousness,</b> Broudy's doctors {{determined}} {{that he had}} suffered permanent brain damage and was left legally blind. Part of his skull was replaced with a metal plate.|$|R
40|$|Over {{several years}} now, notable {{research}} has been undertaken on consciousness from various disciplines in the natural sciences, especially in neuroscience and Christian theology. This paper will therefore attempt {{to add to the}} current literature in these areas by addressing briefly the following three main aspects, namely, (1) Presenting a succinct explanation of the various views of consciousness by select scholars. (2) Exploring briefly the question, ‘Is the emergence of consciousness a product of an evolved brain?’ (3) Concisely examining the question, <b>‘Is</b> <b>consciousness</b> of God and spiritual experiences a divine act and/or a process of an evolved brain?...|$|R
5000|$|The aphoristic style {{implies that}} the text can be {{interpreted}} with multiple meanings, is full of metaphors and allegories, and its sutras implicitly refer to Hindu scriptures. [...] "The sky is his belief" [...] in its third sutra for example, states Patrick Olivelle, {{is a metaphor for}} consciousness, spanning everything visible yet indivisible; it also means that the sannyasi is not enslaved to any specific doctrine but instead follows <b>his</b> own <b>consciousness,</b> <b>his</b> own conception of the absolute.|$|R
25|$|The alien Ovoids {{inadvertently}} taught Doctor Doom {{the process}} of psionically transferring <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> into another nearby being through simple eye contact, as well as showing him other forms of technology which Doctor Doom uses to escape from incarcerations and to avoid being killed. However, if his concentration is broken, his mind can transfer back, and he rarely uses this power unless absolutely necessary due to his own ego about his appearance.|$|E
25|$|The Ajahn Thate became widely {{renowned for}} his humility and the {{development}} of <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> through Buddhist meditation not just through all sections of society in Thailand but internationally, particularly as a result of international speaking and meditation practise tours to Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. In addition to his large following of disciples in Thailand, Ajaan Thate trained many western disciples in meditation. He wrote a profound short book on the practise of meditation.|$|E
25|$|Techno's {{impersonation}} of Ogre {{ended when}} Scourge of the Underworld stowed away inside him, shrunken, and destroyed his {{body from the}} inside, while he refused to kill Jolt again {{to allow him to}} construct a new body. However, his backup plan worked, and <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> was returned to his original human body—mostly healed, although the nerve damage in his neck meant he required his tech-pac to bypass the damage—and the human Ebersol, initially amnesiac of the robot's exploits, returned to calling himself the Fixer.|$|E
50|$|Philippe Tailliez is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} fathers of modern deep-sea diving. He inspired Cousteau to <b>his</b> environmental <b>consciousness.</b> He was given many awards in France and abroad, for his multiple contributions.|$|R

25|$|In {{the film}} sequel, , Setsuna and Celestial Being fight the ELS, an alien lifeform {{that has been}} attacking mankind. Setsuna falls into {{catatonia}} after attempting to share <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> which, by the burst of information he took, damaged his braincells but manages to recover upon seeing his lost allies in a dream. Piloting the GNT-0000 00 Qan, Setsuna makes contact with ELS, agrees to become humanity's liaison and uses the 00 Qan and quantize to the ELS homeworld. Several years later, Setsuna, having become a part ELS, reunites with Marina.|$|E
25|$|In the future, Apocalypse has {{conquered the}} Earth and ruled until the 39th century. By this time, Apocalypse's body had grown feeble: he {{becomes aware of}} the young Nathan's {{presence}} in this time, but only succeeds in kidnapping a clone of the child which Askani created. Apocalypse plans to transfer <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> and power into the clone's stronger body, but perishes in combat with the (real) teenage Nathan. Nathan grows up to become the warrior Cable (while his clone grows up to become the mutant terrorist known as Stryfe) and travels back to the past to prevent Apocalypse's future domination of the planet.|$|E
25|$|During John Byrne's {{run in the}} 1980s, Doom {{attempted}} to steal the cosmic powers of Terrax, but Doom's body was destroyed in the resulting fight between Terrax and the Silver Surfer. Doom survived by transferring <b>his</b> <b>consciousness</b> to another human, and is returned to his original body by the Beyonder (who had reached into the relative future to 'recruit' Doom for the conflict on Battleworld that the FF had participated {{in a few months}} ago from their perspective). While on Battleworld, Doom attempted and briefly succeeded in stealing the Beyonder's power, but it proves too vast for him to control and the disembodied Beyonder is able to take his power back.|$|E
50|$|His {{ultimate}} goal is to reveal the reasoning structure of <b>his</b> own <b>consciousness,</b> and <b>his</b> implicit associations and assumptions. In this process he borrows ideas from psychoanalysis, the writing of Jacques Derrida, and Artificial Intelligence (which he studied).|$|R
6000|$|... "I should decidedly say so," [...] replied Mr. Ward. [...] "He has {{recognised}} Mr. Ernescliffe, and {{any change}} might excite him, and {{lead him to}} ask questions. The moment of <b>his</b> full <b>consciousness</b> is especially to be dreaded." ...|$|R
50|$|The novel's {{chapters}} alternatively follows both writers. The chapters following Colleen are partially {{set before}} Panossian's murder while his chapters are told after his death, as <b>his</b> disembodied <b>consciousness</b> drifts around the convention following participants {{and thinking about}} his past.|$|R
25|$|Gradually {{over the}} next 3,500 years, Leto not only survives, but also is {{transformed}} into a hybrid of human and giant sandworm. By the time of God Emperor of Dune, he has exterminated all other sandworms, and his own transformation has modified his component sandtrout. When Leto allows himself to be assassinated, the sandtrout release themselves to begin the sandworm lifecycle anew; subsequent offspring are tougher and more adaptable than their predecessors, allowing them to ultimately be more easily settled on other worlds, thus ensuring the survival of the sandworm species. Each one, according to Leto, carries in it a tiny pearl of <b>his</b> <b>consciousness,</b> trapped forever in an unending prescient dream.|$|E
25|$|Olivia is a 29-year-old FBI Special Agent {{assigned}} to a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, after her partner and lover, John Scott, is exposed to a flesh-dissolving agent. Both Agent Broyles and Nina Sharp consider her to have much potential and talent, the latter even hoping to bring her on as an employee of Massive Dynamic. An experiment by Dr. Bishop to link her to the dying John Scott's mind {{in order to learn}} what he knew about his condition results in Olivia gaining part of <b>his</b> <b>consciousness,</b> causing her mind to begin integrating and purging the foreign consciousness. This results in Olivia mistaking John Scott's memories for her own. With help from Walter, Olivia finds a way to communicate with John within her own mind, eventually allowing the memories to fade completely.|$|E
25|$|Zaken, in {{the second}} tank, tried to reach his company commanders on the radio, but got no reply. He called the crewmen and told and learned {{that many of the}} commanders were either dead or wounded. He told them to keep moving {{to get out of the}} ambush and fire all weapons. The {{battalion}} made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost <b>his</b> <b>consciousness,</b> recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank and talk to the crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors and told them to switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could speak directly to Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his head out of the turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.|$|E
50|$|Spiritual ecstasy from {{childhood}} was thought {{by the family}} and neighbor to be epileptic seizures. Having engrossed in meditating the 'holy name' given by his mother, Anukulchandra used to lose <b>his</b> outward <b>consciousness</b> on regular basis from the early childhood.|$|R
60|$|After {{the first}} rally the innkeeper began to fail slowly. It was seldom that he {{understood}} what was said to him, and pitiful to the beholder to see in <b>his</b> intervals of <b>consciousness</b> <b>his</b> timid anxiety to earn the good- will of the all-powerful Gunn. His strength declined until assistance was needed to turn him in the bed, and his great sinewy hands were forever trembling and fidgeting on the coverlet.|$|R
60|$|It was weird, strangely weird. I {{looked at}} Maud Brewster {{and knew that}} she was {{similarly}} affected. Then I looked at Wolf Larsen, but there was nothing subjective about <b>his</b> state of <b>consciousness.</b> <b>His</b> whole concern was with the immediate, objective present. He still held the wheel, and I felt that he was timing Time, reckoning the passage of the minutes with each forward lunge and leeward roll of the Ghost.|$|R
