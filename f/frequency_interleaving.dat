It can be further divided into fine-grained multithreading or coarse-grained multithreading depending on the <b>frequency</b> of <b>interleaved</b> issues. Fine-grained multithreading—such as in a barrel processor—issues instructions for different threads after every cycle, while coarse-grained multithreading only switches to issue instructions from another thread when the current executing thread causes some long latency events (like page fault etc.). Coarse-grain multithreading is more common for less context switch between threads. For example, Intel's Montecito processor uses coarse-grained multithreading, while Sun's UltraSPARC T1 uses fine-grained multithreading. For those processors that have only one pipeline per core, interleaved multithreading is the only possible way, because it can issue at most one instruction per cycle.|$|R
