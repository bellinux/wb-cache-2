MethodsA total of 23 thalassemia intermedia patients (13 male and 10 female) aged between 5 and 26 years were treated {{for five months}} with 15 mg/(kg·day) of hydroxyurea. <b>Hemoglobins</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and globin chain electrophoresis was performed on each sample at different time points {{before and during the}} treatment.

Both Gγ and Aγ-globin chains increased significantly and α-globin:Nonα-globin chain as well as Gγ-globin:Aγ globin chains ratios decreased. ConclusionsImprovement in α:non-α ratio and consequent decrease of free α-globin chain might be the cause of beneficial effects of hydroxyurea therapy. Two patients who felt better didn't show significant increase in their fetal hemoglobin level, and this is in contradiction with the hypothesis claiming that the HbF level increase is the cause of such therapeutic effect.

In manual examination, activity of the bone marrow can also be gauged qualitatively by subtle changes in the numbers and the morphology of young RBCs by examination under a microscope. Newly formed RBCs are usually slightly larger than older RBCs and show polychromasia. Even where the source of blood loss is obvious, evaluation of erythropoiesis can help assess whether the bone marrow will be able to compensate for the loss, and at what rate.When the cause is not obvious, clinicians use other tests, such as: ESR, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, RBC folate level, serum vitamin B12, <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>electrophoresis,</b> renal function tests (e.g. serum creatinine) although the tests will depend on the clinical hypothesis that is being investigated.When the diagnosis remains difficult, a bone marrow examination allows direct examination of the precursors to red cells, although is rarely used as is painful, invasive and is hence reserved for cases where severe pathology needs to be determined or excluded.|$|E

40|$|Dacie's heat {{denaturation}} test was modified {{in order to}} get a practical procedure for detecting unstable hemoglobin in hemolysates. For the purpose of screening a centrifugation method was devised : hemolysate, phosphate buffer solution (0. 1 M, pH 7. 4), and zinc chloride solution were mixed in equal proportions (0. 2 ml each) in a test tube and transferred to a capillary tube (0. 3 × 12 cm). The capillary tube was sealed at one end by fusion in a flame of a burner so that the mixture might be contained safely in it, warmed at 50 ℃ for 60 minutes, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm (1700 G) for 5 minutes to read the amount of precipitate sedimented at the bottom in terms of the percentage of the total co 1 umn of the mixture. A reading larger than 3. 5 per cent is suggesive of the presence of unstable hemoglobin in hemolysate. Such a hemolysate should be examined by spectrophotometric method to connrm the result. Namely, hemolysate (30 μl) was mixed with warm (55 ℃) phosphate buffer solution (0. 1 M, pH 7. 4; 3 ml) and introduced in a cuvette. The absorbance (at 700 mμ) of the mixture was measured continuously in a self-recording spectrophotometer with constant temperature cuvette holder (55 ℃) for 20 minutes. Hemolysates containing unstable hemoglobin show at least an increment of absorbance two times as large as that obtained with normal hemolysates (usually the normal hemolysates gave an increase in absorbance less than 0. 300 at the end of 20 minutes). Abnormal hemoglobins seen in Ube during the period from 1968 to 1969 were examined by these tests, and an unstable hemoglobin (Hb Mie) which was unseparable from normal <b>hemoglobin</b> by <b>electrophoresis</b> was discovered. A short record of the clinical manifestation and laboratory examination of the hemolytic anemia associated with this unstable hemoglobin was presented as an example of the applcation of these methods to hemoglobin survey...|$|R

The hematological reference values are very important for diagnostic orientation and treatment decision. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish hematological reference values for healthy adults in Togo. A total of 2571 voluntary blood donors participated to this study. Only 1349 subjects negative for HIV, HBV, HCV, malaria, and without <b>hemoglobin</b> abnormalities in <b>electrophoresis</b> and hypochromia on blood smear, were definitively retained for the study. Median hemoglobin level was higher in males than females (15. 1 g/dL versus 13. 0 g/dL, p = 0. 000). Median total WBC (4. 2 × 10 9 /L) and absolute neutrophil counts (1. 6 × 10 9 /L) were similar by gender. The median lymphocyte counts in males and females were, respectively, 2. 1 × 10 9 /L and 2. 2 × 10 9 /L (p = 0. 11). The median platelet count was lower in males than females (236 × 10 9 /L versus 247 × 10 9 /L, p = 0. 004). Our median values for RBC parameters differ from those of African countries probably because of our inclusion criteria which eliminate most cases with iron deficiency and/or thalassemia. 1...|$|R
