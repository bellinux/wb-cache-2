30|$|A {{total of}} 1320 firms meeting the four {{criteria}} {{were selected from}} the Dun and Bradstreet database as the study’s initial sample frame. After excluding firms {{for a variety of}} reasons (e.g., a no-survey policy, not reachable), the adjusted sample was 1139. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to top management (e.g., CEO, vice president). Following Dillman et al. (2009) survey technique, the following steps were taken: a pre-notification postcard, an initial questionnaire, a reminder postcard, a second questionnaire, and final phone and email contacts. As the first survey package resulted in a low response rate, phone calls and emails were made during the second mailing period to encourage the participation of firms who had misplaced, lost, not received, or not responded to the <b>first</b> <b>mailing.</b> <b>By</b> the end of the data collection, the final useable questionnaires totaled 76, representing a response rate of 6.67  %. A series of t tests was performed to measure the non-response bias by comparing questionnaires received after the <b>first</b> <b>mailing</b> and after the second mailing. No statistical evidence of non-response bias, such as annual sales volume and number of domestic retail stores, was identified in the firms’ demographic characteristics.|$|R

50|$|The Post Office {{had little}} {{difficulty}} in getting mass mailers {{to use the}} ZIP Code as it could make its inclusion a condition for receiving preferential mailing rates and soon did. However, there was some resistance by the general public, members of whom would mail items without ZIP Code, almost invariably at the full rate for <b>First</b> Class <b>Mail,</b> which <b>by</b> regulation had to be delivered {{if at all possible}} and feasible. This was particularly true of older mailers. Mr. ZIP was the Post Office's answer to this, apparently intended to teach small children to always use the ZIP Code as they got older and also to encourage their parents and grandparents to do so.|$|R

50|$|Australia's <b>first</b> <b>mail</b> {{coach was}} {{established}} in 1828 and was crucial in connecting the remote settlements being established to the larger centres.

The Sydney to Melbourne overland packhorse mail service was commenced in 1837. From 1855 the Sydney to Melbourne overland mail coach was supplanted by coastal steamer ship and rail. The rail network became the distributor of mail to larger regional centres there the mail coach met the trains and carried the mail to more remote towns and villages.|$|R

Compared with doctors <b>first</b> approached <b>by</b> <b>mail,</b> those <b>first</b> approached <b>by</b> telephone {{were significantly more likely to}} report having a partner with a special interest in psychiatry (P < 0. 01); and a general practitioner, practice nurse or health visitor who worked as a counsellor (P < 0. 01 in each case). A comparison of doctors first approached by telephone with those who completed telephone interviews after failing to respond to the postal questionnaire showed that postal non-respondents were significantly less likely to report having a general practitioner, practice nurse, health visitor or community psychiatric nurse who worked as a counsellor (P < 0. 01 in each case). CONCLUSION. These findings suggest that non-response to the postal survey was associated with lack of activity in the study area. Telephone administration of questionnaires to postal non-respondents increased {{response rates}} to above 80 % but, as telephone administration enhanced the reporting of counsellors, a social desirability bias may have been introduced...|$|R
