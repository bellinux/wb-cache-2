The EU eco-label scheme (as laid down in the new Regulation (EC) No 1980 / 2000) is now part of a wider approach on Integrated Product Policy (IPP) within the new Action Programme. The Commission has published a Green Paper on IPP that will be a key innovative element of future environmental policy and sustainable consumption and production. Strategically, the <b>European</b> <b>eco-label</b> Scheme is, and will be, in line with the principles, goals and priorities of the 6 th action Programme "Our Future, Our Choice". Following the Rio Summit in 1992, preparations by the EU on the {{overall objective}}s of sustainable development are underway as the year 2002 will be the year of RIO+ 10. 2002 will also see the 10 th anniversary of the Flower label.

30|$|Criteria of {{voluntary}} product eco-labels {{such as the}} <b>European</b> <b>eco-label</b> [34], the German Blue Angel [35], or the Nordic Swan [36] often include requirements for hazardous substances. Most basic criteria for eco-labels for articles in terms of REACH comprise restrictions of SVHCs. The <b>European</b> <b>eco-label</b> is very strict {{and may not be}} awarded to SVHC-containing goods [34 Art. 6 (6)]. Other eco-label criteria are a rich source for article types which might contain SVHCs (above or below the 0.1 % trigger limit), unless they fulfill the ambitious eco-label standards. Just to name but a few examples of basic criteria in the German Blue Angel regime for articles: the criteria RAL-UZ 120 for resilient floor coverings rule out SVHCs as plasticizers or flame retardants, RAL-UZ 132 for thermal insulation material exclude phthalates and halogenated organic flame retardants, RAL-UZ 171 for office equipment with printing function exclude the intentional addition of SVHCs in various materials, or RAL-UZ 119 for mattresses contain regulations on tin-organic substances (such as TBTO), fluorinated hydrocarbons (such as PFCs), and other halogenated organic compounds like flame retardants.|$|R

5000|$|The Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) has {{published}} reports {{focusing on the}} industry’s environmental credentials. In 2002, it noted that “a little over 60% of the pulp and paper produced in Europe comes from mills certified {{under one of the}} internationally recognised eco-management schemes”. [...] There are a number of ‘eco-labels’ designed to help consumers identify paper tissue products which meet such environmental standards. Eco-labelling entered mainstream environmental policy-making in the late seventies, first with national schemes such as the German Blue Angel programme, to be followed by the Nordic Swan (1989). In 1992 a <b>European</b> <b>eco-labelling</b> regulation, known as the EU Flower, was also adopted. The stated objective is to support sustainable development, balancing environmental, social and economical criteria.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tool designed {{to facilitate the}} communication of environmental information in the ceramic sector, both for companies and products. Specifically, the communication tool allows the environmental product declaration to be obtained for ceramic tiles in accordance with ISO 14025 and the environmental declaration of the organisation {{in accordance with the}} European Community Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS Register). Moreover, this tool makes it possible to verify compliance with the ecological criteria established by the <b>European</b> <b>Eco-label</b> programme for hard floor coverings (ceramic tiles) and, when they are not met, propose some best available techniques (BAT) to facilitate compliance with them. To do so, the tool is divided into four parts: (1) input data, where the user provides information related to the consumption of raw materials and resources, emissions into air, water and soil, solid waste, etc.; (2) database, including environmental indicators for different impact categories for the characteristics of the materials, processes and emissions of the ceramic sector; (3) reference documents, such as product category rules or different European regulations to guide the correct implementation of the environmental communication instruments included in the tool; and (4) output data in terms of the environmental declaration for the product and for the organisation, and verification of compliance with the <b>European</b> <b>eco-label</b> criteria and the proposal of BAT in the case of non-fulfilment, together with their environmental and economic consequences. The application of the tool is tested by a case study of ceramic tiles produced in an average Spanish organisation.

40|$|In this contribution, we {{concentrate}} on voluntary eco-labels, i. e., labels applied for {{reasons other than}} prescription by public regulation. Typical examples are the <b>European</b> <b>eco-label,</b> the Nordic White Swan or the German Blue Angel. Section 2, The concept of eco-labelling, gives an overview of the history and ‘landscape’ of eco-labels. It provides information on countries using such a scheme, presents an important categorisation elaborated in this context, explains objectives and mechanisms and hints at the distinction between direct and indirect effects. Section 3,Eco-labelling and product development, refers to the potential and some experiences within business, i. e., on a micro-economic level. The following Section 4 Assessing the impacts presents an empirical view on the state, successes and failures of eco-labelling; primarily based on a meso- and macro-economic view. The final Section 5, Conclusions, deduces the consequences and challenges, both for business and policy, for strengthening eco-labelling...|$|R

40|$|The {{hospitality}} industry generates environmental degradation through {{the construction of}} buildings, waste disposal, and water usage. Nowadays, a large number of customers show increased environmental awareness, being willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products/services. In Romania institutional arrangements to generate awareness of the necessity of sustainable development were numerous, exemplifying in this respect the actions carried out by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development for introducing the <b>european</b> <b>eco-label</b> for tourist accommodation services and the camping services, as well as for promoting the use of the eco-label in Romania among interested hotels and guesthouses. Based on these aspects, the article presents the results of a quantitative marketing research conducted among the young generation from Brașov county.

40|$|The Purpose of {{this study}} was to examine what {{knowledge}} and which attitudes there are about environmental friendly food in the society. To do so an essay were constructed and distributed to five different working places. Altogether there were 50 essays distributed and 43 were returned. The main result; the respondents think that it is important for people to learn how to consume food in a more environmentally friendly way. The majority of the respondents recognized the eco-label KRAV but the <b>European</b> <b>eco-label</b> and Demeter were not recognized in a less extent. Few of the respondents knew what GMO stands for. Over half of the respondents thought that it is pretty important/important or very important to buy ecological food but only one third of them said that they commonly/always buy ecologic food. Slightly more than one third was shore that they could contribute to an environmental friendly development by consuming ecological food. Conclusion: the respondents know too little about what the eco-labels stands for. Far from everyone is convinced that it actually is environmental friendly to buy environmental friendly food...|$|R
40|$|Environmental organisations {{have been}} active since the early 1960 s in putting {{environmental}} issues on the political agenda and in strengthening the environmental consciousness of the public. The struggle {{has been successful in}} the sense that there is now a strong demand for practical solutions among all kinds of actors. It is, however, difficult for states and political actors to manage environmental problems by traditional forms and instruments, due to the complex character of the problems. Therefore, environmental organisations take their own initiatives to participate in policy-making by developing new forms, within new arenas, with the help of new instruments (voluntary rules or standards). Special attention is paid to the possibilities of identifying and developing constructive roles in relation to other actors and institutions as well as the capacity to organise standardisation projects and to mobilise and make use of power resources such as symbolic capital and knowledge. In order to interpret characteristics and implications (possibilities and limitations) of standardisation strategies, I draw on the ecological modernisation perspective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to stimulate {{the debate on the}} {{economic}} aspects of minimally processed fresh-cut production, assessing the purchase intentions of consumers of fresh-cut products. In order to gain this purpose and compare with the literature, results of previous on-field research, that involved consumers of fresh-cut lamb's lettuce (Valerianella Locusta Laterr), are presented and discussed. This work deals with the information collected as marketing and economic analysis on food products object of the research project “Novel strategies meeting the needs of the fresh-cut vegetable sector – STAYFRESH”. Intentions to purchase fresh-cut lamb's lettuce from environmental sustainable farms, simulating a fresh-cut product with an Eco-label, are investigated. Several studies referred to the approach that sets out different types of motives that affect attitude and willingness to pay for minimally processed products. The managerial implications make it possible to assess how much the different types of motives influence the attitude and affect the choices and the behavior of the consumers. To complete, a cost analysis of the fresh cut lamb's lettuce product is proposed.

40|$|Eco-labels {{and ethical}} labels are {{instruments}} used in national product-related {{environmental and social}} policies. Germany was the first country to introduce an eco-labelling scheme, called "Blue Angel", in 1978. Since then, eco-labelling programs have been developed in many other countries of the world. National eco-labelling programs are new instruments covered by policy research studies. After outlining the aims and effects of environmental and ethical labels this study goes on to analyse potential negative impacts of eco-labels for foreign producers {{in the context of}} the world trade treaty and its free trade obligations. A review of the world-wide dissemination (diffusion patterns) of eco-labels and policy-learning processes identifies how policy innovations spread from one country to another. But there is cause to inquire into environmental-policy competence as a precondition for successful implementation. Three case studies are made of the German, <b>European</b> and Indian <b>eco-labelling</b> programs. The key message obtained from this evaluation of the perspectives of eco-labels for environmentally and socially acceptable products: The globalisation of economic, environmental and social policies will lead to a greater dissemination of policy instruments such as eco-labels. However, especially in developing economies that are under high pressure to become competitive on the world market, the introduction of new policy instruments is far too rapid, and does not reflect the need to first improve overall environmental policy competence...|$|R

The Rio Earth Summit (1992) was a milestone for these initiatives, having introduced the concept of sustainable development, its major principles and recommendations of implementation. So, the ecological movement grew globally more and more by widely disseminated actions among various bodies as the governments, associations, businesses, academics, NGOs and communities. In <b>European</b> Union <b>eco-labelling</b> scheme, is a voluntary initiative to promote products and services which {{have the potential to}} reduce negative environmental impacts, as compared to the other products and services in the same product or service group, thus contributing to the efficient use of resources and a high level of environmental protection. This shall be pursued through the provision of guidance and accurate, non-deceptive and scientifically based information to consumers on such products and services. In fact this is official approach known as EU-Ecolabel Scheme, launched in 2005. In general, the idea of sustainable development, and eco-attitude of many of the activities carried out in different economic sectors have been encouraged to be certified, and to adopt sustainable practices to improve their environmental practices, and to inform and educate their clients regarding their friendly-environmental policies. The tourism sector adopted all of these. One by one in hospitality industry have emerged new trends, new destinations. Some of these trends are as well connected to environmental policy, eco-initiatives that certify EMS (Environmental Management System) and to use of eco-label in hospitality industry. For years, the tourism sector in Romania was declared a strategic sector. Within this framework, we decided to examine this area, the specific topic of eco-labelling and quality of lodging services in Romania. This paper proposes a short examination by observation of studies dedicated to lodging eco-label services and their quality based on a comparative analysis between Romanian supply of tourism 'green services' and international one.

40|$|Eco-labels inform {{consumers}} {{about the}} environmental {{aspects of a}} product or a service. Consumers who are concerned with environmental issues can use the information on eco-labels to learn the environmental aspects of the products that they buy. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine how often the students of higher education pay attention to eco-labels when they are purchasing and the levels of the five internal factors that may motivate the consumers to pay attention to eco-labels. These factors are pro-environmental attitude (willingness to pay higher prices for products with eco-label), perceived consumer effectiveness (how much they believe that individual actions can improve the environment), belief in environment-friendly buying, trust in eco-label and knowledge in eco-labels. This study provided an opportunity to learn if the students consider the environmental aspects when they are buying and what teachers and education professionals can do to encourage the students to pay attention to eco-labels. Three textbooks used for General Studies for Primary students, three textbooks used in Integrated Science for Secondary 1 - 3 students and six teaching materials published by publishers (there is no textbook for Liberal Studies that is standardized by Education Bureau) used in Science, Technology and the Environment in Liberal Studies for Secondary 4 - 6 students were reviewed to find if the topic of eco-labeling was mentioned in them. It was found that none of the textbooks used for General Studies for Primary students mentioned eco-labeling, all textbooks used in Integrated Science used for Secondary 1 - 3 mentioned the Energy Efficiency Label and all teaching material used in liberal studies also mentioned Energy Efficiency Label, among them, one book mentioned the <b>European</b> Union’s <b>Eco-label.</b> A survey was carried out to assess how often students pay attention to eco-labels and how much they agree to statements relating to the five internal factors that may motivate them to pay attention to eco-labels. A test was given to assess their knowledge in the Energy Efficiency Label Scheme (EELS) issued by the Electrical and Mechanical Service Department and eco-labels issued to food and wood products respectively. The mean was 2. 8 (on a scale of 6, in which 1 means strongly disagree and 6 means strongly agree), when asked if they agreed that they often pay attention to eco- label when they were buying 3. 5 for pro-environmental attitude, 4. 2 for perceived consumer effectiveness, 3. 4 for belief in environmental buying, 3. 6 for trust in eco-labels and 3. 6 in perceived knowledge in eco-labels. 63. 2 % of the students correctly answered that there are five grades in EELS, 40 % of students correctly chose that the lower the grading, the more efficient is the electrical appliance. 8. 4 % of students correctly chose all five kind of electrical applicants that are mandated to show EEL. 2. 1 % attempted to name any eco-labels issued to wood products and 3. 1 % attempted to name any eco-labels issued to food products. It was concluded that students do not often pay attention to eco-labels when they are buying and that the limited knowledge in eco-labels was the potential cause. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R
