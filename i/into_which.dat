2500|$|In {{the second}} {{regulated}} step (the third step of glycolysis), phosphofructokinase converts fructose-6-phosphate <b>into</b> fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, <b>which</b> then is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. [...] The dihydroxyacetone phosphate {{can be removed}} from glycolysis by conversion <b>into</b> glycerol-3-phosphate, <b>which</b> {{can be used to}} form triglycerides. [...] Conversely, triglycerides can be broken down into fatty acids and glycerol; the latter, in turn, can be converted <b>into</b> dihydroxyacetone phosphate, <b>which</b> can enter glycolysis after the second control point.|$|R
500|$|The {{town was}} the early {{capital of the}} Kingdom of Powys, known to the ancient Britons as Pengwern, {{signifying}} [...] "the alder hill"; and in Old English as Scrobbesburh (dative Scrobbesbyrig), which may mean either [...] "Scrobb's fort" [...] or [...] "the fortified place in the bushes". This name gradually evolved in three directions, <b>into</b> Sciropscire, <b>which</b> became Shropshire; <b>into</b> Sloppesberie, <b>which</b> became Salop/Salopia (an alternative name for both town and county), and <b>into</b> Schrosberie, <b>which</b> eventually became the town's name, Shrewsbury. Its later Welsh name Amwythig means [...] "fortified place".|$|R
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru {{reed warbler}} has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest <b>into</b> <b>which</b> it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the PNR Executive Committee in 1919, {{he was elected to}} the Assembly of Deputies that year, in the first {{election}} following the creation of Greater Romania. Elected again in 1922, he served until 1926. Initially joining the National Peasants' Party <b>into</b> <b>which</b> the PNR merged in 1926, the following year he defected to Alexandru Averescu's People's Party, of which Goga was also a member.|$|E
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs <b>into</b> <b>which</b> a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E

5|$|After Iraq, Cross was {{appointed}} the first Commander, Logistic Support for 3rd Infantry Division in late 1992. During a re-organisation of the Army in 1993, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps was amalgamated {{to become part}} of the newly formed Royal Logistic Corps (RLC), <b>into</b> <b>which</b> Cross transferred and was promoted to colonel. Having completed the Higher Command and Staff Course earlier in 1995, he returned to 3rd Division and served in Bosnia as part of NATO's Implementation Force in 1995 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, <b>into</b> <b>which</b> the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube <b>into</b> <b>which</b> the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E
5|$|An orphan from {{an early}} age, Lillard {{attended}} Mason City High School {{before moving to the}} University of Oregon. He played twice for the university's football team in 1931 before he was ruled ineligible by the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) for playing semi-professional baseball. The following year, he signed with the Cardinals, but played less frequently {{toward the end of the}} season. Lillard was a leading contributor for the Cardinals in 1933, receiving praise from the Chicago Defender. His performances during the season included a game against the Chicago Bears that featured a punt return for a touchdown. However, he was ejected from two games that season for fighting, <b>into</b> <b>which</b> he was often baited by white opponents.|$|E

5|$|As the Doctor investigates, {{he realizes}} that alien energy lifeforms were beamed onto the ship within the {{containment}} field <b>into</b> <b>which</b> the protostar samples were transported. The missing crew members have been converted to energy by the lifeforms from the protostar, presumably as hostages in retaliation for Voyagers actions. The Doctor releases the energy lifeforms on the holodeck; in kind, the missing crew are returned to their original forms. Afterwards, upon reflection, the Doctor decides not to keep the name Schweitzer, as his memories associated with it are too painful.|$|E

And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness you have at last delivered me.|$|E
5|$|But {{the event}} could not mask the {{economic}} crisis <b>into</b> <b>which</b> Poland was drifting, exacerbated by Soviet demands for more military spending. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused further economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 (just before Christmas), the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, the government's main source of hard currency when exported. The new measures were incomprehensible to many urban workers, and their provocative timing (the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.|$|E
