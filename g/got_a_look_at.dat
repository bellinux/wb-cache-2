500|$|McKinley, {{with the}} {{exception}} of his 1893 financial crisis, had avoided scandal and carefully guarded his image, making him difficult to attack. [...] Hanna proved an easier target. Although Davenport had depicted Hanna in his cartoons before the Republican convention in June, these efforts were uninspired. This changed once Davenport <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his subject while attending the 1896 Republican National Convention in St. Louis. After three days spent closely observing Hanna managing the convention to secure McKinley's nomination and passage of a platform supporting the gold standard, Davenport was impressed with Hanna's dynamic behavior. [...] Convinced that he could effectively lampoon Hanna, Davenport's cartoons became more effective. Hanna was a tall man; Davenport exaggerated this trait, in part by shrinking everybody else. He also increased Hanna's already substantial girth. [...] Hanna's short sideburns were lengthened and made rougher—Davenport described them as [...] "like an unplaned cedar board". [...] Davenport borrowed from the animal kingdom for his creation, drawing Hanna's ears so they stuck out like a monkey's. [...] The cartoonist described Hanna's eyes as like a parrot's, leaving no movement unseen, or as those of a circus elephant—scanning the street for peanuts.|$|E
2500|$|The American author Michael Lewis has criticised the magazine's {{editorial}} anonymity, labeling it a {{means to}} hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. In 1991 Lewis quipped: [...] "The magazine is written by young people pretending to be old people ... If American readers <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the pimply complexions of their economic gurus, they would cancel their subscriptions in droves". Although individual articles are written anonymously, there is no secrecy over who the writers are, since they publicly disclose their employer on their social network accounts, for example.|$|E

6000|$|The Belle Savage {{had cleared}} the islands, and was {{standing}} on her course, one day, with a fair wind and a five or six knot breeze, under a fore-top-mast studding-sail, everything looking bright and prosperous. The brig must have been about a day's run to the southward of Bermuda. It was my watch below, but having just breakfasted, I was on deck, and looking about me carelessly, I was struck {{with the appearance of}} the vessel's being deeper than common. I had a little conversation about it, with a man in the forechains, who thought the same thing. This man leaned over, {{in order to get a}} better look, when he called out that he could see that we had started a butt! I went over, immediately, and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this serious injury. A butt had started, sure enough, just under the chains, but so low down as to be quite out of our reach.

60|$|It {{was rather}} a {{troublesome}} matter {{to get the}} cow and calf up the mountain. The first did not see enough that was attractive in naked rocks, to induce her to mount {{in the best of}} humours. She drank freely, however, at the brook, appearing to relish its waters particularly well. At length the plan was adopted of carrying the calf up a good distance, the cries of the little thing inducing its mother immediately to follow. In this way both were got up into Eden, in the course of an hour. And well did the poor cow vindicate the name, when she <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the broad glades of the sweetest grasses, that were stretched before her. So strongly was her imagination struck with the view--for we suppose that some cows have even more imagination than many men--that she actually kicked up her heels, and away she went, head down and tail erect, scampering athwart the sward like a colt. It was not long, however, before she began to graze, the voyage having been made on a somewhat short allowance of both food and water. If there ever was a happy animal, it was that cow! Her troubles were all over. Sea-sickness, dry food, short allowances of water, narrow lodgings, and hard beds, were all, doubtless, forgotten, as she roamed at pleasure over boundless fields, on which the grass was perennial, seeming never to be longer or shorter than was necessary to give a good bite; and among which numberless rills of the purest waters were sparkling like crystal. The great difficulty in possessing a dairy, in a warm climate, is the want of pasture, the droughts usually being so long in the summer months. At Vulcan's Peak, however, and indeed in all of that fine region, it rained occasionally, throughout the year; more in winter than in summer, and that was the sole distinction in the seasons, after allowing for a trifling change in the temperature. These peculiarities appear to have been owing to the direction of the prevalent winds, which not only brought frequent showers, but which preserved a reasonable degree of freshness in the atmosphere. Within the crater, Mark had often found the beat oppressive, even in the shade; but, without, scarcely ever, provided his body was not directly exposed to the sun's rays. Nor was the difference in the temperature between the Reef and the Peak, as marked as might have been expected from the great elevation of the last. This was owing to the circumstance that the sea air, and that usually in swift motion, entered so intimately into the composition of the atmosphere down on that low range of rocks, imparting its customary freshness to everything it passed over.|$|E

When this story was rejected, Breyfogle came to suspect the character's prolonged absence was due in part to censorship.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{many other}} women, Dona first started exercising {{to get in}} better shape. At a young age she joined a Nautilus gym and trained for twenty minutes, {{three times a week}} as she had been told.

5000|$|In 1963, {{before his}} legal {{troubles}} began, he self-published a booklet, My Contact With the Spacepeople. He alsopromoted {{the making of}} a short, low-budget film which dramatizes his supposed visits to the Saturnian space ship. The film, Edge of Tomorrow, begins with Schmidt being interviewed by an actor resembling Long John Nebel. In flashback we see his visit to the space ship and his chats with the Saturnians, including the ship's captain, [...] "Mr. X," [...] and two very fetching Space Girls dressed much like Carol and Tonga of Space Patrol. Schmidt's booklet was retitled Edge of Tomorrow to match the film, illustrated with stills from the film, and was clearly intended to be sold to audience members before or after showings of the film. The booklet is still in print. According to the booklet, while in the space cigar Schmidt had looked at some notebooks which contained prophecies for our earth covering the period 1958 to 1998, [...] "the end of the present Earth Cycle." [...] No details are given and Schmidt did not launch a new career as prophet.
