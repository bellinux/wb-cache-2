At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975. From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower, only 2.6 percent. David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production {{by the end of}} the century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse. The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2–2.5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields. However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World (pre-Gorbachev era).|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} author's {{article was}} to examine the role of taxes in the {{developing}} countries, to assess the maximum of tax encumbrance possible to realize and to analyse the tax structure. The results of his examination are as follows: 1. As the welfare arises, the importance of tax income generally increases in comparison with the <b>gross</b> <b>social</b> <b>product.</b> 2. Maximum encumbrance with taxes possible to realize oscillates from 10 % of <b>gross</b> <b>social</b> <b>product</b> for the poorest countries to 25 % for the developing countries on the medium level of welfare. 3. As the welfare arises, the significance of direct taxes generally increases, especially of taxes collected from the people, on the other hand the participation of indirect taxes is growing small.

The sphere of influence of rent relations {{is not confined to}} agriculture but also extends to the extractive industry, construction, woodlands, fisheries, and the utilization and control of water. The scale of rent relations can be judged by the following data. In 1975 - 77 our country's average <b>gross</b> <b>social</b> <b>product</b> was 904. 0 billion rubles a year, including 130. 9 billion (14. 5 %) in agriculture, 42. 4 billion (4. 7 %) in the extractive industry, and 92. 4 billion rubles (10. 4 %) in construction.

The factors underlying this low standard of health are complex, but relate to the <b>gross</b> <b>social</b> inequality experienced by Aborigines, even today. The social inequality, characterised by extreme socioeconomic deprivation and relative powerlessness, is {{the end result of}} the European occupation of Australia, which caused Aboriginal depopulation and dispossession. Since the early 1970 s a number of special programs have attempted to overcome the health inequalities of Aborigines, but have really met with only limited success.

40|$|The {{recently}} published Thirty-Eighth Leninist Collection (1) contains hitherto unknown materials by V. I. Lenin on problems pertaining to reproduction. Dating back to 1913, {{they are the}} drafts of a plan and materials for a work on E. Luxemburg's book The Accumulation of Capital. Even though the plan to write a new work on accumulation was not carried out, the preparatory materials are of great scholarly interest, introduce us to Lenin's creative laboratory, and hold great importance {{for the study of}} expanded reproduction. Lenin's documents - especially the four tables cited - characterize different aspects of reproduction in precapitalist formations under capitalism and socialism. Scrutinized in particular are the two departments of social production, national income, accumulation, consumption, the <b>gross</b> <b>social</b> <b>product,</b> and constant and variable capital. Other new features include the very detailed characterization of socialist reproduction, the quantitative expression of levels of socialist production and its reproductive relationships in comparison with reproduction in preceding epochs. ...|$|E

The absence of accepted measures of societal performance (in addition to GNP) inhi bits scientific discussion of social objectives. The current interest is directed in "social indicators " and measures of "the quality of life" toward bringing some order into this discussion.

In leading {{countries of the world}} and in Ukraine compatible production and scientific complexes are created; collaboration between research institutions and state is established, in particular the theory and practice of collaboration between science, industry and state on the basis of Triple Helix Model is widespread in the world; in scientific papers objects of research of economic processes, subjects of research of the economic theory are considered. However, there are no works where the objects and tasks of economic researches are studied on the basis of macroeconomic environment, and a distinct principle to distinguish research objects relating to different economies and types of production is laid out; scientific and practical problems of economy in the field of collaboration between state, science and industry are clearly defined. According to the purpose of the article (to specify scientific and practical tasks to rationalize scientific research), the experience gained is systematized and a scheme-matrix of scientific and practical problems is proposed. In scientific practice there are works highlighting principles of scientific research work, research tasks in the field of economy, scientific problems of economy but there are no works considering both principles and tasks of collaboration of academic economists with state and industry in order to provide scientists with recommendations on optimization of economic processes to improve the economic efficiency.

The first measure, <b>gross</b> <b>social</b> costs, excluded output gains due to treatment, whereas the second measure, net social costs, included output gains from both market and nonmarket activities. The cost-effectiveness criterion was the cost-per-life year gained or the implicit value of a year of life. The lower the cost-per-life year gained, the more costeffective the treatment was. Four ERSD treatments were evaluated over 20 years. Home dialysis and transplantation were more cost-effective than in-center dialysis, regardless of whether <b>gross</b> or net <b>social</b> costs were used. However, lower values were obtained {{in the case of}} net social costs reflecting a provision for output gains due to treatment.

In short, the enterprises have to be innovative all the time, because the imperative of modern business is improving all the components of the structure and business of an enterprise. Capacity of small and medium enterprises to bring more quality, functional and cheaper products on the market indicates the development of innovative processes in those enterprises. Most frequently, new products, which represent the guarantee for their successful work, represent the innovations in small and medium enterprises. Small and medium enterprises are more flexible and easier for adaptation in comparison with the environment and thus, they are far more easily adapted to new circumstances in comparison with the need for innovation of products and services.
