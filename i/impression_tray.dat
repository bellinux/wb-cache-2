40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{different}} types of <b>impression</b> <b>trays</b> for the closed-mouth impression technique, using two different types of impression material. For this study, five different types of <b>impression</b> <b>trays</b> were used with two different types of impression materials, one of addition silicone and the other of polyether. We designed a model used for taking the impressions and for measuring interocclusal distortion. The results obtained show that the <b>impression</b> <b>trays</b> COE (GC (R) GC America INC.

In terms of impression materials, the polyether was the one that produced the best results. From a clinical point of view, our study shows that the use of these types of trays is absolutely recommendable when used according to the clinical indications for which they have been designed; that said, we must not fail to consider that selecting the proper type of tray is also important. 1. 071 JCR (2010) Q 3, 52 / 77 Dentistry, oral surgery & medicin...|$|R

50|$|An <b>impression</b> <b>tray</b> is a {{container}} which holds the impression material as it sets and supports the set impression. There are 2 main types of trays. Stock trays are manufactured en masse {{in a range}} of sizes and shapes, from which the closest size and shape tray is selected that matches the dimensions of the dental arches of the person who is to receive the impression. Special trays (or custom trays) are made to fit a specific individual's mouth by a denturist (dental technician). Special trays are constructed on a cast from a preliminary impression which utilizes stock trays.|$|E
50|$|Impressions {{can also}} be {{described}} as mucostatic or mucocompressive, being defined both by the impression material used {{and the type of}} <b>impression</b> <b>tray</b> used (i.e. spaced or closely adapted). Mucostatic means that the impression is taken with the mucosa in its normal resting position. These impressions will generally lead to a denture which has a good fit during rest, but during chewing, the denture will tend to pivot around incompressible areas (e.g. torus palatinus) and dig into compressible areas. Mucocompressive means that the impression is taken when the mucosa is subject to compression. These impressions will generally lead to a denture that is most stable during function but not at rest. Dentures are at rest most of the time, so {{it could be argued that}} mucostatic impressions make better dentures, however in reality it is likely that tissue adaption to the presence of either a denture made with a mucostatic or a mucocompressive technique make little difference between the two in the long term.Another type of impression technique is selective pressure technique in which stress bearing areas are compressed and stress relief areas are relived such that both the advantages of muco static and muco compressive techniques are achieved.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of an impression valve system (IVS) on the bonding force between an <b>impression</b> <b>tray</b> and an edentulous maxillary jaw. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, a polyether-coated maxillary jaw simulator (PM) was used to model an edentulous maxillary jaw. The IVS was placed into individual impression trays. An irreversible hydrocolloid impression was taken of the PM when the IVS was open and closed. The <b>impression</b> <b>tray</b> bonding force was measured using a digital dynamometer.

All six private dental laboratories in Bahrain were contacted and invited to participate in the study. Five laboratories participated, and submitted written instructions received by them for fabrication of both acrylic (A-RPDs) and cobalt-chromium (CC-RPDs) RPDs. These were examined for evidence of selected design variables. Types of <b>impression</b> <b>trays</b> and materials used were also recorded. One hundred and thirty-one written instructions were examined. Eleven percent (n = 14) were for CC-RPDs, 89 % (n = 117) for A-RPDs. All treatments were provided on a private basis. Fifty-seven percent (n = 1 8) of CC-RPD instructions requested the technician to design the prosthesis, 43 % (n = 6) contained a diagram and 43 % (n = 6) mentioned all design variables. Seventy-nine percent (n = 92) of A-RPDs requested the technician to design the denture, and only 1 % (n = 1) mentioned all design variables. Alginate impression material was most commonly used for master impressions (83 % of impressions (n = 109); 85 % (n = 99) of A-RPDs, and 71 % (n = 10) of CC-RPDs).

30|$|The implant {{impression}} {{can be at}} the abutment or implant level. The implant level {{impression is}} preferred in the esthetic zones and reduces the number of treatment visits. However, it presents unique challenges to the prosthodontist and errors can be introduced in many ways due to a rotation error that occurs when implants are connected to impression copings and to dislodgement of the impression material during removal of the <b>impression</b> <b>tray</b> from the mouth [10].|$|E
30|$|The {{open and}} closed <b>tray</b> <b>impression</b> {{techniques}} are both advocated, each has advantages and disadvantages.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Various {{impression}} {{techniques have}} different {{effects on the}} accuracy of final cast dimensions. Meanwhile; there are some controversies about the best technique. Purpose: This study was performed to compare two kinds of implant <b>impression</b> methods (open <b>tray</b> and closed tray) on 15 degree angled implants. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, a steel model with 8 cm in diameter and 3 cm in height were produced with 3 holes devised inside to stabilize 3 implants. The central implant was straight {{and the other two}} implants were 15 ° angled. The two angled implants had 5 cm distance from each other and 3. 5 cm from the central implant. Dental stone, high strength (type IV) was used for the main casts. <b>Impression</b> <b>trays</b> were filled with poly ether, and then the two <b>impression</b> techniques (open <b>tray</b> and closed tray) were compared. To evaluate positions of the implants, each cast was analyzed by CMM device in 3 dimensions (x,y,z). Differences in the measurements obtained from final casts and laboratory model were analyzed using t-Test. Results: The obtained results indicated that closed <b>tray</b> <b>impression</b> technique was significantly different in dimensional accuracy when compared with open tray method. Dimensional changes were 129 ± 37 μ and 143. 5 ± 43. 67 μ in closed tray and open tray, while coefficient of variation in closed- tray and open tray were reported to be 27. 2 % and 30. 4 %, respectively.

30|$|Regarding implant angulation, {{the results}} of this study found that {{increasing}} implant angulation to 15 ° or 30 ° affected the accuracy of indirect impression technique. While in the direct unsplinted technique, no difference in accuracy was found between parallel condition and 15 ° angulated condition. The increased displacement of impression material and the difficult removal of the <b>impression</b> <b>tray</b> in case of angulated implant were believed to be the source of error in the indirect impression technique. In the direct technique, the impression coping remains in the impression, which reduces the effect of implant angulation and the impression material deformation upon removal from mouth.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} is limited on the {{detailed description of}} the practice of Irish general dentists in the provision of crowns. To review the provision of crowns by dentists in Ireland and identify opportunities for improving current clinical practices. A questionnaire was posted to 500 general dentists selected randomly from the Irish Dental Register and 150 responded. Twenty-three laboratories used by these dentists were subsequently surveyed. The Vita Shade Guide was the most commonly used shade guide. Crowns were mainly fabricated using porcelain bonded to metal (51 %) followed by all-ceramic (42 %) and gold (5 %). Plastic Solo trays were the preferred <b>tray</b> for <b>impressions</b> and the laboratory prescription form was the primary means of dentist-technician communication.
