In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents' consent. It was reported that she cut off all professional and personal ties with R. Kelly after the marriage was annulled and ceased having contact with him. In 2014, Jomo Hankerson stated that Aaliyah [...] "got villainized" [...] over her relationship with R. Kelly and the scandal over the marriage {{made it difficult to}} find producers for her second album. [...] "We were coming off of a multi-platinum debut album and except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy, it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> get producers on the album."

2500|$|Rabbi Eric Yoffie, {{president}} of the Union for Reform Judaism, called J Street's reaction to the Israeli invasion of Gaza [...] "morally deficient, profoundly {{out of touch with}} Jewish sentiment and also appallingly naïve". J Street responded stating, [...] "It is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> understand how the leading reform rabbi in North America could call our effort to articulate a nuanced view on these difficult issues 'morally deficient'. If our views are 'naive' and 'morally deficient', then so are the views of scores of Israeli journalists, security analysts, distinguished authors, and retired IDF officers who have posed the same questions about the Gaza attack as we have." [...] Despite this rebuttal, J Street subsequently invited Yoffie to its 2009 convention, and he subsequently praised the organization's stance on the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, which was closer to that of other American Jewish organizations.|$|E

2500|$|The Sandinistas' {{relationship}} with the Roman Catholic Church deteriorated as the Contra War continued. The hierarchy refused {{to speak out against}} the counterrevolutionary activities of the contras and failed to denounce American military aid. State media accused the Catholic Church of being reactionary and supporting the Contras. According to former President Ortega, [...] "The conflict with the church was strong, and it costs us, but I don't think it was our fault. ... There were so many people being wounded every day, so many people dying, and it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> understand the position of the church hierarchy in refusing to condemn the contras." [...] The hierarchy-state tensions were brought to the fore with Pope John Paul II 1983 visit to Nicaragua. Hostility to the Catholic Church became so great that at one point, FSLN militants shouted down Pope John Paul II as he tried to say Mass. Therefore, while the activities of the Catholic church contributed {{to the success of the}} Sandinista revolution, the hierarchy's opposition was a major factor in the downfall of the revolutionary government.|$|E

People weren't getting what they desired from music and being in a band. I couldn't imagine trying to work on another record with that band. We drifted apart, as people do, as people grow into different individuals and have different ideas of where they want to be in their lives and what they want to be doing with music. As different as we were, we all shared a similar vision as far as where we wanted to be; as the years progressed, it became more and more polarized.

[...] Isaac was probably writing music by the 1470s, and the first document mentioning his name dates back to 15 September 1484, placing him in Innsbruck as a singer for Duke Sigismund of Austria, of the House of Habsburg. [...] The following year Isaac migrated to Florence, since documents show that by July 1485 Isaac had become employed as a singer at the church Santa Maria del Fiore. [...] By the middle of 1491, he was designated as a singer at Santissima Annunziata, a position that he held until 1493.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In most {{eucaryotes}} the tubulin genes comprise small multigene {{families with}} approximately {{equal numbers of}} genes for a- and ß-tubulin, the structural proteins of microtubules. The recent isolation of tubulin mutations in several species {{is proving to be}} a powerful tool for examining the structure and function of specific sets of microtubules. In Drosophila melanogaster, genetic analysis of a testis-specific ß-tubulin gene has shown that a single tubulin gene product may fulfill a number of different microtubule functions. In addition to tubulin mutations, mutations in other genes whose products are involved in the regulation or structure of specific microtubule arrays have also been isolated. The combination of analysis of both classes of mutations is beginning to allow a molecular description of the construction and function of three-dimensional cellular structures. In addition, such studies may also shed light on the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to and serve to maintain small families of genes encoding very similar proteins.
