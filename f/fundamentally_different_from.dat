5|$|Kitsune are {{believed}} to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of yōkai, or spiritual entity, and the word kitsune is often translated as fox spirit. However, {{this does not mean}} that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> regular foxes. Because the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> {{and more difficult}} to study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|Under the new system, {{newly elected}} magistrates were awarded with {{automatic}} {{membership in the}} senate, although it remained difficult for a Plebeian from an unknown family to enter the senate. Several factors {{made it difficult for}} individuals from unknown families to be elected to high office, in particular the very presence of a long-standing nobility, as this appealed to the deeply rooted Roman respect for the past. Ultimately, a new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy emerged, which replaced the old Patrician nobility. It was the dominance of the long-standing Patrician nobility which ultimately forced the Plebeians to wage their long struggle for political power. The new nobility, however, was <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the old nobility. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because only Patricians were allowed to stand for high office, and it was ultimately overthrown after those laws were changed. Now, however, the new nobility existed due to the organization of society, and as such, it could only be overthrown through a revolution.|$|E

25|$|Cosmic ray antiprotons {{also have}} a much higher average energy than their normal-matter {{counterparts}} (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2GeV, indicating their production in a <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> process <b>from</b> cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.|$|R
25|$|Semiconductor detectors, {{also called}} {{solid-state}} detectors, are <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> scintillation detectors: They rely on detection {{of the charge}} carriers (electrons and holes) generated in semiconductors by energy deposited by gamma ray photons.|$|E
25|$|Each {{aircraft}} model requires different {{knowledge and}} skill to fly. For example, a single engine general aviation aircraft's design and operation is <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> a gyroplane. Type ratings allow a pilot to fly a specific aircraft model. The CARs use the term type instead of model.|$|E
25|$|The debate focused {{primarily}} {{on the nature of}} the relationship between the civilian and military worlds. There was widespread agreement that there were two distinct worlds and that they were <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> one another. The argument was over how best to ensure that the two could coexist without endangering liberal democracy.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The {{main point}} of this chapter {{is to show that}} the {{different}} indices used in the mobility literature are not measures of the same underlying conceptual entity. In elementary statistics, students are taught that the mean and median are both measures of central tendency but they are different measures of central tendency; the variance and Gini coefficient are measures of dispersion but they are different measures of dispersion; and central tendency and dispersion are <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> concepts <b>from</b> one another. In much the same way, this chapter maintains that the different mobility indices in common use are measuring <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> mobility concepts <b>from</b> one another. It is in this sense that mobility really is multifaceted...|$|R

This dialog takes place between the classical and the quantum parts of the brain.

25|$|Some neuroethics {{problems}} are not <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those encountered in bioethics. Others are unique to neuroethics because the brain, as the organ of the mind, has implications for broader philosophical problems, such as the nature of free will, moral responsibility, self-deception, and personal identity. Examples of neuroethics topics are given later in this article ("Key issues in neuroethics").|$|E
25|$|However, the American Library Association {{strongly}} {{objected to}} the provision, believing that library records are <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> ordinary business records, and that the provision would have {{a chilling effect on}} free speech. The association became so concerned that they formed a resolution condemning the USA PATRIOT Act, and which urged members to defend free speech and protect patrons' privacy.|$|E

25|$|Other {{types of}} gates, namely AND gates and OR gates, can be {{constructed}} using a majority gate with fixed polarization on one of its inputs. A NOT gate, on the other hand, is <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the majority gate, as shown in Figure 6. The key to this design is that the input is split and both resulting inputs impinge obliquely on the output. In contrast with an orthogonal placement, the electric field effect of this input structure forces a reversal of polarization in the output.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{identity}} {{is linked to}} an individual's intrinsic sense of self and, particularly {{the sense of being}} male or female. Gender identity may or may not conform to a person's birth assigned sex. The personal characteristics that are associated with gender identity include self-image, physical and biological appearance, expression, behaviour and conduct, as they relate to gender. … Individuals whose birth-assigned sex does not conform to their gender identity include transsexuals, transgenderists, intersexed persons and cross-dressers. A person's gender {{identity is}} <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> and not determinative of their sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{an image}} of oneself with the front-back axis flipped results in the {{perception}} of an image with its left-right axis flipped. When reflected in the mirror, your right hand remains directly opposite your real right hand, but it is perceived as the left hand of your image. When a person looks into a mirror, the image is actually front-back reversed, which is an effect similar to the hollow-mask illusion. Notice that a mirror image is <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the object and cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object.|$|E
50|$|The Chinese and Tibetan canons are not {{translations}} of the Pali and differ from it to varying extents, but contain some recognizably similar early works. However, the Abhidharma books are <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> works <b>from</b> the Pali Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Chinese and Tibetan canons also consist of Mahāyāna sūtras and Vajrayāna tantras, which have few parallels in the Pali Canon.|$|R
50|$|This idea {{is seen as}} {{particularly}} powerful {{in the context of}} certain groups of people whom society identifies (incorrectly) as being somehow <b>fundamentally</b> negatively <b>different</b> <b>from,</b> and of lower value than, ordinary people (for instance 'the mentally ill' or 'people with special needs' or 'autistic people' or 'asylum seekers').|$|R
5000|$|Proponents {{of black}} {{feminism}} argue {{that black women}} are positioned within structures of power in <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> ways <b>from</b> white women. The distinction of black feminism has birthed the derisive tag [...] "white feminist", used to criticize feminists who do not acknowledge issues of intersectionality. Critics of black feminism argue that racial divisions weaken {{the strength of the}} overall feminist movement.|$|R
25|$|Mass cytometry overcomes the {{fluorescent}} labeling limit by utilizing lanthanide isotopes attached to antibodies. This method could theoretically allow {{the use of}} 40 to 60 distinguishable labels and has been demonstrated for 30 labels. Mass cytometry is <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> flow cytometry: cells are introduced into a plasma, ionized, and associated isotopes are quantified via time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Although this method permits {{the use of a}} large number of labels, it currently has lower throughput capacity than flow cytometry. It also destroys the analysed cells, precluding their recovery by sorting.|$|E
25|$|When the {{revolution}} spread to Latvia there was arguably a more focused target. Instead of frustration or class struggle, the adversary in Latvia was unambiguously the Baltic German elite: a separate social class of separate ethnicity speaking a separate language. Thus the 1905 revolution in Latvia was <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> {{that in the}} rest of Russia. Peasants of both Russian and Latvian ethnicity captured small towns and burned dozens of manors. The revolution in Latvia, however, did not agitate to separate from Russia, as nationalists continued to believe they needed the might of Imperial Russia to counter Baltic German dominance.|$|E
25|$|Kugel {{reported}} that the Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein found no pig bones in hilltop sites starting in the Iron I period (roughly 1200–1000 BCE) and continuing through Iron II, while before that, in Bronze Age sites, pig bones abounded. Kugel deduced from Finkelstein’s data that the new hilltop residents were <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> both their predecessors in the highlands and the city Canaanites — either because they were a different ethnic group, or because they had adopted {{a different way of}} life, for ideological or other reasons. Kugel inferred from Finkelstein’s findings that these highlanders shared some ideology (if only a food taboo), like modern-day Jews and Muslims.|$|E
50|$|In {{the latter}} case, member states' attachés {{assigned}} to a Permanent Representation to the European Union perform a <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> function <b>from</b> that of bilateral attachés.

25|$|Both {{amphetamine}} and methylphenidate {{are predominantly}} dopaminergic drugs, yet their mechanisms of action are distinct. Methylphenidate {{acts as a}} norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor while amphetamine is both a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Methylphenidate's mechanism of action in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine is <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> most other phenethylamine derivatives, as methylphenidate is thought to increase neuronal firing rate, whereas amphetamine reduces firing rate, but causes monoamine release by reversing {{the flow of the}} monoamines through monoamine transporters via a diverse set of mechanisms, including TAAR1 activation and modulation of VMAT2 function, among other mechanisms. The difference in mechanism of action between methylphenidate and amphetamine results in methylphenidate inhibiting amphetamine's effects on monoamine transporters when they are co-administered.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{association}} of Venus to Metal appears at first <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Western notions {{of love and}} romance. In Babylonian mythology, her equivalent was Ishtar, goddess of both love and war. The Chinese metal representative is unyielding and forceful, set in their ways and taciturn; yet Venus' Western element is air, which is logical and sanguine. Metal is also sophisticated, and enjoys the good things in life. In Western astrology, Venus rules both Libra, which is sophisticated, logical, and romantic, and Taurus, which is reserved, sensual, and unyielding. Some Western astrologers believe that metal is better associated with the qualities of the planet Saturn, arguing that metal equates to air in the western system, and that Saturn is linked to air in Vedic astrology.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} case studies of {{language}} acquisition in a child with delayed linguistic development outside of studies on deaf children. Susan Curtiss argued that, even if humans possess the innate ability to acquire language, Genie demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start. Since Genie never fully acquired grammar, Curtiss submitted that Genie provided evidence for a weaker variation of the critical period hypothesis. Genie's nonverbal skills were exceptionally good, which demonstrated that even nonverbal communication was <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> language. Because Genie's language acquisition occurred in the right hemisphere of her brain, its course also aided linguists in refining existing hypotheses on the capacity for right-hemisphere language acquisition in people after the critical period.|$|E
40|$|Comanagement {{is defined}} as shared responsibility, {{authority}} and accountability {{for the management of}} a hospitalized patient, and represents a <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> model <b>from</b> traditional medical consultation. Medical comanagement has rapidly proliferated and is now a dominant model of care in American hospitals. Comanagement is most effective when patients are appropriately selected, processes are predetermined and systems are implemented to ensure rigorous and continuous improvement. This article provides a structured approach for conceptualizing and implementing medical comanagement...|$|R
40|$|The paper puts {{forward a}} metatheoretical {{approach}} which {{is capable of}} reconstructing the argumentative techniques applied in linguistic theories. The main finding is that linguistic theories work in a way <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> both <b>from</b> what the analytical philosophy of science and practicing linguists themselves assume, because they relevantly contain plausible inferences rather than deductive ones {{and they do not}} separate the stage of justification from the discovery process. These hypotheses will be supported {{with the help of a}} case study about the Standard Theory of Generative Syntax...|$|R
50|$|Hotspot volcanoes are {{considered}} to have a <b>fundamentally</b> <b>different</b> origin <b>from</b> island arc volcanoes. The latter form over subduction zones, at converging plate boundaries. When one oceanic plate meets another, the denser plate is forced downward into a deep ocean trench. This plate, as it is subducted, releases water into {{the base of the}} over-riding plate, and this water mixes with the rock, thus changing its composition causing some rock to melt and rise. It is this that fuels a chain of volcanoes, such as the Aleutian Islands, near Alaska.|$|R
