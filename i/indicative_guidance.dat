40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{editorial}} is to provide <b>indicative</b> <b>guidance</b> to prospective EJM contributors {{of the importance of}} theoretical development to the success of submissions. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use a combination of conceptual thinking and theoretical literature to present key concepts of theory and its relevance to a manuscript's contribution to knowledge. Findings – The authors propose some guidelines for researchers who wish to publish the results of their work in EJM, and these also have relevance to other top academic journals. Research limitations/implications – The topic of theoretical conceptualisation and development is a complex one. Because of space constraints, the coverage of many issues is necessarily brief in this article. Practical implications – Scholars should find the thoughts contained in this article to be of significant benefit to their publication efforts in EJM and other top journals. Originality/value – While other top marketing journals have in the past provided similar guideline-style pieces, {{this is one of the}} few to be written from an inclusive perspective, with the explicit focus on the theoretical development stage...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} aims of {{this research}} were to assess whether, when imposing sanctions, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances considered by the General Medical Council are first considered when determining impairment of fitness to practise and {{to determine whether the}} circumstances described by the General Medical Council in their <b>Indicative</b> Sanctions <b>Guidance</b> as warranting erasure from the Medical Register will lead to that outcome. The consideration of specific aggravating circumstances or points of mitigation when determining impairment of fitness to practise was compared to their subsequent consideration by the General Medical Council when deciding on the severity of sanction to be applied. Additionally, the proportion of cases that highlighted aggravating circumstances the General Medical Council deemed sufficiently serious to warrant erasure and the actions taken were monitored. One hundred forty-six cases heard by the General Medical Council between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2012 met with the inclusion criteria. Fisher???s exact test was used to detect a variation from the expected distribution of data. Three of the four aggravating/mitigating circumstances {{were more likely to be}} considered when determining sanction having first been factored into the consideration of impairment. There was a statistically significant correlation between both a risk of harm and dishonesty as aggravating factors and the sanction of erasure from the Medical Register. In general, the General Medical Council consider relevant factors at all stages of their deliberations into practitioner misconduct, as required by the determinations in the cases of Cohen, Zygmunt and Azzam; and subsequently follow the <b>guidance</b> within their <b>Indicative</b> Sanctions <b>Guidance</b> document when determining which sanction to appl...|$|R

Souza, "A {{retrospective}} {{analysis of the}} GDC's performance against its newly-approved fitness to practise guidance", British Dental Journal, Vol. 219 (E 5), September 2015. DOI: 10. 1038 /sj. bdj. 2015. 674 Objectives: To assess if the GDC considers relevant factors at all stages of its deliberations into misconduct, {{as required by the}} determinations in the cases of Cohen, Zygmunt, and Azzam; and to assess whether those circumstances described in the <b>Indicative</b> Sanctions <b>Guidance</b> as warranting erasure from GDC registers led to that outcome. Design Retrospective analysis of practise committee transcripts. Materials and Methods: The consideration of specific factors in determining impairment of fitness to practise was compared with their subsequent consideration when determining the severity of sanction. Additionally, cases that highlighted aggravating circumstances deemed as serious enough to warrant erasure were monitored. Pearson's ? test was used to detect any variation from the expected distribution of data. Results: Sixty-six cases met with the inclusion criteria. Of the five factors considered, all but one was more likely to be heard when determining sanction having first been factored in to the consideration of impairment. Additionally, there was a statistically significant correlation between the aggravating factors and erasure from the registers. Conclusions The GDC do, in general, consider relevant factors at all stages of their deliberations into practitioner misconduct, and act {{in a manner that is}} consistent with their own guidance when determining sanction...|$|R
