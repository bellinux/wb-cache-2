5|$|Once at Ctesiphon, Odaenathus {{immediately}} began {{the siege of}} the well-fortified winter residence of the Persian kings; severe damage was inflicted upon the surrounding areas due to the battles with Persian troops. The city held its ground and the logistical problems of fighting in enemy's land probably prompted the Palmyrenes to lift the siege. Odaenathus headed north along the Euphrates carrying with him numerous prisoners and booty. The invasion resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> restoration of the Roman lands (Osroene and Mesopotamia provinces) occupied by Shapur {{since the beginning of}} his invasions in 252. However, Dura-Europus and other Palmyrene posts south of Circesium, such as Anah, were not rebuilt.

5|$|Regular series {{character}} designer Yoshitaka Amano's concept art {{became the}} basis for the models <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> motion videos produced for the game's PlayStation re-release. Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the graphic directors, drew the imperial Magitek Armors seen in the opening scene. By doing so, he disregarded Sakaguchi's intention to reuse the regular designs from elsewhere in the game. The sprite art for the characters' in-game appearance was drawn by Kazuko Shibuya. While in the earlier installments, the sprites were less detailed on the map than in battle, Final Fantasy VIs had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen. This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions. Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super NES' Mode 7 graphics, Final Fantasy VI made more extensive use of them than its predecessors. For instance, unlike both Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V, the world map is rendered in Mode 7, which lends a somewhat three-dimensional perspective to an otherwise two-dimensional game.|$|E

Nonetheless he was also still an active part of the youth team and played in the team which won the Youth Cup for the second consecutive season. He made his first appearance for the national under-23 team on 20 January 1954 in Italy, and was considered for inclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> England team, but on the day when the selection committee watched him in action, against Arsenal on 27 March, he gave a poor performance and was not called up.|$|E

The Senators then faced Buffalo {{in the first round of}} the playoffs and were eliminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> seven games. Despite holding a lead in Game 7, Alexei Yashin put the puck in his own net, allowing Buffalo to tie the game and eventually win the game and the series on a goal by Derek Plante in overtime.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{campaign}} of May 1794 {{was a series}} of operations conducted by the British Royal Navy's Channel Fleet against the French Navy's Atlantic Fleet, with the aim of preventing the passage of a strategically important French grain convoy travelling from the United States to France. The campaign involved commerce raiding by detached forces and two minor engagements, eventually culminating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> fleet action of the Glorious First of June 1794, at which both fleets were badly mauled and both Britain and France claimed victory. The French lost seven battleships; the British none, but the battle distracted the British fleet long enough for the French convoy to safely reach port.|$|E

A 2–1 victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Full</b> Members Cup on 10 November 1987 gave Millwall their first win at Upton Park in 73 years.

5|$|Between 1999 and 2002, Robinson made 14 {{appearances}} for the England under-21s. He {{was first}} included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> international squad by Peter Taylor {{in a friendly}} against Italy on 15 November 2000, where he was an unused substitute. His next appearance on the England bench came two years later, under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, who selected him for a friendly match against Portugal on 7 September 2002, where he once again remained an unused substitute. He won his first cap in a 3–1 defeat against Australia on 12 February 2003, a match notable for the entire England team being substituted at half-time (at which point Robinson was brought on in place of David James). He won three more caps that year, all in friendlies, and on all occasions he was brought on at half-time. He made his first international start in a 6–1 victory over Iceland on 5 June 2004, with the match being England's final match before the UEFA Euro 2004 finals. Robinson was part of England's Euro 2004 squad, selected as an understudy to David James, although he made no appearances in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|For the game's {{character}} sculpting and rigging, {{the team}} introduced various new elements {{that were not}} used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found {{that the creation of}} the faces was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For the faces, the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To reta{{in the shape of the}} face and avoid awkward movement, the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and creasing in the shape of the face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, pupil dilation was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 are locked into animation.|$|E
