Later the same month 401005 was used for {{fine-tuning}} the new depot at Hamburg-Eidelstedt to the trains. Starting 22 May, 401504 and 401008 were used to train drivers for acceptance runs at Nuremberg. At the same time, 401503 was sent to Nuremberg for a test disassembly. In early June 1990, 401010 was sent to the <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> chamber at the Austrian Research and Test Center Arsenal.|$|E
