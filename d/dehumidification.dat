5|$|Several {{options were}} {{implemented}} {{to increase the}} bridge's lifespan. These included a <b>dehumidification</b> programme that slowed the rate of corrosion in the main cables by keeping air in the voids between the main cables' strands below 40% humidity. Engineering consultants Faber Maunsell began work on the project in 2006, which took {{two and a half}} years to complete at a cost of £7.8million. As part of the works, some of the corroded cable strands were spliced.|$|E

25|$|A <b>dehumidification</b> chamber {{can be an}} unvented system (closed loop) or a {{partially}} vented system which uses a heat pump to condense moisture from the air using cold side of the refrigeration process (evaporator.) The heat thus gathered {{is sent to the}} hot side of the refrigeration process (condenser) to re-heat the air and returns this drier and warmer air inside the kiln. Fans blow the air through the piles as in a normal kiln. These kilns traditionally operate from 100°F to 160°F and use about half the energy of a conventional kiln.|$|E

500|$|Active {{atmospheric}} water collectors {{have been in}} use since the commercialisation of mechanical refrigeration. Essentially, all that is required is to cool a heat exchanger below the dew point, and water will be produced. Such water production may take place as a by-product, possibly unwanted, of <b>dehumidification.</b> The air conditioning system of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, for example, produces an estimated [...] of water each year that is used for irrigating the tower's landscape plantings.|$|E

2500|$|Bronze {{objects were}} kept in <b>dehumidification</b> {{chambers}} {{for a few weeks}} and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed [...] "depth cleaning," [...] which entailed the use of small drills and vacuuming. Similar measures were taken with gold. [...] Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation.|$|E
2500|$|The labyrinthine salt mine has {{a single}} entrance, and a small {{gasoline-powered}} narrow-gauge engine pulling a flat car was utilized to navigate to the various caverns created by centuries of salt mining. [...] Into these spaces, workmen built storage rooms which boasted wooden floors, racks specifically designed to hold the paintings and other art works, up-to-date lighting, and <b>dehumidification</b> equipment. [...] Despite {{the fact that the}} salt was mined using pipes and sluices through which flowed gravity-fed water from the mountain, which carried dissolved salt 17 miles away to Bad Ischl, where the water was evaporated, leaving behind the salt, the mine was not naturally humid, as the salt in the mine's walls absorbed excess moisture, keeping the chambers at a constant 65% humidity, while the temperature only varied from a low of 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter to 47 degrees in the summer. [...] Mining operations continued as the artwork was loaded into the mines, with the miners occasionally dragooned into helping to unload.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dehumidification</b> of {{ventilation}} {{and makeup}} air consumes {{a great deal}} of energy worldwide.

5000|$|According {{to members}} of AHRI’s <b>dehumidification</b> product section, the reason for {{developing}} Standard 920 was to provide ASHRAE with a neutral and high-quality test method for <b>dehumidification</b> energy efficiency. The committee’s goal was to have ASHRAE include minimum <b>dehumidification</b> efficiency requirements in ASHRAE Standard 90.1. That standard is often {{used as the basis}} of building energy codes in the US and Canada, and also used worldwide as the baseline for voluntary energy programs such as LEED Certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) ...|$|E

50|$|To {{provide a}} metric that allows {{estimation}} of annual rather than instantaneous <b>dehumidification</b> performance of ventilation <b>dehumidification</b> systems, AHRI Standard 920 further defines a test protocol for measuring a system’s “integrated seasonal moisture removal efficiency”.

50|$|Membrane dryer {{refers to}} a <b>dehumidification</b> {{membrane}} that removes water vapor from compressed air.|$|E
50|$|A final {{advantage}} is increased <b>dehumidification.</b> Because VAV air flow is reduced under part-load conditions, air {{is exposed to}} cooling coils for a longer time. More moisture condenses on the coils, dehumidifying the air. Thus, although a constant-volume and a single-zone VAV unit maintain the same room temperature, the VAV unit provides more passive <b>dehumidification</b> and more comfortable space conditions.|$|E
50|$|Moisture Removal Efficiency (MRE) is {{a measure}} of the energy {{efficiency}} of any <b>dehumidification</b> process. Moisture removal efficiency is the water vapor removed from air at a defined inlet air temperature and humidity, divided by the total energy consumed by the <b>dehumidification</b> equipment during the same time period, including all fan and pump energy needed to move air and fluids through the system.|$|E
