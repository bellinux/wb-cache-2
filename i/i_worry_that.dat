500|$|Tupelo Honey {{was well}} {{received}} by critics upon the album's release. Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "Tupelo Honey {{is in one}} sense but {{another example of the}} artist making increased use of the album as the unit of communication as opposed to merely the song or the cut. Everything on it is perfectly integrated." [...] ZigZag magazine reviewer John Tobler, who also reviewed the album just after its release, gave the album high praise, saying [...] "If all music were as good as this, there wouldn't be any reason to make any more, because this is the real thing." [...] Critic Dave Marsh called it [...] "the perfect album for Van: he does everything...so incredibly well. There isn't a bad cut on it, of that I'm really sure." [...] Robert Christgau from The Village Voice voiced reservations in his praise of the album, writing that it was [...] "almost as rich in cute tunes as The Shirelles' Greatest Hits, but <b>I</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> domestic bliss with Janet Planet has been softening Van's noodle more than the joy of cooking requires." [...] Tupelo Honey was later ranked the fourth best album {{of the year in the}} Village Voice's first annual Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.|$|E

50|$|In my view, Mayo did {{not fully}} {{take into account the}} fact that an inventive concept can come not just from creative, {{unconventional}} application of a natural law, but also from the creativity and novelty of the discovery of the law itself. This is especially true in the life sciences, where development of useful new diagnostic and therapeutic methods is driven by investigation of complex biological systems. <b>I</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> method claims that apply newly discovered natural laws and phenomena in somewhat conventional ways are screened out by the Mayo test.|$|E

This growth in faith schools needs to be carefully but sensitively monitored by government to ensure that pupils receive an understanding of not only their own faith but of other faiths and the wider tenets of British society". He criticised Islamic schools in particular, calling them a [...] "threat to national identity".|$|E

McCarl was highly active during the 1918 congressional elections, and made numerous political contacts during this time.

5000|$|In a September 22, 2010 speech, SEC {{chairperson}} Mary Schapiro {{signaled that}} US authorities were considering {{the introduction of}} regulations targeted at HFT. She said, [...] "high frequency trading firms have a tremendous capacity to affect the stability and integrity of the equity markets. Currently, however, high frequency trading firms are subject to {{very little in the}} way of obligations either to protect that stability by promoting reasonable price continuity in tough times, or to refrain from exacerbating price volatility." [...] She proposed regulation that would require high-frequency traders to stay active in volatile markets. A later SEC chair Mary Jo White pushed back against claims that high-frequency traders have an inherent benefit in the markets. SEC associate director Gregg Berman suggested that the current debate over HFT lacks perspective. In an April 2014 speech, Berman argued: [...] "It's much more than just the automation of quotes and cancels, in spite of the seemingly exclusive fixation on this topic by much of the media and various outspoken market pundits.

5000|$|Abolishing the Zion {{curtains}} {{has been}} an often proposed and contentious issue affecting Utah politics for years. Many restaurants feel it introduces one more hardship in a state with too many alcohol restrictions, while others feel like it is a much-needed instrument to protect children and teens from exposure to alcohol consumption. A new bill, HB 339, is being introduced that would allow restaurant owners to abolish their Zion curtain provided the owners established a separate bar area {{that would not be}} accessible to anyone under the age of 21.Lawmakers insist that a wall or partition obscuring any alcoholic beverages from view helps to shield children and teens from the glamorization of alcohol. Jim Fell, a research scientist with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, points out that “... no research has been conducted to establish whether there is any actual benefit to this law's implementation. Exposure to alcohol does have an effect on teen drinking, but <b>I</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> the multimedia, including alcohol advertising, would overwhelm any effects that the Utah law might have," [...] said Fell.

5000|$|Cohn {{recalls that}} on arrival in Memphis: [...] "I {{did all the}} {{expected}} touristy things...I went to Graceland, and I saw Elvis Presley’s tomb and his airplanes" [...] - (Cohn would express misgivings after, eventually referencing Presley in the lyrics of [...] "Walking in Memphis": [...] "To me, the song is so minimally about him, but <b>I</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> it gets cast off as another Elvis tribute.

They would later become the centerpieces of 'Walking in Memphis'. The first thing was go to the Full Gospel Tabernacle Church on a Sunday morning to hear the Reverend Al Green preach...I soon had chills running up and down my spine. The service was so deeply moving that I found myself with sweat running down my face and tears in my eyes, totally enveloped by everything I was seeing and hearing. There was something incredibly powerful about Al Green’s voice in that context. Even after three hours of continuous singing, his voice only got stronger and his band only got better. I sat there crying in the church, aware of the irony of how I used to cry in Synagogue in Cleveland as a kid — but because I wanted to get the heck out of there! Al Green’s service {{was one of the great}} experiences of my life." ...|$|E
