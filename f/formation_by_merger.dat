Key words: massive star formation; accretion disks I. Introduction Two very different hypotheses have been proposed for the formation of massive stars. These are formation via accretion of ambient molecular gas and dust in hot, molecular cloud cores onto protostellar cores and the other is <b>formation</b> <b>by</b> <b>mergers</b> of low-mass protostars in dense clusters (Bonnell et al. 1997; 1998). Consequences of the accretion scenerio are formation of accretion disks, bipolar molecular outflows, and possible planet formation as part of the star formation process. Natural consequences of formation via mergers of low-mass protostars are compact star clusters with the most massive stars at the center of each cluster and an enhanced frequency of binary systems.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are used}} to study the fate of disks in mergers between equal-mass galaxies. Contrary to popular belief, mergers between equal-mass galaxies can form shells, loops, and ripples. Material that was originally in the outer disk of the premerger spirals falls into the remnant late in the merger event, long after the inner region of the remnant has relaxed. Thus, its evolution {{is similar to that}} of an accreted dwarf satellite that forms shells through 'phase wrapping'. However, the mechanism described in this letter avoids a number of difficulties with the accretion model; specifically, it can explain the observed correlation between properties of the host galaxies and shell alignments and luminosities. In view of this, we argue that many shell systems may have originated through 'major' mergers of comparable-mass galaxies rather than via 'minor' mergers or accretions. In particular, the shell elliptical NGC 3923 appears to be a good candidate for shell <b>formation</b> <b>by</b> a major <b>merger...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{spectral}} {{analysis of a}} sample of red-sequence galaxies identified by van Dokkum (2005) as dry merger remnants and ongoing dry mergers. Kinematics, stellar population absorption features, and ionisation from emission lines, are derived. We find that {{approximately half of the}} sample showing strong tidal features have younger stellar populations than a control sample at a given velocity dispersion. Conversely, galaxies with weak tidal tails and/or ongoing mergers [...] {{with the exception of one}} galaxy [...] do not show this young component. This seems to indicate that the young stellar populations observed in a significant fraction of ellipticals is the consequence of star <b>formation</b> triggered <b>by</b> <b>mergers.</b> This young component is consistent with a light "frosting" of young stars (< 2 % by mass) superimposed upon a dominant, old (~ 11 Gyr), stellar population. In terms of stellar populations, these mergers are, in fact, fairly dry. We found, however, that merger remnants with young stellar populations are supported by rotation, contrary to the expectations of a major dry merger. This suggests that the small amount of gas involved has been sufficient to produce a dynamically cold stellar component. Half of the galaxies with strong tidal distortion, however, are slow rotating and have stellar populations compatible with the control sample at a given velocity dispersion. Remarkably, none of the galaxies with velocity dispersions in excess of 250 km/s have a young stellar component, independent of the merger stage. Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables.

40|$|We report results {{based on}} 35 new spectroscopic redshifts {{obtained}} with the Keck Telescope for field galaxies that also have photometry and morphology from survey images {{taken by the}} refurbished HST. A sample of 24 redshifts for galaxies fainter than I = 22 has a median redshift of z ~ 0. 81. This result is inconsistent with the lower median redshift of z ~ 0. 6 predicted <b>by</b> the ``maximal <b>merger</b> models'' of Carlberg (1996), which otherwise fit existing data. The data match an extrapolation of the CFRS, as well as predictions of certain mild luminosity-evolution models. Nearly half of the redshifts lie in two structures at z ~ 0. 81 and z ~ 1. 0, showing the presence of high density concentrations spanning scales of ~ 1 /h Mpc, i. e., the size of groups. We find emission lines or the presence of possible neighbors in 7 of 9 otherwise luminous galaxies with red central regions at redshifts beyond z ~ 0. 7. We also note a diversity of morphological types among blue galaxies at z ~ 1, including small compact galaxies, ``chains,'' and ``blue nucleated galaxies. '' These morphologies are found among local, but generally less luminous, galaxies. Distant blue galaxies also include apparently normal late-type spirals. These findings could imply modest bursts of star <b>formation</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>mergers</b> or interactions of small, gas-rich galaxies with each other or with larger, well-formed galaxies. This first glimpse of very faint z ~ 1 field galaxies of diverse colors and morphologies suggests that a mixture of physical processes is {{at work in the}} formation and evolution of faint field galaxies.

As in the Hopkins et al. (2006 b) model, we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate. We find that the synthetic U −V and V −J colors of galaxies that had a quasar phase in their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterized by a quiescent stellar population. At z ∼ 2. 6, the observed number and mass density of quiescent red galaxies with M> 4 × 10 10 M ⊙ {{is consistent with the}} model in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in the past.

Blue-shifted, interstellar Na I absorption is found along {{more of the}} slit than anticipated, exceeding scales of 15 kpc in several systems. If the outflow diverges from the nuclear starburst, the absorbing gas must reach similarly large heights along the sightline in order to cover {{so much of the}} galaxy in projection. If the outflow is launched from a much larger region of the disk, however, then the scale height of the absorbing material can be much lower. The large velocity gradient measured across a few outflows is, in fact, inconsistent with a flow diverging from the central starburst, as angular momentum conservation reduces the rotational velocity of an outflow as it expands. In a few young mergers, where the galactic nuclei are still separated, the spatial gradient of the outflow velocity is shown to be {{similar to that of the}} projected orbital motion across the system.

Such corrugation of the stellar distribution is very rare, and suggests recent <b>formation</b> <b>by</b> several simultaneous <b>mergers.</b> We map the distribution of associated dark matter, using new Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral field spectroscopy of a gravitationally lensed system threaded through the cluster core.

The best-constrained offset is 1. 62 (- 0. 49) (+ 0. 47) kpc, where the 68 per cent confidence limit includes both statistical error and systematic biases in mass modelling. Such offsets are not seen in field galaxies, but are predicted during the long infall to a cluster, if dark matter self-interactions generate an extra drag force. With such a small physical separation, it is difficult to definitively rule out astrophysical effects operating exclusively in dense cluster core environments - but if interpreted solely as evidence for self-interacting dark matter, this offset implies a cross-section sigma(DM) /(m) similar to (1. 7 +/- 0. 7) x 10 (- 4) cm(2) g(- 1) x (t(infall) / 10 (9) yr) (- 2), where t(infall) is the infall duration...|$|R
