50|$|It was {{required}} that all high-powered satellite broadcasters to use MAC from 1986.

5000|$|This {{article about}} IFA 1993 {{provides}} {{a view of}} the project's status close to its end. It mentions [...] "a special BBC compilation encoded in <b>HD-MAC</b> and replayed from a D1 Video Tape Recorder". Most probably it was a BRR instead, a device that used more modern digital compression to fit HD on a single D-1, and bore no relationship to <b>HD-MAC.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, a {{new high}} {{definition}} broadcasting standard, <b>HD-MAC,</b> was created, offering {{twice the number of}} available scanning lines compared to PAL. As a transitional standard, D2-MAC was established. It had the same number of lines as PAL, but like <b>HD-MAC</b> it was designed for widescreen content. The MAC family of standards was adopted in Europe in 1983, primarily for Direct Broadcasting by Satellite (DBS) services.|$|E
5000|$|E! 95 was a 730 million euros HDTV project, {{which created}} the <b>HD-MAC</b> {{standard}} for high definition television.|$|E
50|$|Hence {{the quality}} of Eureka 95 {{archives}} is higher than what viewers could see at the output of an <b>HD-MAC</b> decoder.|$|E
5000|$|D-MAC {{satellite}} broadcasts {{provided the}} first broadcast sourced wide-screen television in Europe, and <b>HD-MAC</b> provided the first HDTV broadcasts, in 1992.|$|E
50|$|The IBA {{convinced}} the Home Secretary {{to revive the}} DBS project but under different conditions, (broadly based on a report drawn up by John Jackson) by inviting private sector companies {{to apply for a}} new television franchise via satellite, to provide a commercial service on three of the five DBS on 2 April 1986. One of the conditions imposed on applicants by the IBA was that they use a new, untried transmission standard, D-MAC. This standard was part of the European Community’s attempt to promote a high-definition television (HDTV) standard being developed by Philips and other European companies, <b>HD-MAC.</b> <b>HD-MAC</b> was still at the laboratory stage and was incompatible with previous standards: <b>HD-MAC</b> transmissions could not be received by existing television sets, which were based on PAL or SECAM standards in Europe. The conditions to use a High power (230 watts) Satellite was dropped, and no winner was precluded from buying a foreign satellite system.|$|E
50|$|The <b>HD-MAC</b> {{standard}} was abandoned in 1993, {{and since then}} all EU and EBU efforts {{have focused on the}} DVB system (Digital Video Broadcasting), which allows both SDTV and HDTV.|$|E
50|$|The {{visible part}} of the video signal {{provided}} by an <b>HD-MAC</b> receiver was 1152i/25, which exactly doubles the vertical resolution of standard definition. The amount of information is multplied by 4, considering the encoder started its operations from a 1440x1152i/25 sampling grid.|$|E
5000|$|Henri Georges de France (7 September 1911 Paris [...] - [...] 29 April 1986 Paris) was a {{pioneering}} French television inventor. His inventions include the 819 line French standard and the SECAM color system. He was also apparently behind the <b>HD-MAC</b> high-definition standard.|$|E
50|$|An <b>HD-MAC</b> {{videodisc}} prototype {{had been}} designed as well. The version that was presented in 1988 could record 20 mn per side of a 30 cm disc. Bandwidth was 12 MHz and S/N 32 dB. This media was used for several hours at Expo 92.|$|E
50|$|The EBU {{development}} and deployment of B-MAC, D-MAC and much later on <b>HD-MAC</b> were {{made possible by}} Hi-Vision's technical success. In many ways MAC transmission systems are better than MUSE because of the total separation of colour from brightness in the time domain within the MAC signal structure.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1992 Summer Olympics, {{a public}} {{demonstration}} of <b>HD-MAC</b> broadcasting took place. 60 <b>HD-MAC</b> receivers for the Albertville games and 700 for the Barcelona games {{were set up}} in [...] "Eurosites" [...] to show {{the capabilities of the}} standard. (1250) 1152 lines CRT Video projectors were used to create an image a few meters wide. There were some Thomson [...] "Space system" [...] 16/9 CRT TV sets as well. The project sometimes used Rear-projection televisions. In addition, some 80,000 viewers of D2-MAC receivers were also able to watch the channel (though not in HD). It is estimated that 350,000 people across Europe were able to see this demonstration of European HDTV. This project was financed by the EEC. The PAL-converted signal was used by mainstream broadcasters such as SWR, BR et 3Sat.|$|E
50|$|But {{there is}} no real reason for the studio {{equipment}} to be constrained by <b>HD-MAC,</b> as the latter is only a transmission standard, used to convey the HD material from the transmitter to the viewers. Furthermore, technical and financial resources are available to store the HD video with better quality, for editing and archiving.|$|E
5000|$|Like Hi-Vision, <b>HD-MAC</b> {{could not}} be {{transmitted}} in 8 MHz channels without substantial modification [...] - [...] and a severe loss of quality and frame rate. A 6 MHz version Hi-Vision was experimented with in the US, but it too had severe quality problems so the FCC never fully sanctioned its use as a domestic terrestrial television transmission standard.|$|E
50|$|PALplus (or PAL+) is an {{analogue}} {{television broadcasting}} system aimed {{to improve and}} enhance the PAL format while remaining compatible with existing television receivers. It followed experiences with the <b>HD-MAC</b> and D2-MAC, hybrid analogue-digital formats that were incompatible with PAL receivers. It was developed at the University of Dortmund in Germany, in cooperation with German terrestrial broadcasters and European and Japanese manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>HD-MAC</b> was a {{proposed}} television standard by the European Commission in 1986 (MAC standard) [...] It {{was an early}} attempt by the EEC to provide HDTV in Europe. It was a complex mix of analog signal (Multiplexed Analog Components) multiplexed with digital sound. The video signal (1250 (1152 visible) lines/50 frames in 16:9 aspect ratio) was encoded with a modified D2-MAC encoder.|$|E
50|$|In September, 1988, the Japanese {{performed}} the first High Definition broadcasts {{of the olympic}} games, using their Hi-Vision system (NHK produced material using this format since 1982). In that same month of September, Europe showed {{for the first time}} a credible alternative, namely a complete <b>HD-MAC</b> broadcasting chain, at IBC 88 in Brighton. This show included the first progressive scan HD video camera protoTypes (Thomson/LER).|$|E
50|$|<b>HD-MAC</b> was a {{proposed}} broadcast television systems standard by the European Commission in 1986 (MAC standard), {{a part of}} Eureka 95 project. It is an early attempt by the EEC to provide High-definition television (HDTV) in Europe. It is a complex mix of analogue signal (Multiplexed Analogue Components), multiplexed with digital sound, and assistance data for decoding (DATV). The video signal (1250 (1152 visible) lines/50 fields per second in 16:9 aspect ratio) was encoded with a modified D2-MAC encoder.|$|E
50|$|Experience was gained on {{important}} building blocks like HD digital recording, digital processing including motion compensation, HD CCD cameras, {{and also in}} factors driving acceptance or rejection of a new format by the professionals, {{and all of that}} was put to good use in the subsequent Digital Video Broadcasting project which, in contrast to <b>HD-MAC,</b> is a great worldwide success. Despite early claims by competitors that it could not do HD, it was soon deployed in Australia for just that purpose.|$|E
50|$|On {{the studio}} and {{production}} side, it was entirely different. <b>HD-MAC</b> bandwidth reduction techniques bring the HD pixel rate down {{to the level of}} SD. So in theory, it would have been possible to use an SD digital video recorder, assuming it provides enough room for the DATV assistance stream, which requires less than 1.1 Mbit/s. SD video using 4:2:0 format (12 bits per pixel) needs 720x576x25x12 Mbit/s, which is slightly less than 125 Mbit/s, to be compared with the 270 Mbit/s available from a D-1 machine.|$|E
50|$|The first HDTV {{transmissions}} in Europe, albeit not direct-to-home, {{began in}} 1990, when the Italian broadcaster RAI used the <b>HD-MAC</b> and MUSE HDTV technologies to broadcast the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The matches were shown in 8 cinemas in Italy, where the tournament was played, and 2 in Spain. The connection with Spain was made via the Olympus satellite link from Rome to Barcelona {{and then with}} a fiber optic connection from Barcelona to Madrid. After some HDTV transmissions in Europe the standard was abandoned in the mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|Work on <b>HD-MAC</b> {{specification}} started officially in May 1986. The {{purpose was}} to react against a Japanese proposal, supported by the US, which aimed to establish the NHK-designed system as a world standard. Besides preservation of the European electronic industry, {{there was also a}} need to produce a standard that would be compliant with the 50 Hz field frequency systems (used by a large majority of countries in the world). Truth be said, the precisely 60 Hz of the Japanese proposal was also worrying the US, as their NTSC M-based standard definition infrastructure used a practical frequency of 59.94 Hz. This apparently minor difference had the potential for a lot of trouble.|$|E
50|$|PAL/SECAM {{analogue}} SDTV broadcasts use 6-, 7- (VHF), or 8 MHz (UHF). The 819-line (system E) used 14 MHz wide VHF channels. For <b>HD-MAC,</b> {{the transmission}} medium must guarantee a baseband bandwidth {{of at least}} 11.14 MHz. This translates to a 12 MHz channel spacing in cable networks. The specification allows for 8 MHz channels, {{but in this case}} assistance data can no longer be correctly decoded, and it is only possible to extract a standard definition signal, using a D2-MAC receiver. For satellite broadcasting, due to FM modulation spectrum expansion, an entire satellite transponder would be used, resulting in 27 to 36 MHz of bandwidth. The situation is pretty much the same in analogue standard definition : a given transponder can only support one analogue channel. So from this point of view, going to HD does not represent an inconvenience.|$|E

40|$|A constant-luminance-coding (CIELAB) codec is {{presented}} for high-definition TV (HDTV) use that offers {{the possibility of}} enlarging the reproducible color TV spectrum by selecting {{a new set of}} primary colors.

Subjective tests were carried out to investigate the importance of a wider color spectrum and the acceptability of CIELAB coding in a compatible <b>HD-MAC</b> system. It was found that more saturated primaries help to minimize calorimetric distortions if CIELAB coded signals are decoded by a conventional decoder...|$|E

Basic research activities were: improvement of the basic telecines stability; investigation of the principal deviations; extraction of reference points in dependence on the sprockethole and examination of the picture contents. An electronic correction method for the steadiness was developed. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract — Spectrum {{sharing in}} open {{spectrum}} systems is a challenging problem, particularly since users experience dynamic spectrum availabilities that vary {{over time and}} location.
