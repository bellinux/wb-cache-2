5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> that type, but only short-term <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{the only}} natural host of measles virus. <b>Immunity</b> <b>to</b> the disease {{following}} an infection is lifelong; that afforded by vaccination is long term but eventually wanes.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} vaccine are used {{throughout}} the world to combat polio. Both types induce <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> polio, efficiently blocking person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community (so-called herd immunity).|$|E

5|$|VP7 is a {{glycoprotein}} {{that forms}} the outer surface of the virion. Apart from its structural functions, it determines the G-type of the strain and, along with VP4, is involved in <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> infection.|$|E
5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune to disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might bring}} to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms {{that do not}} harm its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E

This Article examines whether exempting those transactions from bankruptcyâ€™s automatic stay, including the stay of foreclosure actions against collateral, is necessary or appropriate {{in order to}} minimize systemic risk...|$|R
50|$|Another {{solution}} implies greater <b>immunities</b> <b>to</b> noises, like a 4-20 mA {{current loop}} or Modbus over RS-485 output, suitable for ambiances with electromagnetic interferences typical of medium-large scale photovoltaic power stations. The equipped electronics often concur to normalize the signal output into a predetermined value and easy {{integration in the}} system's SCADA.|$|R
5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> infection, and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E
5|$|In generic sense, {{vaccination}} {{works by}} priming {{the immune system}} with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune response, via use of an infectious agent, is known as immunization. The development of <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> polio efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community.|$|E
5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that {{the cells of the}} innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> the host.|$|E

5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke an immune {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics {{have no effect on}} viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E
5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E

5000|$|In 1983, President Ronald Reagan {{extended}} certain {{benefits to}} Interpol. Some of these benefits included immunity from lawsuits and prosecution. Likewise, in 2009, President Barack Obama granted certain benefits {{found in the}} International Organizations <b>Immunities</b> Act <b>to</b> International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). Conservative bloggers and people such as former Speaker Newt Gingrich {{did not support the}} President extending privileges, exemptions, and <b>immunities</b> <b>to</b> Interpol. Conservative bloggers claimed that by increasing the privileges and immunities Interpol received, the President was allowing an international police to reign freely without legal restraint. They also believe that it is a plot to allow international courts to arrest and prosecute American officials.|$|R

5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E
5|$|Despite its toxicity, T.floccosus {{is one of}} the ten wild {{mushrooms}} most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in Meghalaya, northeast India, and is highly regarded by the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal. What is not known is whether the Indian populations of T.floccosus are nontoxic, or whether the local people have developed an <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> it. It is also enjoyed in Mexico. American mycologist David Arora reported that some enjoyed it while he felt it had a strong sour taste.|$|E
5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision.

Some lack <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Kathaâ€™s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E

King Charles I of Hungary granted <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> the Saxon communities of BirthÃ¤lm (Berethalom, Biertan), Kleinschelken (Kisselyk, Åžeica MicÄƒ), and Mediasch (Medgyes, MediaÈ™) in 1315, but the same monarch annulled other communities' similar privileges in 1324. Altrodenau (Radna, Rodna) and Bistritz (Beszterce, BistriÈ›a) received immunity in 1366.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Maurice Brodie, a {{research}} assistant at New York University, attempted to produce a formaldehyde-killed polio vaccine from ground-up monkey spinal cords. His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself {{and several of his}} assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. Many of these children developed allergic reactions, but none developed <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a vaccine that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur gave <b>immunity</b> <b>to</b> Shiro Ishii {{and other}} members of the {{bacteriological}} research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including Princes Chichibu, Asaka, Takeda, Higashikuni and Fushimi, from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary. In doing so, he ignored the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency.|$|E
