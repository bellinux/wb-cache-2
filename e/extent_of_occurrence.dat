5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|The grey-necked wood rail or grey-cowled wood rail (Aramides cajaneus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Rallidae, the rails. It lives {{primarily}} in the forests, mangroves, and swamps of Central and South America. Of the two subspecies, A. c. avicenniae is found in southeastern Brazil, while the nominate is found throughout {{the portion of the}} range not occupied by the other subspecies. The species as a whole is usually found at elevations from sea level to , although some have been found above that. This bird's large <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> along with its population is why it is considered to be least-concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In some places, it is occasionally hunted and kept for food.|$|E

25|$|The {{rufous-naped lark}} {{is found in}} many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It has a very large but {{discontinuous}} range, with an estimated global <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> of 5,600,000km2. Its range is believed to be increasingly fragmented in the north, from which a declining population is inferred. The southern African population has not contracted in range or abundance, save for areas of extensive cultivation or urbanization. Livestock ranching is believed to have created bare patches in grasslands, which they favour. The populations of southern Mozambique and Swaziland have been estimated at >50,000 and 100,000 individuals respectively.|$|E
25|$|In much of macroecology, {{the use of}} EOO as {{a measure}} of range size may be {{appropriate}}; however, AOO is a more appropriate measure when evaluating O–A relationships. In macroecological investigations that are primarily biogeographical in nature, the variables of interest can be expected to vary most from one <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> to the opposite, and less so through discontinuities contained within the total EOO. However, when investigating O-A relationships, the area occupied by a species is the variable of interest, and the inclusion of discontinuities within the EOO could significantly influence results. In the extreme case where occupied habitats are distributed at random throughout the EOO, a relationship between abundance and range size (EOO) would not be expected. Because O–A relationships have strong conservation implications, Gaston and Fuller have argued that clear distinctions need to be made as to the purpose of the EOO and AOO as measures of range size, and that in association with O-A relationships the AOO is the more useful measure of species abundance.|$|E
40|$|The greater {{latitudinal}} <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> species towards higher latitudes {{has been}} attributed to the broadening of physiological tolerances with latitude as a result of increases in climatic variation. While there is some support for such patterns in climate, the physiological tolerances of species across large lati-tudinal gradients have seldom been assessed. Here we report ¢ndings for insects based on published upper and lower lethal temperature data. The upper thermal limits show little geographical variation. In contrast, the lower bounds of supercooling points and lower lethal temperatures do indeed decline with latitude. However, {{this is not the case}} for the upper bounds, leading to an increase in the variation in lower lethal limits with latitude. These results provide some support for the physiological tolerance assumption associated with Rapoport’s rule, but highlight the need for coupled data on species tolerances and range size...|$|R
40|$|First {{described}} in 1998, the marsh tapaculo (Scytalopus iraiensis) is an endangered bird {{of the family}} Rhinocryptidae. It is endemic to Brazil and is restricted to the wet flood plains of rivers and streams. Due to its cryptic habits and environments <b>of</b> <b>occurrence,</b> information available on its biology, natural history and distribution is scarce. We compiled occurrence records (99 records), delimited the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences</b> (296, 584 km 2), calculated the area of occupancy (84 km 2), estimated territory size (5, 313 ± 1, 201 m 2 per pair), population density (3. 76 ± 0. 85 individuals per hectare), and population size (31, 584 ± 7, 140 mature individuals) of marsh tapaculo. The species was recorded in marshes associated to four types of vegetation and in four ecological zones. This new information is extremely important to support revaluation of the species’ threat category and to enhance knowledge about this endemic and little known bird from Brazil...|$|R
40|$|The {{geographic}} {{ranges of}} the 34 native species of freshwater crayfish known from Tasmania are mapped and described from extensive museum collections. <b>Extents</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> range from over 30, 000 to about 5 km E- 2 and {{species in the}} open water genus Astacopsis have significantly greater ranges than the burrowing species {{in one of two}} undescribed genera within Parastacoides. Species living in Type 1 burrows associated with open water have significantly larger ranges than those found in Type 2, water table, burrows. Many species show mosaic istributions with either parapatric boundaries, or narrow zones of geographic overlap, or sympatric contact zones. In most cases, closely related species are also geographically close; exceptions to this trend may represent older clades, some members of which have suffered range contractions. The Tasmanian crayfish fauna presents a useful opportunity to examine questions about geographic ranges...|$|R
25|$|The {{definition}} of range is further confounded by how the total realized range size is measured. There {{are two types}} of measurements commonly in use, the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> (EOO) and the area of occupancy (AOO) (see also the Scaling pattern of occupancy). The EOO can best be thought of as the minimum convex polygon encompassing all known normal occurrences of a particular species, and is the measure of range most commonly found in field guides. The AOO is the subset of the EOO where the species actually occurs. In essence, the AOO acknowledges that there are holes in the distribution of a species within its EOO, and attempts to correct for these vacancies. A common way to describe the AOO of a species is to divide the study region into a matrix of cells and record if the species is present in or absent from each cell. For example, in describing O–A relationships for common British birds, Quinn et al. found that the occupancy at the finest resolution (10 x 10km squares) best explained abundance patterns. In a similar manner, Zuckerberg et al. used Breeding Bird Atlas data measured on cells 5×5km to describe breeding bird occupancy in New York State.|$|E
500|$|This rail is {{considered}} to be a least-concern species, according to the IUCN.

40|$|Magister Artium - MAThis mini-thesis aims {{to gauge}} the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrences</b> <b>of</b> suicidal ideations among a sample of first-year {{students}} at the University of the Western Cape. The study investigates whether differences among those with suicidal ideations exist with respect to gender, race, religious affiliation and faculty for which students are registered. The sample {{of the current study}} consisted of 161 students from two first year Psychology classes at the University of the Western Cape. Non-probability convenience sampling was used whereby only those students who attended the two lectures were asked to participate in the current study. Students self-completed a questionnaire which included a brief demographic section and a section with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). The overall <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> suicidal ideations in the chosen sample was 26 %. No significant differences among those with suicidal ideations in terms of gender, race, religion or faculty were observed. The results of this study highlight the importance of establishing prevention and intervention programmes on university campuses to create more awareness about suicide and offer more education to students on this topic in general, as well as to specifically offer counselling and support to students suffering from suicidal ideations...|$|R

40|$|Species range maps {{based on}} <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> (EOO maps) {{have become the}} basis for many {{analyses}} in broad-scale ecology and conservation. Nevertheless, EOO maps are usually highly interpolated and overestimate small-scale occurrence, which may bias research outcomes. We evaluated geographical range overestimation and its potential ecological causes for 1158 bird species by quantifying EOO map occurrence across 4040 well-studied survey locations in Australia, North America, and southern Africa at the scale of 80 - 742 km(2). Most species occurred in only 40 - 70 % of the range indicated by their EOO maps. The observed proportional range overestimation affected the range-size frequency distribution, indicating that species are more range-restricted than suggested by EOO maps. The EOO maps most strongly overestimated the distribution of narrow-ranging species and ecological specialists with narrow diet and habitat breadth. These relationships support basic ecological predictions {{about the relationship between}} niche breadth and the fine-scale <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> species. Consequently, at-risk species were subject to particularly high proportional range overestimation, on average 62 % compared with 37 % of nonthreatened species. These trends affect broad-scale ecological analyses and species conservation assessments, which will benefit from a careful consideration of potential biases introduced by range overestimation...|$|R

30|$|The {{habitat of}} P. peridoticola lies entirely in Kinabalu Park (an IUCN Category II National Park) {{and it is}} {{therefore}} statutorily protected.

However, {{as there is no}} currently available evidence of decline or fluctuations in the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> its <b>occurrence</b> (EOO), the area <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> (AOO), or the number of mature individuals, the conservation status of the species is currently classified as ‘Near Threatened’ (IUCN 2001).|$|R
40|$|According to {{ecological}} theory, the {{coexistence of}} competitors in patchy environments may be facilitated by hierarchical spatial segregation along axes of environmental variation, but empirical evidence is limited. Cabrera and water voles show a metapopulation-like structure in Mediterranean farmland, {{where they are}} known to segregate along space, habitat, and time axes within habitat patches. Here, we assess whether segregation also occurs among and within landscapes, and how this is influenced by patch-network and matrix composition. We surveyed 75 landscapes, each covering 78 ha, where we mapped all habitat patches potentially suitable for Cabrera and water voles, and the area effectively occupied by each species (<b>extent</b> <b>of</b> occupancy). The relatively large water vole tended to be the sole occupant of landscapes with high habitat amount but relatively low patch density (i. e., with a few large patches), and with a predominantly agricultural matrix, whereas landscapes with high patch density (i. e.,many small patches) and low agricultural cover, tended to be occupied exclusively by the small Cabrera vole. The two species tended to co-occur in landscapes with intermediate patch-network and matrix characteristics, though their <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> <b>occurrence</b> were negatively correlated after controlling for environmental effects. In combination with our previous studies on the Cabrera-water vole system, these findings illustrated empirically the <b>occurrence</b> <b>of</b> hierarchical spatial segregation, ranging from withinpatches to among-landscapes. Overall, our study suggests that recognizing the hierarchical nature of spatial segregation patterns and their major environmental drivers should enhance our understanding of species coexistence in patchy environments...|$|R
