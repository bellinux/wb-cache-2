40|$|The phosphoinositide 3 -kinase γ (PI 3 Kγ) plays a {{major role}} in {{leukocyte}} recruitment during acute inflammation and has been proposed to inhibit classical macrophage activation by driving <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>gene</b> expression. PI 3 Kγ plays an important role in diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In seeking to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we showed that PI 3 Kγ action in high-fat diet–induced inflammation and insulin resistance depended largely on its role in the control of adiposity, which was due to PI 3 Kγ activity in a nonhematopoietic cell type. However, PI 3 Kγ activity in leukocytes was required for efficient neutrophil recruitment to adipose tissue. Neutrophil recruitment was correlated with proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages in adipose tissue, which triggered insulin resistance early during the development of obesity. Our data challenge the concept that PI 3 Kγ is a general suppressor of classical macrophage activation and indicate that PI 3 Kγ controls macrophage gene expression by non–cell-autonomous mechanisms, the outcome of which is context-dependent...|$|E
40|$|IL- 10 is an {{immunomodulatory}} cytokine {{that plays}} an obligate role in preventing spontaneous enterocolitis in mice. However, {{little is known}} about IL- 10 function in the human intestinal mucosa. We showed here that IL- 10 was constitutively expressed and secreted by the human normal colonic mucosa, including epithelial cells. Depletion of IL- 10 in mucosal explants induced both downregulation of the IL- 10 -inducible, <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>gene</b> BCL 3 and upregulation of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL- 17. Interestingly, TGF-beta blockade also strongly induced IFN-gamma production. In addition, the high levels of IFN-gamma produced upon IL- 10 depletion were responsible for surface epithelium damage and crypt loss, mainly by apoptosis. Polymyxin B, used as a scavenger of endogenous LPS, abolished both IFN-gamma production and epithelial barrier disruption. Finally, adding a commensal bacteria strain to mucosa explant cultures depleted of both IL- 10 and LPS reproduced the ability of endogenous LPS to induce IFN-gamma secretion. These findings demonstrate that IL- 10 ablation leads to an endogenous IFN-gamma-mediated inflammatory response via LPS from commensal bacteria in the human colonic mucosa. We also found that both IL- 10 and TGF-beta play crucial roles in maintaining human colonic mucosa homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Overview summary Adenoviral vectors are {{efficient}} for in vivo {{delivery of}} genes {{to a wide}} variety of tissue types, whereas the duration of expression is limited by the potent adenovirus-specific immune response directed to the infected cell. In this study, we demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and expression of viral interleukin- 10 (vIL- 10) not only prolongs murine cardiac allograft survival, but also inhibits the immune response toward adenoviral antigens, and thereby improves the persistence of the vector and extends transgene expression. These findings could be used to design a new generation of adenoviral vector that expresses both an <b>immunosuppressive</b> cytokine <b>gene</b> and another gene of interest. This strategy should have general application in many gene therapy settings other than transplantation. Nonetheless, although the efficacy of adenoviral vectors can be improved by incorporating <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>genes</b> into the vector, there are also nonimmune mechanisms serving to limit vector gene expression...|$|R

40|$|Kidney {{transplantation}} {{is inevitably}} faced with overcoming the immune {{response to the}} grafted organ, necessitating immunosuppressive therapy. Further, the immunogenicity of the graft is augmented by the initial ischemia-reperfusion injury, which negatively influences both acute and chronic renal graft failure. Because of its systemic nature, current immune suppression is a trade-off of efficacy against side-effects. Local, rather than generalized, immunosuppression or tolerogenic strategies may improve graft survival {{and quality of life}} of the transplanted patients. Targeted (over) expression of molecules that are able to modulate the immune reaction locally, in the graft, offers a strategy to shield the transplanted kidney against rejection, while leaving the immune system virtually unaffected. Gene therapeutic approaches may transform the theory of local immune suppression into reality. In addition, gene therapy may be instrumental in expanding the donor pool from non-heart beating donors and ameliorate ischemia-reperfusion injury in both living-related as well as deceased kidney transplantation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate (1) the potential of gene therapy with Interleukin- 13, an immunomodulatory and cytoptotective cytokine, to mitigate renal I/R injury and acute kidney transplant rejection and (2) the potential of local <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>gene</b> therapy in kidney transplantation.

40|$|Perivascular {{adipose tissue}} (PVAT) {{surrounds}} {{blood vessels and}} releases paracrine factors, such as cytokines, which regulate local inflammation. The inflammatory state of PVAT has {{an important role in}} vascular disease; a pro-inflammatory state has been related with atherosclerosis development, whereas an anti-inflammatory one is protective. Cold exposure beneficially affects immune responses and, could thus impact the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of one-week of cold exposure at 4 °C of ferrets on aortic PVAT (aPVAT) versus subcutaneous adipose tissue. Ferrets were used because of the similarity of their adipose tissues to those of humans. A ferret-specific Agilent microarray was designed to cover the complete ferret genome and global gene expression analysis was performed. The data showed that cold exposure altered gene expression mainly in aPVAT. Most of the regulated genes were associated with cell cycle, immune response and gene expression regulation, and were mainly down-regulated. Regarding the effects on immune response, cold acclimation decreased the expression of genes involved in antigen recognition and presentation, cytokine signalling and immune system maturation and activation. This <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>gene</b> expression pattern was depot-specific, as it was not observed in the inguinal subcutaneous depot. Interestingly, this depression in immune response related genes was also evident in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In conclusion, these results reveal that cold acclimation produces an inhibition of immune response-related pathways in aPVAT, reflected in PBMC, indicative of an anti-inflammatory response, which can potentially be exploited for the enhancement or maintenance of cardiovascular health. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective:Allograft-targeted <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>gene</b> therapy may inhibit {{recipient}} immune activation {{and provide}} an alternative to systemic immunosuppression. We studied the optimal technique and efficacy of intracoronary gene transfer of viral interleukin- 10 and human transforming growth factor–β 1 in a rabbit model of heterotopic heart transplantation. Methods: Replication-defective adenoviral vectors were constructed, expressing viral interleukin- 10 (AdSvIL 10) or transforming growth factor–β 1 (AdCMVTGF-β 1). Intracoronary delivery of vectors was accomplished ex vivo by either bolus injection or slow infusion. The allografts were implanted heterotopically in recipient rabbits and collected 4 days after the operation. Vector dose was 4 × 109 to 6 × 1010 pfu/gm of donor heart. Transfer was confirmed by DNA amplification for both genes. Gene product expression in tissue was quantified by immunoassay and visualized by immunohistochemical staining. Results: Allograft viral uptake was only 9. 9 % ± 2. 4 % with bolus injection, but increased to 80. 5 % ± 6. 8 % at 1 ml/min infusion rate (p = 5 × 10 – 14). Uptake ratio was not affected by vector quantity or slower infusion rates. Transforming growth factor–β 1 was consistently detected in allografts infected with AdCMVTGF-β 1, but not with control adenovirus or AdSvIL 10. Expression was proportional to infused vector quantity and reached 10 ng/gm of allograft at infused 1010 pfu/gm. Transforming growth factor–β 1 was also detected in recipient's serum at less than 1 ng/ml. Viral interleukin- 10 was detected in minor amounts only (< 1 ng/gm) in allografts infected with AdvIL 10 up to 5 × 1010 pfu/gm. Nevertheless, it was detected in recipient serum at concentrations up to 0. 4 ng/ml. Conclusions: Intracoronary gene transfer of immunosuppressive cytokines to cardiac allografts during cold preservation is feasible. Slow infusion is superior to bolus injection. In vivo effects on allograft rejection remain to be determined. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 113 : 1059 - 67...|$|E
40|$|Although {{adenoviral}} vectors {{are attractive}} for gene transfer, their effectiveness {{is limited by}} host antiviral im-m u n e responses. In this study, w e determined if host antiallograft and antiviral immunity could be dimin-ished with an adenoviral vector encoding the immunosuppressive cytokine viral interleukin- 10 (vIL-IO). AdSV 40 vIL- 10, a vIL- 10 -expressing adenoviral vector with an SV 40 promoter, induced significant prolonga-tion of murine cardiac allograft survival to 32. 2 ± 1. 7 days compared to 14. 2 ± L O days for controls (p < O. OI). This effect was specific for vIL-IO encoding vector and could be inhibited by anti-vIL- 10 monoclonal antibody (m A b). In vivo administration of adenovirus facilitated the generation of adenovirus-specific cyto-toxic T lymphocytes (CTL), whereas treatment vdth AdSV 40 vIL- 10 prevented C T L priming and generation of virus-specific immunity. AdSV 40 vIL-I 0 also induced extended expression of a / 3 -galactosidase reporter from a co-injected LacZ-encoding adenoviral vector. These results demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and expression of vIL- 10 prolong allograft survival and inhibit the immune response to adenoviral antigens, thereby improving {{the persistence of the}} vector and extending transgene expression.

40|$|Treatment of {{autoimmune}} diseases {{remains a}} challenge for immunological research. An ideal therapy should inhibit the immune reaction against the diseased organ and leave {{the rest of the}} immune response intact. Our previous studies showed that donor-derived dendritic cells (DCs) treated in vitro with mitomycin C (MMC) suppress rat heart allograft rejection if injected into recipients before transplantation. Here we analyze their efficacy in controlling autoimmunity. MMC-DCs loaded with myelin-basic-protein (MBP) inhibited specific T cells derived from multiple sclerosis patients in vitro. If coincubated with MMC-DCs, T cells were arrested in the G 0 /G 1 cell cycle phase. Microarray gene scan showed that MMC influences the expression of 116 genes in DCs, one main cluster comprising apoptotic and the second cluster <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>genes.</b> Apparently, the combination of apoptosis with expression of tolerogenic molecules renders MMC-DCs suppressive. MBP-loaded MMC-DCs also inhibited mouse T cells in vitro and, in contrast to MBP-loaded naïve DCs, did not induce experimental autoimmune encephalitis. Most importantly, mice vaccinated with inhibitory DCs became resistant to the disease. Whereas {{this is not the first}} report on generation of suppressive DCs, it delineates a method using a clinically approved drug at nontoxic concentrations, which yields irreversibly changed DCs, effective across species in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) support tumor {{growth by}} {{promoting}} angiogenesis and suppressing antitumor immune responses. CSF- 1 receptor (CSF 1 R) signaling {{is important for}} the recruitment of CD 11 b+F 4 / 80 + tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and contributes to myeloid cell-mediated angiogenesis. However, the impact of the CSF 1 R signaling pathway on other TIM subsets, including CD 11 b+Gr- 1 + myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), is unknown. Tumor-infiltrating MDSCs have also been shown to contribute to tumor angiogenesis and have recently been implicated in tumor resistance to antiangiogenic therapy, yet their precise involvement in these processes is not well understood. Here, we use the selective pharmacologic inhibitor of CSF 1 R signaling, GW 2580, to demonstrate that CSF- 1 regulates the tumor recruitment of CD 11 b+Gr- 1 loLy 6 Chi mononuclear MDSCs. Targeting these TIM subsets inhibits tumor angiogenesis associated with reduced expression of proangiogenic and <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>genes.</b> Combination therapy using GW 2580 with an anti–VEGFR- 2 antibody synergistically suppresses tumor growth and severely impairs tumor angiogenesis along with reverting at least one TIM-mediated antiangiogenic compensatory mechanism involving MMP- 9. These data highlight the importance of CSF 1 R signaling in the recruitment and function of distinct TIM subsets, including MDSCs, and validate the benefits of targeting CSF 1 R signaling in combination with antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of solid cancers...|$|R
40|$|Cowpox virus (CPXV), a close {{relative}} of variola virus, the orthopoxvirus that causes smallpox, can suppress the immune system through a large array of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>gene</b> products. We developed a murine model in which DO 11. 10 T cells specific for an OVA peptide were transferred into BALB/c mice {{to assess the impact}} of a pulmonary CPXV infection on DO 11. 10 T cell proliferation in lung draining lymph nodes following intranasal OVA peptide delivery. High and low-dose CPXV infections were compared. Both doses lead to clinical illness including ruffled coat and weight loss, but the high dose is lethal and is characterized by viral dissemination to the spleen. A high-dose infection reduced DO 11. 10 T cell proliferation, but a low-dose infection did not. At the time that proliferation of T cells was assessed (6 d post infection), 15 ± 1 % of lung dendritic cells (DCs) were infected at the high-dose, but only 5 ± 1 % of DCs at the low-dose. At both doses, infected and uninfected lung DCs had decreased expression of MHC class II and the co-stimulatory molecules CD 80 and CD 86. DCs and T cells were not infected in the lymph nodes at either dose, but lymph node DCs also showed a reduction in antigen-presenting molecules. We speculated that the lung microenvironment created by infection, rather than direct infection of the DCs, suppressed DC antigen-specific T cell activation. In support, we found that alveolar lavage fluid and supernatant derived from lung homogenates from infected mice suppressed the function of uninfected lung DCs in vitro. Furthermore, the suppressive activity was more highly concentrated in lungs from high-dose infected mice. Cytokine analysis revealed the presence of IL- 10, an immunosuppressive cytokine, in lung supernatants in mice receiving a high-dose of CPXV. We used IL- 10 knockout mice in our adoptive transfer model to examine a role for IL- 10 in T cell suppression in the lymph nodes. However, the knockout mice behaved similarly to BALB/c, with lack of DO 11. 10 T cell proliferation in the high-dose, but not the low-dose, and concluded IL- 10 does not prevent T cell proliferation at the high-dose. Finally, we examined a possible virally encoded immunomodulatory protein, a soluble IFNγ receptor (IFNR), to determine if sequestration of host-produced IFNγ contributed to the immune suppression seen in the high-dose. A mutant virus lacking the IFNR behaved similarly to wild-type virus, and the survival and day 6 lung titers were comparable. Other virally encoded factors may play a role in suppressing DO 11. 10 T cell proliferation and should be examined in future experiments. These studies strongly suggest that orthopoxvirus infections create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that compromises the host pulmonary immune responses.

40|$|Untreated HIV- 1 {{infection}} progresses through {{acute and}} asymptomatic stages to AIDS. Although {{each of the}} three stages has well-known clinical, virologic, and immunologic characteristics, much less is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying each stage. In this study, we report lymphatic tissue microarray analyses, revealing for the first time stage-specific patterns of gene expression during HIV- 1 infection. We show that although there is a common set of key genes with altered expression throughout all stages, each stage has a unique gene expression signature. The acute stage is most notably characterized by increased expression of hundreds of genes involved in immune activation, innate immune defenses (e. g., RIG- 1, MDA- 5, TLR 7 and TLR 8, PKR, APOBEC 3 B, 3 F, 3 G), adaptive immunity, and in the proapoptotic Fas-Fas ligand pathway. Yet, quite strikingly, the expression of nearly all acute stage genes return to baseline levels in the asymptomatic stage, accompanying partial control of infection. This transition from acute to asymptomatic stage is tied to increased expression of a diverse array of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>genes</b> (e. g., CLEC 12 B, ILT 4, galectin- 3, CD 160, BCMA, FGL 2, LAG 3, GPNMB). In the AIDS stage, decreased expression of numerous genes involved in T cell signaling identifies genes contributing to T cell dysfunction.

Results We compared the transduction efficiency of AAV 2 vectors with an AAV 2 capsid (AAV 2 / 2) to AAV 2 vectors pseudotyped with AAV 5 (AAV 2 / 5), AAV 8 (AAV 2 / 8) or bovine adeno-associated virus (BAAV) capsids, or an AAV 2 capsid with an insertion of the low density lipoprotein receptor ligand from apolipoprotein E (AAV 2 apoE), on cultured islets, {{in the presence of}} helper adenovirus infection to speed expression of a GFP transgene. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were used. The AAV 2 / 5 vector was superior to AAV 2 / 2 and AAV 2 / 8 in rat islets. Flow cytometry indicated AAV 2 / 5 -mediated gene expression in approximately 9 % of rat islet cells and almost 12 % of insulin-positive cells. The AAV 2 / 8 vector had a higher dependence on the helper virus multiplicity of infection than the AAV 2 / 5 vector. In addition, the BAAV and AAV 2 apoE vectors were superior to AAV 2 / 2 for transducing rat islets. Rat islets (300 per mouse) transduced with an AAV 2 / 5 vector harboring the immunosuppressive transgene, tgfβ 1, retain the ability to correct hyperglycemia when transplanted into immune-deficient diabetic mice.

BackgroundManipulation of the graft with <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>genes</b> represents a novel approach to overcome the toxicity of immunosuppressants currently used to prevent acute rejection. Here we compared the efficiency of a non-viral versus a viral technique of gene transfer to the kidney in the setting of isotransplantation and evaluated whether transfection with adenovirus encoding CTLA 4 Ig prolonged allograft survival. MethodsDonor rat kidneys were perfused with a medium containing the cationic polymer polyethylenimine PEI 25 k complexed to a vector coding for the β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene or with a replication-deficient adenovirus encoding the β-gal gene (AdCMVβ-gal; 1 × 109 pfu) before isotransplantation. In another set of experiments, donor kidneys were perfused with an adenovirus encoding the murine CTLA 4 Ig gene (AdmCTLA 4 Ig; 1 x 109 pfu) before allotransplantation. ResultsPerfusion with PEI/DNA complexes resulted in large areas of hypoperfusion, histology showed glomerular and tubular injury, capillary thrombosis, and complement activation. Reperfusion with lower PEI/DNA ratio was possible but no detectable transfection observed. In animals receiving adenovirus, β-gal activity increased with time and localized mainly in proximal and distal tubular cells as documented by β-gal histochemistry and in situ hybridization. Adenovirus-mediated transduction of CTLA 4 Ig, a recombinant fusion protein that blocks T cell activation, resulted in a prolonged allograft survival. ConclusionsThe toxic effects observed in kidneys exposed to PEI 25 k prevent any future possibility of their use in clinical transplantation. By contrast, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to the kidney offers exciting perspectives for the future of transplant medicine. Transducing the graft with a gene encoding CTLA 4 Ig effectively prolongs renal graft survival and induces sustained unresponsiveness to the donor antigens without the need of immunosuppression...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and aims: Helicobacter pylori {{establishes}} a chronic {{infection in the}} stomach of almost half the world's population. A small proportion of patients go on to develop peptic ulcer disease {{and in some cases}} gastric cancer. Numerous factors influence the outcome of infection, including host, bacterial and environmental factors. The impact of bacterial colonisation density on the outcome of disease is poorly understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the determinants of bacterial density and the implications in disease. Methods: Gastric biopsies were collected from 50 H. pylori infected patients attending the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham for a routine upper GI endoscopy. Patient disease status was determined as having gastritis, duodenal ulcer disease (DUD), or gastric ulcer disease (GUD). Histological analysis for inflammation, activity, H. pylori density, atrophy and intestinal metaplasia were assessed according to the Sydney scoring system. Bacterial strains were cultured from gastric biopsies. Isolated bacterial DNA was used for genotyping strain virulence for CagA, VacA and DupA status. In order to determine accurate levels of colonisation in gastric tissue samples, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was developed based on the quantification of H. pylori 16 S rRNA copy number, relative to the number of human GAPDH copy numbers. Quantification of IL 8, ILIO, TGFß, FOXP 3, h 8, Dl and LL 37 mRNA levels in gastric tissue were assessed by real-time RTPCR. The impact of host factors on bacterial density was assessed in vitro using H. pylori infected or uninfected AGS gastric epithelial cells, treated with recombinant cytokine. Colony forming units (CFUs) were enumerated in culture suspensions. The in vitro model was also used to examine the impact of cagA, cage, and vacA isogenic deletion mutant strains on bacterial density. Also, h, 8 D 1 expression levels were measured in culture suspensions, and IL- 8 secretion levels in were assessed by ELISA. Results and conclusions: The pattern of colonisation in the gastric mucosa was found to be associated with the disease profile that develops, with an antral-predominant colonisation was associated with DUD, whereas corpus-predominant colonisation was associated with GUD. Bacterial factors that may drive the pattern of bacterial density in the stomach were then investigated, and strains expressing the dupA virulence factor were coincident with antral-predominant colonisation in the gastric mucosa. cagA and vacA were not found to be associated with bacterial density in vivo or in vitro. To assess the relationship between colonisation density and the host response, firstly IL 8 mRNA expression levels were measured in gastric biopsies. An inverse relationship between bacterial load and expression of this pro-inflammatory cytokine was observed, but only at high IL 8 expression levels and with higher H. pylori density. The inflammatory cytokines IL- 10, TNFa, IL- 17 and IL- 22 did not impact CFU counts in vitro. No association was observed between bacterial load and expression levels of the <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>genes</b> ILIO, TGFBI and FOXP 3. However, increased CFU counts were found on treatment of H. pylori infected AGS cells with recombinant IL- 10 and TGFß in vitro. Also, reduced expression of these <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>genes</b> was associated with the presence of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. In addition, ILIO and FOXP 3 expression levels were negatively associated with mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration. Reduced expression levels of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) defensin hß, Dl were found with H. pylori infection in vivo and in vitro, and a negative association between hßDl expression and bacterial load was observed in vivo. A small increase in hßDl expression was observed in AGS cells infected with the cagPAI defective mutant strain in comparison to the wild type strain, suggesting a possible role for the CagPAI in modulating hßDl expression. In contrast, expression levels of the antimicrobial peptide LL 37 were upregulated in the H. Mori infected gastric mucosa. In conclusion, the localisation of H. pylori in the gastric mucosa is associated with the disease profile that develops in the stomach. The patterns of colonisation observed may be influenced by the dupA virulence determinant. Host immune responses, were not associated with colonisation density. However, increased Treg response may be associated with protecting the host from the deleterious effects of inflammation. The direct modulation of bacterial load may be regulated by AMPs. In the H. pylori infected mucosa, reduced hßDl expression was observed which may assist persistent colonisation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Thus, early viral gene transcription is responsible for MVA-triggered NF-??B activation. To identify the viral ORF(s) whose products activate NF-??B during MVA infection, we first tested a VACV plasmid library to identify which viral ORF could activate a NF-??B-controlled firefly luciferase gene. We then utilized chemically synthesized siRNAs, testing the effect of silencing each of the viral genes individually on MVA-induced NF-??B activation in these cells. Three viral genes (C 11 R, E 7 R, and A 35 R) have been identified whose silencing can prevent MVA-induced ERK 1 / 2 activation, which occurs upstream of NF-??B activation. The product of C 11 R, a viral growth factor protein, is capable of inducing ERK 1 / 2 and NF-??B activation in the host 293 T cells when it is expressed ectopically. Furthermore, infection with a deletion mutant virus, MVA??C 11 R, resulted in reduced ERK 2 phosphorylation and NF-??B activation compared to cells infected with the parental MVA strain. This reduction was observed in both 293 T cells and in keratenocyte cell line, HaCaT, indicating the C 11 R protein product modulates viral-induced NF-??B activation in multiple cell types.

The application of gene therapy to improve the efficacy and survival of T-cells remains a major goal in the development of an optimal immunotherapeutic strategy and current research indicates that the use of genetically modified T-cells in adoptive transfer is a feasible therapy for the clinic. Immunosuppresive drugs such as rapamycin and CsA inhibit T-cell proliferation and may impair the function and efficacy of adoptively transferred T-cells in vivo. Our objective of this project was to enhance the efficacy and survival of Primary Human T-cells in vitro by modification with a retroviral vector containing an <b>immunosuppressive</b> resistant <b>gene.</b> Cell proliferation experiments using a CFSE cell protein dye elucidated the optimal cell stimulation requirements and the optimal day to target Primary T-cells for retroviral infection. Two distinct retroviral infection systems were established in the laboratory and applied to transduce Kit 225 T-cells, Primary Human T-cells and EBV- Cytotoxic T-cells. These T-cells were modified with a retrovirus to confer rapamycin resistance (pBabe mTOR S 2035 T) or a retrovirus to confer CsA resistance (pBabe CNA V 314 R). The data showed that both the pBabe mTOR S 2035 T virus and the pBabe CNA V 314 R virus could confer immunosuppression resistance in the modified T-cell but that this was not demonstrated for every infection. The data also showed that the modification of Primary Human T-cells with these viruses generated cells with a growth advantage and increased cytokine production compared to Primary T-cells modified with control pBabe puro virus. This suggests that the modification of PBLs with the <b>immunosuppressive</b> resistance <b>genes</b> mTOR S 2035 T or CNA V 314 R may be a useful strategy to improve the efficacy and function of T-cells. During the course of this project, experiments also showed that the PI 3 -Kinase inhibitor LY 294002 and rapamycin co-operate to inhibit T-cell proliferation. Taken together, the results demonstrated in this project highlight the importance of the TOR and calcineurin pathways in regulating T-cell proliferation, and suggest strategies to improve both immunosuppression and cellular immunotherapeutic regimes...|$|R
40|$|Xeno{{transplantation}}, the transplantation {{of living}} organs, tissues, or cells from one species to another, {{is viewed as}} a potential solution to the existing shortage of human organs for transplantation. While whole-organ xenotransplantation is still in the preclinical stage, cellular xenotransplantation and extracorporeal perfusion applications are showing promise in early clinical trials. Advances in <b>immunosuppressive</b> therapy, <b>gene</b> engineering, and cloning of animals bring a broader array of xenotransplantation protocols closer to clinical trials. Despite several potential advantages over allotransplantation, xenotransplantation encompasses a number of problems. Immunologic rejection remains the primary hindrance. The potential to introduce infections across species barriers, another major concern, is the main focus of this review. Nonhuman primates are unlikely to be a main source for xenotransplantation products despite their phylogenetic proximity to humans. Genetically engineered pigs, bred under special conditions, are currently envisaged as the major source. Thus far, there has been no evidence for human infections caused by pig xenotransplantation products. However, the existence of xenotropic endogenous retroviruses and the clinical evidence of long-lasting porcine cell microchimerism indicate the potential for xenogeneic infections. Thus, further trials should continue under regulatory oversight, with close clinical and laboratory monitoring for potential xenogeneic infections...|$|R
50|$|Microarrays have {{discovered}} gene expression patterns that correlate with antigen-induced activation or anergy in B lymphocytes. Lymphocyte anergy pathways involve induction of some, {{but not all}} of the signaling pathways used during lymphocyte activation. For example, NFAT and MAPK/ERK kinase pathways are expressed in anergic (or “tolerant) cell lines, whereas NF-kB and c-Jun N-terminal kinases pathways are not. Of the 300 genes that were altered in expression after antigen-stimulated naïve B cells, only 8 of these genes were regulated in tolerant B cells. Understanding these “tolerance” pathways have important implications for designing <b>immunosuppressive</b> drugs. These <b>gene</b> expression signatures of tolerant B cells could be used during drug screens to probe for compounds that mimic the functional effects of natural tolerance.|$|R
40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} are common and debilitating, but their severe manifestations {{could be reduced}} if biomarkers were available to allow individual tailoring of potentially toxic <b>immunosuppressive</b> therapy. <b>Gene</b> expression-based biomarkers facilitating such tailoring of chemotherapy in cancer, but not autoimmunity, have been identified and translated into clinical practice. We show that transcriptional profiling of purified CD 8 (+) T cells, which avoids the confounding influences of unseparated cells, identifies two distinct subject subgroups predicting long-term prognosis in two autoimmune diseases, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -associated vasculitis (AAV), a chronic, severe disease characterized by inflammation of medium-sized and small blood vessels, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by autoantibodies, immune complex deposition and diverse clinical manifestations ranging from glomerulonephritis to neurological dysfunction. We show that the subset of genes defining the poor prognostic group is enriched for genes involved in the interleukin- 7 receptor (IL- 7 R) pathway and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and those expressed by memory T cells. Furthermore, the poor prognostic group is associated with an expanded CD 8 (+) T cell memory population. These subgroups, which are {{also found in the}} normal population and can be identified by measuring expression of only three genes, raise the prospect of individualized therapy and suggest new potential therapeutic targets in autoimmunity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is {{responsible}} for the lymphoproliferative disorders observed in transplanted patients.  METHODS—The case history is described of a 59  year old man with a chorioretinal lesion who had received a single lung transplant and was on <b>immunosuppressive</b> treatment. Immunoglobulin <b>gene</b> rearrangement and EBV detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with semiquantification were used on the vitreous material.  RESULTS—A proliferation of B lymphocytes with a monoclonal subpopulation was found by PCR on the vitreous sample. The large amounts of EBV genomes found in the vitreous suggest that EBV was the cause of the lymphoproliferation. Healing of the lesion was achieved by a decrease in immunosuppressive treatment and the use of nucleotide analogues.  CONCLUSION—The diagnosis of ocular post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) can be made by PCR on vitreous material.

We transduced immature (day 5 of culture) myeloid DC with an E 1 -deleted replication-deficient adenoviral vector encoding the cytokine IL- 10 (AdV IL- 10) and a control adenovirus MX- 17 (AdV MX 17). Human DC transduced with AdV IL- 10 showed inhibition of the mixed leukocyte culture, reduced cell surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD 80 /CD 86) and {{were unable to}} produce the potent allo-stimulatory cytokine, interleukin- 12. In order to test the in vivo properties of these cells a humanized immunodeficient mouse skin transplantation model was developed. Immunodeficient NOD-scid mice were engrafted with human skin, reconstituted via intraperitoneal injection with allogeneic mononuclear cells (MNC) mixed with 1 x 10 (6) DC that were autologous to the skin donor and that had been transduced with either AdV IL- 10 or AdV MX- 17. Skin grafts were removed at day 7 and 14 after reconstitution and studied histologically for evidence of rejection. In animals that received DC modified with AdV IL- 10 there was reduced skin graft rejection as characterized by reduced mononuclear cell infiltration and less dermo-epidermal junction destruction compared with those animals that received DC modified with the control virus alone. Injection of equivalent numbers of donor-derived fibroblasts transduced with AdV IL- 10 were ineffective at modifying rejection of skin grafts. <b>Immunosuppressive</b> cytokine <b>gene</b> therapy targeting human DC is a novel means of inhibition of the alloimmune response...|$|R
40|$|The {{endothelium}} that {{lines the}} blood vessels has been of considerable interest with respect to understanding the onset and development of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Endothelial cells are capable of initiating a multitude of physiological or pathological responses, both at the molecular and cellular level {{in response to the}} pattern of blood flow such as the tangential shear stress force and the circumferential vessel deformation. Ultimately, gene transcription becomes activated or repressed, and this activity is regulated by transcription factors. One type of transcription factor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), is widely recognized for its anti-inflammatory effects via upregulation of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>genes</b> and downregulation of inflammatory genes, while serving as a therapeutic target for numerous diseases. Recently, it was shown that steady, physiological levels of shear stress on vascular endothelial cells activate GR in the absence of its ligand and initiate its subsequent nuclear translocation. As a continuation of this work, we have conducted live fluorescent time-lapse imaging of GR sub-cellular movement in response to fluid shear stress, and for the first time, quantitative analysis of GR nuclear translocation was performed using a unique image analysis algorithm based on an expectation- maximization/maximization of posterior marginals algorithm. Moreover, we have determined that GR translocation in endothelial cells is independent of an intact cytoskeleton. ^ We have also looked into the role of the nuclear lamina in GR intracellular movement by silencing lamin A/C. The nuclear lamina not only gives the nucleus its structure, but also serves as a scaffold for numerous nuclear proteins as well as the cell 2 ̆ 7 s genetic machinery. Mutation or absence of the lamin A/C gene, LMNA, has been shown to lead to an array of diseases called laminopathies. Interestingly, there was no dependence on nuclear lamina for GR import through the nucleus, but downstream transcription of glucocorticoid responsive genes was influenced significantly as demonstrated by reporter assays and real time-polymerase chain reaction of genes containing glucocorticoid response elements. Further experiments suggested that this might be due to aberrant function of histones proteins that are normally sequestered at the nuclear lamina and regulate the opening as well as closing of chromatin for gene transcription or repression, respectively. Glucocorticoid-responsive genes also showed significant changes in mRNA expression between lamin-intact and lamin-deficient endothelial cells. ^ Finally, {{for the first time we}} observed the effects of another hemodynamic force, cyclic stretch, on GR activity in normal and lamin-silenced endothelial cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. Interestingly, GR only showed signs of nuclear translocation in response to pathological degrees of stretch in cells with intact lamina; it failed to translocate in response to any stretch stimulus in lamin-deficient cells. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases in cells with lamin A/C suggested potential roles of JNK and ERK on GR activation, whereas only p 38 inhibition in lamin-deficient cells appeared to marginally enhance nuclear presence of GR. In search of potential explanations as to why GR was held within the cytoplasm under both mechanical strain and pharmacological drug inhibition, we found mRNA levels of four mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases to be significantly altered in lamin-deficient cells, thus affecting upstream kinases and potentially affecting GR sensitivity to cyclic stretch. Furthermore, we believe that the substrate used for mechanical stimuli studies may be significant in understanding intracellular protein activity in the case of dysfunctional lamin A/C. ^ These findings will allow us to learn more about the response of the endothelial glucocorticoid receptor to hemodynamic forces such as fluid shear stress and cyclic stretch. Moreover, the introduction of a novel image analysis algorithm to quantify the intracellular movement of GR as well as any other fluorescently-labeled protein within a cell gives new and improved insights into protein dynamics. Our groundbreaking work on the relationship between GR and nuclear lamina has also been intriguing with respect to their function following lamin A/C silencing and application of mechanical stimuli, and our observations necessitate further studies that will emphasize live-cell imaging of new proteins of interest, mechanical stimuli and lamin A/C-induced GR phosphorylation, as well as other potential paths to better link their mutual dependence. Ultimately, we anticipate that the intracellular activity of GR may become recognized as a critical mediator for cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, and its altered function as a result of dysfunctional lamin A/C may provide new insight in understanding aberrant protein behavior in laminopathies. ...|$|R

In the transplant setting, local modulation of host immune responses by a genetically modified allograft may offer an attractive alternative to systemic immunosuppression. Methods: We tested the efficacy and in vivo effect of intracoronary transfer of two <b>immunosuppressive</b> cytokine <b>genes.</b> First-generation E 1 -deleted adenoviral vectors expressing the Epstein-Barr virus interleukin- 10 (AdSvIL 10) or human transforming growth factor—β 1 (AdCMVTGF-β) were used. Rabbit cardiac allografts were transduced during cold preservation by slow (1 ml/min) intracoronary infusion of 1010 pfu/gm diluted viral vectors and then implanted heterotopically. Controls included E 1 -deleted adenovirus (Ad 5 dl 434) and AdCMVLacZ. Beating allografts were collected on day 4 for analysis of gene transfer efficacy and distribution. Additional grafts were used for evaluation of alloreactivity (n = 34). Results: Mean allograft viral uptake was 81 % (up to 91 %). Polymerase chain reactions and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reactions confirmed the presence and expression of both genes in the grafts. β-Galactosidase staining in AdCMVLacZ-infected grafts demonstrated efficient gene expression, which was highest (100 %) in subepicardial regions. More homogeneous transmyocardial distribution of the transgene (in 25 % to 40 % of cells) could be achieved by pulsatile slow delivery. Allograft survival was 6. 9 ± 0. 9 days in controls (n = 12), 11. 1 ± 1. 7 days in AdCMVTGF-β–infected grafts (n = 11, p < 10), and 11. 2 ± 3 days in AdSvIL 10 -infected grafts (n = 11, p < 10). Histologic scores (blinded) showed significantly (p < 0. 005) higher regression coefficients for rejection in controls compared with both cytokine-transduced groups.

TGFβ 1 − 509 T/T genotype in the donors or T allele-positivity in the recipients {{was associated with a}} significant protective effect against acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and grades II–IV aGVHD in the unrelated transplantation cohort. In the combined cohort, multivariate analysis confirmed that donors with the TGFβ 1 - 509 T/T genotype also conferred protection against the risk of aGVHD and grades II–IV aGVHD. In both the unrelated transplantation cohort and the sibling transplantation cohort, the IL- 10 − 819 C/C and − 592 C/C genotypes in either recipients or donors were significantly associated with a higher incidence of aGVHD. In the combined cohort, the IL- 10 promoter haplotype polymorphisms at positions − 1082, − 819, and − 592 influenced the occurrence of aGVHD and death in remission. Recipients without the A-T-A haplotype or those transplanted from donors without the A-T-A haplotype had a higher incidence of aGVHD than those who were A-T-A homozygotes or heterozygotes. Estimates for death in remission showed a clear advantage for recipients transplanted from donors with the A-T-A haplotype. In multivariate analysis, recipients without the A-T-A IL- 10 haplotype had a higher risk of aGVHD (relative risk [RR] = 0. 764; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 460 - 1. 269; P =. 096) and grades II–IV aGVHD (RR = 0. 413; 95 % CI: 0. 245 - 0. 697; P =. 001).

The loss of many <b>immunosuppressive</b> and host-range <b>genes</b> resulted in a safe and immunogenic vaccine vector. However it still retains some immunomodulatory genes that may reduce MVA immunogenicity. Earlier reports demonstrated that the deletion of the A 41 L, B 15 R, C 6 L, or C 12 L open reading frames (ORFs) enhanced cellular immune responses in recombinant MVA (rMVA) by up to 2 -fold. However, previously, we showed that deletion of the C 12 L, A 44 L, A 46 R, B 7 R, or B 15 R ORFs from rMVA, using MVA-BAC recombineering technology, did not enhance rMVA immunogenicity at either peak or memory cellular immune responses.

Two clusters of fifteen genes were deleted in one rMVA mutant that encodes either the 85 A antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or an immunodominant H 2 -Kd-restricted murine malaria epitope (pb 9). The deletion mutants were tested in prime only or prime and boost vaccination regimens. The responses showed no improved peak or memory CD 8 + T cell frequencies.

Large-scale <b>gene</b> expression of peripheral blood mononuclear T cells was evaluated using cDNA microarray nylon membranes containing 5184 cDNAs. Data were analysed using the SAM and Cluster and Treeview software. When untreated patients were compared to healthy individuals, 38 genes, most of them located on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 17 and 19, were repressed, and when untreated patients were compared to treated ones, 154 genes, located on chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 12 and 17, were induced. In terms of biological function of coded proteins, the differentially expressed genes were associated with apoptosis, cell cycle, chromosomal scaffold, cytokine/chemokine, DNA repair/replication, Golgi/mitochondrial proteins, mRNA processing, signalling molecules and tumour suppressors. Two autoantigen genes related to RNA splicing (small nuclear riboprotein 70 000 MW-U 1 SNR, and splicing factor 3 a, 60 000 MW), and the tetranectin-plasminogen-binding protein were repressed. The Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G low affinity IIb, apoptotic protease activating factor- 1, two subunits of cytochrome c, caspase 8, complement C 5 a, HLA-DRA, HLA-DQB 1, transforming growth factor-β receptor II, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (Sm protein N) genes, heterogeneous nuclear riboprotein-C, and argininosuccinate lyase genes, among others, were induced.

40|$|Chronic {{autoimmune}} {{diseases are}} driven by cells that respond to tissue components of the body. Inflammation in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes or multiple sclerosis, can be suppressed by drug therapy. However, {{the broad range of}} immunosuppressive action of these drugs often does not restrict to the autoimmune response, but increases the risk of serious infection. Therefore, therapies that restrict to suppression of only the auto-immune response need to be developed. CD 4 + T cells that recognize cartilage are responsible for induction of arthritis because they direct their actions to cartilage in the joints. Such T cells are present in the joints of arthritis patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that T cells specific for the cartilage-derived antigen proteoglycan can be used to target arthritis with suppressive agents after introduction of genes that express suppressive agents in these T cells. For our studies we used cartilage proteoglycan-induced arthritis, which is a chronic arthritis in mice. This arthritis represents many features of rheumatoid arthritis, and is mediated by Th 1 cells, B cells and antibodies. To enable studies on cartilage-specific T cells, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing a proteoglycan-specific T cell receptor on its T cells. Due to the high number of cartilage-specific T cells, transgenic mice were highly susceptible for arthritis. Moreover, the T cell response of transgenic mice with arthritis shifted to an excessive Th 1 -phenotype. Therefore, these transgenic mice were useful donors for arthritogenic CD 4 + T cells. To explore gene therapy of inflammation with T cells, we provided proteoglycan-specific T cells with different <b>genes</b> encoding <b>immunosuppressive</b> proteins. The <b>genes</b> were isolated from mouse cells and inserted into T cells by retroviruses. Retroviral transduction of T cells resulted in up to 80 % of cells expressing the transgenes (IL- 4, IL- 10, TNF-alpha-Receptor-Ig, IL- 1 receptor antagonist). T cells expressing the inserted genes were sorted by flow cytometry and transferred to mice with arthritis. Especially T cells that were manipulated to express IL- 10 were able to induce significant suppression of joint inflammation. Moreover, only the IL- 10 -producing T cells that expressed the cartilage-specific T cell receptor suppressed arthritis, indicating specificity of therapy. In addition, manipulated T cells suppressed production of pro-inflammatory proteins like TNF-alpha, IL- 17, IL- 2 and PG-specific IgG 2 a antibodies. Strikingly, we discovered that propagation of IL- 10 production in cells of the treated recipient was the mechanism that was used by the transferred IL- 10 -producing T cells to suppress arthritis. Among the recipient’s cells, T cells and B cells were found to express increased levels of IL- 10. Because interleukin- 10 is an immunomodulatory cytokine expressed by cells in order to naturally prevent exacerbation of inflammation in healthy individuals, these results indicate that T cells producing IL- 10 restore natural immunosuppressive immune responses in arthritis. In conclusion, manipulation of pro-inflammatory T cells that recognize tissue components is a powerful approach to specifically target inflammation in chronic autoimmune diseases. In addition, moving focus from suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators to propagation of immunosuppressive functions of cells may provide a more comprehensive insight in mechanisms that support specific regulatory capacities of the immune system...|$|R
