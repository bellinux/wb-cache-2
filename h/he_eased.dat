5|$|In February, at the 2014 Rotterdam Open, <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> past Gaël Monfils and Paul-Henri Mathieu in {{straight}} sets, but fell to Latvian Ernests Gulbis in the quarterfinals. In the 2014 Dubai Tennis Championships, he retired against Somdev Devvarman {{after losing the}} first set due to his wrist injury. The same injury led to his subsequent withdrawal from Masters 1000 series events in Indian Wells and Miami, meaning that del Potro dropped to world No. 8.|$|E
25|$|As Jairzinho accelerated, {{the ever}} {{dangerous}} striker Tostão began a sprint up the middle, drawing his defender with him, diverting the Italian defence and making {{more room for}} Jairzinho. Younger players should note the movement off the ball by Brazil. Increasingly squeezed inside, Jairzinho's run nevertheless drew the defence to him and <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> the ball to Pelé in the centre. Always dangerous, Pelé paused and shaped to make a dribble.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Ceaușescu {{became a}} popular figure, both in Romania {{and in the}} West, because of his {{independent}} foreign policy, which challenged {{the authority of the}} Soviet Union. In the 1960s, <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> press censorship and ended Romania's active participation in the Warsaw Pact, but Romania formally remained a member. He refused {{to take part in the}} 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces and even actively and openly condemned that action in his 21 August 1968 speech. He travelled to Prague a week before the invasion to offer moral support to his Czechoslovak counterpart, Alexander Dubček. Although the Soviet Union largely tolerated Ceaușescu's recalcitrance, his seeming independence from Moscow earned Romania a maverick status within the Eastern Bloc.|$|E

50|$|Ciaráns {{continued}} {{insistence that}} he was fit enough to join them on the forthcoming German tour caused them considerable disquiet. They preferred <b>he</b> <b>ease</b> himself back to work, with a few small shows in Ireland. The tour gradually began to take its toll on Ciarán, and {{it was decided that}} {{for the sake of his}} health he should return home. He flew from Brussels to Dublin.|$|R
25|$|The 2012 London Olympics {{was next}} up for Tsonga. His victory over Milos Raonic {{in the second}} round became the longest ever (in number of games played) at the Olympics. Fatigue, surprisingly, did not appear to affect Jo-Wilfried in the third round. <b>He</b> <b>eased</b> into the quarterfinals over Feliciano López, but lost to world no. 2 Novak Djokovic. In the men's doubles event, Tsonga {{represented}} France alongside Michaël Llodra. The pair won their opening match against Argentinians David Nalbandian and Eduardo Schwank, and followed it with a win over India's Leander Paes and Vishnu Vardhan. They faced the Brazilian duo of Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares in the quarterfinals, and earned a two set victory for a semifinal berth. In a marathon encounter, they won their next match against the Spaniards López and David Ferrer, 18–16 in the third set. In the finals, they faced the top seeded Americans Mike and Bob Bryan, but lost in straight sets, thus winning the Olympic silver medal.|$|E
25|$|Next up for Powell was the Diamond League Athletissima in Lausanne on 30 June. In chilly conditions, {{not ideal}} for sprinting, the former world record holder bulleted {{out of his}} blocks {{and ran to the}} tape, {{recording}} a world-leading 9.78s with a following wind of 1.0m/s. Powell was indeed happy with his strong performance, his fastest in three years and was full of confidence {{about the rest of the}} season and the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea in late August. Next up for Powell was the IAAF Diamond League Meeting in Birmingham, England on 10 July. He became the first man in history to break the 10 seconds barrier in the Sir Alexander Stadium when he clocked a very easy looking 9.95s in his heat. Later, in the final <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> to a 9.91s victory where compatriots Nesta Carter and Michael Frater finished second and third respectively. Powell was satisfied with both his races, stating that he took both the races easy due to very chilly and rainy conditions. Asafa seemed more and more confident heading into the World Championships in late August. Powell next competed on 30 July in Budapest at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He ran 9.90s in his heats and eased through the final to win in 9.86s, having following winds of 1.8m/s and 2.0m/s respectively, in cold conditions.|$|E
500|$|On 26 March, Simpson rode in the one-day Tour of Flanders. With 's Nino Defilippis, he chased down {{an early}} breakaway. Simpson {{worked with the}} group; with about [...] to go he attacked, {{followed}} by Defilippis. The finish, three circuits around the town of Wetteren, was flat; Defilippis, unlike Simpson, was a sprinter and was expected to win. One kilometre from the finish, Simpson launched a sprint; <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> off with 300m to go, tricking Defilippis into thinking he was exhausted. As Defilippis passed, Simpson jumped again to take victory, becoming the first Briton to win a [...] "monument" [...] classic. Defilippis protested that the finishing banner had been blown down, {{and he did not}} know where the finish was; however, the judges noted that the finish line was clearly marked on the road itself. Defilippis' team asked Simpson to agree to a tie, saying no Italian had won a classic since 1953. He replied: [...] "An Englishman had not won one since 1896!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber {{recalled}} of Schnitzer that [...] "he {{was incredibly}} {{easy to be}} around. He made you feel at <b>ease.</b> <b>He</b> was powerful and wealthy yet at <b>ease.</b> <b>He</b> didn't take himself that seriously." ...|$|R

500|$|Lee {{returned}} to the court {{for the first time}} after recovering from his injury to play in the London Olympic Games. He closely beat Ville Lång of Finland in rubber games for the first round, and blamed pressure for the close defeat. In the second round, <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> to a victory against Indonesia's Simon Santoso, before beating Kashyap Parupalli of India in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, he beat Chen Long of China in straight sets despite early predictions that Chen would be difficult to beat, and set up a repeat of 2008's final against Lin Dan. This was the second meeting in the Wembley Arena for both players after the 2011 World Championships. Lee led the match after winning the first game but Lin brought it to the rubber games. Despite leading for most of the time in the third game, Lin managed to level the point and edge him narrowly by 21–19, forcing Lee to settle for silver once more. BBC Sport analyst Gail Emms said, [...] "You couldn't have asked for any more from Lee Chong Wei." [...] This epic episode was documented in an academic article entitled [...] "Silver lining in winning silver: an exploratory study of supporters’ reactions and coping on the social media towards Lee Chong Wei’s London Olympics defeat".|$|E
500|$|... "The Field Where I Died" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave [...] "The Field Where I Died" [...] a [...] "B+". He {{felt that it}} worked [...] "pretty well" [...] {{and there was a}} lot to appreciate about it, and while he noted that [...] "the episode isn't quite good enough for the conclusion to be as devastating as it should be", he still praised the tragic ending. However, he felt it not believable that Mulder quickly accepts his past lives and Melissa's part in it, and thought it would have worked better if <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> into believing it. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She called the entry [...] "unabashedly emotional episode" [...] that is [...] "unafraid to plumb the depths of human loss and grief". Furthermore, Vitaris praised Cloke's acting; she called her [...] "a truly gifted actor, slipping faultlessly into the skin of all of Melissa's personalities." [...] She was, however, more critical of Duchovny, noting that his hypnosis scene was underacted. Sarah Stegall, in The Munchkyn Zone, gave the episode a 5 out 5 rating. Stegall wrote that while the episode is [...] "drowned in tears and soaked in muted sunlight, [...] teeters on the brink of sentimentality", it manages [...] "to stay just this side of it for a dynamite, gripping episode that showcases some fine actors".|$|E
2500|$|Ishihara {{is deeply}} {{interested}} in the North Korean abduction issue, and called for economic sanctions against North Korea. [...] Following Ishihara's campaign to bid Tokyo for the 2016 Summer Olympics, <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> his criticism of the Chinese government. He accepted an invitation to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and was selected as a torch-bearer for the Japan leg of the 2008 Olympic Torch Relay.|$|E
60|$|Rotherby {{looked up}} sharply. The cool, self-possessed tone had an intimidating note. But Mr. Green laughed maliciously, as he {{continued}} to mop his still watering eyes.

60|$|Dealing with a man, {{said the}} night-watchman, thoughtfully, {{is as easy}} as a {{teetotaller}} walking along a nice wide pavement; dealing with a woman is like the same teetotaller, arter four or five whiskies, trying to get up a step that ain't there. If a man can't get 'is own way <b>he</b> <b>eases</b> 'is mind with a little nasty language, and then forgets all about it; if a woman can't get 'er own way she flies into a temper and reminds you of something you oughtn't to ha' done ten years ago. Wot a woman would do whose 'usband had never done anything wrong I can't think.|$|R
2500|$|In the cross-winds of the {{political}} movements of the time, he chose a largely [...] "moderate progressive" [...] profile, accepting government intervention on some issues (e.g., anti-trust matters) but opposed anything that smacked of socialism. <b>He</b> <b>eased</b> up on patronage as a political tool and focused instead on helping his constituents in matters small and large, often invoking the image {{of himself as a}} [...] "drayhorse" [...] – a hard-working, persistent advocate for the things and people he believed in.|$|E
2500|$|According to Patrick Seale, Assad's rule [...] "began with an {{immediate}} and considerable advantage: the government he displaced was so detested that any alternative came as a relief". He first tried to establish national unity, which he felt had been lost {{under the leadership of}} Aflaq and Jadid. Assad differed from his predecessor at the outset, visiting local villages and hearing citizen complaints. The Syrian people felt that Assad's rise to power would lead to change; one of his first acts as ruler was to visit Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, father of the Aflaqite Ba'athist Mansur al-Atrash, to honor his efforts during the Great Arab Revolution. He made overtures to the Writers' Union, rehabilitating those who had been forced underground, jailed or sent into exile for representing what radical Ba'athists called the reactionary classes: [...] "I am determined that you shall no longer feel strangers in your own country." [...] Although Assad did not democratize the country, <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> the government's repressive policies.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his rise}} to power, <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> press {{censorship}} and openly condemned the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in his 21 August speech of 1968, {{which resulted in}} a surge in his popularity. The period of stability was very brief, however; his government very shortly later became severely repressive and authoritarian, and was considered by far the most Stalinist in Eastern Europe. His secret police, the Securitate, was responsible for mass surveillance as well as severe repression and human rights abuses within the country, and he suppressed and controlled the media and press implementing methods that were among the harshest, most restrictive and brutal in the world. Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to skyrocketing foreign debts for Romania; in 1982, he exported much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay the debts. The shortages that followed drastically lowered living standards, leading to heavy rationing of food, water, oil, heat, electricity, medicine, and other necessities. His cult of personality experienced unprecedented elevation, followed by extensive nepotism and the intense deterioration of foreign relations, even with the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|Roth was a witty man but unnatural campaigner. To help himself, <b>he</b> would <b>ease</b> {{himself into}} public {{appearances}} by bringing along a Saint Bernard dog. His succession of St. Bernards through his 34-year political career became a trademark of sorts.|$|R
25|$|On April 13, 2009, President Barack Obama {{eased the}} travel ban, {{allowing}} Cuban-Americans to travel freely to Cuba; and on January 14, 2011, <b>he</b> further <b>eased</b> the ban, by allowing students and religious missionaries {{to travel to}} Cuba if they meet certain restrictions.|$|R

60|$|Adelheid had {{encouraged}} the digression which, with one less gifted with strong good sense than Sigismund, might have {{only served to}} wound his pride, but she perceived that <b>he</b> <b>eased</b> his mind by thus drawing on his reason, and by setting up that which should be in opposition to that which was.|$|E

Gulliver is washed ashore on Lilliput, a land of tiny humans who {{see him as a}} threatening giant. The Lilliputians are afraid of Gulliver and tie him down with stakes to the beach, but <b>he</b> <b>eases</b> their fears by performing several acts of kindness. An old quarrel between Lilliput and neighboring Blefuscu is revived, and Gulliver lends a hand by towing Blefuscu's warships far out to sea. Lilliput's Emperor (Basil Sydney) then views the giant as a threat to his throne after Gulliver is critical {{of the reasons for the}} war. Gulliver escapes in a boat he had previously built when the Emperor orders his execution.|$|R
