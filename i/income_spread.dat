When designing an agroforestry enterprise, one should research the marketing possibilities and include the agroforestry system in the complete business plan for the farm.

The six growth centers are: Chiangmai (Thailand), Surabaya (Indonesia), Jaffna (Sri Lanka), Mariveles (Philippines), Kandy (Sri Lanka), and Taxila-Wah (Pakistan). An evaluation is attempted {{of the spread}} or trickle-down process in the six case studies, as reflected by the income generated in each growth center and the income multipliers obtained in the surrounding rural areas. The hypothesis advanced for testing is that the spending generated by the different {{sectors of the economy}} tends to spread unevenly within the growth space, being greater in the zones nearer to the center than further away from it, and that the income multipliers so derived have only a negligible or no impact in the rural areas. It is further postulated that the income generated by the spending category in the growth center and the income multipliers obtained are independent {{of the size of the}} center. The results of the six case studies support, in general, the above hypothesis with regards to the predominance of backwash to <b>income</b> <b>spread</b> in the peripheries of the growth centers.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} a gasoline station’s incentive to price-discriminate by selling full-service gasoline {{as well as}} self-service gasoline. Unlike previous research, we explicitly model a firm’s incentive to price discriminate by choosing to be either single-product or multi-product {{as a function of}} market and station characteristics. This allows us to make two contributions to research in the area: First, we highlight the importance of accounting for self-selectivity considerations that can arise in an empirical analysis of price discrimination that is based on market data. Second, we are able to show how the product and pricing choices of firms depend upon the market characteristics. Using cross-sectional survey data on prices, station and market characteristics for 198 gasoline stations in the Greater Saint Louis area, we estimate a switching regression model of station decisions. Specifically, we employ a binary probit framework that models a station’s decision to price-discriminate through the choice of the station-type as a function of market and station characteristics. We then estimate conditional linear regressions with self-selectivity corrections for the station’s choice of prices. We show that incorrect inferences about the incentive to price discriminate and about the differences in the prices charged between single-product and multi-product stations would result if the endogeneity in the choice of the station-type were ignored in the estimation. The empirical analysis shows that a larger <b>income</b> <b>spread</b> in the market implies a greater likelihood of the gasoline station being multi-product.

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} {{characteristics}} {{and behavior of}} households headed by women in urban Brazil and identify some of the consequences for child welfare on the growth of these households. The following was among their findings. First, households headed by women are a heterogeneous group, which varies strongly by region - as does the extent of poverty among them. Such households are {{more common in the}} northeast and increase with urbanization. Second, households headed by women are not, on average, a"vulnerable group"in Brazil, as some are quite well off. The subset of such households that are very poor is quite vulnerable. Households headed by women tend to be poorer in the northeast, especially around Recife, than in Porto Alegre in the south, where there is virtually no gap. Third, less than half the households headed by women contain dependent children, and only a third are headed by the stereotypical"single mother. "When there are children in households headed by women, especially households headed by single mothers, the income gap is greater than in other households. As a portion of households in Brazil, households headed by women and containing children represent only 3. 4 percent of urban households, but this group tends to be poor, which is worrisome for child outcomes. Poor children tend to live in households headed by women. These households are poor not because there are more children or fewer adults but because women earn less than men. Women heading households do not earn less than other women - on the contrary. However, it female heads of households earned as much as male heads of households, the average income in households headed by women would be above that for other households and fewer single mothers would be poor. The best interventions toeliminate poverty in this group are those that focus on: (a) ending wage discrimination; and (b) ending occupational segregation. Interventions that focus on raising skill levels and educational attainment for the whole workforce, including women, would also help alleviate absolute poverty, although not necessarily relative income differences. "Workfare"or public employment policies would not help this group since most already participate in the labor force. Programs targeted to this group would not be particularly progressive, given the heterogeneity and <b>income</b> <b>spread</b> among these households. But the results do suggest the need for special interventions for children in households headed by women, given those children's tendency to stay out of school.

The increasing pressure of population on land resources in India, and particularly the weather, makes it essential to get the maximum food production both from irrigated and rainfed areas.

Drawing on the 2006 SAM accounting multipliers, macroeconomic e¤ects of alternative income policies are evaluated. Furthermore, the high and low-income gain pathways are identi�ed by applying the graph-theoretic path analysis. The following �ndings are noted. The rural <b>income</b> gain <b>spreads</b> over the entire economy, whereas the urban income gain largely remains within urban areas, suggesting relatively larger income multiplier e¤ects of rural development policies. Second, investing in education, health and family planning promises a signi�cant increase in agricultural production, which in turn creates considerable employment in rural areas. Targeted rural development policies thus {{seem to be the}} best strategy to bring growth and harmoniously improve income distribution. Third, a unit increase in the demand for family planning-health commodities generates 60 % more income for the urban-Kigali households than rural households. Finally,a unit increase in the family planning-health demand raises agricultural production by 1. 3 unit, which is followed by 1. 2 unit increase in service production and by 0. 74 unit increase in manufacturing production. To sum up, investing in family planning-health is a viable strategy to promote agricultural growth and reduce poverty through employment created in the rural sector. ...|$|R

However, despite lack of government support, the area of smallholder oil palm has increased dramatically in the past decade in those regions with access to roads and palm oil mills. We argue that, once processing infrastructure is in place, oil palm smallholders can readily take advantage of this infrastructure to pursue a profitable livelihood option, with lower cost and greater flexibility than large-scale operations. In this paper we explore the characteristics of oil palm smallholders in Sarawak and the complex and varied processes by which they have inserted themselves into the rapidly expanding landscape of large-scale plantation development.
