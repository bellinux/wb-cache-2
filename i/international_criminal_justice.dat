He stated, [...] "this volume provides a valuable entry point for investigating this kaleidoscope of legal and moral issues". Steven R. Ratner of the University of Michigan Law School reviewed the book for the American Journal of International Law, writing, [...] "In light of the complexity of the legal and moral issues, Targeted Killings is a welcome addition to the academic literature. It aims to combine in one volume perspectives from legal experts, moral philosophers, and military planners." [...] University of Reading law lecturer Robert P. Barnidge, Jr. wrote in the Boston University International Law Journal, [...] "Targeted Killings also provides some clarity as to the threshold between armed conflict and situations falling short of armed conflict". He concluded, [...] " [...] main contribution to the discussion lies in its focus on the willing use of violence on a significant scale by an organized group".|$|E

2500|$|Hans Köchler (born 18 October 1948) is {{a retired}} {{professor}} of philosophy at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, {{and president of the}} International Progress Organization, a non-governmental organization in consultative status with the United Nations. In his general philosophical outlook he is influenced by Husserl and Heidegger, his legal thinking has been shaped by the approach of Kelsen. Köchler has made contributions to phenomenology [...] and philosophical anthropology and has developed a hermeneutics of trans-cultural understanding [...] that has influenced the discourse on the dialogue of civilizations, particularly as regards the relations between Islam and the West. His research in political and legal philosophy—combined with his involvement with the UN—has resulted in a fundamental critique of the state-centered international system and in specific proposals for the democratization of the United Nations Organization and for a viable system of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Another form of Rwandan justice {{which has}} worked {{alongside}} Gacaca is the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The United Nations Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to [...] "prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of {{international humanitarian law}} committed in the territory of Rwanda and neighbouring States, between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994". The Tribunal is located in Arusha, Tanzania, and has offices in Kigali, Rwanda. Its Appeals Chamber is located in The Hague, Netherlands. Since it opened in 1995, the Tribunal has indicted 93 individuals whom it considered responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Rwanda in 1994. The ICTR has played a pioneering role {{in the establishment of}} a credible <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> system and is the first ever international tribunal to deliver verdicts in relation to genocide, and the first to interpret the definition of genocide set forth in the 1948 Geneva Conventions. It also is the first international tribunal to define rape in international criminal law and to recognise rape as a means of perpetrating genocide.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s, he co-operated with Cardinal Karol Wojtyła of Kraków, {{later to}} become Pope John Paul II, within the {{framework}} of the International Society for Phenomenology. He published the first comment articles on the future Pope's anthropological conception. During the 1980s he engaged in a critique of legal positivism (Philosophie—Recht—Politik, 1985) and developed a theory according to which human rights are the basis of the validity of international law (Die Prinzipien des Völkerrechts und die Menschenrechte, 1981). He also dealt with the applicability of democracy in inter-state relations (Democracy in International Relations, 1986). Legal theory led him to questions of political philosophy, and in particular a critique of the representative paradigm of democracy. [...] During the 1990s Köchler got increasingly involved in questions of world order—including the role and philosophical foundations of civilizational dialogue—and in what he has called the dialectic relationship between power and law. On the basis of these reflections, he made major proposals for the reform of the United Nations Organization, in particular the Security Council, and for a comprehensive system of <b>international</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice.</b>|$|E

40|$|This Note {{examines}} the nexus between <b>international</b> and domestic <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> systems.

Using Kenya {{as a case}} study, we analyze the advocacy strategies of Kenyan NGOs during the preliminary examination that took place between February 2008 and March 2010.

Instead, these NGOs successfully focused on advocating for the ICC preliminary examination to turn into a formal investigation.
