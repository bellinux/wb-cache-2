40|$|In this article, we {{conduct a}} {{critical}} {{reading of the}} <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy discourse. We argue that rather than being a transformative discourse within European Union policy, <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy discourse reinforces neoliberal hegemony by (re) legitimizing it. Inspired by post-foundational discourse theory and Glynos and Howarth’s logics of critical explanation, we analyse three central <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy documents. We characterize what kind of political project is articulated in and through <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy discourse, and uncover how it relates to neoliberal political rationality. Our contribution lies in showing (1) how the <b>social</b> logics of <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy {{can be understood as}} both ‘roll-out’ and ‘roll-with-it’ neoliberalization, thereby relegitimizing and naturalizing neoliberalism; (2) how the political logics of <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy pre-empt the critique of ‘roll-back’ neoliberalization and thus legitimize decreased public expenditure; and (3) how the fantasmatic logics make <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy ideologically useful in relegitimizing neoliberalism through the win-win-win fantasy and the ethical responsibilization of subjects. We argue that resisting the neoliberalizing power of <b>European</b> Union <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy discourse implies resisting the fantasmatic grip of <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> as carrying a sublime win-win-win. Instead of accepting <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> as driven by a replication of best practices, we need to understand <b>social</b> <b>innovations</b> as conceived and suited for particular social issues in particular contexts: we call for a different win-win mindset that does not blind innovators to possible negative impacts of <b>social</b> <b>innovations...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the capabilities approach offers a number of conceptual and evaluative benefits for understanding <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> and – in particular, its capacity to tackle marginalisation. Focusing on the substantive freedoms and achieved functionings of individuals introduces a multidimensional, plural appreciation of disadvantage, {{but also of the}} strategies to overcome it. In light of this, and the institutional embeddedness of marginalisation, effective <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> capable of tackling marginalisation depends on a) the participation of marginalized individuals in b) a process that addresses the social structuration of their disadvantage. In spite of the high-level ideals endorsed by the <b>European</b> Union, <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> tends to be supported through EU policy instruments as a means towards the maintenance of prevailing institutions, networks and cognitive ends. This belies the transformative potential of <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> emphasised in EU policy documentation and neglects the social structuration processes from which social needs and societal challenges arise. One strategy of displacing institutional dominance is to incorporate groups marginalised from multiple institutional and cognitive centres into the policy design and implementation process.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we conduct a {{critical}} {{reading of the}} <b>European</b> Union’s <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> (EUSI) policy discourse. We argue that <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> has become a prominent element of European policy discourses and {{can be seen as}} a key component in an emerging hegemonic project. We therefore engage in a problematization of EUSI policy. Inspired by a governmentality perspective and Howarth’s framework for critical policy studies (2010) we examine the social, political, ideological, ethical and economic logics in three EUSI policy documents. Our contribution lies in (1) our problematization and critical study of <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy discourse in the EU context; and (2) our expansion of Howarth’s framework with two additional logics that are at play in policy discourse: ethical logics and economic logics. The distinction between ideological and ethical logics helps us to expose how EUSI discourse is meant to grip subjects through both the fantasmatic promise of a win-win-win and the ethical injunction of responsibilization. The addition of economic logics helps us to reflect on the further incorporation of the social into the economy, as the economic valuation of social and environmental impacts becomes a key part of the vision for the future of the EU...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} prominent concept employed by political leaders and administrations across Europe. It has been posited {{as a solution to}} both old and new social risks at a time of heightened uncertainty and pressure on public administrations and finances (Bonoli, 2005; OECD, 2011; Sinclair and Baglioni, 2014). There is broad recognition that, growing interest in <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> is intimately linked to the Great Recession, structural unemployment and the social challenges arising as a result (European Commission., 2014). In political and policy rhetoric, the European Union repeatedly cites <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> as a solution to the persistence of socio-economic, environmental and demographic challenges. These challenges are placing increasing pressure on Europe’s systems of welfare, health, education and care provision. Budgetary constraints and increased demand on public services has fuelled the desire to capitalise on <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> so that public and private institutions are able to do and achieve more with less (TEPSIE, 2014). Not only is <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> understood as a means to achieve an end in this regard, it is also recognised as an end in itself. <b>Social</b> <b>innovation</b> has been cited by the European Commission as ‘another way to produce value, with less focus on financial profit and more on real demands or needs… for reconsidering production and redistribution systems' (European Commission., 2014 : 8). The <b>European</b> Commission defines <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> as: {{the development and implementation of}} new ideas (products, services and models) to meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborations. It represents new responses to pressing social demands, which affect the process of social interactions. It is aimed at improving human wellbeing. <b>Social</b> <b>innovations</b> are <b>innovations</b> that are <b>social</b> in both their ends and their means. They are innovations that are not only good for society but also enhance individuals’ capacity to act. (European Commission., 2013 a: 6) Work Package 6 of the Creating Economic Space for <b>Social</b> <b>Innovation</b> (CRESSI) research programme examines how this definition (or perhaps ideal) is translated and realised in the EU and domestic policymaking process. Whilst this research pays some attention to definitional issues of <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> and the implications of conceptualising <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> in a particular way, the principle objective of the EU <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> policy survey is to identify and review ‘social innovation in the context of European policymaking’ (Borzaga and Bodini, 2014 : 412).

40|$|Excerpt] This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a research project exploring the involvement of new partners – in particular, the social partners, civil society and people in vulnerable situations – in <b>social</b> <b>innovation.</b> For the purposes of the research, ‘social innovation’ is defined as new ideas (products, services and models) that simultaneously resolve societal challenges, meet social needs and create new social relationships among the groups concerned. <b>Social</b> <b>innovation</b> can involve such aspects as new participation in decision-making, services affecting the social situation of specific target groups (provided commercially or not) and changes in social care systems. It is part of cultural development and societal change. The research was carried out at EU level – focusing especially {{on the role of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Fund (ESF) in <b>social</b> <b>innovation</b> – and in six Member States: Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Sweden. It examined the <b>innovation</b> and <b>social</b> partnership culture in each country, and analysed to what extent national-level policies have been triggered by EU policy. The research also includes three case studies carried out in Ireland, Slovenia and Sweden, presenting initiatives that the social partners, or those in vulnerable situations, have been involved in designing and implementing. The objective of this study is to inform, with an evidence-based approach, the policy debate on <b>social</b> <b>innovation,</b> and contribute to a better understanding of effective and sustainable processes.
