5000|$|The initial design {{called for}} a mobile surface-launched system, but a {{changing}} cold war situation saw a silo-based R-9 developed {{in tandem with the}} <b>ground-based</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>ground-based</b> <b>system,</b> however, would never achieve the hoped-for mobility of the initial design parameters. In total, three launch sites were constructed, but only two were used. [...] "Desna-V", the silo launch area, consisted of three underground silos with the ability to launch the R-9 within 20 minutes, and the ability to store the missile in an unfueled ready condition for one year. [...] "Valley", the first of two above-ground launch sites, was mostly automated and could fire the R-9 within 20 minutes as well, and repeat the process within two and a half hours. The final launch site, [...] "Desna-N", was also an above-ground site, but was never stocked with R-9s as the site was not automated and needed at least two hours to launch a single missile.|$|E
40|$|The Reionization And Transient Infra,. Red (RATIR) camera {{has been}} built for rapid Gamma,. Ray Burst (GRE) followup and will provide {{simultaneous}} optical and infrared photometric capabilities. The infrared portion of this camera incorporates two Teledyne HgCdTe HAWAII- 2 RG detectors, controlled by Teledyne's SIDECAR ASICs. While other <b>ground-based</b> <b>systems</b> have used the SIDECAR before, this system also utilizes Teledyne's JADE 2 interface card and IDE development environment. Together, this setup comprises Teledyne's Development Kit, which is a bundled solution that can be efficiently integrated into future <b>ground-based</b> <b>systems.</b> In this presentation, we characterize the system's read noise, dark current, and conversion gain...|$|R
25|$|Additionally WAAS {{works just}} as well between airports. This allows the {{aircraft}} to fly directly from one airport to another, as opposed to following routes based on ground-based signals. This can cut route distances considerably in some cases, saving both time and fuel. In addition, because {{of its ability to}} provide information on the accuracy of each GPS satellite's information, aircraft equipped with WAAS are permitted to fly at lower en-route altitudes than was possible with <b>ground-based</b> <b>systems,</b> which were often blocked by terrain of varying elevation. This enables pilots to safely fly at lower altitudes, not having to rely on <b>ground-based</b> <b>systems.</b> For unpressurized aircraft, this conserves oxygen and enhances safety.|$|R

50|$|Development of {{the system}} began in 1993, after the failure to {{introduce}} into service and market the ZA-HVM short-range SAM (together with ZA-35). The first <b>Ground-based</b> <b>system</b> tests were completed in July 2005 and the system was judged to be shore-qualified. The tests included using Denel Dynamics Skua subsonic target drones equipped with telemetry sensors. Test flights flew different trajectory profiles, including low-flying, walking and exercising collision course evasive action.|$|E
50|$|The {{telescope}} {{is intended for}} radio-astrophysical observations of extragalactic objects with ultra-high resolution, as well as researching of characteristics of near-Earth and interplanetary plasma. The very high angular resolving power will be achieved when {{used in conjunction with}} a <b>ground-based</b> <b>system</b> of radio-telescopes and interferometrical methods, operating at wavelengths of 1.35-6.0, 18.0 and 92.0 cm. Once in space, the flower-like main dish was to open its 27 'petals' within 30 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The first distance-based {{navigation}} system was the German Y-Ger√§t blind-bombing system. This used a Lorenz beam for horizontal positioning, and a transponder for ranging. A <b>ground-based</b> <b>system</b> periodically sent out pulses which the airborne transponder returned. By measuring the total round-trip {{time on a}} radar's oscilloscope, the aircraft's range could be accurately determined even at very long ranges. An operator then relayed this information to the bomber crew over voice channels, and indicated when to drop the bombs.|$|E
50|$|A {{lightning}} detector is {{a device}} that detects lightning produced by thunderstorms. There are three primary types of detectors: <b>ground-based</b> <b>systems</b> using multiple antennas, mobile systems using a direction and a sense antenna in the same location (often aboard an aircraft), and space-based systems.|$|R

The transformation to NextGen requires programs and technologies that provide more efficient operations, including streamlined communications capabilities. The SWIM program {{is an integral part}} of that transformation that will connect FAA systems. The SWIM program will also enable interaction with other members of the decision-making community including other government agencies, air navigation service providers, and airspace users.|$|E
5000|$|Guidance was {{provided}} by a Brown-Boveri radar system and beam riding receivers on the missile. Beam riding systems are the simplest systems to implement, as the <b>ground-based</b> <b>system</b> can consist solely of a tracking radar. The target is first {{picked up on the}} radar system and [...] "locked on". The missile is launched directly into the path of the radar, allowing receivers {{at the back of the}} missile to hear the radar signal and keep itself centred in the beam. The missile then flies directly at the target as long as the radar remains locked on.|$|E

40|$|There exist several known {{methods for}} {{calculation}} of radio coverage for <b>ground-based</b> <b>systems.</b> As {{far as we}} know there are no equivalent methods for the case of flying platforms when the altitudes and speeds are significantly different to those of <b>ground-based</b> <b>systems.</b> This thesis describes the theoretical concepts behind calculations of radio coverage for flying platforms. An investigation is made to sort out what is important and possible to employ in a model for simulations. A method is described and implemented in a program for evaluation of flying radio systems. Two typical cases of flight missions are simulated and discussed. It is found that the free space model is valid most of the mission time. The contribution from the antennas is found to be small in comparison to the path loss. Further investigations suggested are e. g. better ground reflection models and a better model for the flight mechanics...|$|R

50|$|The Canadian design {{became known}} as the Accurate Position Finder, or APF for short. At the time, the {{solution}} to rapidly switching a microwave signal between two antenna leads had not been solved. As a result, {{there was no way to}} use a single antenna for both transmission and reception, and the team initially considered systems with one transmitter and one receiver, or a single transmitter and four receivers. This profusion of antennas was not a major problem in the GL role; the reflectors were about a metre across, which was not too large for a <b>ground-based</b> <b>system,</b> especially considering the multi-metre wide antennas of the GL Mk. II it would replace.|$|E
50|$|An {{extended}} range {{version of the}} Block 2 variant of the Umkhonto-IR was test fired in October 2013. During the demonstration, three missiles successfully destroyed low-cost aerial target systems (LOCATS - provided by the South African Army), two at 15 km range and one at 20 km. The targets were launched from the Denel Overberg Test Range and flew out to sea before turning inshore on an elliptical track. The successful ground-based firing tests proved that {{the range of the}} Umkhonto can be extended to 20 km while the physical dimensions of the missile remain unchanged. The test was also part of the development of a mobile <b>ground-based</b> <b>system</b> for the South African Army.|$|E

By using radar polarimetry, a <b>ground-based</b> SAR <b>system</b> {{can be used for}} monitoring seasonal vegetation changes.

30|$|These ionospheric {{currents}} {{give rise}} to a variety of important space weather effects, influencing the performance and reliability of spaceborn and <b>ground-based</b> technological <b>systems.</b> Problems in <b>ground-based</b> <b>systems</b> occur for instance due to the secondary, Earth-induced, electric fields and corresponding currents. For directional drilling in polar regions disturbances in the magnetic field caused by strong ionospheric currents may hamper accurate well positioning (Poedjono et¬†al. 2013). Ionospheric currents may also lead to increased drag on low-altitude spacecraft (Liu and L√ºhr 2005; Pirjola et¬†al. 2005). Better understanding of the time‚Äìspace structure of polar ionospheric currents and in particular their improved modelling are therefore of great importance, not only for advances in fundamental space research but also regarding practical applications.|$|R
