30|$|Nine {{isolates}} of A. salmonicida {{were recovered}} and identified from skin, gill and kidney from four fish species, i.e. red spot emperor, <b>king</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bream,</b> white-spotted rabbit fish, tilapia {{and one of}} abalone, {{all of which are}} considered as commercially important for aquaculture development in Oman.|$|E
30|$|Aeromonas salmonicida was {{isolated}} from red spot emperor, <b>king</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bream,</b> white-spotted rabbit fish and tilapia, and an invertebrate (abalone) in Oman during December 2011 –May 2012. The cytotoxic enterotoxin ast gene was found widely distributed among the isolates; aerolysin-like protein (act) and the flagellin structural gene lafA less so; and the nuclease gene (nuc) not at all. However, {{there was not}} any evidence of pathogenicity among the isolates when tested in laboratory-based experiments using rainbow trout and Nile tilapia. Therefore, {{the risk of the}} pathogen to fish in Oman is unclear.|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{and intensity of}} polyopisthocotylean monogeneans on the gills of three commercially important species of sparid caught in Omani coastal waters close to the city port of Muscat were determined and compared. Throughout May 2012 to April 2013, infections on bi-weekly samples of the soldier seabream, Argyrops filamentosus (Valenciennes, 1830), the <b>king</b> <b>soldier</b> seabream, Argyrops spinifer (Forsskål, 1775), and, the silver seabream, Rhabdosargus sabra were evaluated. From a total of 200 specimens (standard length of 26 – 52 cm), caught by line angling or by traps, at least three species of gill monogenean, namely Omanicotyle [Bivagina] heterospina, Heteromicrocotyla sp. and Microcotyle sp., were commonly encountered. Silver bream, which was infected by all three monogeneans, bore the highest infections (100 % prevalence; mean intensity of 20. 14 ± 0. 92 parasites fish- 1), whilst the <b>soldier</b> <b>bream,</b> which was infected only by O. heterospina had the lowest levels of infection (of the three sparids with 63. 8 % prevalence; mean intensity 5. 8 ± 0. 17 parasites fish- 1). Comments {{on the distribution of}} monogeneans on each host are provided but to what extent this is influenced by water current speeds passing through the buccal and opercular cavities, gill morphology, parasite size, and / or the morphology and efficiency of the parasite’s attachment apparatus requires establishing and forms the basis of ongoing investigations...|$|R

30|$|In this study, 9 {{isolates}} of A. salmonicida {{were recovered}} from skin, gill and kidney of 417 fish representing 4 wild fish, including red spot emperor (Lethrinus lentjan), <b>king</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bream</b> (Argyrops spinifer), white-spotted rabbit fish (Siganus canaliculatus), abalone (Haliotis mariae) and one farmed tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The fish {{were collected from}} 3 areas (Muscat, Mudhaibi and Salalah) considered suitable for aquaculture in Oman based on the Atlas of suitable sites for aquaculture in Oman. The animals were mostly healthy, as judged visually, except for one tilapia that demonstrated abnormal behaviour. The abalone was from a population that {{had a history of}} high mortality albeit without any clinical signs of disease.|$|E
40|$|Background: The Sultanate of Oman's {{aquaculture}} {{industry is}} expanding with an on-going assessment of potential new fish species for culture. The <b>king</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bream,</b> Argyrops spinifer (Forsskål) (Sparidae), {{is one such}} species that is under consideration. During a routine health assessment of specimens caught in the Sea of Oman throughout the period November 2009 to March 2011, a number of gill polyopisthocotylean monogeneans were recovered. Methods: A subsequent study of the monogeneans using a range of morphology-based approaches indicated that these were Bivagina heterospina Mamaev et Parukhin, 1974. In the absence of pre-existing molecular data, an expanded description of this species is provided, including a differential diagnosis with other species and genera belonging to the subfamily Microcotylinae Monticelli, 1892 with the subsequent movement of this species to a new genus to accommodate it. Results: The polyopisthocotyleans collected from the gills of A. spinifer appear to be unique within the family Microcotylidae Taschenberg, 1879 in that, morphologically, they possess a pair of large, muscular vaginae each armed with a full crown of 16 - 18 robust spines and a unique dorsal region of folded tegument, which permits their discrimination from species of Bivagina Yamaguti, 1963. Sequencing of the SSU rDNA (complete 1968 bp) and LSU rDNA (partial 949 bp) places the specimens collected during this study within the subfamily Microcotylinae, but the LSU rDNA sequence differs from Bivagina and also from other microcotylid genera. Morphological features of B. heterospina sensu Mamaev et Parukhin, 1974 and the specimens collected from the current study are consistent {{with one another and}} represent a single species. The vaginal armature of these worms is unique and differs from all other genera within the Microcotylinae, including Bivagina, and its movement to Omanicotyle n. gen. to accommodate this species is proposed. Conclusions: A new genus, Omanicotyle n. gen., is erected to accommodate Omanicotyle [Bivagina] heterospina n. comb. which represents the first monogenean to be described from Omani marine waters. Given the pathogenic potential of microcotylids on captive held fish stocks, a full assessment of Omanicotyle heterospina n. gen. et n. comb. is now required before large-scale production commences...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture {{is being}} seriously {{considered}} as a promising sustainable industry in the Sultanate of Oman. Fish farming commenced in Oman in 1986, {{but it was only}} in 2011 that it became a more commercially driven sector. While worldwide aquaculture production is expected to rise to meet the shortage in capture fisheries, there is a parallel requirement to identify potential threats to the health and welfare of existing aquatic farmed stocks and to take appropriate steps to mitigate them. As aquaculture in Oman is in an early stage of development, it is important to acquire baseline data on the existence and prevalence of aquatic diseases and pathogens to help the Government make policy decisions to develop health management regimes applicable for Omani aquaculture. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate current farming practices of tilapia in Oman, to investigate the bacterial species composition and distribution from different sites in some of the economically important fish species, and to study the characteristics and pathogenicity of Aeromonas species. The current practices were studied for 9 Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) farms from four areas (Al Batinah, Ad Dhahirah, Ad Dakhiliyah and Ash Sharqiyah North) during the period of September to November 2012 by using questionnaires and interviews with the farm owners and staff. In total 417 fish representing 5 target species were chosen {{on the basis of the}} commercial importance and their potential for aquaculture in Oman, including red spot emperor (Lethrinus lentjan), <b>king</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>bream</b> (Argyrops spinifer), white spotted rabbit fish (Siganus canaliculatus), abalone (Haliotis mariae) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The fish were collected from 5 main sampling areas in Oman (Muscat, Mudhaibi, Manah, Sohar and Salalah) based on the Atlas of suitable sites for aquaculture in Oman to investigate the bacterial species composition and distribution. The animals were examined for clinical signs of disease prior to routine bacteriology. Bacterial isolates were recovered using traditional methods and identified to species level using phenotypic and molecular approaches using 16 S rDNA, 16 S rDNA RFLP and 16 S rDNA sequencing. Experimental fish challenge studies were also conducted using both live bacterial cells and ECP protein to investigate the pathogenicity of Aeromonas isolates. In addition, the presence of some virulence factors was investigated using both phenotypic and genotypic methods. The results of this study showed that, the most farms in the Oman follow very similar farming practices. The major proportion of the tilapia is consumed within the local communities. A number of farmers have experienced mortalities, which were considered to be attributable to poor water quality, overcrowding or due to excessive feeding. Farmers facing fish mortalities tended not to record the problems due to a lack of understanding of the concept of fish farm management. There is a regulation about aquaculture and related quality control, but it has not yet been implemented in an appropriate manner in Oman.
