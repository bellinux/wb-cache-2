25|$|During {{the night}} of September 25, the fire emitted was quite {{extraordinary}} and accompanied by terrifying rumblings.

25|$|Thus <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> Redoubt No. 1, {{the last}} bastion on the Confederate left flank, was {{captured}} by troops coming from the north, south, and west. Stewart's corps had been wrecked by the day's fighting and retreated to {{a new line of}} defense a mile or two to the south. Rearguard actions by reinforcements from Lee's Corps kept the retreat from becoming a rout. With the collapse of the Confederate left, Cheatham's and Lee's Corps followed to the new line.|$|E

25|$|In 1575, French surgeon Ambroise Paré {{described}} an experiment {{to test the}} properties of the bezoar stone. At the time, the bezoar stone was deemed to be able to cure the effects of any poison, but Paré believed this was impossible. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> a cook at King's court was caught stealing fine silver cutlery and was sentenced to death by hanging. The cook agreed to be poisoned instead. Ambroise Paré then used the bezoar stone to no great avail, as the cook died in agony seven hours after taking poison. Paré had proved that the bezoar stone could not cure all poisons, contrary to popular belief at the time.|$|E
25|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> on a {{cold and}} wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a {{handsome}} young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden {{that the man was}} sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist him back to the village of the Pootatucks, where he might find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man nodded his assent, she slowly walked him to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, lest he collapse in the effort.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 1945, 144 RAC was redesignated 4th Royal Tank Regiment {{to replace}} the {{original}} 4 RTR, which had been captured at Tobruk in the North African Campaign in 1942. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> the band of the East Lancashire Regiment was touring the NW Europe theatre, so they played the regimental march for the final parade of 144 RAC on 28 February, to mark the original link with the 8th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment. The first parade of the new regiment the following day was inspected by Sir John Crocker, commander of I Corps and the most senior RTR officer in the theatre. The RTR band played the regimental march, My Boy Willie and each man wore a new black beret and RTR badge, specially sent from England by the Director, RAC. They also adopted the blue shoulder flash of 4 RTR.|$|E

25|$|Thus <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>that,</b> with Hermes {{as their}} guide, the three {{candidates}} {{bathed in the}} spring of Ida, then confronted Paris on Mount Ida in the climactic moment that is the crux of the tale. After failing to judge their beauty with their clothing on, the three goddesses stripped nude to convince Paris of their worthiness. While Paris inspected them, each attempted with her powers to bribe him; Hera offered to make him king of Europe and Asia, Athena offered wisdom and skill in war, and Aphrodite, who had the Charites and the Horai to enhance her charms with flowers and song (according to a fragment of the Cypria quoted by Athenagoras of Athens), offered the world's most beautiful woman (Euripides, Andromache, l.284, Helena l. 676). This was Helen of Sparta, wife of the Greek king Menelaus. Paris accepted Aphrodite's gift and awarded the apple to her, receiving Helen as well as the enmity of the Greeks and especially of Hera. The Greeks' expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War.|$|E

[...] Cho had intimidated female students by photographing their legs under their desks and by writing violent and obscene poetry.

[...] About six weeks after the semester began, Giovanni {{wrote a letter to}} then-department head Lucinda Roy, who removed Cho from the class. Roy alerted the student affairs office, the dean's office, and the campus police, but each office responded that there was nothing they could do if Cho made no overt threats against himself or others.

500|$|To {{help protect}} {{northern}} Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of Supermarine Spitfire fighters were {{transferred from the}} United Kingdom and became operational in March 1943 as No.1 Fighter Wing under Group Captain Allan Walters. A major engagement over Darwin on 2May resulted {{in the loss of}} five Spitfires during combat, and several others in forced landings owing to fuel starvation or engine failure, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. Bladin immediately ordered a retaliatory Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander Charles Read against Penfui airfield, on the assumption (correct as <b>it</b> <b>happened)</b> <b>that</b> this was where the Japanese raiders were based; four enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Between March and May 1943, the number of sorties flown by NWA's combat squadrons rose from 211 to 469. The Allies claimed a total of forty-six Japanese aircraft destroyed for the loss of thirty of their own on operations, seventeen to enemy action and thirteen from other causes. On 17June, under the command of Group Captain Clive Caldwell, No.1 Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires. The same month, the USAAF's 380thBombardment Group, consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under NWA's control, enhancing its strategic strike capability. [...] By this time, NWA headquarters staff numbered 385, including ninety-six officers.|$|E

He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
