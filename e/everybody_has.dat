5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that <b>everybody</b> <b>has,</b> so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

When every element in the population does have the same probability of selection, this is known as an 'equal probability of selection' (EPS) design. Such designs are also referred to as 'self-weighting' because all sampled units are given the same weight.|$|E

60|$|Wada and Henry, however, were tougher {{patients}} {{with which to}} deal. In the first place, Wada got in a bad funk. He was of the firm conviction that his star had set and that the Solomons would receive his bones. He saw that life about him was cheap. At Penduffryn he saw the ravages of dysentery, and, unfortunately for him, he saw one victim carried out on a strip of galvanized sheet-iron and dumped without coffin or funeral into {{a hole in the}} ground. <b>Everybody</b> <b>had</b> fever, <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> dysentery, <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> everything.

One night he hears a telephone ringing in someone's home, and suddenly realizes that someone else is alive on Mars. Missing the call, and several others, he sits down with a phone book of Mars and starts dialing at A.|$|E
25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that <b>everybody</b> <b>has,</b> it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E

Ester Raab, a survivor of the escape, recalled: [...] "The plan was, at 4 o’clock (pm), should start (the escape), <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> to kill his SS man, and his guard at his place of work."

500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{suggests}} {{that one of}} the reasons for Harrison's follow-up album, Extra Texture (Read All About It), being rushed into production in April 1975 was to [...] "redeem the artist from negative fallout" [...] created by Dark Horse over the winter of 1974–75. Having come up with little new material in the previous six months, Harrison revisited songs he had written or begun writing in 1973, one of which was titled [...] "World of Stone". While discussing the song in September 1975, with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Paul Gambaccini, Harrison commented: [...] "There's not much of a story to it ... it's really just down to saying that <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> their own opinion and right to be ...

500|$|Before New Amerykahs release, {{the album}} was {{tentatively}} called KahBa, which Badu derived from her name, as a reference to Islam and Kemetism. The title of the album series, New Amerykah, is a pun of Badu's name.

500|$|Josquin's fame lasted {{throughout}} the 16th century, and indeed increased {{for several decades}} after his death. Zarlino, writing in the 1580s, was still using examples from Josquin in his treatises on composition; and Josquin's fame was only eclipsed after {{the beginning of the}} Baroque era, with the decline of the pre-tonal polyphonic style. During the 18th and 19th centuries Josquin's fame was overshadowed by later Roman School composer Palestrina, whose music was seen as the summit of polyphonic refinement, and codified into a system of composition by theorists such as Johann Fux; however, during the 20th century, Josquin's reputation has grown steadily, to the point where scholars again consider him [...] "the greatest and most successful composer of the age." [...] According to Richard Sherr, writing in the introduction to the Josquin Companion, addressing specifically the shrinking of Josquin's canon due to correction of misattributions, [...] "Josquin will survive because his best music really is as magnificent as <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> always said it was." ...|$|E
