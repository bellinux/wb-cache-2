40|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>factors</b> {{based on}} the Korean {{population}} are required for making appropriate risk assessment. It is expected that handbooks for <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> will be applied in many fields, {{as well as by}} health department risk assessors. The present article describes the development of an <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> handbook that specifically focuses on human activities in situations involving the possible risk of exposure to environmental contaminants. We define majour <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> that represent behavioral patterns for risk assessment, including time spent on routine activities, in different places, on using transportation, and engaged in activities related to water contact including swimming, bathing and washing. Duration of residence and employment are also defined. National survey data were used to identify recommended levels of <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> in terms of time spent on routine activities and period of residence and employment. An online survey was conducted with 2073 subjects who were selected using a stratified random sampling method in order to develop a list of <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> for the time spent in different places and in performing water-related activities.

40|$|A set of <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> that {{reflects}} the characteristics of individual behavior capable of influencing exposure is essential for risk and exposure assessment. In 2007, the Korean <b>Exposure</b> <b>Factors</b> Handbook was, therefore, issued, driven {{by the need to}} develop reliable ex-posure factors representing the Korean population. The {{purpose of this study was}} to overview the development process of the Korean <b>Exposure</b> <b>Factors</b> Handbook and major recommended exposure values for the Korean population to allow information exchanges and comparison of recommended values among nations. The researchers reviewed the domestic data that could be used in the develop-ment of <b>exposure</b> <b>factors,</b> confirmed a knowledge gap, and set a priority of development by phases. A methodology to measure expo-sure factors was established to develop measuring techniques and test their validity.

The study thus produced recommended values for 24 <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> grouped by general expo-sure factors, food ingestion factors, and activity factors by setting up a database of <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> and carrying out statistical analysis. The study has significantly contributed to reducing the potential uncertainty of the risk and exposure assessment derived by the appli-cation of foreign data or research findings lacking representativeness or grounds by developing a set of <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> reflecting the characteristics of the Korean people.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) depends critically {{on the quality of}} input information that is available to the risk assessor and specifically on the probabilistic <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> distributions that are developed and used in the exposure and risk models. Deriving probabilistic distributions for model inputs can be time consuming and subjective. The absence of a standard approach for developing these distributions can result in PRAs that are inconsistent and difficult to review by regulatory agencies. We present an approach that reduces subjectivity in the distribution development process without limiting the flexibility needed to prepare relevant PRAs. The approach requires two steps. First, we analyze data pooled at a population scale to (1) identify the most robust demographic variables within the population for a given <b>exposure</b> <b>factor,</b> (2) partition the population data into subsets based on these variables, and (3) construct archetypal distributions for each subpopulation. Second, we sample from these archetypal distributions according to site- or scenario-specific conditions to simulate <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> values and use these values to construct the scenario-specific input distribution. It is envisaged that the archetypal distributions from step 1 will be generally applicable so risk assessors will not have to repeatedly collect and analyze raw data for each new assessment. We demonstrate the approach for two commonly used <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> [...] body weight (BW) and exposure duration (ED) [...] using data for the U. S. population. For these factors we provide a first set of subpopulation based archetypal distributions along with methodology for using these distributions to construct relevant scenario-specific probabilistic <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> distributions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Epidemiologists {{have long}} {{regarded}} relative risk (RR) {{as a key}} measure of association between two binary variables. Yet even when the sample {{is representative of the}} population, associations having a RR> 9 may have a relatively small value for Phi (φ <. 3). This paper provide additional reasons for using RR instead of φ. (1) Formulas relating φ and RR are derived. A relative φ 2 is constructed and is shown to equal the attributable fraction in the population (AFP). RR is shown to increase monotonically with this relative φ 2 for a given <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> prevalence (H). (2) Constructs are created to measure degrees of necessity (N) and sufficiency (S). Related formulas are derived. RR is shown to increase monotonically with N for a given <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> prevalence (H). (3) Coordinates that will always generate admissible results are discussed. (4) RR is a good measure of association between two binary variables because it increases monotonically with AFP, with a relative φ 2 and with N for a given <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> prevalence (H). In Appendix B, auxiliary identities are presented including a Bayes’ rule comparison, the over-involvement rule and the non-response bias effect size...|$|R
