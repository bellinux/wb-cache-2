40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this review is to name and {{describe}} the important factors of musculoskeletal strain originating from pushing and pulling tasks such as cart handling that are commonly found in industrial contexts. A literature database search was performed using the research platform Web of Science. For a study {{to be included in}} this review differences in measured or calculated strain had to be investigated with regard to: (1) cart weight/ load; (2) handle position and design; (3) exerted forces; (4) handling task (push and pull); or (5) task experience. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria and proved to be of adequate methodological quality {{by the standards of the}} Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research. External load or cart weight proved to be the most influential factor of strain. The ideal handle positions ranged from hip to shoulder height and were dependent on the strain factor that was focused on as well as the handling task. Furthermore, task experience and subsequently handling technique were also key to reducing strain. Workplace settings that regularly involve pushing and pulling should be checked for potential improvements with regards to lower weight of the loaded handling <b>device,</b> <b>handle</b> design, and good practice guidelines to further reduce musculoskeletal disease prevalence...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Longitudinal {{studies to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of rehabilitative therapies require an objective, reproducible and quantitative means for testing function in vivo. An fMRI assessment tool for upper extremity related brain activation using an MRI-compatible manipulandum was developed and tested for use in neurorehabilitation research. METHODS: Fifteen healthy, right-handed subjects participated in two fMRI sessions, which were {{three to four weeks}} apart. A block design paradigm, composed of three conditions of subject-passive movement, subject-active movement and rest, was employed for the fMRI recordings. During the rest condition, subjects simply held the <b>device</b> <b>handle</b> without applying any force or movement. The same type of auditory and visual instructions were given in all the three conditions, guiding the subjects to perform the motor tasks interactively with the MRI-compatible arm manipulandum. The tasks were controlled across the fMRI sessions. The subjects' brain activation was recorded by fMRI, and their behavioral performance was recorded by the manipulandum. The brain network activated by the subjects' interaction with the manipulandum was identified, and the reproducibility and reliability of the obtained activation were determined. RESULTS: All subjects completed the trial protocol. Two subjects were excluded from analysis due to head motion artifacts. All passive movements were performed well. Four out of the total 780 active movements were missed by two subjects. Brain activation was found in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex and non-primary motor cortex as well as in subcortical areas in the thalamus, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. These activations were consistent across the two fMRI sessions. CONCLUSION: The MRI-compatible manipulandum elicited robust and reproducible brain activations in healthy subjects during the subject-active and subject-passive upper extremity motor tasks with a block design paradigm. This system is promising for many applications in neurorehabilitation research and may be useful for longitudinal studies...|$|E
40|$|With {{a spatial}} haptic {{interface}} device and a suitable haptic rendering algorithm, users can explore and modify virtual geometries {{in three dimensions}} {{with the aid of}} their haptic (touch) sense. Designers of surgery simulators, anatomy exploration tools and applications that involve assembly of complex objects should consider employing this technology. However, in order to know how the technology behaves as a design material, the designer needs to become well acquainted with its material properties. This presents a significant challenge today, since the haptic devices are presented as black boxes, and implementation of advanced rendering algorithms represent highly specialized and time consuming development activities. In addition, {{it is difficult to imagine}} what an interface will feel like until it has been fully implemented, and important design trade-offs such as the virtual object's size and stability gets neglected. Traditional user-centered design can be interpreted as that the purpose of the field study phase is to generate a set of specifications for an interface, and only solutions that cover these specifications will be considered in the design phase. The designer might miss opportunities to create solutions that uses e. g. lower cost devices since that might require reinterpretation of the overarching goal of the situation with starting point in the technical possibilities, which is unlikely without significant material knowledge. As an example, a surgery simulator designed in this thesis required a high cost haptic device to render adequate forces on the scale of human teeth, but if the design goal is reinterpreted as creating a tool for learning anatomical differences and surgical steps, an application more suitable for the lower cost haptic devices could be crafted. This solution is as much informed by the haptic material "speaking back to" the designer as by field studies. This licentiate thesis will approach a perspective of spatial haptic interface design that is grounded in contemporary design theory. These theories emphasizes the role of the designer, who is not seen as an objective actor but as someone who has a desire to transform a situation into a preferred one as a service to a client or greater society. It also emphasizes the need for crafting skills in order to innovate, i. e. make designed objects real. Further, it considers aesthetic aspects of a design, which includes the subtle differences in friction as you move the <b>device</b> <b>handle,</b> and overall attractiveness of the device and system. The thesis will cover a number of design cases which will be related to design theory and reflected upon. Particular focus will be placed on the most common class of haptic devices which can give force feedback in three dimensions and give input in six (position and orientation). Forces will be computed and objects deformed by an volume sampling algorithm which will be discussed. Important design properties such as stiffness, have been identified and exposed as a material for design. A tool for tuning these properties interactively has been developed to assist designers to become acquainted with the spatial haptic material and to craft the material for a particular user experience. Looking forward, the thesis suggests the future work of making spatial haptic interfaces more design ready, both in software and hardware. This is proposed to be accomplished through development of toolkits for innovation which encapsulate complexities and exposes design parameters. A particular focus will be placed on enabling crafting with the haptic material whose natural limitations should be seen as suggestions rather than hinders for creating valuable solutions.
