Additional 50million kuna (6.7million euro) was required to build the connecting motorway section north of Goričan interchange.|$|E
25|$|Contracts for {{the project}} were awarded {{to some of the}} biggest and most reputed {{construction}} firms in India, including Larsen & Toubro, Gammon India and AFCONS. To enable quicker construction, several innovative practices were adopted. Piers for major bridges were cast on the riverbanks itself and launched using cranes mounted on pontoons. The technique of <b>incremental</b> <b>launching</b> of bridge spans was used {{for the first time in}} India. Since it would take too long to complete the project using locally available tunnelling technology, nine hydraulic tunnelling machines were imported from Sweden in order to bore through the hard rock of the Sahayadris. The biggest challenge, however, came from the nine tunnels that had to be bored through soft soil. No technology existed anywhere in the world for this purpose and the work had to be carried out through a painstakingly slow manual process. Excavation was almost impossible due to the clayey soil that was saturated with water owing to a high water table in the region. Several times tunnels collapsed immediately after they had been dug, necessitating work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost while constructing the soft soil tunnels alone. In all, seventy-four people perished during the construction of the line.|$|E

40|$|A {{fractionated}} spacecraft is {{a satellite}} architecture {{for which the}} functional capabilities of a conventional spacecraft are distributed across multiple modules (spacecrafts) which fly separately and interact through wireless links. Removing the physical dependencies between the resources, or subsystems, of a spacecraft, brings several attributes, such as flexibility and robustness, which can be exploited {{for the benefit of}} the earth observation payloads. In this manner, an infrastructure network which is composed of resource modules can be put into a sun-synchronous orbit for the benefit of such payloads. However, fractionating a spacecraft and letting the different subsystems fly separately leads to several technological concerns which are related to the shared resources within the fractionated spacecraft network. Regarding these technology implications, collision free close proximity cluster flying configurations were evaluated initially. Then a realization approaches were also discussed via system analysis for shared resources, namely guidance, navigation and control, communications, data handling and power. Notional spacecraft architecture was determined in the light of these discussions and the sizing of the modules within this architecture was made based on an <b>incremental</b> <b>launch,</b> or one module per launch, approach. Finally it was concluded that the resource capability increase is more efficient in terms of data storage and processing when compared to wireless power transfer.

40|$|<b>Incremental</b> bridge <b>launching</b> {{is one of}} {{the many}} ways in which a bridge can be constructed. In The Netherlands this method is not often used. This may be {{explained}} by the fact, that there are not many suitable locations for application of this method. <b>Incremental</b> bridge <b>launching</b> is profitable for long bridges and can only be used for straight bridges or when the superstructure has a constant horizontal and vertical radius throughout the length. However, when the preconditions for use of this method are met, <b>incremental</b> bridge <b>launching</b> can be a great solution for bridge design. Ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) is a new concrete. In contrast to regular reinforced concrete, UHPFRC contains fibers to provide for the capacity that is necessary when the concrete is loaded in tension. However, as for incrementally launched bridges, its application is limited as of yet. One explanation for the reluctance to use the material, is that compared to regular concrete, the cost of production are many times higher. To make economical designs using UHPFRC, the high cost of production need to be recovered by material savings, when a structure is executed or during its lifetime. The aim of this thesis is to identify whether a superstructure designed in UHPFRC can increase the application range of <b>incremental</b> bridge <b>launching</b> in The Netherlands, and to explore whether the concept can compete with other bridge designs. In order to make a statement, a case study approach is used. It concerns the launch of the eastern approach bridge of the bridge over “Het Pannerdensch Kanaal”, designed in UHPFRC. The location suits <b>incremental</b> bridge <b>launching</b> perfectly, as there is a constant horizontal and vertical curvature in the alignment for over 550 meters. The most favorable cross-section for incrementally launched bridges is a box girder. A comprehensive analysis on the cross-sectional capacity of a prestressed box girder, designed with different concrete strength classes, is performed to optimize the shape. The design of a box girder takes a special procedure, where both the transverse and longitudinal directions are considered separately. Transverse bending moments and shear forces, due to mobile loading, are obtained with influence surfaces and the differential equation of the Euler-Bernoulli bending beam. For the longitudinal direction, a spreadsheet is developed to identify the bending moments and shear forces that occur during launch and service life. The force method for analysis of indeterminate structures is used to determine the governing bending moments for this multiple span bridge. Also, the sheet contains parts to determine the required amount of central and continuity prestressing and to optimize the length of the steel nose to reduce the peak moments during launch. The use of UHPFRC in the design of a structure requires a special approach. Requirements regarding quality control are strict and need to be prescribed to allow on-site production. The typical characteristics of UHPFRC have an important impact on the execution and production cycle of the incrementally launched bridge, which is therefore investigated. The case study is used to investigate the competitiveness of the design. Cost of production and execution are integrated into a price per cubic meter of concrete and compared to the design of The Zeeburgerbrug, which was launched and built with regular concrete. Efficient use of UHPFRC allows a light box girder design, which can be launched without auxiliary supports. Conventional and shear reinforcement are not necessary. Transverse and longitudinal prestressing provide sufficient bending moment capacity, while the fibers contribute to a huge shear capacity that is more than enough to withstand the shear forces. The required amount of central and continuity prestressing does not fit in the concrete cross-section. Therefore, all tendons are applied externally. The anchors and deviators will not fit in the concrete cross-section either. The cost comparison shows, that a lot of the higher cost of production of UHPFRC can already be compensated during the design and construction phases. The remaining part of the higher cost of production of UHPFRC need to be compensated differently, for instance by savings in maintenance cost due to better durability properties or by a lighter substructure, as we are able to generate proper savings in the amount of concrete for the superstructure. The case study proves that when the superstructure is considered only, it might be hard to design and execute the UHPFRC box girder more economically than the design of The Zeeburgerbrug. However, when we consider the total bridge over the entire service life, we might have a competitive design. Alternative bridge designs, that use different construction techniques should be developed to assess the competitiveness of the incrementally launched UHPFRC box girder for that location.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the {{issues associated with}} and presents a modeling framework for long-term capacity planning problems constrained {{in a similar fashion}} to satellite capacity acquisition. Although ambiguities exist, the satellite capacity planning problem also contains many clearly defined constraints. In the immediate time horizon, universal satellite capacity is fixed, as satellite launches are rare, and each <b>incremental</b> satellite <b>launch</b> only marginally increases capacity. In the world of Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM), satellites have fixed coverage areas as they are typically in geo-synchronous orbit. Other military applications such as observation and satellite phone require, low-earth orbit and medium-earth orbit satellites. The contracts used to acquire satellite capacity from the commercial sector also clearly define constraints, such as start and end date, bandwidth, price per unit bandwidth and allocated satellite system, which also implies frequency and available capacity. The paper first reviews the issues involved with planning capacity acquisition, and then presents a modeling framework for developing strategies to meet criteria and minimize cost. A simulation environment is developed for testing contracts and satellites of different parameters against varying demand distributions. A dynamic program is used to solve the integer program associated with selecting satellite capacity levels to cover demand. by John M. Lydiard, IV. Thesis: S.
