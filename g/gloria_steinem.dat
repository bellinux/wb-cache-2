She blamed the NOI for the previous attempt to kill him, arguing that they were angered by his claim to be Allah and thus above Elijah Muhammad. Clarence13X also received coverage from international media, including a Canadian television program.|$|E

She was famously and controversially photographed sitting on an anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist. In 2005, she, Robin Morgan and <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem</b> co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices {{of women in the}} media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content.

5|$|Dworkin {{authored}} ten {{books of}} radical feminist theory and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to assert {{the presence of}} and denounce institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She {{became one of the}} most influential writers and spokeswomen of American radical feminism during the late 1970s and the 1980s. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not merely a fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution as a system of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of subordination in patriarchy. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem,</b> John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Dworkin is {{most often}} remembered {{for her role as}} a speaker, writer, and activist in the feminist anti-pornography movement. In February 1976, Dworkin took a leading role in {{organizing}} public pickets of Snuff in New York City and, during the fall, joined Adrienne Rich, Grace Paley, <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem,</b> Shere Hite, Lois Gould, Barbara Deming, Karla Jay, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Robin Morgan, and Susan Brownmiller in attempts to form a radical feminist antipornography group. Members of this group would go on to found Women Against Pornography in 1979, but by then Dworkin had begun to distance herself from the group over differences in approach. Dworkin spoke at the first Take Back the Night march in November 1978, and joined 3,000 women in a march through the red-light district of San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} {{popularity is}} linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of the}} most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She has been written about by scholars and journalists interested in gender and feminism, such as <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem,</b> Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.|$|E
25|$|Media focus {{would fall}} on feminists grading {{each other on}} {{personality}} and appearance, the source of Betty Friedan and <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem's</b> well-documented antipathy. In February 2006, shortly after Friedan's death, the feminist writer Germaine Greer published an article in The Guardian, in which she described Friedan as pompous and egotistic, somewhat demanding and sometimes selfish, citing several incidents during a 1972 tour of Iran.|$|R
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the February 2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary, Ratajkowski {{spoke at}} a Bernie Sanders rally in New Hampshire to endorse his campaign. One of the main points of her speech, and her social media {{activity}} surrounding it, was to counter <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem's</b> statement that young female Sanders supporters were involved in the campaign (rather than supporting fellow female Hillary Clinton) to meet potential male romantic partners.|$|R
50|$|The refounded group {{published}} a journal, Feminist Revolution. A nearly complete anthology of articles from the journal {{was published in}} 1979 by Random House. The anthology omits a controversial report on <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem's</b> involvement with a liberal youth group that was later revealed to have been funded by the CIA. The anthology's publication created a lasting rift between members of Redstockings and feminists who were close to Steinem.|$|R

2500|$|Empowered by The Feminine Mystique, new feminist activists of the 1970s {{addressed}} {{more political}} and sexual {{issues in their}} writing, including <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem's</b> Ms. magazine and Kate Millett's Sexual Politics. Millett's bleak survey of male writers, their attitudes and biases, to demonstrate that sex is politics, and politics is power imbalance in relationships. [...] Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex described a revolution based in Marxism, referenced as the [...] "sex war". Considering the debates over patriarchy, she claimed that male domination dated to [...] "back beyond recorded history to the animal kingdom itself".|$|R
40|$|These essays from <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem’s</b> {{first three}} decades of work offer a {{portrait}} of a woman who was not only one of the savviest leaders of the women’s liberation movement, but also a profoundly humane thinker with a wide-ranging intellect and irresistible wit. In “If Men Could Menstruate,” Steinem engages readers in a flight of imagination as incisive as it is hilarious. She offers first-person journalism in her underground exposé “I Was a Playboy Bunny,” provides heartbreaking memoir in the story of her mother’s struggles in “Ruth’s Song,” and stakes important positions in feminist theory in “Erotica vs. Pornography. ” This is Steinem at her most provocative—and most compassionate.

25|$|Critics of Schlafly saw her {{advocacy}} against {{equal rights}} and {{her role as}} a working professional as a contradiction. <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem</b> and author Pia de Solenni, among others, considered it ironic that in Schlafly's role as an advocate for the full-time mother and wife, she herself was a lawyer, newsletter editor, touring speaker, and political activist.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the year}} that <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem's</b> Ms. {{magazine}} was launched in the US and Cleo in Australia, the song quickly {{captured the imagination of}} the burgeoning woman's movement. National Organization for Woman founder Betty Friedan was later to write that in 1973, a gala entertainment night in Washington DC at the NOW annual convention closed with the playing of [...] "I Am Woman". [...] "Suddenly," [...] she said, [...] "woman got out of their seats and started dancing around the hotel ballroom and joining hands in a circle that got larger and larger until maybe a thousand of us were dancing and singing, 'I am strong, I am invincible, I am woman.'

5000|$|Backlash is Susan Faludi's 550 page {{analysis}} of social, {{economic and political}} inequities and resulting difficulties American women faced in the 1980s. The book was hailed as [...] "the most vehement and unapologetic call to arms to issue from the feminist camp in many years", and [...] "a rich compendium of fascinating information and an indictment of a system losing its grip..." [...] that [...] "has already done much to ignite a revolutionary [...] "national" [...] consciousness". [...] Published {{within a year of}} several other popular feminist writings - Naomi Wolf's The Beauty Myth (1990), <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem's</b> Revolution From Within (1992), and Marilyn French's The War Against Women (1992) - Faludi's book garnered front page attention in national newspapers and magazines, and interviews of its author on television and radio. As a best-seller, Backlash rejuvenated feminist discussion in the media, and established Faludi as a leading spokesperson for women's issues in the 1990s.|$|R

25|$|With the {{publication}} of Ordeal in 1980, Boreman joined the anti-pornography movement. At a press conference announcing Ordeal, she leveled many of the above-noted accusations against Traynor in public for the first time. She was joined by supporters Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon, <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem,</b> and members of Women Against Pornography. Boreman spoke out against pornography, stating {{that she had been}} abused and coerced. She spoke before feminist groups, at colleges, and at government hearings on pornography.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's uncompromising {{positions}} and forceful style {{of writing and}} speaking, described by Robert Campbell as [...] "apocalyptic", earned her frequent comparisons to other speakers such as MalcolmX (by Robin Morgan, Susie Bright, and others). <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem</b> repeatedly compared her style {{to that of the}} Biblical prophets; Susan Brownmiller recalls her Take Back the Night speech in 1978: ...|$|E
5000|$|In the clip, Lopez plays {{a number}} of archetypal characters, including: a news anchor who urges women to [...] "rise up against their male oppressors", a 1950s housewife, a 1960s secretary, an underpaid factory worker in the 1970s (her hotheaded boss played by actor Eric Womack), and a 1980s businesswoman. It opens with the news anchor Lopez having a heated {{conversation}} in a phone booth, stating: [...] "I'm tired, I've been working all day! No, I can't...you should it". She then appears in a television news studio, where part of Hillary Clinton's famous 1995 [...] "Women's Rights Are Human Rights" [...] speech, followed by part of Patricia Arquette's Academy Award speech (specifically Arquette saying, [...] "It's our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights {{for women in the}} United States of America"), followed by part of <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem's</b> famous 1971 [...] "Address to the Women of America" [...] speech, can be heard in the background. Lopez disregards the script and begins speaking: [...] "Look, I don’t have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. Taken for granted, ignored, overlooked, under-appreciated." ...|$|R
5000|$|Faludi was {{inspired}} to write Backlash after investigating the statistics behind a 1986 Newsweek cover story that reported on a Harvard-Yale study detailing the bleak marital prospects for single, educated career women. The statistics were in error and did not reflect the reality, so Faludi began to examine other sensationalized stories about women that were being promoted by the media. She believes that her book started {{to attract the attention}} it did because women relegated to - and writing for - the arts and culture sections of journals and newspapers, frustrated with internal job discrimination and believing the book addressed the problem, helped to get initial coverage. [...] Faludi also says the 1991 fall publishing date was an advantage because during the originally planned spring date [...] "we {{were in the middle of}} a war, it was boys' time" [...] and the book [...] "would have dropped like a stone", whereas the [...] "fall was girls' time because of Anita Hill." [...] As well, two publishing companies, Crown Publishing Group (Faludi's Backlash) and Little, Brown and Company (<b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem's</b> Revolution From Within) made an unusual decision to promote the two books together, which proved commercially successful in heightening attention for the authors, the books, and the subject matter. Faludi and Steinem were together on the cover of Time, in ads, in interviews and in the [...] "reams of commentary on both books".|$|R
500|$|Three {{songs were}} played during the ending credits {{which were not}} {{included}} on the V for Vendetta soundtrack. The first was [...] "Street Fighting Man" [...] by the Rolling Stones. The second was a special version of Ethan Stoller's [...] "BKAB". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from [...] "On Black Power" [...] (also in [...] "A Declaration of Independence") by black nationalist leader Malcolm X, and from [...] "Address to the Women of America" [...] by feminist writer <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem</b> {{were added to the}} song. <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem</b> can be heard saying: [...] "This is no simple reform... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends." [...] The final song was [...] "Out of Sight" [...] by Spiritualized.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} said that few, if any, First Ladies worked as {{consistently}} before marrying as did Pat Nixon. As she told the writer <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem</b> during the 1968 presidential campaign, [...] "I never had time to think about things like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1980, Linda Boreman (who had {{appeared}} in the pornographic film Deep Throat as [...] "Linda Lovelace") made public statements that her ex-husband Chuck Traynor had beaten and raped her, and violently coerced her into making that and other pornographic films. Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, with Dworkin, feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon, and members of Women Against Pornography. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem,</b> and Boreman began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of Deep Throat. Boreman was interested, but backed off after Steinem discovered that the statute of limitations for a possible suit had passed.|$|E
500|$|In June 2000, Dworkin {{published}} controversial {{articles in}} the New Statesman and in the Guardian, stating that one or more men had raped her in her hotel room in Paris the previous year, putting GHB in her drink to disable her. Her articles ignited public controversy when writers such as Catherine Bennett and Julia Gracen published doubts about her account, polarizing opinion between skeptics and supporters such as Catharine MacKinnon, Katharine Viner, and <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem.</b> Her reference to the incident was later described by Charlotte Raven as a [...] "widely disbelieved claim", better seen as [...] "a kind of artistic housekeeping". Emotionally fragile and in failing health, Dworkin mostly withdrew from public life for two years following the articles.|$|E
500|$|Millett won the Best Books Award for Mother Millett from Library Journal in 2001. In 2012, she {{was awarded}} {{one of that}} year's Courage Award for the Arts by Yoko Ono, which Ono created to [...] "recognize artists, musicians, collectors, curators, writers—those who sought the truth in their work and {{had the courage to}} stick to it, no matter what" [...] and [...] "honor their work as an {{expression}} of my vision of courage". Between 2011 and 2012, she was also awarded the Lambda Pioneer Award for Literature and a $25,000 visual arts grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts.

500|$|Dose {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} Furtado's new [...] "highly sexualized" [...] image was manufactured, and noted the {{involvement in the}} album's development of Geffen's Jimmy Iovine, who helped to develop the Pussycat Dolls, a girl group known for their sexually suggestive dance routines. The writer also criticised Furtado's discussion of her buttocks and apparent rejection of feminism in a Blender magazine interview, writing: [...] "Girls, do you hear that churning? Those are the ideas of <b>Gloria</b> <b>Steinem</b> turning in their grave." [...] A writer for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said that cynics could attribute Furtado's commercial success with Loose to her [...] "amped-up sex appeal." [...] The writer added that, the failure of Janet Jackson's album Damita Jo (2004) indicated such a move was not infallible. Furtado was [...] "still demure compared to many of her competitors"—she avoided sporting lingerie or performing [...] "Christina Aguilera-style gyrations or calisthenics" [...] in the [...] "Promiscuous" [...] and [...] "Maneater" [...] videos. [...] "Despite its dramatic arrival ... Furtado's new image doesn’t feel calculated", he said. [...] " [...] seems to be thinking less and feeling more, {{to the benefit of}} her music." ...|$|E
