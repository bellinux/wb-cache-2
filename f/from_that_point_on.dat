5|$|A {{major change}} in the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|Dylan first {{performed}} the song live on November 21, 1978, in El Paso, Texas, and again, two days later, in Norman, Oklahoma. He {{did not play}} it in concert again until July 19, 1987, in Eugene, Oregon; <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> he has often included the song in his sets. According to his official website, as of November 2017 Dylan has {{performed the}} song exactly 500 times.|$|E
5|$|García {{moved in}} with his uncle Pedro Ortiz when his parents divorced. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> his uncle brought him to Arena México, home of Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), for whom Ortiz worked at the time. Whole {{spending}} time backstage he would be introduced {{to the other side}} of professional wrestling, being trained from a very early age by all three of his uncles.|$|E
50|$|In 1918 Procter and {{his wife}} {{returned}} to Newlyn, where they primarily lived <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> forward. <b>On</b> 21 October 1935, after years of high blood pressure, Procter died of a cerebral haemorrhage in North Shields while travelling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Otherwise," [...] {{continued}} the lawyer, [...] "the telegram {{would not have}} come <b>from</b> <b>that</b> far-away <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the Pacific coast. There now remain five other places where Colonel Weatherby might be located. The chances are, however, {{that he is not}} in any of them." ...|$|R
50|$|All {{naturally}} occurring crystals contain disordered areas (defects). Scientific descriptions typically assume a perfect crystal, extrapolating <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> based <b>on</b> defect prevalence. However, given sufficient defects, extrapolation from perfect crystals fails. Amorphous materials may display regions with atoms in repeating patterns, but without crystalline order. This means that their properties cannot {{be inferred from}} those of a perfect crystal.|$|R
5|$|Until early 2000, Fantastic Light raced in the colours of Maktoum Al Maktoum and {{was trained}} by Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk. His {{ownership}} was {{then transferred to}} Godolphin Racing, and he was trained <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> by Saeed bin Suroor.|$|E
5|$|According to news reports, {{the first}} {{passenger}} trains {{left the city}} at 9:00am, and continued running throughout the day. Around 10:00am, General W. S. Hancock arrived and was followed by 360–400 federal troops from New York and Fort Monroe, who relieved those guarding Camden Station. They brought with them two 12 pounder artillery pieces. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> {{the men of the}} 5th and the federal troops took turns guarding the station.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} I-96 concurrency, I-69 changes {{cardinal}} orientation and is signed as east–west <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on.</b> The freeway continues {{parallel to the}} Looking Glass River through suburban areas north of Capital Region International Airport. North of East Lansing, I-69 meets US127 at a cloverleaf interchange. East of that junction, I-69 turns southeasterly passing the Hawk Hollow Golf Course and Park Lake {{on the way to}} meet the eastern end of BL I-69 just north of Lake Lansing. I-69 then turns northeasterly parallel to Lansing Road (Old M-78) to enter Shiawassee County. The freeway continues through Central Michigan farmlands, jogging north of Perry and Bancroft.|$|E
50|$|While {{commanding}} a trawler {{to aid the}} French evacuations in 1940, he {{was captured}} and was detained in the concentration camp at Aintree. His poems <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> onwards centred <b>on</b> {{the sea and the}} war.|$|R
50|$|Analytically, an ellipse {{may also}} {{be defined as the}} set of <b>points</b> such <b>that</b> the ratio of the {{distance}} of each <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the curve from a given point (called a focus or focal point) to the distance <b>from</b> <b>that</b> same <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the curve to a given line (called the directrix) is a constant. This ratio is called the eccentricity of the ellipse.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} 4.2BSD release came in August 1983. It was notable as {{the first}} version released after the 1982 departure of Bill Joy to co-found Sun Microsystems; Mike Karels and Marshall Kirk McKusick took on leadership roles within the project <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> forward. <b>On</b> a lighter note, it also marked the debut of BSD's daemon mascot in a drawing by John Lasseter that appeared {{on the cover of}} the printed manuals distributed by USENIX.|$|R
5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|As a male-line {{grandchild}} of the British monarch, Victoria Melita {{bore the}} royal arms, with an inescutcheon for Saxony, the whole differenced by a label of five points argent, the outer pair bearing hearts gules, the inner pair anchors azure, {{and the central}} point a cross gules. In 1917, the inescutcheon was dropped by royal warrant. Her arms <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> are duplicated {{in the arms of}} Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic {{made its way}} to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would {{have to take care of}} 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on)</b> would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E
5000|$|Although Throssell {{was officially}} exonerated, {{his career was}} stymied <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> onwards. <b>On</b> ASIO's advice he was {{repeatedly}} denied access to highly classified documents, and was refused promotion in the then Department of External Affairs. In 1955, the Secretary of the Department, Arthur Tange, even wrote to the Solicitor-General asking if there were grounds for having Throssell dismissed from the Public Service; the reply said that [...] "no charge against Throssell could possibly succeed". Nevertheless, the smears and suspicion continued unabated and Tange maintained a correspondence with ASIO about Throssell.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, {{the most}} common use of {{degaussing}} was in CRT-based TV sets and computer monitors. For example, many monitors use a metal plate {{near the front of}} the tube to guide the electron beams from the back. This plate, the shadow mask, can pick up strong external fields and <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> produce discoloration <b>on</b> the display.|$|R
5|$|On 28 May 1848 a line opened between Irvine and Busbie, about 2miles (3km) north-west of Kilmarnock; a short {{branch to}} Irvine Harbour {{opened on the}} same day. The Cumnock line as far as Auchinleck and the Muirkirk branch <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> opened <b>on</b> 9 August. This {{included}} the Ballochmyle Viaduct, located near Catrine; it was built with a central span of 181feet (55.2m) and 175feet (53.3m) high above the River Ayr. It was the largest masonry arch span {{in the world at}} the time of its completion, and is the highest railway bridge in Britain.|$|R
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> the Colts {{took over}} the game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts {{defensive}} back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 yards to the Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive Dominic Rhodes runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the game was over.|$|E
5|$|He went to Primary School in St. Annes Primary School, Navan. Brosnan's father {{abandoned}} the family when Pierce was an infant. When {{he was four}} years old, his mother moved to London {{to work as a}} nurse. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> he was largely brought up by his grandparents, Philip and Kathleen Smith. After their deaths, he lived with an aunt and then an uncle, but was subsequently sent to live in a boarding house run by a woman named Eileen.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, {{she won the}} 110-, 220-, and 440-yard treble at the Australian Championships in {{the absence}} of her main rivals, but <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> her career was plagued by illness and weight problems. She was {{selected}} in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games purely as a relay swimmer, winning gold in the event. At her second Olympic Games, the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, she only competed in the 4 × 100 relay heats; her teammates went on to win silver in the final. She retired from competitive swimming following the Rome Olympics.|$|E

50|$|In the 2012-13 season, Frans {{sustained}} {{a knee injury}} in training that caused him to miss {{the start of the}} season. After being sidelined for a month, Frans made his first appearance of the season, in a 2-0 loss against Mechelen on 16 February 2013. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> Frans went <b>on</b> to make nine appearance {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|R
5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> {{was more of a}} political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car {{in which}} Baba was being driven went {{out of control and}} a second serious {{automobile}} accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> he was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move. In fact, during his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E
5|$|The 1938–39 NHL season saw the NHL {{move back}} to a single division, and <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the Cup was awarded to the playoff runner-up. The Cup was not {{formally}} awarded from 1939 to 1943 {{and it would not}} be until 1944 that the winning teams from that period were inscribed on the trophy. At the end of the 1949–50 NHL season the trophy was retired and has not been awarded since. It is now {{in the collection of the}} Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario and is on display with other historic trophies in the entrance to the Panasonic Hometown Hockey exhibit.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to 1998, Highway 118's western {{terminus}} was Highway 169 in Glen Orchard, {{making the}} total road length 116.1 km <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> to Haliburton. <b>On</b> January 1, 1998, 26.6 km of Highway 118, between Highway 169 and Highway 11 was redesignated as Muskoka Regional Road 118 West. A majority of that route is also cosigned as the Frank Miller Memorial Route.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{hearing about}} this plea, Li Siyuan ordered a withdrawal. It was said <b>that</b> <b>from</b> this <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> Dingnan viewed the {{imperial}} government lightly, such that whenever there were rebellions against the imperial government, {{it would get}} in communications with the rebels to demand bribes in order to aid them against the imperial government.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first version}} of the opening episode was {{recorded}} at Lime Grove Studios {{on the evening of}} 27 September 1963, following a week of rehearsals. The second attempt at the opening episode was recorded on 18 October, with the following three episodes being recorded weekly <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> onwards <b>on</b> 25 October, 1 November and 8 November. As with much British television of the era, the episodes were predominantly videotaped [...] "as live", with little scope for re-takes or breaks in recording. This left room for the many mistakes that are evident in the serial, but did allow the episodes to be completed very quickly.|$|R
5|$|The Longhorns scored ten{{touchdown}}s {{in their}} first elevenpossessions. They started with first-quarter touchdowns by Henry Melton and Jamaal Charles. The Buffaloes got their only score of the game, a field goal, {{at the start of}} the secondquarter. Vince Young, Limas Sweed, David Thomas, and Jamaal Charles scored touchdowns in the secondquarter to give the Horns a 42–3 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Selvin Young, Charles and Melton each scored rushing touchdowns. Brandon Foster scored a touchdown on defense due to Michael Griffin blocking a Colorado punt. Halfway through the third quarter, Texas already had 70 points, but went on cruise control <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> and did not score again.|$|E
5|$|VfL Wolfsburg {{purchased}} Rodríguez as a 19-year-old on 13 January 2012 for £7.5 {{million with}} the player signing a four-and-a-half-year deal. He quickly asserted {{himself into the}} first-team lineup, making his Bundesliga debut the next day against 1. FC Köln, a 1–0 victory for the Wolves. Rodríguez went on to play every {{game of the season}} <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> without being substituted, becoming a favorite on the left of the defense for manager Felix Magath.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} death of Malamir in 836, the Bulgarian throne passed to Presian I (836–852), who too was likely underage. As {{evidenced by the}} Presian Inscription from Philippi, Isbul retained his position as kavhan and his decisive influence in the Bulgarian court. In 837, the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani (Smolenoi), who inhabited the lower Nestos (Mesta) River and Western Thrace near Drama, rose against their Byzantine rulers. The inscription of Philippi mentions large-scale Bulgarian activity in the lands of the Smolyani. The Bulgarian forces were led by Isbul, {{as well as the}} ichirgu-boil (commander of the capital garrison) and the head priest. As the inscription is damaged, it is unclear who Presian and Isbul supported in that conflict. However, during this campaign the Bulgarian army conquered most of Macedonia including Philippi, where the inscription was found. <b>From</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on,</b> Isbul disappears from the sources, and there is no information about the date and circumstances of his death.|$|E
50|$|On 15 October 1849, {{the line}} was opened from Dumfries to Closeburn, and on 20 May 1850, the final section was opened from Closeburn to Horsecleugh, where an end-on {{junction}} was made with the GPK&AR, which opened <b>from</b> Auchinleck to <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the same day. There was no station at Horsecleugh; it was probably an arbitrary boundary point. its location {{is thought to be}} at the Dumfries Road bridge.|$|R

Originally, new episodes premiered on Mondays, but from July 28, 2011, they were shown <b>on</b> Thursdays <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> onward. <b>On</b> November 24, 2011, the show received a new set (before that, the set was {{a house with a}} Super Mario Bros.-themed background on the wall). February 2, 2012 was the last appearance of Alison Whitney on the show. After Alison's departure, Gary's counterpart Dark Gary (also played by Culig) was promoted from recurring character to Alison's replacement as co-host. Nintendo Week also filled in various guest co-hosts alongside Gary and Dark Gary from the week beginning February 16, 2012.|$|R
50|$|Sometime in October 2005, ACPSI {{addressed}} their paradigm first collective panel at the Association for the Study of African-American Life and History (ASALH) Conference in Pittsburgh {{and made}} plans <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> forward <b>on</b> continuing the collectivization {{and organization of}} the Institute. Interspersed between conference sessions and presentations, we held working sessions on the Institute. Floyd Beachum developed the Organizational Diagram. Robert Smith developed the mission statement and an initial conceptual agenda of relative subject matter to the Institute. Zachery Williams was elected as the first {{executive director of the}} Institute largely stemming from the promotion of his vision of an integrated think-tank and policy advocacy institution and his background in black intellectualism.|$|R
