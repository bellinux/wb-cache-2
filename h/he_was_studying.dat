5|$|The storyline in Dark Forces follows Kyle Katarn (voiced by Nick Jameson), a Human {{mercenary}} {{employed by}} the Rebel Alliance. Before the game begins, Katarn was a student learning the skills required to follow in his father's career of agricultural mechanics.

5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>studying</b> {{the relationship between}} the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Major-thirds tuning was {{introduced}} in 1964 by jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>studying</b> with Gunther Schuller, whose twelve-tone technique was invented for atonal composition by his teacher, ArnoldSchoenberg. Patt was also inspired by the free jazz of OrnetteColeman and JohnColtrane. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation using twelve-tones, he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, perhaps in 1963. To achieve the E-E open-string range of standard (Spanish) tuning, Patt started using seven-string guitars in 1963, before settling on eight-string guitars with high G (equivalently A) as their highest open-notes. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of {{his work as a}} session musician after 1965 in New York. Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds tuning.|$|E
5|$|Born in Isleworth, Greater London, Mousinho {{was signed}} by then Brentford manager Martin Allen during the 2005–06 season, after {{returning}} from the United States where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>studying</b> and playing at the University of Notre Dame. He was recommended to Brentford by Martin Allen's son, having previously been on the books at Chesham United. He made his Brentford debut in October 2005 in a 1–1 against Oxford United in the Football League Trophy; playing the whole match. He made his league debut for the club two months later in a 4–1 away win over Tranmere Rovers, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute. Initially he acted as cover for regular right-back Kevin O'Connor, but was then played in a central midfield role. He was also the outfield player chosen to play as goalkeeper against Gillingham in 2006, when Clark Masters was sent-off, {{and there was not}} a substitute goalkeeper available; the game ended 2–2 with Mousinho playing 75 minutes in goal.|$|E
5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>studying</b> medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E
