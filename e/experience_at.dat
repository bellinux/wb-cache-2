5|$|A Harry Potter themed {{attraction}} at a Universal Studios park or a Disney {{park was}} rumored in 2003. However, {{the rights to}} the Harry Potter franchise had been acquired by Warner Bros., who denied all the rumors. In 2001, Time Warner used this license to construct and operate the Harry Potter Movie Magic <b>Experience</b> <b>at</b> Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia. The attraction was a small indoor walkthrough featuring many re-creations of locations in the first two movies. After two years of operation this attraction was removed.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was {{the busy}} trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of <b>experience.</b> <b>At</b> this time a genuine non-anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Division commander, Major General William F. Dean {{determined}} that the 21st Infantry Regiment was the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments. Dean decided to send the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion from the formation because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bradford Smith, was the most experienced leading man, having <b>experience</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft airlifted one battalion from the division garrison under Smith's command into Korea. The battalion deployed quickly to block advancing North Korean forces, performing a holding action {{while the rest of}} the division could be moved to South Korea by sea.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Safi Thomas {{founded the}} Hip-Hop Dance Conservatory (HHDC) in New York City. Thomas' {{goal was to}} provide a {{comprehensive}} education to hip-hop dancers that was comparable to what ballet, modern, and jazz dancers <b>experience</b> <b>at</b> their respective institutions. HHDC provides a formal curriculum with dance classes (breaking, freestyle, locking, etc.) and academic classes (dance theory, physiology, kinesiology, etc.) to people who want to pursue hip-hop dance as a career. It is the only educational institution in the United States that is exclusively dedicated to hip-hop dance instruction. HHDC does not grant degrees. It is a non-profit organization and repertory company that grants certifications to dancers that complete the three-year program.|$|E
5|$|In July 1904, The Judd School {{participated in}} the Pupil Teachers Scheme on an {{experimental}} basis. Established in the 1902 Education Act, students would receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years training, splitting their time between a Pupil Teachers Centre and practical <b>experience</b> <b>at</b> elementary and secondary schools. The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War. When the school became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1918. In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988. According to the 2009 school prospectus, there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and maintenance staff.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's <b>experience</b> <b>at</b> Versailles was {{influential}} in shaping his future outlook, {{yet it was}} not a successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world.|$|E
5|$|Knowles {{teamed with}} America's Second Harvest and Pastor Rudy Rasmus of St. John United Methodist Church for a pre-concert food {{donation}} drive which {{was part of}} The Beyoncé <b>Experience</b> <b>at</b> every stop. Food was collected for people who fought with famine. Knowles' organization The Survivor Foundation was also involved in the campaign. The first 1,000 fans who would drop off a minimum of three non-perishable food items would receive an autographed photo of Knowles and a raffle ticket for a chance to have an upgraded seat. For the food drive in Ethiopia, India and Turkey, Houston Chronicle collaborated with Knowles, creating a Virtual Aid Drive and asking people to send money to them. The funds were donated to the Global FoodBanking Network.|$|E
5|$|Mayabazar was {{the first}} colourised Telugu film, with its audio remastered from {{monaural}} to a DTS 5.1-channel system. In late November 2007 a Hyderabad company, Goldstone Technologies, acquired world negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including that of Mayabazar, to digitally remaster them in colour. C.Jagan Mohan of Goldstone Technologies' <b>experience</b> <b>at</b> All India Radio gave him the idea of converting the film's audio to DTS. The audio was restored, sound effects remastered, distortion eliminated, and {{the volume of the}} vocals increased, and musicians re-recorded the film's background music on seven tracks instead of one.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} battle, Grant's and Johnston's armies were of {{comparable}} size, but the Confederates were poorly armed with antique weapons, including shotguns, hunting rifles, pistols, flintlock muskets, {{and even a few}} pikes; however, some regiments, such as the 6th and 7th Kentucky Infantry, had Enfield rifles. The troops approached the battle with very little combat experience; Braxton Bragg's men from Pensacola and Mobile were the best trained.

With 12 points in 6 games, Getzlaf finished second in overall scoring to teammate Patrice Bergeron's 13. He scored one goal and added two assists in the championship game against Russia as the Canadians won the gold medal by a 6–1 score; it was the nation's first title in eight years at the event.|$|E
