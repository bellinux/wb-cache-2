50|$|The Lisbon’s arched-mouth nase {{is a small}} cyprinid. Adults {{range from}} 5 to 11 cm, though there are records of {{specimens}} reaching ca. 18 cm. It can be distinguished from the other Iberian nase species {{by the lack of}} <b>horny</b> <b>blade</b> on the lower jaw, the absence of intense reddish coloration {{at the base of the}} fins and by its pronouncedly arched mouth. It has elongated pelvic fins that reach the anus and often pass the anal-fin insertion in males, and dorsal, pelvic and anal fins usually have 8 branched rays. This species has 36 to 43 scales in the lateral line, 7.0 to 8.5 scales above the lateral line, 13 to 16 circumpeduncular scales, denticulated (vs. smooth) grinding teeth surfaces, 6-5/5 pharyngeal teeth and 15 to 19 gill rakers. It is further distinguished from Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum, a phylogenetically close species that lives in the same area, by having a higher body, a relatively longer head, and a larger eye. The origins of anal and pelvic fins are displaced anteriorly, while the origin of pectoral fins is displaced posteriorly. Pelvic and pectoral fins and last anal-fin ray are longer in the new species. Unlike the other phylogenetically related species, the Lisbon’s arched-mouth nase shows external sexual dimorphism, with males having longer pelvic fins whose extremities pass the anus and often overlap with the anal fin.|$|E
