50|$|In 1953, the Model 16M was modernised with a dual seat {{replacing}} {{the saddle and}} rear pillion seat. In 1956 the Burman gearbox was replaced with a new four speed unit of AMC's own design and in 1957 further improvements included replacement of the outdated generator with a crankshaft mounted Lucas alternator.

50|$|The third {{generation}} Raptor {{was released by}} Western Digital in January 2006. It features two 75 GB platters (for a total of 150 GB) and a more advanced system of Native Command Queuing. At the same time, the Raptor X was released. It has identical specifications to the standard Raptor,but it has {{the addition of a}} clear polycarbonate window in the <b>drive</b> <b>cover,</b> making the movements of the disks and magnetic heads visible. This unique feature is likely to be popular with case modders. Like the regular Raptor, the Raptor X has a MTBF rating of 1.2 million hours, or 137 years. Both drives are covered by a five-year warranty. While this drive uses the NCQ feature of SATA 2, it lacks support for the increased bandwidth of SATA 2.|$|E
5000|$|... 1966 saw the {{introduction}} of the D10, still 175cc and 3 speed gearbox but with increased power. The electrical system was further revised with a new type of Wipac alternator and rotor. The points were moved from the nearside to a separate housing in the primary <b>drive</b> <b>cover</b> on the offside, apart from this the bike's external appearance was very similar to the late D7 models. There were 2 variants added to the range both with 4 speed gearboxes, high level exhaust and forks with no nacelle but a separate headlamp. The first was the Sports model with Chrome mudguards, a fly-screen and a hump on the rear of the dual-seat. The second was the Bushman, mostly for export, which had 19 inch wheels and a modified frame for more ground clearance. D10 production ceased in 1967.|$|E

50|$|This {{transmission}} has {{a separate}} oil for the differential in the transmission, {{so there are}} two fluid levels to check. The differential fluid is checked by unscrewing the speed sensor gear assembly {{and use it as}} a dipstick. The speed sensor gear assembly is located on top of the transmission just above the right inner CV joint. Differential is emptied by removing the final <b>drive</b> <b>cover</b> on the rear of the transmission or by vacuum extraction through the speed sensor hole. Vacuum extraction is the more attractive option since a paper gasket seals the steel cover and access is very difficult. Filling is through the speed sensor hole. Differential oil capacity is about 1 liter. An acceptable differential oil is Redline synthetic MT-90 75W90 gear oil or any synthetic 75W90 GL4 gear oil. Be very careful not to introduce sand or dust into the differential, as the differential has no way to filter its oil.|$|E
50|$|Each IBM 1316 Disk Pack is 4 in high, weighs 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and {{contains}} six 14 in diameter disks, yielding 10 recording surfaces (the outer surfaces are not used). The 10 individual read/write heads are {{mounted on a}} common actuator within the disk drive which moves in and out hydraulically and mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. The disks spin at 1500 rpm. Each recording surface has 100 tracks with 20 sectors per track. Each sector stores 100 characters. The disk pack {{is covered with a}} clear plastic shell and a bottom cover when not in use. A lifting handle in the top center of the cover is rotated to release the bottom cover. Then the top of the 1311 drive is opened and the plastic shell lowered into the disk-drive opening (assuming it is empty). The handle is turned again to lock the disks in place and release the plastic shell, which is then removed and the <b>drive</b> <b>cover</b> closed. The process is reversed to remove a disk pack. The same methods are used for many later disk packs.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 655 {{removable}} disc drives {{were the}} first to employ floating or flying heads. Early marketing material made a big deal of this, but {{there were a number of}} problems that plagued all of the Century Series systems. Head crashes were common, because the head flew less than a human hair's width above the disc surface. (Unless a drive unit was repaired and carefully cleaned after a crash, the next disc pack loaded in that drive would also crash. And, if a crashed disc pack was loaded on an operational drive, it would destroy the head on that drive unit. Contributing to this was the fact that disc packs were hand-loaded: spun tight onto a spindle, then uncovered by hand, in open air, before the <b>drive</b> <b>cover</b> was closed. A head crash could be caused merely by repeatedly bumping the smoked polycarbonate pack cover against the edge of a disc platter while lifting it off. Although the typical head crash ruined heads and the pack, the worst kind of head crash was caused by an entire pack coming loose from its spindle and rising freely inside the machine while spinning at high speeds!) ...|$|E

50|$|The jockey shifter is a gear {{shifting}} device used on motorcycles before {{the use of}} a foot-operated shift lever. A jockey shifter gets its name from the location of the motorcycle rider's hand when shifting gears. It is under his seat like the position of a jockey's hand while using his riding crop on his horse. This hand shifter lever is directly mounted to the transmission and is just long enough to clear the primary <b>drive</b> <b>cover</b> or belt drive. A motorcycle equipped with this type of shifter requires {{the use of a}} foot clutch. The foot clutch comes in one of two configurations; either a rocker foot clutch, which was stock on many early motorcycles, or a suicide foot clutch, which was never available on production motorcycles but was manufactured by daring motorcycle enthusiasts. The suicide foot clutch was usually a very simple lever, more or less a mirror image of the rear brake lever {{on the other side of}} the motorcycle; like a standard shift car's clutch lever. The rocker foot clutch is easier to use than the suicide foot clutch because it can be rocked into a position where the clutch is either engaged or disengaged - leaving the rider's foot free to be put down, at a stop, to steady the motorcycle. Sometimes a tank shifter is referred to as a jockey shifter, but this is incorrect due to the rider's hand position being in front of him, not behind him like for a horse jockey. A tank shifter is also connected to the transmission with linkage, which jockey shifters do not use. The earliest known use of a foot clutch and hand shifter, on motorcycles, was with the first multi-geared transmission on the 1915 Harley Davidson. It is a mechanical linkage that is typically mounted to the left side of the motorbike's fuel tank and is held in place by a slotted piece of metal welded to the frame or the tank. Through a series of linkages, it is connected to the transmission shift selection lever. In terms comparable to a motorcycle of current construction, it is simply a way to relocate the shift lever from the front foot controls to the side of the gas tank. Early motorcycle customizers who were trying to reduce their motorcycle's weight so as to increase its power-to-weight ratio would sometimes replace their stock rocker foot clutch with a hand fabricated suicide foot clutch, and remove the tank shifter's linkage and instead attach a shifter arm directly to the transmission (jockey shifter). This reduced weight not only made the bike accelerate better, but also gave the rider bragging rights of riding a motorcycle which required more skill to operate.|$|E

50|$|The <b>cover</b> <b>drive</b> in cricket is {{the act of}} {{stroking}} the ball through the covers with well-timed wristwork and conventional movement of the front foot toward the pitch of a delivery aimed at or outside the off stump. The <b>cover</b> <b>drive</b> {{is considered one of}} the most graceful shots playable in the sport. Batsmen able to master the <b>cover</b> <b>drive</b> are usually given especially high praise because of the shot's difficulty in execution and its requirement for exquisite timing. When played to perfection, the <b>cover</b> <b>drive</b> comprises a batsman's seemingly effortless wielding of the blade in a downward trajectory through the off side, with the cricket ball gliding through infielders in the covers at pace toward the boundary at deep cover.|$|R
50|$|Cattle drives were an {{important}} feature of the settlement of both the western United States and of Australia. In the year 1866, cattle drives in the United States moved 20 million head of cattle from Texas to railheads in Kansas. In Australia drives of sheep also took place. In both countries these <b>drives</b> <b>covered</b> great distances (800 miles Texas to Kansas), with drovers on horseback, supported by wagons or packhorses. Drives continued until railways arrived. In some circumstances driving very large herds long distances remains economic.|$|R
