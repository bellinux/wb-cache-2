500|$|Despite {{its initial}} reception, Connotations was listed in 1979 by Billboard {{magazine}} among Copland works that {{continued to be}} programmed by orchestras, with subsequent performances by Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling received positively. Reaction to the work itself remains mixed. Ross dismisses Connotations as a [...] "barbaric yawp of a piece." [...] Morin calls it a [...] "thorny, riveting patchwork" [...] and listening to it [...] "like the unrelenting pummeling of a prizefighter at times." [...] Adams calls its style [...] "very simplistic... strident" [...] and [...] "generally unpleasant sounding" [...] and adds that [...] "the rigor [...] seemed more to cramp [...] natural spontaneity than to aid it." [...] Composer Kyle Gann calls Connotations [...] "big, unwieldy... and [...] that good... Copland's imagination seemed constrained by the technique. On a more positive note, Davis wrote after a performance of the work under Ehrling by The Juilliard Orchestra that while Connotations remains a [...] "spiky" [...] composition, Copland [...] "adopts Schoenberg's serial procedures to produce a sequence of typically pungent and exhilarating Coplandesque sonorities." [...] Desmond Shawe-Taylor called the work [...] "beautifully put together: <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> variety, thought" [...] after he had heard Boulez conduct the piece. Michael Andrews wrote of Copland's [...] "mammoth, anxious and angry vision" [...] and Barlett Naylor of [...] "a majesty hidden in this dark piece" [...] after both had heard de Waart's performance.|$|E
500|$|... is a blonde-haired {{girl who}} is the fourth Mew Mew {{introduced}} to the readers and {{the youngest of the}} bunch. Infused with the DNA of a Golden Lion Tamarin, Bu-Ling grows a monkey tail and ears while transformed, and fights with a pair of rings. Bu-Ling is introduced as being a busker due to her acrobatic skills to earn money for her family. The other Mew Mews agree that her monkey DNA is a perfect match for her personality as she is <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and loves having fun, to the point Minto considers her very immature or childish. A running gag when it comes to referencing the Mew Mews' DNA had Bu-Ling thinking that her DNA is a lion where she is always corrected that she has the DNA of a Golden Lion Tamarin. Despite her age, Bu-Ling is raising her five younger siblings and managing the family finances while their father is training in the mountains. The manga never mentions Bu-Ling's mother while the anime adaptation states that she died. Midway through the series, Bu-Ling befriends Tart when he captures her and holds her hostage. She is reluctant to fight Tart during the final battle until he affirms they have no choice, and cries over him after he is defeated. Bu-Ling kisses Tart {{at the end of the}} series and tells him she does not want it [...] "to be goodbye." [...] He replies by saying that he may return to see her. In the anime adaptation, the relationship between Bu-Ling and Tart is expanded and the circumstances of their initial friendship changes– instead of being saved by the Mew Mews, Tart himself saves Bu-Ling from an underground cavern when he realizes that she is suffocating from a lack of oxygen.|$|E

So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S.
