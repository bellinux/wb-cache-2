5|$|In 1815, the Portuguese {{crown prince}} Dom João (later Dom JoãoVI), acting as regent, created the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, which raised {{the status of}} Brazil from colony to kingdom. He ascended the Portuguese throne the {{following}} year, {{after the death of}} his mother, Maria I of Portugal. He returned to Portugal in April 1821, leaving behind his son and heir, Prince Dom Pedro, to rule Brazil as his regent. The Portuguese government immediately moved to revoke the political autonomy that Brazil had been granted since 1808. The threat of losing their limited control over local affairs ignited widespread opposition among Brazilians. José Bonifácio de Andrada, along with other Brazilian leaders, convinced Pedro to declare Brazil's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822. On 12 October, the prince was acclaimed PedroI, first Emperor of the newly created Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. The declaration of <b>independence</b> <b>was</b> opposed throughout Brazil by armed military units loyal to Portugal. The ensuing war of <b>independence</b> <b>was</b> fought across the country, with battles in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers to surrender did so in March 1824, and <b>independence</b> <b>was</b> recognized by Portugal in August 1825.|$|E

5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War of Independence, {{although}} no formal declaration of <b>independence</b> <b>was</b> issued {{at the time}} and the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A formal declaration of <b>independence</b> <b>was</b> finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E
