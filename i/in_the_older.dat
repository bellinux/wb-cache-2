5|$|In {{addition}} to historical evidence, the coins' use of Ge'ez provides valuable linguistic information. Though rarely used, the vocalization of Ge'ez sometimes employed on Aksumite coins allows linguists to analyze vowel changes and shifts that cannot be represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Semitic abjads such as Hebrew, Arabic, South Arabian, and earlier, unvocalized Ge'ez.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most abundant deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} finds in the Taynton Limestone Formation, in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds {{referred}} remains to Megalosaurus {{that had been}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Chipping Norton Limestone Formation dating from the early Bathonian, about thirty single teeth and bones. Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume an identity with Megalosaurus bucklandii, in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with M. bucklandii among the remains found at one site, the New Park Quarry, and therefore affirmed the reference to that species. However, in another site, the Oakham Quarry, the material contained one bone, an ilium, that was clearly dissimilar.|$|E
5|$|Despite these taxonomic changes, Indraloris {{remained}} {{known from}} only two specimens (the holotypes of Indraloris lulli and Sivanasua palaeindica) until 2005. Both of those specimens—an isolated first lower molar (m1) and a mandible (lower jaw) fragment with m1, respectively—come from Haritalyangar in the Nagri Formation. In 2005, however, American paleontologists Lawrence Flynn and Michèle Morgan described five teeth of Indraloris from fossil sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Kamlial Formation {{as a second}} species in the genus, Indraloris kamlialensis. The species was named after the Kamlial Formation. In addition, they suggested that two lower jaw fragments from the Kamlial Formation represented a third, larger species of Indraloris.|$|E

5|$|Licancabur has erupted {{primarily}} andesite, but basaltic andesite and dacite {{have also}} been found. The rocks are dark and grey-coloured. Basaltic andesite was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> lavas, and dacite in the more-recent ones. Although the rocks have a seriate texture, the groundmass is hyalopilitic. Phenocrysts include amphibole, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite; olivine is found in andesite, and biotite in dacites. Plagioclase is the most common. The amount of phenocrysts in Licancabur's rocks is smaller than that in other Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes, such as Lascar.|$|E
5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning.

The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E

5|$|The {{libraries}} of Europe contain many medieval {{copies of}} ancient Greek and Latin texts.

In texts of classical authors such as Herodotus and Demosthenes, these totals are expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older,</b> acrophonic numerals that were used in Athens during the classical period but abandoned sometime during the Hellenistic period.

5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B.

Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} their active careers, some of Ull's members {{entered the}} ranks of sports officials and administrators. Most notable was Karl Roll, who became the first chairman of the Norwegian Ski Federation in 1908. Several members had already held positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> organization Association for the Promotion of Skiing, founded three weeks before Ull, in 1883. Johan Bechholm was its first secretary, from 1883 to 1886, and many others followed. Johan Sverre (member since 1896) was a notable Olympic administrator after the Norwegian independence in 1905, and Hjalmar Krag (member since 1887) became chairman in the Confederation of Sports. Fritz R. Huitfeldt also became a known figure in his field; for his ski bindings, and for pioneering Telemark skiing. Huitfeldt's ski factory, which he started together with Richard Blichfeldt, was named Ull.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older rocks are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of diabase rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> gneiss. Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
