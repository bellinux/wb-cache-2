25|$|With Isaac in London, Mary Ann began setting about {{securing}} a <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> to his assets by filing documents detailing his infidelities, claiming that, {{though she had}} never been formally married to Isaac, they were wed under Common Law by living together for seven months after Isaac had been divorced from his first wife Catherine. Eventually a settlement was made, but no divorce was granted. However, she asserted that she was free to marry, and indeed married John E. Foster.|$|E
25|$|While {{the lawsuit}} between {{the museum and}} Orman waged on in the courts, the museum signed a deal to anchor the {{proposed}} Belle Island Village tourist attraction, which was scheduled to debut in fall 2008, in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. When the developer of the Belle Island Village resort met with financial struggles of their own, the construction lender Regions Bank foreclosed on the unfinished property. In response, the museum itself sought Chapter 11 protection in June 2009. The bank initially agreed to sell the resort property to Tennessee Investment Partners, which is partially owned by the real estate investment firm of Matisse Capital, the original developer of the proposed Belle Island Village. The purchase was scheduled to close {{by the end of}} March 2010, with assurances that the buyer intended to reinstate the Hollywood Motion Picture Museum as the centerpiece attraction of the new resort. The deal additionally called for agreements for the new investor to cover the lawsuit and <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> made by Orman. When the sale of the property to Tennessee Investment Partners and subsequent plans to relocate the museum to Tennessee fell through, Reynolds and Fisher began making plans to liquidate the memorabilia collection.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functionalities is Budget Availability Check. In fact, this functionality shows the beauty of the system.

40|$|We {{establish}} rigorously {{the existence}} and properties of the stationary probability distribution which characterizes the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> by a risk averse individual who confronts random wage fluctuations and incomplete insurance markets. We show that there exists a unique, almost-everywhere continuous stationary cumulative distribution function which characterizes the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims</b> in a stochastic steady-state. This distribution is shown to possess a single mass point coinciding with the non-negative, finite borrowing limit faced by the individual. We establish that the stationary distribution which characterizes the asset accumulation of low time preference individuals {{is at least as}} large, in the sense of first-degree stochastic dominance, as that of individuals with higher rates of time preference. We prove that, so long as individuals are allowed to borrow in amounts which can be repayed with probability one, additive differences in the probability distribution governing random wage earnings imply inversely proportional additive differences in the stationary probability distributions which govern the accumulation of non-contingent <b>financial</b> <b>claims.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The end {{came with}} the Reformation. Since the 1520s monks had been leaving and turning to the new teachings. Monastic {{discipline}} and also {{the economics of the}} abbey fell into disorder. In 1533 the abbot absconded with the abbey's portable valuables. In addition, Emperor Ferdinand I demanded high contributions from the Lower Lusatian abbeys to finance the Turkish wars. Finally, in 1541, Johann Friedrich I, Elector of Saxony, occupied Dobrilugk, because of a <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> he had against the King of Bohemia, in whose territory it was.

50|$|With {{regard to}} the {{proceeds}} from offences, another system of confiscation is widely used in some States: so-called value confiscation, which consists of the requirement to pay a sum of money based on {{an assessment of the}} value of the proceeds directly derived from offences, or their substitutes. As a result of a value confiscation, the State can exert a <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> against the person against whom the order is made, which, if not paid, may be realised in any property (no matter whether legally or illegally acquired) belonging to that person. The order is thus executed in a similar way to fines or court orders in civil cases.|$|E
50|$|A form of Khul' {{was adopted}} by Egypt in 2000, {{allowing}} a Muslim woman to divorce her husband. As a condition of the divorce, the woman renounces any <b>financial</b> <b>claim</b> on the husband and any entitlement to the matrimonial home. In Egypt, {{it is very difficult}} for a woman to be granted Khulʿ. In the first two years after Khulʿ was adopted 5,000 cases were brought before Egyptian courts. Of the 5,000 cases, only 122 were approved. Although difficult to obtain, many believe that the implementation of Khulʿ in Egypt is a milestone for Islamic activists. The Islamic Khul' procedure has also been used by some Egyptian Christian women to obtain a no-fault divorce, and it is considered by some as an opportunity for their empowerment vis-à-vis patriarchical institutions.|$|E
