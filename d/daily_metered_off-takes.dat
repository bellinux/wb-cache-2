DOREMI project has developed an innovative platform able to stimulate and monitor elder people as also to be customized on user requirements. Methods: 34 older people (age 65 - 80 years) were involved in UK and Italy DOREMI trials (3 months). Subjects were characterized at baseline in terms of physical activity (SPPB, PASE test, <b>daily</b> steps/ <b>meters,</b> 6 MWT), hemodynamic and biochemical parameters (blood pressure, HR, lipid profile, glycaemia, etc.), dietary habits (caloric intake) and balance assessment (BERG scale). Through the DOREMI technological platform, users were: stimulated to perform indoor physical activity protocol (exergame on tablet); monitored by DOREMI bracelet (heart rate monitoring); invited to fill diet e-diary, receiving nutritional advice provided by the expert through the same application; tested for balance by item- 10 BERG test (DOREMI balance board). At the end of trial, users underwent the same test battery of baseline. Results: In DOREMI population an overall increase in physical activity was observed, with a significant improvement in hemodynamic (decrease in blood pressure and HR at 6 MWT) and biochemical parameters (decrease in LDL, triglycerides, total cholesterol).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{the need}} for {{corticosteroids}} in acute severe asthma is well established the appropriate dose is not known. METHODS: The response to intravenous hydrocortisone 50 mg (low dose), 100 mg (medium dose), and 500 mg (high dose), administered every six hours for 48 hours and followed by oral prednisone, was compared in patients with acute asthma in a double blind randomised study. After initial emergency treatment with bronchodilators subjects received oral theophylline or intravenous aminophylline and nebulised salbutamol four hourly. Patients were given low, medium, or high doses of intravenous hydrocortisone and then 20, 40, or 60 mg/day respectively of oral prednisone with a reducing regimen over the following 12 days. Beclomethasone dipropionate, 400 micrograms twice <b>daily</b> by <b>metered</b> dose inhaler, was also started. Peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), and visual analogue dyspnoea scores (VAS) were recorded daily in hospital and PEF and VAS twice daily after discharge {{for a total of}} 12 days. RESULTS: The 66 subjects (40 female) who completed the study had a mean (SD) age of 31 (14) years. On presentation mean (SD) FEV 1 % predicted in the low (n = 22), medium (n = 20), and high dose (n = 24) groups was 17 (13), 19 (12), and 19 (11) and after emergency bronchodilator treatment 32 (20), 30 (12), and 36 (13). After 24 hours of treatment the respective post-bronchodilator FEV 1 % predicted values were 62 (22), 62 (23), and 65 (28) compared with 71 (24), 69 (22), and 71 (24) after 48 hours. No significant difference between the groups was detected. PEF and VAS improved with treatment over the 12 days but was not influenced by steroid dose.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of inhalation device (Autohaler versus metered dose inhaler) and patients' subjective opinion towards the different devices, as well as daily frequency and duration of treatment on medication compliance. DESIGN: Prospective study measuring compliance in the same patients of the Autohaler twice <b>daily</b> with the <b>metered</b> dose inhaler twice daily, as well the Autohaler twice daily with the Autohaler four times daily. SETTING: Primary health care. SUBJECTS: 34 subjects with asthma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients preference and compliance. RESULTS: Patients preferred the Autohaler. The percentage of patients with a negative opinion towards the metered dose inhaler was 38 % compared with 12 % towards the Autohaler. The median values of the compliance rate of the Autohaler with twice and four times daily frequency were 90. 8 % (25 - 75 th percentile 61. 6 - 98. 0 %) and 78. 5 % (25 - 75 th percentile 49. 0 %- 91. 2 %), respectively (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} degree of {{variation}} {{in the quality of}} asthma management among physician groups participating in a managed care network. Study Design: Cross-sectional observation. Patients and Methods: The study population consisted of patients with moderate or severe asthma identified through a pharmacy database from a managed care plan in 1996. The patients were surveyed to obtain their assessments of asthma care, including components on quality of care, quality of service, and outcomes of care. We selected 47 physician groups that provided services for at least 35 asthma patients who responded to the survey. Variations in the outcome variables across physician groups were described by quartile, range, and histogram.

40|$|Abstract This {{study used}} an {{exploratory}} research focus to investigate if making electricity consumption public {{and subject to}} social norms and networks resulted in consumption decreases for households in Milton, Ontario. In the first phase, Milton Hydro identified customers who fell within an average annual electricity consumption category and these customers {{were invited to participate}} by mail. Due to lack of participant uptake, cold-calling, targeting of service and faith groups and commuters, and snowball sampling were employed to obtain a total participant size of 17. The second phase saw participants grouped according to social network type (occupational, faith group, etc) and exposed to approval or disapproval indicators within their group about their daily electricity consumption rates via an on-line ‘energy pool’. There were five main groups: one of neighbours, one of members of a faith group, one of members of a company, one of strangers and one of a control group. Group members saw other members’ indicators {{with the exception of the}} control group, whose indicators were privately delivered. All group’s electricity consumption was tracked through <b>daily</b> smart <b>meter</b> readings. Participants also had the option of commenting on each other’s electricity use via an online ‘comment box’. In the third phase participants were asked to participate in a questionnaire to assess: 1) the perceived efficacy of the intervention; 2) perceptions of electricity consumption; and 3) the influence of the group on these perceptions. This sequential methodology was chosen for its ability to “ [...] . explain significant (or non-significant) results, outlier results, or surprising results” (Cresswell, 2006, p. 72). The findings of this exploratory research seem to suggest the following: 1) that publicity or group type does not seem to affect electricity consumption in comparative electricity consumption feedback for this study; 2) that participants used injunctive norms to comment on their electricity consumption but directed these comments solely at themselves; and 3) that the stronger the relationships in the group, the more likely participants were to engage with the website through checking it and commenting on it. This study may be useful to those in the fields of: 1) electricity conservation who wish to leverage feedback technologies; 2) social networks who wish to better understand how tie strength interacts with social norms and; 3) those in social marketing who wish to develop norm-based campaigns...|$|R
40|$|When used in high doses, inhaled {{corticosteroids}} {{may cause}} {{suppression of the}} hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. The influence of the mode of drug inhalation {{on the degree of}} this suppression is not clear. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 0900 h serum cortisol concentrations, a short tetracosactrin test, and 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion in 48 adults with asthma taking 1500 - 2500 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate <b>daily</b> via a <b>metered</b> dose aerosol. Twelve patients had hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression, as judged by subnormal results from {{at least two of the}} three tests or (in one patient) by an abnormal insulin stress test response. These patients then changed to inhaling the same dose of beclomethasone dipropionate through a 750 ml spacer device (Volumatic). The endocrine tests were repeated from nine days to eight weeks later in 10 patients. Comparison with initial values showed that adding the spacing device caused an increase in the median 0900 h cortisol concentration from 126 nmol/l to 398 nmol/l, in the post-tetracosactrin cortisol concentration from 402 nmol/l to 613 nmol/l and in 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion from 54 nmol to 84 nmol. The rise in serum cortisol concentration in response to tetracosactrin did not change. Evidence of persisting hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was present in only four of the 10 patients; the most pronounced improvements in function tended to occur in those who had never required long term oral corticosteroids. The results from this uncontrolled study suggest that asthmatic patients taking high dose beclomethasone dipropionate may minimise adverse effects by using a large volume spacer device...|$|R

Mean FEV(1) after bronchodilator remained significantly higher throughout the study with fluticasone propionate compared with placebo (P< 0. 001). Median exacerbation rate was reduced by 25 % from 1. 32 a year on placebo to 0. 99 a year on with fluticasone propionate (P= 0. 026). Health status deteriorated by 3. 2 units a year on placebo and 2. 0 units a year on fluticasone propionate (P= 0. 0043). Withdrawals because of respiratory disease not related to malignancy were higher in the placebo group (25 % v 19 %, P= 0. 034). CONCLUSIONS: Fluticasone propionate 500 microgram twice daily did not affect the rate of decline in FEV(1) but did produce a small increase in FEV(1). Patients on fluticasone propionate had fewer exacerbations and a slower decline in health status. These improvements in clinical outcomes support the use of this treatment in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of SPECT reconstruction methods including advanced corrections for physical interactions {{in the patient}} and detectors has provided the ability to obtain images with absolute activity quantification using SPECT/CT imaging. However, the conversion of voxel values to activity units, which is performed {{with the use of}} a calibration factor, is not well standardized and methods to reliably estimate this factor are needed. In this work, we focused on a calibration factor obtained from a planar acquisition of a small calibration source imaged in air due to its relative simplicity. We evaluated the repeatability of this method and studied the factors that affect the variability of the resulting calibration factor. The calibration factor estimate was obtained based on acquisition of an image of a vial containing a measured quantity of the radionuclide of interest before each patient image acquisition. The process of filling a new vial for each patient and the use of a radionuclide activity meter to measure the calibration source activity for each acquisition were potential sources of variability. The constancy test performed as part of <b>daily</b> radionuclide activity <b>meter</b> quality control was used as an indicator of radionuclide activity meter instrumentation variability. The background count rate, another potential source of variability, was measured by a planar acquisition without any calibration source in the field of view and was subtracted from the calibration source count rate. Finally, the calibration factor repeatability could be affected by variations in camera sensitivity or table speed over time. A sensitivity factor calculated from a daily 57 Co extrinsic flood acquisition, also acquired as part of routine quality control, was used to evaluate the impact of the camera sensitivity variations that are independent of radionuclide and collimator on the calibration factor measurement. In order to estimate the components of the total variance of the calibration factor and to determine the parameters that affect the variability of the calibration factor, a mixed-effects model was used to analyze the data.|$|R

Methods. A double-blind randomised parallel-group trial was performed with a 2 -week run-in and an 8 -week treatment period. Thirty-six symptomatic adult asthmatics on a mean daily dose of 750 μg inhaled corticosteroids during run-in, a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) of 70 % predicted normal and a mean histamine concentration provoking a 20 % reduction in FEV 1 (histamine PC 20) of 0. 11 mg/l were randomised {{to one of the}} two treatment groups. Primary variables were morning peak expiratory flow (mPEF), FEV 1 and histamine PC 20. Secondary variables were β 2 -agonist use, symptom score and nocturnal awakening. The Schuirmann two one-sided tests procedure was used for the statistical analysis. Ninety-five per cent confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the differences in means. Results. The mean differences end of treatment to baseline for the two formulations (Becotide and Beclate) respectively were: mPEF 5. 6 l/min (CI- 16. 4 - 27. 6) and - 22. 3 l/min (CI- 35. 6 - - 9); FEV 1 - 2. 9 % (CI - 11 - 5. 2) and 0. 2 % (CI- 4. 8 - 5. 2); Histamine PC 20 - 0. 04 mg/ml (CI - 0. 15 - 0. 06) and 0. 02 mg/ml (CI - 0. 37 - 0. 4). Changes in clinical variables were not conclusive. The mean differences with CIs for primary variables were contained within the limits set for equivalence. The sample size was sufficient to differentiate the groups for mPEF, but this was not of clinical significance. Conclusion. After 8 weeks of treatment the two formulations of BDP, delivered by MDI through a large-volume spacer, were therapeutically equivalent in moderate-to-severe asthmatic adults.

40|$|AbstractViozan™, (Sibenadet HCI, AR-C 68397 AA) is a dual D 2 {{dopamine}} receptor, β 2 -adrenoceptor {{that combines}} bronchodilator activity with the sensory afferent modulating effects associated with D 2 -receptor agonism. Investigation in animal models of key {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) symptoms {{has demonstrated that}} sibenadet effectively inhibits sensory nerve activity, thereby reducing reflex cough, mucus production and tachypnoea. The results of the early clinical evaluation of this novel agent are reported. An initial proof of concept study (Study I) aimed to determine the clinical potential of this novel agent by assessing the effects of three doses of sibenadet therapy relative to placebo, with two commonly used bronchodilators, intended to provide a benchmark against which sibenadet activity could be judged. In all, 701 patients were randomized to one of three sibenadet dose groups (400, 600 or 1000 μgex valve), salbutamol 200 μg, ipratropium bromide (IB) 40 μg or placebo, all three times <b>daily</b> via pressurized <b>metered</b> dose inhaler (pMDI) for 4 weeks. Once the results of Study I had been evaluated, a dose-ranging, study (Study 2) involving 872 patients randomized to receive sibenadet (45, 270, or 495 μgex actuator), or placebo all three times daily via pMDI, for 6 weeks commenced. Both studies were preceded by a 2 -week baseline phase and followed by a 2 -week follow up period. The primary efficacy variable identified changes in key COPD symptoms over the treatment period (compared with baseline data) as determined by the novel Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS©). In addition, data on lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse events were collected. Patients receiving sibenadet therapy three times daily exhibited statistically significantly greater improvements in BCSS total score than those receiving placebo or bronchodilator therapy alone. A clear dose-response was evident in Study 2. Symptom improvement in this study was also accompanied by improved lung function and healt-related quality of life. Sibenadet therapy was well tolerated with an adverse events profile comparable to current bronchodilator therapy. These data were viewed as extremely encouraging, warranting further, large-scale clinical investigation...|$|R
30|$|In {{the context}} of absorbed dose {{calculation}} for targeted radionuclide therapy or {{for the evaluation of}} the tumor response to therapy, {{it is important that the}} measurement be repeatable and the factor stable over time in order to provide accurate absolute activity quantification. However, the repeatability of the calibration factor measurement and its stability over time have not been carefully investigated, and little information can be found in the literature about factors impacting its variability. Thus, we studied the variability of the calibration factor measurement using data from a series of patient 131 I-tositumomab[*]+[*]unlabeled tositumomab (Bexxar®, GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, England) radionuclide therapy procedures and quality control measurements obtained over a period of 4  years. The calibration factor was measured by a dual-camera whole-body anterior-posterior scan of an in-air calibration source and was performed for each patient acquisition. This served as the raw data on calibration factor stability and repeatability. This work focused on the assessment of the repeatability of this in-air calibration factor measurement over a long time period and on the factors affecting its repeatability by analyzing sources of variability. One factor evaluated was the quantitative stability of the SPECT camera over time, which has a direct effect on the stability of the calibration factor. As a proxy for this, we used the count rate measured in daily extrinsic 57 Co flood acquisitions performed as part of a routine quality control program. Since this was measured using a different radionuclide and collimator, it assesses only the radionuclide and collimator independent component of camera sensitivity variations. Since the activities in the calibration sources used for calibration were measured using a radionuclide activity meter, radionuclide activity meter variability may also impact the calibration factor calculation. To assess this, we used results of <b>daily</b> radionuclide activity <b>meter</b> constancy measurements. Finally, the variable radiation environment in the SPECT camera room may also be a factor affecting the variability of the calibration factor measurement. To quantify this effect, we used background measurements routinely acquired as part of the radionuclide therapy protocol. Using these data, we performed a number of statistical analyses to evaluate the importance of the various potential sources of variation and the overall stability of the calibration factor.|$|R
40|$|Mastitis is an {{inflammation}} of the mammary gland, caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and yeasts. During the processes of inflammation, chloride (Cl) and sodium (Na) ions, immunoglobulins and other serum proteins present in blood, flow through capillaries direct to the alveoli lumen of the gland, thus increasing its concentration. This {{is due to the}} increase of vascular permeability, the destruction of tight junctions and the active ion-pumping system, while the concentration of casein, lactose, triglycerides and potassium (K) decreases. This work aimed to study a method to evaluate mastitis in Gir dairy cattle, where the milk electric conductivity (EC) was correlated to milk somatic cell count (SCC). This method will provide an early diagnosis, which can be used <b>daily</b> with conductivity <b>meter</b> in mechanical milking machine or weekly in properties with manual milking. The measurement of EC in milk was accomplished through the appliance of AK 83 BENCHTOP PORTATIL. The experiment was conducted in two farms: Calciolândia, Arcos/MG and Bom Jardim da Serra, Mococa/SP, totaling 123 Gir cows. In Calciolândia farm, milking was manual and in Bom Jardim da Serra milking was manual and mechanical but both with the presence of the calf. The milk collection took place in 10 ml bottles at ambience temperature, and the samples were in duplicate, one to measure the EC and the other for SCC and components. The correlations were calculated using SAS software, through data collected from farms. The correlations found between EC and SCC were 40. 9 % and 42. 7 %, respectively to Bom Jardim da Serra and Calciolândia farms. Environmental factors that influences SCC and EC where not considered in the analysis, order of birth, lactation stage, age of cow, number of milk per day and jet of milk collected sample of complete collection of first milking or jets of milk. For now we can conclude that there is strong evidence of an analogy between electrical current (EC) and the milk somatic cell count (SCC), where the EC increases during inflammation and SCC, but one is the amount of other ions and by increased presence of cells in milk. This method can replace the SCC, reducing the cost of laboratory tests with a quick, efficient and inexpensive measurement...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate and}} compare the efficacy and safety of tiotropium and ipratropium during long term treatment in patients with stable {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD).  METHODS— 288 patients of mean (SD) age 65 (8) years and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 41 (12) % predicted participated in a 14 centre, double blind, double dummy, parallel group study and were randomised after a run in period of two weeks to receive either tiotropium 18 µg once daily from a dry powder inhaler (HandiHaler; two thirds of patients) or ipratropium 40 µg four times <b>daily</b> from a <b>metered</b> dose inhaler (one third of patients) for a period of 13 weeks. Outcome measures were lung function, daily records of peak expiratory flow (PEF), and the use of concomitant salbutamol. FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured one hour before and immediately before inhalation (mean value of the two measurements on test day 1 was the baseline value while on all other test days it was known as the trough FEV 1 and FVC), and 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after inhalation of the study drug on days 1, 8, 50, and 92.  RESULTS—During treatment tiotropium achieved a significantly greater improvement than ipratropium (p< 0. 05) in trough, average, and peak FEV 1 levels and in trough and average FVC levels. The trough FEV 1 response on days 8, 50, and 92 ranged between 0. 15 l (95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 19) and 0. 16 l (95 % CI 0. 12 to 0. 20) for tiotropium and between 0. 01 l (95 % CI - 0. 03 to 0. 05) and 0. 03 l (95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 07) for ipratropium. The trough FVC response on days 8, 50,and 92 ranged between 0. 34 l (95 % CI 0. 28 to 0. 40) and 0. 39 l (95 % CI 0. 31 to 0. 47) for tiotropium and between 0. 08 l (95 % CI 0. 00 to 0. 16) and 0. 18 l (95 % CI 0. 08 to 0. 28) for ipratropium. On all test days tiotropium produced a greater improvement in FEV 1 than ipratropium starting three hours after inhalation (p< 0. 05). During treatment weekly mean morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) was consistently better in the tiotropium group than in the ipratropium group, the difference in morning PEF being significant up through week 10 and in evening PEF up through week 7 of treatment (p< 0. 05). The use of concomitant salbutamol was also lower in the tiotropium group (p< 0. 05). The only drug related adverse event was dry mouth (tiotropium 14. 7 %, ipratropium 10. 3 % of patients).  CONCLUSIONS—Tiotropium in a dose of 18 µg inhaled once daily using the HandiHaler was significantly more effective than 40 µg ipratropium four times daily in improving trough, average, and peak lung function over the 13 week period. The safety profile of tiotropium was similar to ipratropium. These data support the use of tiotropium as first line treatment for the long term maintenance treatment of patients with airflow obstruction due to COPD. ...|$|R
40|$|In many {{coastal regions}} of {{developing}} countries the employment of industrial desalination plants is not possible due to the high investment and operating costs. For these purposes {{there is a need}} of small and low-priced desalination plants. Among a multitude of existing desalination methods the multi-stage heat recovery seems to offer a large potential for energy conservation. However, this process has not yet reached efficencies as high as those of the MEH process or membrane destillation. Since there is no published, detailed investigation of this process, it is examined theoretically and experimentally in this work with the aim to lower energy consumption {{to such a degree that}} the process can be powered economically by solar supply. For optimization, the heat- and mass-transfer between the stages must be well understood. The mass transfer was first examined in detail in a single distillation chamber. It was found to be affected by different factors, such as evaporation and condensation temperature, salinity, surface properties of the condenser and the geometry of the distillation chamber. Losses by drip back from the condenser reduce the distillate yield. The mass transfer resistance can be described as a serial connection of at least four single resistances in each phase boundary and in the gas and liquid bulk. The mass transfer model described in this work includes all known resistances and permits the variation of the surface areas of evaporator and condenser. The thermal resistance of the water layers is determined by the convective resistance of the liquid phase. This resistance involves high production losses. Using seawater the production was reduced by 25 %. Since constantly water of less concentration flows into the system, the resulting density gradient weakens free convection and reduces the heat flow. Except for the decrease of water and gas layer height no further factors were determined to optimize mass transfer. A thermodynamic model of destillation was implemented in the simulation environment MATLAB/SIMULINK taking into account all heat- and mass-flows in the system as well as thermal inertia and salt concentrations. The validation of the model with results of a multi-stage laboratory plant shows an error of less than 1 % in stationary conditions. This is regarded as sufficiently exact for the aim of optimizing the process regarding constructional and thermodynamic aspects. While thermodynamic optimization covers the number of stages, refilling factor and recovery of sensitive heat, the constructional optimization takes concerns the back dripping losses and the production rate. An optimized design was found, allowing a simple construction of the plants. A desalination module with 8 stages, a surface area of 2 m x 0. 5 m and a height of 0, 5 m achieves a production rate of 8 kg/(m²h) and an energy recovery of GOR= 3, 5. That means, that the power requirement is only 28, 5 % compared to a single stage desalination unit. With the recovery of sensitive heat a GOR value of 4, 6 is achieved. Compared with the best results published up to now, this represents an efficiency increase of about 100 %. For a field test in Pozo/Gran Canaria A pilot plant with 4 desalination modules (1 m² each), powered by solar flat plate and vacuum tube collectors was set up, achieving a daily output of 33 litres or 40 litres with sensitive heat recovery respectivly. This corresponds to 9 litres <b>daily</b> per square <b>meter</b> of collector area (at 8 kWh/m²d). With the validated, thermodynamic simulation models including the solar collectors and the thermosiphon circuit it is now possible to predict the distillate production at any location on the basis of meteorological data. The produced water quality exceeds drinking water standards. However pitting corrosion was problematic. According to the validated simulation model further improvements are possible. Reduced back dripping losses, the use of the lowest stage for distillate production, sensitive heat recovery and improved insulation can raise the daily output to 19, 5 litres per square meter collector area when using low inertia heatpipe vacuum tubes. Partial improvements were already achieved in practice with a capillary desalination module, using mainly plastics. This way corrosion is avoided and drip-back losses are reduced. With this new technology larger surfaces can achieve higher production rates at lower costs. A water price of 10 €/m³ seems to be possible. In review it can be stated that drip-back losses and the formation of stable density gradients in seawater operation represent systems-inherent and weak points which are difficult to avoid. Nevertheless, with further optimization measures similar water costs as with MEH or membrane distillation could be achieved with the advantage of simple construction and maintenance and no auxiliary energy for pumps is needed...|$|R
