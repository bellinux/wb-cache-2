5|$|By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian {{forces in}} Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were {{captured}} {{by the end of}} December, general exhaustion among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> weather set in, it became clear to the Allied commanders that no further progress would be made and General Alexander called off the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Snowflakes {{are also}} {{often used as}} symbols {{representing}} winter or cold conditions.

5|$|The Grand Pier {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular tourist attractions in the town. It {{previously}} housed funfair style attractions, a go-kart track, cafes, a fudge factory, and a host of arcade games, and underwent a £34 million re-development after a fire in 2008 destroyed the main pavilion. After a <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> which delayed progress, the new pier pavilion reopened on 23 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{victories}} wrecked the British carrot-and-stick {{strategy of}} showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The Americans would not negotiate for {{anything short of}} independence. These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the <b>harsh</b> <b>winter.</b> Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion, which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} urban centre, the tribal people of Chamba are divided into two major groups; the Gujjars and the Gaddis. The Gujjars, mainly nomads, came to Chamba across the state border from Kashmir along the trade routes. They belong to nomadic herdsmen of the Islamic community, and travel to lowland Punjab in the autumn with their {{livestock}} to avoid the <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> of the Chamba hills. Their features are Turkic and have a distinct language and culture aloof from the main town.|$|E

5|$|Because of the <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> conditions, {{the station}} area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Amtrak {{announced}} {{several possible}} {{changes to the}} Mountaineer, including a later schedule through West Virginia and combined operation west of Cincinnati with both the Riley and an unnamed (and never implemented) WashingtonDenver train. Under this plan the Mountaineer would receive new Amfleet equipment but lose its sleeping car. The schedule changes never took place, but Amtrak was forced to re-equip the Mountaineer after a <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> damaged many of its old steam-heated coaches and locomotives. The Mountaineer was one of eight routes suspended in January 1977, and it returned with an all-Amfleet consist, minus the sleeping car.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} prior to the game, both teams {{had to cope with}} <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> weather in the Nashville area. Virginia Tech was forced to move {{practices}} indoors when an ice storm arrived on the day before Christmas. The storm caused travel delays for fans and players alike. Alabama's first practices in Nashville were held without the full team available because many players had been delayed. The harsh weather continued through the day of the game, and Tech was forced to cancel its final outdoor practice before the game. Alabama, meanwhile, drove 45 minutes to Murfreesboro to a practice field that was not covered by ice.|$|E

5|$|While MLS {{has looked}} into {{changing}} to a fall-to-spring format, {{there are no}} current plans to do so. If the league were to change its schedule, a substantial winter break would still be necessary due to teams being located in <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> climates. It {{would also have to}} compete with the popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL) in the fall and winter as well as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL), which both run on fall-to-spring schedules.|$|E
5|$|After new {{investment}} at board level Revie {{was able to}} spend £25,000 on Everton's Scotland international Bobby Collins, who he installed as captain. Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams, forward Ian Lawson and left-back Cliff Mason. He spent £53,000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus, and though he proved not to {{be as effective as}} during his first spell at Leeds, Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £17,000 profit within just a few months. Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> caused many postponements and a backlog of games {{at the end of the}} season proved too much for Leeds, who fell away to finish in fifth place.|$|E
5|$|In 429 BC, Perdiccas II sent {{aid to the}} Spartan {{commander}} Cnemus in Acarnania, but the Macedonian forces arrived {{too late}} to enter the Battle of Naupactus, which ended in an Athenian victory. In that same year, Sitalces, according to Thucydides, invaded Macedonia {{at the behest of}} Athens to aid them in subduing Chalcidice and to punish Perdiccas II for violating the terms of their peace treaty. However, given Sitalces' huge Thracian invading force (allegedly 150,000 soldiers) and a nephew of Perdiccas II that he intended to place on the Macedonian throne after toppling the latter's regime, Athens must have become wary of acting on their supposed alliance since they failed to provide him with promised naval support. Sitalces eventually retreated from Macedonia, perhaps due to logistical concerns: a shortage of provisions and <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> conditions.|$|E

5|$|In January 2011, Grint made a cameo {{appearance}} in BBC popular comedy show Come Fly with Me starring comedy duo Matt Lucas and David Walliams (Little Britain). In March 2011, Grint was {{cast as the}} lead character in the small-budget anti-war Norwegian film Into the White, which was directed by Petter Næss. Principal photography started in April, and the project, which was shot on location, was released in 2012. Into the White {{is based on a}} real incident that took place on 27 April 1940, when German Luftwaffe pilot Horst Schopis’s bomber was shot down at Grotli by a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm Blackburn Skua, which then crash-landed. The several German and British crew members found shelter by chance during a <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> there.|$|E
5|$|The <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> of 1657/58 {{had forced}} the Dano-Norwegian fleet in port, and the Great and Little Belts {{separating}} the Danish isles {{from the mainland}} were frozen. After entering Jutland from the south, a Swedish army of 7,000 veterans undertook the March across the Belts; on 9 February 1658, the Little Belt was crossed and the island Funen (Fyn) captured within a few days, and soon thereafter Langeland, Lolland and Falster. On 25 February, the Swedish army continued across the Great Belt to Zealand with the Danish capital Copenhagen. Although only 5,000 men made it across the belts, the Swedish attack was completely unexpected; Frederick III was compelled to surrender and signed the disadvantageous Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658.|$|E
5|$|The rollout of Amfleets {{throughout}} {{the system was}} restricted by the availability of locomotives with HEP or special generator cars. The first route outside the Northeast Corridor to receive Amfleets was the Washington–Martinsburg Blue Ridge, on December 1. By November 1976, 350 Amfleets had been delivered and 78% of Amtrak's short-haul trains used either Amfleets or equally-modern Turboliner trainsets. Routes using Amfleets outside the Northeast Corridor included the Blue Ridge, Colonial, Twilight Limited, Wolverine, Illinois Zephyr, Abraham Lincoln, State House, Illini, Shawnee, Black Hawk, San Joaquin, Mount Rainier, Pacific International, Puget Sound, and San Diegan. The Amfleet's modern HEP system proved invaluable during the unusually <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the short-distance Amfleet I coaches into long-distance service. Budd completed delivery of the Amfleet I order on June 9, 1977.|$|E

5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{were unable}} to respond {{effectively}} to the Muslim advance in Africa, because the two decades between 695 and 715 were a period of great domestic turmoil. They did react with raids of their own in the East, {{such as the one}} in 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral, but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph al-Walid I (705–715) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor Anastasios II (713–715) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful pre-emptive strike against the Muslim naval preparations. Anastasios was soon overthrown by Theodosius III (715–717), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by Leo III the Isaurian (717–741). It was Leo III who faced the second and final Arab siege of Constantinople. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> and Bulgar attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Europe remained volatile into 1794. Off Northern France, the French Atlantic Fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay. In consequence, the French Navy officer corps suffered greatly {{from the effects}} of the Reign of Terror, with many experienced sailors being executed, imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty. The shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though; France itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a <b>harsh</b> <b>winter</b> to ruin the harvest. By this time at war with all her neighbours, France had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions. Eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the National Convention: food produced in France's overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in Chesapeake Bay, and augmented with food and goods purchased from the United States. During April and May 1794, the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the Atlantic to Brest, protected by elements of the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
