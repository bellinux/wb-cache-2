25|$|A {{second step}} was the {{privatization}} of the Tbilisi Water Supply Company. In 2006, a credit of 25 million USD had {{been approved by the}} European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to rehabilitate the water and sanitation infrastructure of Tbilisi. But the government refused the loan and instead opted for full privatization. In November 2007 it decided to sell the company to Multiplex Energy Limited, a newly created company whose ownership was not known to the public. The new company was obliged to keep tariffs unchanged {{for the next five years}} and to make substantial improvements, including the rehabilitation of the sewer infrastructure by 2012, 24-hour water supply within the entire service area by 2015 and the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant at Gardabani to replace the dilapidated existing plant by 2018. The private company took over its responsibilities in May 2008. A performance <b>incentive</b> <b>system</b> for employees and a new billing system were introduced, and connections were gradually retrofitted with meters reaching 23% of customers in 2013. According to an independent study, the overall results of water privatization in Tbilisi were positive. While staffing levels did gradually decrease from 1,962 full-time equivalents in 2006 to 1,606 in 2012, training and overall job satisfaction all increased. The average income of employees doubled between 2006 and 2013. This was more than the inflation rate during the same period, but increases were not as high as the average for water and power companies in Georgia. Furthermore, physical water losses and water theft (non-revenue water) decreased slightly (from 42% in 2006 to 38% in 2013) and water supply became continuous within the old administrative borders of Tbilisi in 2013.|$|E

The reform was initiated by Alexei Kosygin's First Government and implemented during the Eighth Five-Year Plan, 1968–1970.|$|E

Despite the critique put forward by business scholars and behavioral scholars, short-term structures are still prevalent within managerial <b>incentive</b> <b>systems.</b> This study explores why large cap firms have not aligned their managerial <b>incentive</b> <b>systems</b> to the critique from business scholars and behavioral scholars. Furthermore, this study aims to contribute to {{a deeper understanding of the}} existence and development of managerial <b>incentive</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to address the aim of the study, eight small case studies were conducted at eight large cap firms. The findings of the study indicate that short-term structures are considered pivotal in attracting and retaining managerial talent, directing the attention of managers to important targets in generating shareholder value and motivating the managers to perform at the top of their capacity. Furthermore, the study shows that the short-term structures, criticized within the academia, are reinforced and institutionalized by stakeholder pressure and organizational contingencies...|$|R

This paper investigates use of <b>incentive</b> pay <b>systems</b> in British and French private sector establishments in 2004, focusing on payment-by-results, merit pay, and profit sharing, using British and French workplace surveys: WERS and Réponse. Despite the stereotypes of Britain as a deregulated economy and France as a more coordinated social-market economy, French firms make considerably greater use of incentive pay, and particularly, merit pay. The paper explores the organisational and institutional determinants of this. It finds that personnel economics and management theories explain a significant share of the within country variation in use of <b>incentive</b> pay <b>systems.</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>systems,</b> merit pay, profit-sharing, employer organisation...|$|R
