50|$|The second airbag device {{which is}} now {{available}} is an <b>inflatable</b> <b>airbag</b> jacket. A rider can wear an airbag jacket that is tethered to the motorcycle, so {{if he or she}} is thrown from the bike during a collision, the jacket will automatically inflate for a 20 second period to provide a cushion for the rider. This will lessen the upper body and internal injuries to a rider that may often be fatal. Mugen Denko pioneered the development of airbag jackets in 1995 and conducted many tests, although the idea of an airbag jacket / vest was invented by Tamás Straub who applied for Hungarian patent in 1976.|$|E

50|$|For {{bodies with}} atmospheres, the landing occurs after {{atmospheric}} entry. In these cases, landers may employ parachutes {{to slow down}} and to maintain a low terminal velocity. Sometimes small landing rockets are fired just before impact to reduce the impact velocity. Landing may be accomplished by controlled descent and setdown on landing gear, with the possible addition of a post-landing attachment mechanism for celestial bodies with low gravity. Some missions (for example, Luna 9 and Mars Pathfinder) used <b>inflatable</b> <b>airbags</b> to cushion the lander's impact rather than a more traditional landing gear.|$|R

40|$|Human {{essential}} hypertension affects over 75 {{million people in}} the United States, and can lead to death due to its several serious health complications such as hypertension-related cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this research was to understand how hypertension could cause physiological changes to the microcirculation, specifically the PO 2 dependence of oxygen consumption (VO 2) in skeletal muscle of normotensive and hypertensive rats. The Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) strain was used as the diseased model, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls to conduct this study. The SHR strain develops hypertension between 5 - 6 weeks after birth with an average systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg. By arresting blood flow using an objective-mounted <b>inflatable</b> <b>airbag,</b> PO 2 measurements were obtained along with an oxygen disappearance curve (ODC), which was used to calculate VO 2 over various ranges of physiological PO 2 values. PO 2 and VO 2 curves were analyzed based on Hill’s equation to fit the data and describe the PO 2 dependence of VO 2. When compared to the healthy Wistar-Kyoto rats, the SHRs exhibited a higher Vmax, or maximum rate of oxygen consumption. The average maximal rate of consumption by the hypertensive animal models could be a consequence of a “mitochondrial uncoupling” or some disconnect in the mitochondrial oxygen consumption and the normal corresponding ATP production. In conclusion, this project demonstrated that in situ muscle tissue from hypertensive and normotensive rats had a PO 2 dependence of oxygen consumption over a wide range of physiological PO 2 values and the hypertensive rats consumed oxygen at a higher maximal rate...|$|E

40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [LLNL] was tasked {{to compare}} the impact {{response}} of NFL helmet pad systems and U. S. Army pad systems compatible with an Advanced Combat Helmet [ACH] at impact velocities up to 20 ft/s. This was a one-year study funded by the U. S. Army and JIEDDO. The Army/JIEDDO point of contact is COL R. Todd Dombroski, DO, JIEDDO Surgeon. LLNL was chosen by committee to perform the research based on prior published computational studies of the mechanical response of helmets and skulls to blast. Our collaborators include the U. S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory [USAARL] (a DoD laboratory responsible for impact testing helmets), Team Wendy and Oregon Aero (current and former ACH pad manufacturers), Riddell and Xenith (NFL pad manufacturers), and d 3 o (general purpose sports pad manufacturer). The manufacturer-supplied pad systems that were studied are shown in the figure below. The first two are the Army systems, which are bilayer foam pads with both hard and soft foam and a water-resistant airtight wrapper (Team Wendy) or a water-resistant airtight coating (Oregon Aero). The next two are NFL pad systems. The Xenith system consists of a thin foam pad and a hollow air-filled cylinder that elastically buckles under load. The Riddell system is a bilayer foam pad that is encased in an <b>inflatable</b> <b>airbag</b> with relief channels to neighboring pads in the helmet. The <b>inflatable</b> <b>airbag</b> is for comfort and provides no enhancement to impact mitigation. The d 3 o system consists of a rate-sensitive homogeneous dense foam. LLNL performed experiments to characterize the material properties of the individual foam materials and {{the response of the}} complete pad systems, to obtain parameters needed for the simulations. LLNL also performed X-ray CT scans of an ACH helmet shell that were used to construct a geometrically accurate computational model of the helmet. Two complementary sets of simulations were performed. The first set of simulations reproduced the experimental helmet impact certification tests performed by USAARL, who provided data for comparison. The goal of this set of simulations was to demonstrate the overall validity of LLNL's computational analyses and methods and understand the general physics of helmet impacts. In these tests and the corresponding simulations, an inverted ACH containing pads and a head-form are dropped onto a hemispherical anvil, at 10 and 14. 14 ft/s impact velocities. The simulations predicted peak accelerations (the metric used by USAARL for comparing the performance of pad systems), rebound velocities, and impact durations consistent with the experimental data, thus demonstrating the validity and relevance of the simulation methods. Because the NFL pad systems are approximately double the thickness of the U. S. Army pads, they do not fit into the ACH. As a result, the NFL pads could not be simply placed into an ACH shell in either a simulation or an experiment without modifying their size and shape. Since impact mitigation depends critically on the available stopping distance and the area over which the stopping force is applied, {{it is important to consider}} identically shaped pads in order {{to compare the}}ir performance in a fair and meaningful manner. Consequently, the second set of simulations utilized a simplified simulation geometry consisting of a 5 kg cylindrical impactor (equal in mass to a head) striking equally sized pads from each manufacturer. The simulated bilayer foam pads had the same proportions of hard and soft foam as the actual pad systems, while the Xenith pads were simulated as a bilayer foam pad with material properties adjusted to give the same response as the actual Xenith pads. The effects of trapped air were included in the simulations of the Team Wendy and Oregon Aero pads. All simulations used material properties derived from the experiments conducted at LLNL. The acceleration history of the center of mass of the impactor was used to calculate the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for each simulation, to assess the pad performance. The HIC is a well-established metric that combines both acceleration and duration of impact to assess the danger of injury, and is a more robust measure than peak acceleration. Our key findings are: (1) The performance of a pad depends on the range of impact velocities. At lower impact velocity, softer pads perform better. At higher impact velocity, harder pads perform better; (2) Thicker pads perform better at all velocities, but especially at high velocities; and (3) For comparable thicknesses, neither the NFL systems nor the Oregon Aero pads outperform the Team Wendy pads currently used in the ACH system in militarily-relevant impact scenarios (impact speeds less than 20 ft/s). The second finding suggests a commercial off-the-shelf solution for mitigating impact-related traumatic brain injury to soldiers...|$|E

5000|$|Larger North American {{pickup trucks}} are {{generally}} {{the best for}} carrying a truck camper, although many manufacturers produce units for lighter duty European and Japanese models. The {{gross vehicle weight rating}} (GVWR) of a truck is the figure used to determine what size camper may be carried. The GVWR, minus the weight of the truck with passengers and fuel is the payload that the truck may legally carry. Stability can be improved by the addition of a sway bar, add-on overload springs or <b>inflatable</b> <b>airbags</b> on the rear suspension. Most campers are rated at their [...] "dry weight" [...] which is the weight of the camper less any fluids like fresh water or sewage, and any possessions or add-ons that may add to the total weight.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been performed previously on assessing the out-of-plane (OOP) seismic performance of unreinforced clay brick masonry (URM) walls and the retrofitting of URM load-bearing and infill walls having a solid wall thickness. However, comparatively little {{research has}} been performed pertaining to URM walls with cavities (i. e., continuous air gaps separating wythes of brick from one another), despite the prominence of cavity masonry construction {{in various parts of the}} world. Hence, research was pursued with an emphasis on efficiently retrofitting URM cavity walls to enable the formation of composite behavior when subjected to simulated seismic OOP loading. The research reported herein was based on an experimental testing approach wherein walls were loaded OOP using <b>inflatable</b> <b>airbags.</b> Ten tests total were performed on nine separate URM cavity wall panels located in two separate buildings. The intended outcomes of the research reported herein included determining the OOP behavior of cavity walls in one-way vertical flexure both when bordered and not bordered by rigid moment-resisting reinforced concrete frames; to quantify the improvement in drift levels of cavity walls prior to loss in strength and prior to collapse using a variety of cavity wall ties at different spacing; to establish an effective solid wall thickness for cavity walls with various retrofit tie conditions for use in existing OOP predictive models; and to estimate how the semi-composite action generated by the retrofitting of cavity walls with stiff cavity ties may be predicted.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringMass transit bus {{is one of}} the key {{modes of}} transportation, {{especially}} in highly populated areas of the United States (US). Review of literature has shown that there is very little research, which focuses on the safety and comfort of a bus operator. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). FARS shows that there were 300 fatal bus accidents during the period from 1995 to 1999. Statistical data also shows that 16 bus operators suffered fatal injuries during the period from 1991 to 2000. The operators end up driving for long duration of time, which makes the three-point type of belt restraint system uncomfortable. This may also lead to stress and fatigue. The use of a two-point seat belt restraint system may be more comfortable for the operator since his hands and torso will be unrestrained. However, the physical sled testing of this seat belt configuration revealed severe life threatening risk for the operator. It was observed that the Head Injury Criteria (HIC 15) value was above the threshold limit of 700 and the femur load value was well over their allowable threshold limit of 10, 000 N. The Neck Injury Criteria (Nij) value was very close to the allowable threshold limit of 1. Thus, safety and comfort of the transit bus operator appear to be contradictory to each other. In this research, an effort had been made to develop a methodology to design an airbag restraint system for a mass transit bus operator, which can satisfy the two contradictory objectives. An Inflatable lap belt type of airbag restraint system has been previously implemented in aircraft safety. This system is comprised of a two-point restraint type seat belt system with an airbag embedded in it. This type of airbag safety system was tested in this study for a mass transit bus operator with an aim to keep the HIC and the Nij values within allowable limits. Additional knee-padding was designed to minimize the femur loads. All of the research was conducted for frontal impact of a bus with the rigid-wall crash condition. A model development of a two-point restraint type seat belt system was carried out with the occupant simulation code, MADYMO. This model is validated with the help of physical sled test data. The baseline simulation model was used to develop the numerical model of an <b>inflatable</b> lap belt <b>airbag</b> restraint system. With the help of numerical models, the prototypes of airbag and inflators were manufactured. A physical sled test was also carried out for this system under frontal impact condition. This test data was utilized to validate the simulation results obtained from the MADYMO model. The physical sled testing as well as numerical models were developed for the three-point belt restraint system. Except the femur injury, all of the injuries were within the allowable safe limit. A physical sled test with the airbag and the knee-padding was also conducted to test the performance of an <b>inflatable</b> lap belt <b>airbag</b> restraint system. A knee-padding played a vital role to minimize the femur injury. The Results from this study can be utilized in the design and development of a safety belt system for optimal protection of mass transit bus operators in the event of a frontal impact crashes. This study can be utilized further for designing the safety restraint system for other crash conditions...|$|R
