25|$|Early in the 20th century, a {{cache of}} texts {{was found in a}} mound near Gilgit in Pakistan. Amongst them was the Ajitasena Sūtra. This sutra appears to be a mixture of Mahayana and pre-Mahayana ideas. The text is set in a world where monasticism is the norm, typical of the Pāli Suttas; there <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the usual {{antagonism}} towards the śravakas (i.e., the early Buddhists) or the notion of Arahantship, as is typical of Mahayana sutras such as the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra.|$|E

25|$|Radiocarbon dating, {{begun in}} 1995 by {{physicist}} Douglass Donahue and chemists Jacqueline Olin and Garman Harbottle, places {{the origin of}} the parchment somewhere between 1423 and 1445. The initial results were confusing because the unknown substance the British Museum had found across the whole map, effectively ignored by later researchers who were concentrating on the ink, turned out to be trapping tiny traces of fallout deep within the parchment from 1950s nuclear tests. Although there <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> this 1950s substance on top of the ink, further tests, starting with a detailed chemical analysis, are needed to confirm whether the lines were drawn after it soaked into the parchment.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Morrissey {{launched}} his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all {{did well in}} the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his subsequent albums, Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted, also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he embarked on a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, and World Peace <b>Is</b> <b>None</b> <b>of</b> Your Business. He released his autobiography in 2013, followed by his first novel in 2015. His eleventh solo album, Low in High School, is set {{to be released in}} November 2017.|$|E

500|$|Late in September, a British convoy {{consisting}} of 13 battered ships under Captain Sir James Saumarez appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, {{they were in}} urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege. Nevertheless, Saumarez met {{with representatives of the}} Maltese and on 25 September, sent an offer of truce to Vaubois on their behalf. Vaubois replied [...] "Vous avez, sans doute, oublié que des Français sont dans la place. Le sort des habitans [...] ne vous regarde pointe. Quant à votre sommation, les soldats français ne sont point habitués à ce style" [...] ("You might have forgotten that the French hold this place. The fate of the inhabitants <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> your concern. As for your ultimatum, French soldiers are not accustomed to such a tone"). Unable to persuade the French to give in, Saumarez instead provided the Maltese forces with 1,200 muskets with which to continue the siege. Saumarez, unable to delay repairs any longer, sailed for Gibraltar {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
500|$|Public {{reception}} of Gaga's music, fashion sense, and persona is polarized. Because of her influence on modern culture, and her rise to global fame, sociologist Mathieu Deflem of the University of South Carolina {{has offered a}} course titled [...] "Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame" [...] since early 2011 {{with the objective of}} unraveling [...] "some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga". When Gaga met briefly with politician Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser, he found the interaction [...] "intimidating" [...] as she was dressed in 16-inch heels, making her the tallest woman in the room. When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009, Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend. Responding to a question on this issue, she expressed her fondness for androgyny. In a 2010 Sunday Times article, Camille Paglia criticized Gaga as [...] "more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker, a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks, the rebellious and the dispossessed when she <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> those".|$|E
500|$|The Oxford English Dictionary {{defines the}} word cunt as [...] "The female {{external}} genital organs" [...] and notes [...] "Its currency is restricted {{in the manner}} of other taboo-words: see the small-type note s.v. FUCK v." [...] During the Middle Ages the word may often have been considered merely vulgar, having been in common use in its anatomical sense since at least the 13thcentury. [...] In The Miller's Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer writes [...] "And prively he caughte hire by the queynte" [...] (and intimately he caught her by her crotch), and Philotus (1603) mentions [...] "put doun thy hand and graip hir cunt." [...] Gradually though the word became used more as the obscenity it is generally considered to be today. [...] In John Garfield's Wandring Whore II (1660) the word is applied to a woman, specifically a whore—"this <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> your pittiful Sneakesbyes and Raskalls that will offer a sturdy C— but eighteen pence or two shillings, and repent of the business afterwards". [...] Francis Grose's A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue (1785) lists the word as [...] "C**t. [...] The chonnos of the Greek, and the cunnus of the Latin dictionaries; a nasty name for a nasty thing: un con Miege." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Frank {{authored}} the States' Rights to Medical Marijuana Act (H.R. 2592), {{an attempt}} to stop the federal government from preempting states' medical marijuana laws. He has consistently voted for the bipartisan Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment, annually proposed by Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), that would prohibit the United States Department of Justice from prosecuting medical marijuana patients. In March 2008, he proposed the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008 (HR 5843), which would have decriminalized small amounts of the drug, but which died in committee during the 110th Congress. [...] On June 18, 2009, he re-introduced the bill as the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2009 (HR 2943). Commenting on legislation to remove federal criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, Frank stated [...] "In a free society a large degree of human activity <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the government's business. We should make criminal what's going to hurt other people and other than that we should leave it to people {{to make their own}} choices." [...] In 2003, he was rated [...] "A" [...] by Vote Hemp, indicating a pro-hemp voting record. In 2006 he was rated [...] "+30" [...] by NORML, indicating a pro-drug-reform stance. In 2007 he co-sponsored the [...] "Drug Sentencing Reform & Kingpin Trafficking Act" [...] ((S.1711) 07-S1711) to [...] "target cocaine kingpins and address sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine". In 2008, Frank sponsored [...] "Removing Impediments to Students Education" [...] (RISE) ((H.R.5157) 08-HR5157) to allow rehabilitated drug offenders to get student loans.|$|E

After finishing a six date {{tour in the}} UK, he did a US tour during June and July, including a concert in New York with special guest Blondie at Madison Square Garden. In July 2015, he publicly claimed that an airport security guard had groped him at San Francisco International Airport.

2500|$|Scholar J. Glentworth Butler says that, in the Greek, there <b>is</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> {{the sorrow}} or regret {{contained}} in the words repentance and repent. Repentance denotes [...] "sorrow for what one has done or omitted to do; especially, contrition for sin." [...] Repent primarily means [...] "to review one's actions and feel contrition or regret for something one has done or omitted to do" [...] Therefore, Butler asserts that translating metanoeō/μετανοέω and metanoia/μετάνοια as repent and repentance constitute [...] "an utter mistranslation" [...] that translators excuse {{by the fact that}} no English word can adequately convey the meaning of the Greek words.|$|E
2500|$|Also in January 2014, he {{announced}} that he had signed a two-record deal with Capitol Music, with recording to commence on 1 February in France.

Prior to its release, he embarked on a US tour in May but was hospitalised in Boston in early June, and cancelled the remaining nine dates on the tour. The title track of the album was issued as a digital download in May. Three other songs, [...] "Istanbul", [...] "Earth Is the Loneliest Planet" [...] and [...] "The Bullfighter Dies" [...] followed in subsequent weeks. The songs were promoted with spoken word videos, featuring Morrissey reciting the lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|The {{planetary}} {{problem is}} the -body problem in the case {{that one of the}} masses is much larger than all the others. A prototypical example of a planetary {{problem is the}} Sun–Jupiter–Saturn system, where the mass of the Sun is about 1000 times larger than the masses of Jupiter or Saturn. An approximate solution to the problem is to decompose it into [...] pairs of star–planet Kepler problems, treating interactions among the planets as perturbations.
