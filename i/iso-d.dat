40|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} the absence of the fragile X mental-retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP and the fragile X-related proteins 1 and 2 (FXR 1 P and FXR 2 P) form a gene family with functional similarities, such as RNA binding, polyribosomal association and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In a previous study, we found that FMRP and FXR 1 P shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, while FXR 2 P shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleolus. The nuclear and nucleolar-targeting properties of these proteins were investigated further. Here, we show that FXR 2 P contains in its C-terminal part, a stretch of basic amino acids 'RPQRRNRSRRRRFR' that resemble the nucleolar-targeting signal (NoS) of the viral protein Rev. This particular sequence is also present within exon 15 of the FXR 1 gene. This exon undergoes alternative splicing and is therefore only present in some of the FXR 1 P isoforms. We investigated the intracellular distribution of various FXR 1 P isoforms with (iso-e and iso-f) and without (<b>iso-d)</b> the potential NoS in transfected COS cells treated with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin-B. Both iso-e and iso-f showed a nucleolar localization, as observed for FXR 2 P; <b>iso-d</b> was detected in the nucleo-plasm outside the nucleoli. Further, when a labelled 16 -residue synthetic peptide corresponding to the NoS of FXR 1 P was added to human fibroblast cultures a clear nucleolar signal was observed. Based on these data we argue that the intranuclear distribution of FXR 2 P and FXR 1 P isoforms is very likely to be mediated by a similar NoS localized in their C-terminal region. This domain is absent in some FXR 1 P isoforms as well as in all FMRP isoforms, suggesting functional differences for this family of proteins, possibly related to RNA metabolism in different tissues...|$|E

The N 52 I substitution results in {{a significant increase in}} both stability and cooperativity of equilibrium unfolding, and acts as a "global suppressor" of destabilizing mutations. The equilibrium m-value for denaturant-induced unfolding of N 52 I <b>iso-</b> 2 increases by 30 %, a surprisingly large amount for a single residue substitution. The folding/unfolding kinetics for N 52 I <b>iso-</b> 2 have been measured by stopped-flow mixing and by manual mixing, and are compared to the kinetics of folding/unfolding of wild-type protein, <b>iso-</b> 2 cytochrome c. The results show that the observable folding rate and the guanidine hydrochloride dependence of the folding rate are the same for <b>iso-</b> 2 and N 52 I <b>iso-</b> 2, despite the greater thermodynamic stability of N 52 I <b>iso-</b> 2. Thus, there is no linear free-energy relationship between mutation-induced changes in stability and observable refolding rates. However, for N 52 I <b>iso-</b> 2 the unfolding rate is slower and the guanidine hydrochloride dependence of the unfolding rate is smaller than for <b>iso-</b> 2. The differences in the denaturant dependence of the unfolding rates suggest that the N 52 I substitution decreases the change in the solvent accessible hydrophobic surface between the native state and the transition state. Two aspects of the results are inconsistent with a two-state folding/unfolding mechanism and imply the presence of folding intermediates: (1) observable refolding rate constants calculated from the two-state mechanism by combining equilibrium data and unfolding rate measurements deviate from the observed refolding rate constants; (2) kinetically unresolved signal changes ("burst phase") are observed for both N 52 I <b>iso-</b> 2 and <b>iso-</b> 2 refolding. The "burst phase" amplitude is larger for N 52 I <b>iso-</b> 2 than for <b>iso-</b> 2, suggesting that the intermediates formed during the "burst phase" are stabilized by the N 52 I substitution...|$|R

40|$|Native <b>iso-</b> 2 {{cytochrome}} c {{contains two}} residues (His 18, Met 80) coordinated to the covalently attached heme. On unfolding of <b>iso-</b> 2, the His 18 ligand remains coordinated to the heme iron, whereas Met 80 is displaced by a non-native heme ligand, His 33 or His 39. To test whether non-native His-heme ligation slows folding, we have constructed a double mutant protein {{in which the}} non-native ligands are replaced by asparagine and lysine, respectively (H 33 N,H 39 K <b>iso-</b> 2). The double mutant protein, which cannot form non-native histidine-heme coordinate bonds, folds significantly faster than normal <b>iso-</b> 2 cytochrome c: gamma = 14 - 26 ms for H 33 N,H 39 K <b>iso-</b> 2 versus gamma = 200 - 1, 100 ms for <b>iso-</b> 2.

Recently, a specific small molecule inhibitor of MIF (<b>ISO-</b> 1) has been described. We investigated the effects of <b>ISO-</b> 1 on TLR responses in primary human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). In monocytes, <b>ISO-</b> 1 caused marked suppression of TLR 4 -induced proinflammatory cytokine production, {{and to a lesser}} extent suppression of TLR 2 -induced responses. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced activation of cocultures of monocytes and endothelial cells was strongly inhibited by <b>ISO-</b> 1. Suppression of monocyte TLR 4 signalling by <b>ISO-</b> 1 was associated with alterations in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) - 1 / 2 activation status.

Complementation tests of 6, 520 chlorolactate-resistant mutants that were obtained spontaneously or induced with UV, ICR- 170, or nitrosoimidazolidone resulted {{in the identification of}} 195 mutations at the cyc 1 locus, which controls the primary structure of <b>iso-</b> 1 -cytochrome c. These 195 mutants, with 16 cyc 1 mutants previously isolated, were examined for total cytochrome c by spectroscopic methods, growth on lactate medium, suppressibility by defined nonsense suppressors, mutational sites by x-ray-induced recombination, ability to revert, and in 86 cases, whether intragenic revertants contain altered <b>iso-</b> 1 -cytochrome c. Except for the deletion mutant cyc 1 – 1, all of the mutants appeared to contain single-site mutations that could be assigned to at least 35 different sites within the gene.

40|$|To {{define the}} import pathway for apoiso- 1 -cytochrome c in vivo, the coding region for {{bacterial}} chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or yeast copper metallothionein (CuMT) was fused to the carboxy terminus of the apoiso- 1 -cytochrome c (<b>iso-</b> 1) coding region. When the resulting <b>iso-</b> 1 /CAT and <b>iso-</b> 1 /CuMT fusion proteins were individually expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, they were specifically targeted to the mitochondria and protected from trypsin digestion. Although <b>iso-</b> 1 /CAT was accessible to heme modification, it remained membrane associated {{because of the}} folded conformation of the CAT domain. A small deletion disrupting CAT structure resulted in the translocation of the resulting fusion protein, <b>iso-</b> 1 /CAT delta, to the intermembrane space, where it functioned efficiently in respiratory electron transfer. Similarly, <b>iso-</b> 1 /CuMT was heme modified and nearly identical to <b>iso-</b> 1 {{in its ability to}} support respiratory growth, indicating that the CuMT domain was compatible with translocation to the IMS. Inclusion of copper in the growth medium, which converts the loosely structured apo-CuMT to a tightly folded holo-CuMT, inhibited both heme attachment and respiratory growth without affecting mitochondrial targeting. Thus, by altering the folded conformation of the reporter moiety of these fusion proteins, it was possible to differentiate between those molecules arrested at the mitochondrial targeting step of the cytochrome c import pathway and those translocated to the intermembrane space. By replacing the heme-binding cysteine residues with serines, this system was used to demonstrate that the import requirement for heme attachment operated at the level of membrane translocation and not on mitochondrial targeting in vivo...|$|R

The cyc 2, cyc 3, cyc 8 and cyc 9 genes are located, respectively, on chromosomes XV, I, II and III, and are, therefore, unlinked to each other and unlinked to CYC 1, the structural gene of <b>iso-</b> 1 -cytochrome c and to CYC 7, the structural gene of <b>iso-</b> 2 -cytochrome c. While some cyc 3 mutants are completely or almost completely deficient in cyotchromes c, none of the cyc 2 mutants contained less than 10 % of parental level of cytochrome c even though over one-half of the mutants contain UAA or UAG nonsense mutations. Thus, it appears as if a complete block of the cyc 2 gene product still allows the formation of a residual fraction of cytochrome c. The cyc 2 and cyc 3 mutant genes cause deficiencies even in the presence of CYC 7, cyc 8 and cyc 9, which normally cause overproduction of <b>iso-</b> 2 -cytochrome c.

The present investigation tested the hypothesis that pre-ischaemic treatment with isoflurane mimics ischaemic preconditioning (producing chemical preconditioning) and thereby protects the myocardium against ischaemic injury in an isolated rat heart model. Control hearts underwent 30 min of global no-flow ischaemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion.

Consistent with the less cooperative folding thus expected for the horse protein, the guanidine-HCl m-values are ∼ 3 kcal mol− 1 M− 1 versus ∼ 4. 5 kcal mol− 1 M− 1 for horse versus yeast cytochrome c. The tight free energy spacing of the yeast cytochrome c substructures suggests that its folding has more branch points than for horse cytochrome c. Studies on a variant of <b>iso-</b> 1 -cytochrome c with an H 26 N mutation indicate that the least and most stable substructures unfold sequentially and the two least stable substructures unfold independently as for horse cytochrome c. Thus, important aspects of the substructure architecture of horse cytochrome c, albeit compressed energetically, are preserved evolutionally in yeast <b>iso-</b> 1 -cytochrome c...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Software {{usability}} {{became an}} important quality factor in recent years due to the increasing demand of interactive software systems. Now mostly systems are developing using object-oriented methodology. The object-oriented methodology reduces design complexity, so enhances usability. Also object-oriented approach improves the usability of software system when software engineering process combined with usability engineering. This paper proposes an extended <b>ISO-</b> 9241 usability model. Since fuzzy modeling approach deals with uncertainty and impreciseness involved in usability and its sub-factors, this paper investigate the application of fuzzy AHP technique to <b>ISO-</b> 9241 model and the proposed enhanced <b>ISO-</b> 9241 model. The result shows better usability of proposed model in comparison of existing model...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Development of {{metabolic}} syndrome {{is associated with}} impaired cardiac performance, mitochondrial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory cytokine increase, such as the macrophage migration inhibitory factor MIF. Depending on conditions, MIF may exert both beneficial and deleterious effects on the myocardium. Therefore, we tested whether pharmacological inhibition of MIF prevented or worsened {{metabolic syndrome}}-induced myocardial dysfunction. Methods and Results: C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed for ten weeks with 60 % fat-enriched diet (HFD) or normal diet (ND). MIF inhibition was obtained by injecting mice twice a week with <b>ISO-</b> 1, for three consecutive weeks. Then, triglycerides, cholesterol, fat mass, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, ex vivo cardiac contractility, animal energetic substrate utilization assessed by indirect calorimetry and mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis were evaluated. HFD led to fat mass increase, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. <b>ISO-</b> 1 did not alter these parameters. However, MIF inhibition was responsible for HFD-induced cardiac dysfunction worsening. Mouse capacity to increase oxygen consumption in response to exercise was reduced in HFD compared to ND, and further diminished in <b>ISO-</b> 1 -treated HFD group. Mitochondrial respiration was reduced in HFD mice, treated or not with <b>ISO-</b> 1. Compared to ND, mitochondrial biogenesis signaling was upregulated in the HFD as demonstrated by mitochondrial DNA amount and PGC- 1 a expression. However, this increase in biogenesis was blocked by <b>ISO-</b> 1 treatment...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{structures}} of <b>iso-</b> 1 -cytochrome c and <b>iso-</b> 2 -cytochrome c in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{are determined by}} the genes CYC 1 and CYC 7, respectively. The CYC 1 locus was previously shown to be on the right arm of chromosome X, and the CYC 7 locus is shown in this investigation to be on the left arm of chromosome V closely linked to the min 1 and mak 10 markers. The CYC 7 locus appears to be composed of a structural region and a regulatory region. Mutations in the structural region can cause a deficiency or alteration of <b>iso-</b> 2 -cytochrome c, whereas mutations in the regulatory region can cause increases in the amount of <b>iso-</b> 2 -cytochrome c. Single-site gene conversion, occurring at a relatively high frequency of approximately 4 %, caused intragenic recombination of a mutational site in the structural region and a mutational site in the regulatory region, enabling us to suggest the order of the sites in relationship to other markers on the chromosome...|$|R
