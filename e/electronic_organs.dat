5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>organs,</b> the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than <b>electronic</b> <b>organs,</b> because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, {{before the}} popularization of <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> and the {{introductions}} of combo organs, manufacturers developed and marketed various portable monophonic electronic instruments with small keyboards. These small instruments consisted of an electronic oscillator, vibrato effect, passive filters etc. Most of these (except for Clavivox) {{were designed for}} conventional ensembles, rather than as experimental instruments for electronic music studios—but they contributed {{to the evolution of}} modern synthesizers.|$|E
25|$|The Hammond Novachord {{released}} in 1939, was an electronic keyboard that used twelve sets of top-octave oscillators with octave dividers to generate sound, with vibrato, a resonator filter bank and a dynamic envelope controller. During {{the three years}} that Hammond manufactured this model, 1,069 units were shipped, but production was discontinued {{at the start of}} World War II. Both instruments were the forerunners of the later <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> and polyphonic synthesizers.|$|E

500|$|Perfectionist is a dance-pop and synthpop album, characterised by [...] "driving rhythm {{sections}} and edgy minor-key melodies". Its opening track, [...] "Perfection", runs for thirty seconds {{and sees a}} [...] "robotic-sounding" [...] therapist listing Kills' flaws. [...] "Wonderland", which fantasises about romance and a relationship's [...] "perfect ending", includes synthesizer arrangements and choir sections; the line [...] "Take me to wonderland" [...] is repeated throughout the song. A track including a bassline, piano, club beats and synths, [...] "Free" [...] samples [...] "Wuthering Heights" [...] by Kate Bush. It was written by Kills when {{she worked as a}} waitress, and discusses [...] "bailing on a budget". [...] "Break You Hard" [...] is an industrial pop song with [...] "hypnotic rhythms", which talks about [...] "breaking a lover", while [...] "Zombie" [...] incorporates <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> and [...] "mumbling bass" [...] in an electronic R sound.|$|E
500|$|On April 24, 1934, Hammond filed [...] for an [...] "electrical musical instrument", {{which was}} {{personally}} {{delivered to the}} patent office by Hanert, explaining that they could start production immediately {{and it would be}} good for local employment in Chicago. The invention was unveiled to the public in April 1935, and the first model, the Model A, was made available in June of that year. Over 1,750 churches purchased a Hammond organ in the first three years of manufacturing, and by the end of the 1930s, over 200 instruments were being made each month. For all its subsequent success with professional musicians, the original company did not target its products at that market, principally because Hammond did not think [...] enough money was [...] in it. The Hammond Organ Company produced an estimated two million instruments in its lifetime; these have been described as [...] "probably the most successful <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> ever made". In 1966, an estimated 50,000 churches had installed a Hammond.|$|E

2500|$|Broadly speaking, in {{a popular}} music context, the term {{electronic}} keyboard or just a keyboard mostly refers to any type of digital or electronic keyboard instrument. These include synthesizers, digital pianos, stage pianos, <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> and digital audio workstations. However, in true musical terminology, an electronic keyboard is an inexpensive synthesizer equipped with built-in power amplifier and small loudspeakers.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electronic}} keyboard may also called a digital keyboard, portable keyboard, or [...] home keyboard, referring their digital-based sound generation and light-weight, portable build. In China, Japan, India, and Southeast Asia (particularly Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand), {{electronic keyboard}}s were often mistakenly {{referred to as}} an organ, due to popularity of home <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> in those countries and keyboards/synthesizers are considered as a similar instrument.|$|E

2500|$|Arpeggiators seem to {{have grown}} from the accompaniment system used in <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> in the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. They were also {{commonly}} fitted to keyboard instruments through the late 1970s and early 1980s. [...] Notable examples are the RMI Harmonic Synthesizer (1974), Roland Jupiter-8, Oberheim OB-8, Roland SH-101, Sequential Circuits Six-Trak and Korg Polysix. [...] A famous example can be heard on Duran Duran's song [...] "Rio", in which the arpeggiator on a Roland Jupiter-4 plays a C minor chord in random mode. They fell out of favor by {{the latter part of}} the 1980s and early 1990s and were absent from the most popular synthesizers of the period but a resurgence of interest in analog synthesizers during the 1990s, and the use of rapid-fire arpeggios in several popular dance hits, brought with it a resurgence.|$|E
2500|$|Acid rock often {{encompasses}} the more extreme {{side of the}} psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and guitar-centered sound. Alan Bisbort and Parke Puterbaugh write that acid rock [...] "can {{best be described as}} psychedelia at its rawest and most intense [...] Bad trips as well as good, riots as well as peace, pain as well as pleasure - the whole spectrum of reality, not just the idyllic bits, were captured by acid rock." [...] "Acid rock" [...] has also been described as more heavily electric and containing more distortion ("fuzz") than typical psychedelic rock. By the late 1960s, in addition to the deliberate use of distortion and feedback, acid rock was further characterized by long guitar solos and the frequent use of <b>electronic</b> <b>organs.</b> Lyric references to drug use were also common, as exemplified in Jefferson Airplane's 1967 song [...] "White Rabbit" [...] and Jimi Hendrix Experience's 1967 song [...] "Purple Haze". Lyrical references to drugs such as LSD were often cryptic.|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, with {{significant}} new supporting evidence, {{it was reported}} {{on the pages of}} Popular Science Monthly that the human vocal cords function like a fire siren to produce a harmonic-rich tone, which is then filtered by the vocal tract to produce different vowel tones. By the time, the additive Hammond organ was already on market. Most early electronic organ makers thought it too expensive to manufacture the plurality of oscillators required by additive organs, and began instead to build subtractive ones. In a 1940 Institute of Radio Engineers meeting, the head field engineer of Hammond elaborated on the company's new Novachord as having a “subtractive system” in contrast to the original Hammond organ in which “the final tones were built up by combining sound waves”. Alan Douglas used the qualifiers additive and subtractive to describe different types of <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> in a 1948 paper presented to the Royal Musical Association. [...] The contemporary wording additive synthesis and subtractive synthesis can be found in his 1957 book The electrical production of music, in which he categorically lists three methods of forming of musical tone-colours, in sections titled Additive synthesis, Subtractive synthesis, and Other forms of combinations.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, the Wurlitzer Company {{released}} the company's first electric piano, the model 100. The wurlitzer strikes flat tines whose vibration is amplified from a surrounding electrostatic charged 'comb'. [...] In '59 the Fender company bought the Rhodes name and produced the piano bass {{and then in}} the mid '60s began producing the famous Fender Rhodes series which used rod shaped tines mounted on a steel piece that runs parallel above them, with a coil pickup on each individual tine. The invention of the transistor in 1959 spawned the production of progressively more compact keyboards. [...] Many home organs maintained the appearance but lost some weight due to the lower power consumption needs of transistor circuitry. [...] Also in this era 'combo organs' found a lot of use like the famous Vox Continental used by the Beatles and others, the Gibson G101 used by the doors, and others by Farfisa, Wurlitzer, Acetone (Roland) and others. These were usually built using 12 oscillators and transistor pair 'divider' circuits to produce all the frequencies like all non- 'tone wheel' <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> of the era. They were just more compact and thus suited for 'combo' use.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>organs</b> {{are still}} {{made for the}} home market, {{but they have been}} largely {{replaced}} by the digital keyboard or synthesizer, which is not only smaller and cheaper than typical <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> or traditional pianos, but also far more capable than the most-advanced <b>electronic</b> <b>organs</b> of earlier years. Modern digital organs, by the same token, are far more advanced in design and capabilities than their ancestors. Today's digital organs have reached a degree of sophistication and complexity surpassed only by the pipe organ itself, and often offer features not found in pipe organs, such as orchestral and percussion sounds, a choice of historical pitch standards and temperaments, and advanced console aids.|$|E
