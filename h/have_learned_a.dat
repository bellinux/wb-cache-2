25|$|I am {{unable to}} state with {{certainty}} what language the Pelasgians spoke, but we could consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia {{in the city of}} Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.|$|E
500|$|Khan {{began dating}} Avantika Malik (daughter of Vandana Malik, CEO of the CNBC-TV18 {{business}} news channel), at age 19– according to him, {{when he could}} not express his thoughts and feelings. He later attributed his personal growth to his relationship with Malik: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> lot about myself and become a more balanced person." [...] His openness about their relationship {{at an early stage}} of his career received much press coverage; Sitanshi Talati-Parikh of Verve commented, [...] "he does not see any danger in tagging himself as 'unavailable'". Khan later explained that he did not believe in hiding their relationship; he cited Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan and Hrithik Roshan, all of whom married early in their careers and remained popular. The couple were engaged on 16 January 2010, in a farmhouse owned by Avantika's family in Karjat (near Navi Mumbai). They married a year later (on 10 January 2011) in a private civil ceremony at Aamir Khan's home in Pali Hill. On December 6, 2013, it was announced that the couple were expecting their first child and on June 9, 2014, Malik gave birth to a baby girl, Imara Malik Khan.|$|E
500|$|Žigić played {{regularly}} {{through the}} 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign under {{the management of}} Radomir Antić, contributing three goals and partnering former Red Star teammate Marko Pantelić as Serbia qualified for a major tournament {{for the first time}} as an independent nation. Ahead of the tournament proper, he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006: [...] "I went to Germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of. Tactically, I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> lot and I'm in much better condition, both physically and psychologically. This is my World Cup, I think I can play a lead role and I want to show I'm a player that can do it in big games." [...] After losing to Ghana in the opening group match, Serbia went on to face Germany. Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose's first-half dismissal, Žigić headed a cross down to Milan Jovanović who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game; Lukas Podolski's second-half penalty was saved, and Antić dedicated the victory to the Serbian people. In a game of missed chances against Australia, Serbia lost 2–1 and finished bottom of the group.|$|E

500|$|McEwen faced {{questions}} about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank. Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen's checks, the expenses of his Congressional office, and his campaign finance disclosures, while noting Portman was [...] "the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd" [...] and was [...] "a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington," [...] labeling Portman and McEwen [...] "Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob." [...] McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, [...] "McEwen says now that his problem {{was a form of}} excessive pride. He says he used to 'demand perfection' of himself." [...] McEwen also said, [...] "I felt I could never admit a mistake.... I am very, very sorry. I should have watched it more carefully.... I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> great deal." [...] Les Spaeth, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor, said, [...] "People very much disliked the check overdraft thing, but I think they don't see it as happening again. I think it's past. He made a mistake and he got caught. But that's overridden by the service he's given, particularly to our county." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1821, {{shortly before}} his seventeenth birthday, Disraeli was {{articled}} as a clerk to a firm of solicitors—Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearse and Hunt—in the City of London. T F Maples {{was not only the}} young Disraeli's employer and friend of his father's, but also his prospective father-in-law: Isaac and Maples entertained the possibility that the latter's only daughter might be a suitable match for Benjamin. A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was [...] "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including Robert Blake and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, [...] "I had some scruples, for even then I dreamed of Parliament. My father's refrain always was 'Philip Carteret Webb', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It {{would be a mistake to}} suppose that the two years and more that I was in the office of our friend were wasted. I have often thought, though I have often regretted the University, that it was much the reverse." ...|$|E

[...] Mason added: [...] "I can tell you that my colleagues from coast to coast and border to border have condemned this whole process of lawyers getting on television and talking about cases that they don't know a damn thing about, and don't have the experience to back up their words or the law to do it. Now you <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> lesson." ...|$|E
2500|$|But younger architects in the 1930s {{criticized the}} style {{and size of the}} {{buildings}} at Federal Triangle for being [...] "elitist, pretentious, and anachronistic". Architecture critic William Harlan Hale strongly criticized the Neoclassical style for being unimaginative and anti-democratic: [...] "New Deal indeed! What was there new, or modern, or imaginative, or efficient, or economical in trying to give modern Washington the character of Imperial Rome? What was there either aesthetic or intelligent in cloaking the offices of a modern democracy as the temple of a classic tyrant, the gallery of a Renaissance prince, or the palace of a French monarch? ...we have learned quite a lot about the principles of modern architecture, just as we <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> lot about some other things; and today, after so short a time, it looks pretty much like a relic out of the dim past." [...] By the 1940s, some critics said the buildings were too reminiscent of Nazi and Soviet architecture.|$|E

2500|$|Kabbalists {{hold that}} {{not only do the}} words of Torah give a divine message, but they also {{indicate}} a far greater message that extends beyond them. Thus they hold that even as small a mark as a kotzo shel yod (קוצו של יוד), the serif of the Hebrew letter yod (י), the smallest letter, or decorative markings, or repeated words, were put there by God to teach scores of lessons. This is regardless of whether that yod appears in the phrase [...] "I am the Lord thy God" [...] ( [...] , Exodus 20:2) or whether it appears in [...] "And God spoke unto Moses saying" [...] ( [...] Exodus 6:2). In a similar vein, Rabbi Akiva (c. 50 – c. 135 CE), is said to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> new law from every et (את) in the Torah (Talmud, tractate Pesachim 22b); the particle et is meaningless by itself, and serves only to mark the direct object. In other words, the Orthodox belief is that even apparently contextual text [...] "And God spoke unto Moses saying..." [...] is no less important than the actual statement.|$|E
