The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit.

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts {{situated at the}} base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.|$|E
25|$|Black Mill was {{the third}} mill on the site. There was a mill on Barham Down in the thirteenth century.

The Maniots had nowhere to bury so many corpses, so they threw them down wells. The plain later got the name 'Vromopigada,' which means 'Dirty Wells'.|$|E

25|$|The bridge has {{not always}} been the source of tragedy, the evening of the 18th of May 1969 is fondly remembered by many of the {{community}} when a truck laden with Bushmills and Cream of Barley Whiskey was traveling from Antrim to Dublin when its brakes failed coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> it rolled over the bridge wall into the river some 3 meters or so below, the driver survived and was brought to Hospital but the entire loot of liquor was strewn across the river bottom. Most of the town of Slane were quick on the scene, vans and truck were seen spiriting away from the wreck of the truck in the dead of night. Several prosecutions followed, the actual quantity of whiskey taken away is still known only to the management of Bushmills and perhaps to the Insurance Company that followed up the claim. The following day five Irish Divers, Brian Cusack, Sean Sheridan, Joe Murray, Fergus McKenna and Sean Donohoe arrived and while the local people of Slane were still dredging for bottles they collected 408 bottles in total, the local butcher in Slane at the time was apparently still drinking Bushmills Whiskey four years later.|$|E

500|$|No {{one in the}} Patriot army held command {{once the}} {{fighting}} started. Each detachment fought independently under the previously agreed to plan to surround and destroy the Loyalists. The Patriots crept {{up the hill and}} fired from behind rocks and trees. Ferguson rallied his troops and launched a desperate bayonet-charge against Campbell and Sevier. Lacking bayonets, the Patriots ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> into the woods. Campbell soon rallied his troops, returned to the hill, and resumed firing. Ferguson ordered two more bayonet charges during the battle. This became the pattern of the battle; the Patriots would charge up the hill, then the Tories would charge down the hill with fixed bayonets, driving the Patriots off the slopes and into the woods. Once the charge was spent and the Tories returned to their positions, the Patriots would reform in the woods, return {{to the base of the}} hill, and charge up the hill again. During one of the charges, Colonel Williams was killed, and Colonel McDowell was wounded. Firing was difficult for the Loyalists, since the Patriots constantly moved using cover and concealment to their advantage. [...] Furthermore, the downhill angle of the hill contributed to the Loyalists overshooting their marks.|$|E

500|$|The six {{finally agreed}} that Capper {{had to be}} removed from the house after Michelle Capper told them her {{stepfather}} was going to report her to the police as a missing person. In the early hours of 14 December 1992, Capper was forced into the boot of a stolen white Fiat Panda car and driven 15 miles (25 km) to a narrow lane at Werneth Low near Romiley, on the outskirts of Stockport. In the car were McNeilly, the Powells and Dudson. McNeilly [...] "giggled" [...] as they made the journey. Capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then McNeilly poured petrol over her. Powell stated: [...] "Suzanne was still wobbly and fell over. Bernie [...] said 'Get up.' Bernie pushed her <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> poured petrol on her." [...] When McNeilly had difficulty getting the petrol to ignite, Glyn Powell asked Dudson for some paper, who handed him a folded envelope which Powell then attempted to light and use as a taper. After three failed attempts, Dudson said: [...] "In the end he just went up to her with a lighter and lit her. He lit her on the back. She went straight up in flames and was screaming. The flames lit up the whole forest." [...] McNeilly began to sing [...] "Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn!" [...] from the Trammps' song Disco Inferno. [...] Believing Capper to be dead, the four returned to Jean Powell's house, stopping to buy canned drinks on the way. Both Leigh and Pook were at the house when they arrived and Dudson stated: [...] "Cliff [...] asked Glyn , 'Have you done it?' Glyn said 'Yes' and he was laughing. He gave Cliff his lighter back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sanderstead [...] is {{a village}} in the London Borough of Croydon, {{situated}} on high ground {{at the edge of}} the built-up area of Greater London. From 1915 to 1965 it formed a parish in the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District of Surrey.

The Grade I listed All Saints' Church dates from the 13th century but was extensively altered in later periods.

Among those in attendance many MPs, as Parliament was adjourned for the day despite the fierce objections of one member, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, who denounced the sport as [...] "rascality and roguery". After a delay caused by the crowd overflowing onto the racecourse, Robert the Devil broke quickly and was sent into the lead by his jockey, Rossiter, with a mile to travel. He led the field <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>and</b> into the straight as several challengers emerged and then dropped away, and entering the final furlong he had a commanding lead and looked the likely winner. Fred Archer on Bend Or however, had been making gradual progress and sent his colt up to join the leader in the closing strages. Robert the Devil responded with a [...] "brilliant effort", but at the line the favourite prevailed by a head after a [...] "magnificent" [...] finish. It was widely agreed that the riding of Archer on the winner was the main difference between the colts.|$|E
