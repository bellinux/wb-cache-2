40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{correlation}} between the degree of torn rotator cuff as recorded by MRI and degenerative change of acromion and greater <b>tuberosity</b> <b>of</b> <b>humerus</b> determined by simple radiographs. Materials and Methods: Of the 518 cases included in this study, a group of 234 cases had a chronic rotator cuff tear and a control group of 284 cases had an intact rotator cuff in shoulder MRI. The degree of degenerative changes was classified according to the length of spur and morphological change of acromion and greater tuberosity through the true anteroposterior simple radiograph in supraspinatus outlet view. The degree of tear (partial-thickness or full-thickness tear) and the size of complete rotator cuff tear were analyzed according to the MRI findings of shoulder. The authors also evaluated the correlation between the degree and size of torn rotator cuff and the degenerative change of acromion and greater tuberosity. Results: There were significant differences in the size and extent of torn rotator cuff according to the age, sex and degenerative change of acromion and greater <b>tuberosity</b> <b>of</b> <b>humerus</b> (p< 0. 001). More degenerative changes of acromion and greater tuberosity in simple shoulder radiographs showed the increased degree and size of torn rotator cuff (p< 0. 001). In addition, the higher degree and larger size of torn rotator cuff were noted in older age subjects (p< 0. 001) and in the female group (p< 0. 001).

We present an arthroscopically assisted technique which avoids an incision through the deltoid obtaining a better and faster clinical outcome. The patient is placed in lateral decubitus. After the arthroscopic evaluation of the lesion through a posterior and a posterolateral portal, with the limb in traction we perform the preparation <b>of</b> the greater <b>tuberosity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus.</b> We place the arm in abduction and internal rotation and we proceed to the harvest of the latissimus dorsi and the tendon preparation by stitching the two sides using very resistant sutures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was, firstly, to {{determine}} if muscle activity in the rat has any effect on the growth in length <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> and on the migration <b>of</b> the <b>deltoid</b> <b>tuberosity</b> and, secondly, to evaluate the effect of muscle activity on the size and shape <b>of</b> the <b>deltoid</b> <b>tuberosity.</b> Three groups <b>of</b> 25 days old male rats were used. In the first group the brachial plexus innervating one forelimb was resected (the treatment side) and the opposite side was unoperated (the non-treatment side). The second group was sham-operated {{on one side and the}} third group, the control group, was unoperated. All animals were killed at 53 days of age and the dried humeri measured and compared. For all dimensions the experimental group varied significantly from the remaining two groups in the magnitude of the differences between the treatment and non-treatment sides. In the experimental group the <b>deltoid</b> <b>tuberosities</b> were smaller, less curved, and closer to the proximal end of the bone in humeri from the treatment sides compared to humeri from the non-treatment sides. Humeri from the treatment sides were significantly shorter and were narrower opposite the <b>deltoid</b> <b>tuberosity.</b> A prominent nutrient artery canal was significantly closer to the proximal end of the bone in humeri from the treatment side. These results indicate that after denervation more growth occurred distally and less growth occurred proximally. The differences were, however, small. The present study provides evidence of the contribution made by muscle activity to the form and growth in length of a long bone, and provides indirect evidence of the interaction between the activity of the growth plates and periosteal tension. It is postulated that muscle pull affects periosteal tension and consequently bone form and growth in length...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most}} commonly dislocated large joint. Sudden violence applied to the humerus with the joint fully abducted tilts the humeral head downward onto the inferior weak part of the capsule, which tears, and the humeral head comes to lie inferior to the glenoid fossa. During this movement the acromion has acted as a fulcrum. The strong flexors and adductors of the {{shoulder joint}} now usually pull the humeral head forward and upward into the subcoracoid posi-tion. Posterior dislocations are rare and are usually due to direct force {{on the shoulder of}} the patient form front, the rounded appear-ance of the shoulder is seen to be lost, since the greater <b>tuberosity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> is no longer bulging laterally beneath the deltoid muscle.

40|$|Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is {{regarded}} as the workhorse for reconstruction in many head and neck surgeries and was first described by Ariyan in late 1970 s. Mc Gregor and Reed in 1970 described the blood supply to skin flaps as axial or random. PMMC has both axial blood supply (distinct arteriovenous circulation along its long axis) in its proximal part as well as random supply (communicating vessels in dermal subdermal plexus) in the distal part beyond the pectoral branches of thoracoacromial artery when skin and underlying rectus fascia are included. Pectoralis major being a thick fan shaped muscle has origins from medial half of clavicle, sternocostal from manubrium and body of sternum with second to sixth costal cartilage and from rectus fascia. It is inserted into the crest <b>of</b> greater <b>tuberosity</b> <b>of</b> <b>humerus.</b> The fibers are directed from horizontal to oblique. The nerve supply is from lateral pectoral nerve which arises from the lateral cord of brachial plexus and is located medially and from medial pectoral nerve which is located laterally and originates from medial cord of brachial plexus. Lateral pectoral nerve is closely related to pectoral branch of the thoracoacromian artery and forms the neurovascular bundle. The arterial supply is from the pectoral branch of thoracoacromian artery, the lateral thoracic artery from axillary artery and from superior thoracic artery to a lesser extent. The pectoral branch of thoracoacromian artery is the main supply and it lies between pectoralis major and minor muscle, engulfed in the fascia running inferiorly along the oblique fibers of pectoralis major muscle upto the fifth or sixth rib being medial to the nipple...|$|R

40|$|Massive {{rotator cuff}} tears are {{difficult}} to treat surgically due to retraction, degeneration and fraying of the ends of torn tendons, severe fatty infiltration and atrophy of the respective muscles.

We developed a new technique for repairing massive rotator cuff tears by semitendinosus and gracilis myotendinous grafting.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect on}} movement under load of three different techniques for re-attachment <b>of</b> the <b>tuberosities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> using test sawbones.

An orthogonal photogrammetric system allowed all segments to be tracked in a 3 D axis system. The humeri were incrementally-loaded in abduction, and the 3 D linear and angular movements of all segments were calculated. Displacement between the tuberosities and the shaft was measured. The first and second techniques were the most stable constructs, with the third allowing greater separation of fragments and angular movement.

40|$|SummaryDuring the {{assembly}} of the musculoskeletal system, bone ridges provide a stable anchoring point and stress dissipation for the attachment of muscles via tendons to the skeleton.

The inhibition <b>of</b> <b>deltoid</b> <b>tuberosity</b> formation and several other bone ridges in embryos in which Bmp 4 expression was blocked specifically in Scx-expressing cells implicates BMP 4 as a key mediator of tendon effects on bone ridge formation.

40|$|Background: Diagnosing {{impingement}} syndrome without {{rotator cuff}} tear usually {{depends on the}} physical examination and roentgenography, and obtaining objective evidence for this condition is at best difficult. The {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain whether quantitatively assessing this condition with using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) can diagnose impingement syndrome and predict the postoperative results. Methods: Before executing arthroscopic or open treatment, SPECT was performed on 73 patients and 24 volunteers and these people were followed up for 2 years. Any increased uptake on SPECT was investigated by using the axial view, which demonstrated the greatest uptake for the acromion, distal clavicle, greater tuberosity, lesser tuberosity and the coracoid process of the operated and non-operated sides. Results: The patients who were diagnosed as having impingement syndrome with or without rotator cuff tear showed increased uptake on the operative side compared to the non-operated side in the assessed locations. The greater <b>tuberosity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> could be used for quantitative measurement as a postoperative prognostic factor. Conclusions: The bone SPECT method is useful for making the diagnosis of patients with impingement sydrome, and the results of quantitative assessment at the greater tuberosity can be used for evaluating the prognosis following the operation...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the prevalence of ultrasound (US) pathologic abnormalities in the shoulders of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients and to compare them with the main clinical findings.

The subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, the sheath of the long biceps tendon, the glenohumeral joint and the acromion-clavicular joint were examined for the presence of synovial effusions and synovial hypertrophy. Rotator cuff tendons (supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus) were imaged for tendinosis, calcifications and total or partial tears, while deltoid enthesis were evaluated for local enthesitis and the lesser and greater <b>tuberosity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humerus</b> for the presence of enthesophytes. RESULTS: Tendinosis represented the most frequent abnormal finding. Supraspinatus tendinosis was detected more often than subscapularis and infraspinatus tendinosis. When considering tendon tear, supraspinatus was also the most frequently involved anatomical structure. Clinical examination frequently failed to detect abnormalities in patients in whom US examination showed pathological findings.
