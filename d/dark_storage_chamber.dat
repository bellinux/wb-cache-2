With initial far red light treatment more than 80 % remained dormant in subsequent <b>dark</b> <b>storage.</b> After 2 days of <b>dark</b> <b>storage,</b> red light effectively promoted germination, while gibberellic acid action was weak.

Different codes and regulations for ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>chambers</b> specify minimum embedment depth and separation distance for underground ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>chambers.</b> They are usually given in terms of the rock mass properties and the weight of explosive stored in chambers. Some empirical formulae, usually based on the peak particle velocity of the stress wave or the maximum strain of the rock mass, are also available to estimate the damage zones in the rock mass from an explosion. All these empirical methods do not include the effects of explosion details, such as the loading density, chamber geometry and explosive distribution. In this paper, a previously calibrated numerical model is used to estimate the damage zones in a granite mass resulting from an accidental explosion in an underground ammunition <b>storage</b> <b>chamber.</b> Effects of various explosion conditions on rock mass damage are investigated. On the basis of the numerical results, some empirical formulae are derived to predict damage zones around the explosion chamber, as well as safe embedment depth of the <b>storage</b> <b>chamber</b> and safe separation distance between adjacent chambers.

ABSTRACT CONT’D • The reference values used were 9. 5 oC for temperature and 95 % humidity level. The output was interfaced to the power control circuit of the cooling system, and the humidity adjusting mechanism to keep the state of the chamber to these desired values. The maximum mass of tomatoes designed for <b>storage</b> in the <b>chamber</b> was 10 kg.
