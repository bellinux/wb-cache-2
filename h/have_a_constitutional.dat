5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{describes}} no-fault or unilateral divorce {{based on}} no fault {{as a power}} grab by the parent that initiates the divorce and he also states that fathers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> right to shared control {{of their children and}} through political action they intend to establish parental authority for both parents and for the well-being of their children. Members of the fathers' rights movement state that a rebuttable presumption for shared parenting preserves a child's protection against unfit or violent parents.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{does not}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> {{bill of rights}} and there are few express rights {{guaranteed}} by the Constitution. However, certain indirect protections have been recognised by implication or as a consequence of other constitutional principles. For example, there is an implied guarantee of freedom of political communication. Additionally, rights are protected indirectly through the separation of powers, which requires courts to be sufficiently independent and impartial from the other branches of government. Human rights in Australia are generally protected through statutes and the common law.|$|E
25|$|The Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland {{provided}} that children {{born on the}} island of Ireland to parents who were both foreign nationals would no longer <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> right to citizenship of the Republic of Ireland. It was effected by the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act, 2004, which was approved by referendum on 11 June 2004 and signed into law on 24 June of the same year. It partially reversed changes made to the Constitution by the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which was passed as part of the Good Friday Agreement.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} real property, mechanic's liens are purely {{statutory}} devices {{that exist in}} every state (although in California, as noted below, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> foundation). The reason they exist is a legislative public policy to protect contractors. More specifically, the state legislatures have determined that, due to {{the economics of the}} construction business, contractors and subcontractors need greater remedy for non-payment for their work than merely the right to sue on their contracts. In particular, without the mechanics' lien, subcontractors providing either labor or materials may have no effective remedy if their general contractor is not sufficiently financially responsible, because their only contractual right is with that general contractor.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{revised the}} Wagner Act's {{requirement}} of employer neutrality, to allow employers to deliver anti-union messages in the workplace. These changes confirmed an earlier Supreme Court ruling that employers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> right {{to express their}} opposition to unions, {{so long as they}} did not threaten employees with reprisals for their union activities nor offer any incentives to employees as an alternative to unionizing. The amendments also gave employers the right to file a petition asking the Board to determine if a union represents a majority of its employees, and allow employees to petition either to decertify their union, or to invalidate the union security provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
500|$|There were {{attempts}} at compromise. The Crittenden Compromise would have extended the Missouri Compromise line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, {{contrary to the}} Republican Party's free-soil platform. Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, [...] "I will suffer death before I consent... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> right." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{article in}} the American Criminal Law Review, {{published}} in 2011 by Stacey Kime, disagreed with some of Hewett's arguments. Kime argued that [...] "it is well settled that criminal defendants <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> right to present exculpatory evidence", disagreeing {{with the idea that}} the basis for a robust defense had been gutted. Instead, she blamed the [...] "incoherent" [...] standard today on a lack of understanding of where the [...] "source of this constitutional right" [...] to have a strong defense lies. Unlike Hewett, who targeted post-Washington decisions, Kime believed that there were flaws in the Washington opinion itself. Specifically, she argued that [...] "the Court's reasoning was not only unnecessary, but the Washington doctrine itself is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment's history and text".|$|E
500|$|The case drew {{national}} media attention, prompting editorials from the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, among others. [...] The case has also drawn {{notice in the}} legal community, with articles in the American Bar Association Journal and the Volokh Conspiracy. In addition, the United States Department of Justice cited the Glik case extensively {{in a letter to}} the Baltimore Police Department expressing concerns over policies dealing with officer interactions with citizen photographers and videographers. Commentary from law journals also discussed the lasting impact of the case. In an article for the Case Western Reserve Law Review, Gregory T. Frohman wrote that the court's ruling [...] "seemingly laid down a nearly unfettered right for nonthreatening third-party recorders in public places". In an article for the Northern Illinois University Law Review, Jesse Harlan Alderman wrote that [...] "hough Glik and Alvarez hold sway only [...] within [...] their [...] respective [...] jurisdictions, it [...] seems [...] likely [...] that [...] the [...] right [...] to record [...] public [...] police [...] activity [...] will [...] be [...] treated [...] as [...] universal". Matt Giffin, writing for the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, observed that the case [...] "could play a significant role in solidifying the emerging consensus that citizens <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> interest in monitoring the activities of police officers". Likewise, in an article for the Cardozo Law Review, Travis S. Triano noted that the Court's ruling emphasized that [...] "Glik’s filming was found to fall well within the bounds of constitutional protections".|$|E

Most grenades and rocket-launchers are smuggled through Guatemalan borders, as leftovers from past central-American conflicts. However some grenades are also smuggled from the US to Mexico [...] or stolen from the Mexican military.|$|E

Adair in the November election by plurality. Goodrich's primary goal was to bring [...] "efficiency and economy" [...] to the government. Almost all of the state's primary source of revenue came through property tax which was seen as unfairly targeting farmers and the rural parts of the state. In 1917 Goodrich tried to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> convention called to amend the Constitution of Indiana to allow excise taxes to be imposed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fight for}} {{abortion}} rights {{in other states}} continues, as many state laws criminalize miscarriage in a crime characterized as [...] "aggravated homicide of a family member" [...] and activists have worked to have excessively harsh sentences of up to 30 years reduced. In 2010, Veronica Cruz was successful in leading the effort to free seven women serving prison sentences for abortion or miscarriage in Guanajuato and in 2011 secured a similar release in Guerrero. In November 2014, the SCJN began hearings on a case from Veracruz, {{which is the first}} case in Mexico to ask the court to consider whether women <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> right to abortion and whether criminalization should be eliminated across the nation.|$|E

McCarthy also wrote that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, while not allowing a standard habeas corpus review, provides that each detainee [...] "has a right to appeal to our civilian-justice system. — specifically, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. And if that appeal is unsuccessful, the terrorist may also seek certiorari review by the Supreme Court." ...|$|E
