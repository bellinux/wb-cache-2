5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} also re-examined {{the role of}} the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the {{accession}} process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral obligation to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, {{one of the reasons why}} the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.|$|E

2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of Monday 15 October, roadblocks were set up between Ruatoki and Taneatua by armed police, who searched and {{questioned}} everyone who passed through. After reports that a school bus was stopped and searched, police superintendent Wally Haumaha said these reports were wrong. However, the bus driver told a hikoi four days after the raid: [...] "The police did hop on our bus and they did search our bus ... they always held their rifles." [...] The organiser of the hikoi called on the government to acknowledge the incident and <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> children affected by it. Speaking on Radio New Zealand she asked [...] "I'd like to ask that question why? [...] is it because we're from Ruatoki? Is it because the majority of children are Māori out here?" [...] Police maintained a strong presence in Ruatoki in the days following the initial raids and continued to question locals.|$|E
2500|$|From there, word-of-mouth spread. In 2003, the {{non-profit}} Foundation for US Historical Monuments {{was formed to}} help bring about the monument's creation. After their efforts faltered, an anonymous [...] group of Wall Street bankers who lost friends and co-workers in the [...] 9/11 attacks learned about his sculpture. They commissioned Blumberg to build a large-scale version for a monument near Ground Zero, paying $500,000 for the work. The Gary Sinese Foundation and the Green Beret Foundation supported the effort to build the monument. No public funds were used. Two of the individual Wall Street supporters said they were asked by families and friends {{if there was a}} place that individuals could go to remember the U.S. troops overseas who daily combat potential terrorist threats. [...] "We wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> special operations community and all military service branches, because every day since 9/11, we've had to look at that hole in the ground," [...] one of the private backers says. [...] "What everyone needs to know is: There are people out there like this team, like the Green Berets, that are willing to sacrifice at all costs for them." [...] At its rededication, the statue's entire cost of over $750,000 was paid by hundreds of private citizens.|$|E
