500|$|Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a {{possible}} rising star in the party {{and that he has}} a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I {{think there will be a}} lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago." [...] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed [...] "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012." ...|$|E
500|$|Langford {{later said}} that Neighbours {{is doing a}} [...] "fairly decent job" [...] with Chris's coming out story. He wished that viewers got {{to see more of}} Chris's {{thoughts}} and feelings and less of how his situation affected the people around him. Langford added [...] "I do like that Chris isn't a perfect kid. Many shows tend to make gay teens near saints. Instead, he's a fairly average kid who makes mistakes and messes up, like starting a fight at a basketball game. In July 2011, Langford revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up. He opined {{that there is not a}} hint of romance between the two and wondered why people assumed that if a gay character shares a scene with another guy, they must get together. Langford revealed that he liked Chris and Lucas's mentor and mentee relationship as it is. The writer also commented on the introduction of Chris's father and said that he was [...] "delighted" [...] that Chris was finally getting his own drama, that was [...] "pretty realistic." [...] He added [...] "It's nice to see the father/son dynamic play out. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> a lot of Chris's dad's issues stem from the fact that his son is gay and I hope the show will delve into those unresoved issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|When I {{hear what}} we call music, {{it seems to me}} that someone is talking. And talking about his feelings, or about his ideas of relationships. But when I hear traffic, the sound of traffic—here on Sixth Avenue, for instance—I don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> anyone is talking. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> sound is acting. And I love the {{activity}} of sound [...] I don't need sound to talk to me.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "little red dot" [...] gained {{currency}} {{after the}} former Indonesian President B. J. (Bacharuddin Jusuf) Habibie {{was regarded as}} having criticized Singapore {{in an article published}} in the Asian Wall Street Journal of 4 August 1998. It was reported that Habibie had remarked that he did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> Singapore was a friend, and had pointed to a map, saying: [...] "It's O.K. with me, but there are 211 million people [...] All the green [...] is Indonesia. And that red dot is Singapore." [...] The remark caused an outcry as it was seen as a dismissal of Singapore.|$|E
2500|$|Obsessions are {{thoughts}} that recur and persist despite efforts to ignore or confront them. People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or compulsions, to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, {{vary in their}} clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying or intrusions related to [...] "relationship rightness". Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> inanimate objects are ensouled.|$|E
2500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{her interest}} in developing new soundscapes, [...] "I love experimenting and I love working with different sounds and putting them together so they’re not one-dimensional." [...] She also added [...] "Right now we're working on collecting and creating the sound first before we even start working on the lyrical direction or melodies. I kind of have an idea though, and it's very rough right now. So I'm very eager to start that." [...] Sean Garrett spoke on the album's sound saying it was [...] "a great mish-mash of genres". Rihanna revealed during an interview with GQ's [...] "Men of the Year" [...] that she wanted her music to be uplifting saying [...] "I want to make music that’s hopeful, uplifting. Nothing corny or supersentimental. I just want it to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> brings you out of whatever you’re going through. I want it to spark that fire. I {{want it to be}} real, authentic, and raw." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of {{supporting}} Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote Rhinoceros as {{a criticism of}} blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; {{at the end of}} the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros [...] Sartre criticized Rhinoceros by questioning: [...] "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there". [...] Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, [...] "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".|$|E

5000|$|The first {{performance}} of Tabula Rasa in Tallinn 1977 {{was considered to}} be a major success. The composer Erkki-Sven Tüür, said about the performance: [...] "I was carried beyond.

60|$|He <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{he hated}} {{it more than}} she--to him sex was {{so much easier to}} mention between man and woman than between man and man; and she had always been more natural and frank, not deeply secretive like his Forsyte self.|$|R

60|$|A picaresque {{novel is}} only a very eventful biography; but the opening of Bleak House is quite another {{business}} altogether. It is admirable in quite another way. The description of the fog in {{the first chapter of}} Bleak House is good in itself; but it is not merely good in itself, like the description of the wind in the opening of Martin Chuzzlewit; it is also good in the sense that Maeterlinck is good; it is what the modern people call an atmosphere. Dickens begins in the Chancery fog because he means to end in the Chancery fog. He did not begin in the Chuzzlewit wind because he meant to end in it; he began in it because it was a good beginning. This is perhaps the best short way of stating the peculiarity of the position of Bleak House. In this Bleak House beginning we <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> it is not only a beginning; we <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the author sees the conclusion and the whole. The beginning is alpha and omega: the beginning and the end. He means that all the characters and all the events shall be read through the smoky colours of that sinister and unnatural vapour.|$|E

I shall feel--can't you appreciate that?--as though my task with him had come naturally and gracefully to an end. We have both fulfilled our obligations to one another.

Besides, honestly, Nigel, I don't feel frivolous enough to think about marriage just now. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> even while the clock is ticking we are moving on to terrible things. I can't tell you quite what it is. I carried my life in my hands during those last few days abroad. I dare say this is the reaction." ...|$|E
6000|$|They feel, themselves, {{that the}} forces of society tend to hurl them out of existence.

The conversation turned to the [...] "white potion" [...] and [...] "black jack," [...] and I found they were all agreed that the poor person, man or woman, who in the Infirmary gave too much trouble or was in a bad way, was [...] "polished off." [...] That is to say, the incurables and the obstreperous were given a dose of [...] "black jack" [...] or the [...] "white potion," [...] and sent over the divide.
