50|$|The {{interior}} reduced button clutter {{by adding}} a 7-inch touchscreen with haptic feedback, an additional 8-inch screen is also standard. To reduce interior noise an acoustic (PVB layered) windshield, acoustic front door glass and thicker rear glass are used as well as triple sealed door openings. Advance package models include further noise reduction using a thicker carpet base layer and <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> <b>liners.</b> The seating H-point has been reduced and the steering gear ratio is 9% quicker for a more sporty feel. The MDX rides lower reducing its center of gravity.|$|R
5000|$|For 1974, {{the major}} {{exterior}} changes were a revised front end and 5 mph rear bumper, increasing overall length 6 in, and a slanted front header panel with recessed headlamp bezels. Louvered steel replaced the egg-crate plastic grille. Front and rear aluminum bumpers with inner steel spring replaced the chrome items, with license plate mountings relocated. A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had larger single-unit taillights, with ventilation grills eliminated from trunk and hatch lids. A [...] fuel tank replaced the [...] tank. Side striping replaced {{the hood and}} deck stripes for the GT sport stripes option. The custom interior's wood-trimmed molded door panels were replaced by vinyl door panels matching the seat trim. January saw plastic <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> <b>liners</b> added after thousands of fenders were replaced under warranty on 1971-1974 models. In February the [...] "Spirit of America" [...] limited-edition hatchback was introduced, with white exterior, white vinyl roof, blue and red striping on body sides, hood and rear-end panel, emblems on <b>front</b> <b>fenders</b> and rear panel, white [...] "GT" [...] wheels, A70-13 raised white-letter tires, white custom vinyl interior and red accent color carpeting. Seventy-five hundred Vegas were built through May. Sales peaked at 460,374 for the 1974 model year.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{designs of}} the car panel need to be studied by digitizing {{the surface of the}} panel of various car models. This research focuses on the static simulation analysis especially to strain, stress and displacement analysis of a <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel {{of the car}}. The main objectives of this research are to study the design of the existing exterior car body part, analyze and proposed the mechanism to improve the design using Finite Element Method software. To achieve that, three different designs of <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel were used, there are Proton Iswara, Honda EG and Proton Saga <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel. A 3 D Scanner machine used to scan the actual model of <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel and to convert the model into the simulation analysis format by using POLYWORK software. SOLIDWORKS software was used to create corner radius and surface of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel of the car. After that, analysis was carried out by using commercial Finite Elements software (ALGOR) to evaluate and analyze the behavior and surface of a <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel of the car. It is considered the function, design, strength and the rigidity of the stamping parts of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel. In this research, this <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel analyzed using the static simulation analysis for components with linear materials. For this simulation, two types of load will be applied {{on the surface of the}} <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel which are at all surface area and at selected surface area. The result will be analyzed based on the strain, stress and the displacement of the surface of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel. The comparison of strain, stress and displacement data of each car <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> model were done using graphs. With this, the process of digitizing the surface of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> model can be done easily. After that, a related study was carried out to know the properties of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel during the impact of the applied load. At the end of this research, the comparison data of various car <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panels will be known and could be the basis for the future design. Besides that, the area between the optimum line and the minimum line for each graph analysis can be used as a guideline and a mechanism to improve the design of <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel in the future...|$|R
