5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> ear has been lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt {{may also be}} divided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> and outer belts, with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5AU), and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide {{the inner and outer}} belts at the 2:1 resonance gap (3.3 AU), whereas others suggest inner, middle, and outer belts; also see diagram).|$|E
5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> Solar System. The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E

5|$|With Grace's support, Carroll {{was able}} to attend school in France—at Lille and at the University of Douai—where he studied the humanities, philosophy, and civil and canon law. By May 1685, Carroll had moved to London, where he {{registered}} to study English common law and was accepted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> Temple, {{one of the four}} Inns of Court that are able to call members to the bar and enable them to practice law. According to family tradition, Carroll secured a position as clerk to William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, an Englishman who was one of two Catholic peers in the court of James II.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner,</b> rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the galactic}} tide, the main trigger for sending comets <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> Solar System {{is thought to}} be {{interaction}} between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect). During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on the {{cultural}} and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has put forward a revisionist interpretation of the castle's architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle {{was intended to be}} entered from {{the north end of the}} Lower Court, passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and then up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> Court. This would have provided high status visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political prestige of the owners. Historian Magnus Alexander disputes the practicality of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.|$|E
5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E
