5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with <b>data</b> <b>capture</b> models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E

It was the fifth national population census exercise of Zambia since its independence in 1964, with the previous censuses conducted in 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the processing started in April 2011 by the Central Statistical Office. Optical Mark Reading (OMR) and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology were used for <b>data</b> <b>capture.</b> The census was funded by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Kingdom AID (UKAID-formerly DFID), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), who contributed close to 60 per cent of the total expenditure and rest contributed by the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Zambia.|$|E

In some situations the gateway impossibly does force a user to access the sensor node directly. In such case the security and reliability to inquire and data disseminate are very important. Only when every client (remote sensor node, remote user) in the WSNs proves his/her identity can he/she be allowed to join the WSNs and access to resource, such as real-time data. Thus, a key security requirement for WSNs is user authentication [2 - 5].|$|R
