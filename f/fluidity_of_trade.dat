40|$|In {{the context}} of {{globalization}} the shift from the national to the global has become an economic reality and advanced the emergence of regional integration groups alongside regional competition policies. In the same vein, the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has adopted a regional competition law, which entered into force in 2003. WAEMU follows a centralized approach to its competition policy, in which the Union {{not only has the}} exclusive competence to legislate on anticompetitive practices, but also bears the exclusive decision-making power regarding the enforcement of the law. National competition-law authorities are mainly excluded from the decision-making process and limited to consulting or executive functions. However, the centralized approach is not flawless. The expected reforms in the member states are still pending, the collaboration of national structures and the community is not effective and the regional institutional level, which was supposed to constitute a strong authority, faces severe constraints in terms of resources and flexibility. The regional case law also remains limited. The effectiveness of the community competition law thus far has {{failed to live up to}} its expectations. This paper builds on WAEMU’s eight years experience of enforcement as well as other regional integration experiences, such as ECOWAS or the EU, and identifies a certain number of criteria, which should be taken into account when designing a regional competition policy. The so called “competition constraints” are the number of states and the level of integration of the regional market, the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> between member states, the respective institutional capacities of the member states and the Union, the existence or lack of a competition culture in the member states and the time dimension. By analyzing the interaction between the competition constraints and the institutional design of a regional competition policy, one can extract certain principles of orientation regarding the applicable substantive law and the distribution of competences. Applying the lessons learned to the case of WAEMU, the insufficient involvement of the national competition law authorities appears as one of the main deficiencies of the institutional framework of WAEMU. Therefore, this paper calls for a “controlled decentralization”, which includes the installation of a new collaboration framework between the regional and the national level...|$|E
40|$|The Director General of the OIE, Dr Bernard Vallat, {{welcomed the}} FDC Members {{and gave a}} brief review of the OIE Third Strategic Plan for the period 2001 – 2005. In this context, Dr Vallat {{referred}} to the rationale for the increase in the OIE Member Country contributions and budget from 2001 onwards, which will allow new opportunities for increased activities by the OIE and its Specialist Commissions. For the FDC, this means that the number of meetings could be increased, and/or the length of meetings could be extended. Dr Vallat also presented the new organisational structure of the OIE. The present Department of Information and International Trade will be split into two departments – one will be devoted to the safety and <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> international <b>trade</b> in animals and animal products. New topics within these areas will be food safety and animal welfare. Aquatic animals could be included in this work; many countries are concerned about welfare in aquatic animals, especially in respect to aquaculture.

The GARCH (Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) model which visually embodies the auto-regress of the wave of exchange rate shows that the amount <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> will enhance the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> the exchange rate, that is, the various expects of the participators of the market affect the amount <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and the <b>fluidity,</b> so in the process <b>of</b> <b>trading,</b> the trader who is in the dry tree of information bears more trading expenditure. It is predicted that the liberalization of foreign exchange rate and fluctuated exchange rate system will jointly bring the enhancement <b>of</b> the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> the exchange rate and the amount <b>of</b> exchange <b>trade.</b> The change <b>of</b> this system will bring the rise of participators in foreign exchange market; meanwhile, it will also initiate superfluous <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> foreign exchange market.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> four different high pressure die cast Al-Si alloys at different pouring temperatures. A vacuum fluidity test apparatus was employed to measure fluidity. The analysed alloys showed different flow sensitivities to casting temperatures.

One alloy was then contaminated with 50 % scrap addition, increasing the amount of oxide inclusions. The <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> the contaminated melt has then been measured and compared with the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> the clean melt. The results show that the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> the alloy with scrap addition is lower than that of the clean melt.

The results show that pouring temperature, mould temperature and squeeze velocity can significantly affect the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> magnesium alloy specimens with wall thickness no more than 4 mm, and the pouring temperature is the most influential factor on the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> specimens with wall thickness of 1, 2 and 3 mm, while mould temperature is the one for specimens with wall thickness of 4 mm. Increasing pouring temperature between 700 °C and 750 °C is beneficial to the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> AZ 91 D magnesium alloy, and increasing mould temperature significantly enhances the filling ability of thick (3 and 4 mm) section castings.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, to {{determine}} a possible role of insulin in the regulation of membrane functions, we have {{examined the effects of}} insulin on the membrane <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> erythrocytes in patients with essential hypertension and normotensive subjects. Membrane <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> erythrocytes obtained from hypertensive and normotensive subjects were evaluated by means of an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and a spin-labeling method. In an in vitro study, insulin increased the order parameter (S for 5 -nitroxide stearate) and the peak height ratio (ho/h- 1 for 16 nitroxide stearate) in the EPR spectra of erythrocyte membranes, which indicated that insulin decreased the membrane <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> erythrocytes. The effects of insulin on the membrane fluidity were potentiated in the presence of extracellular Ca 21, and in contrast, were antagonized by the Ca 21 channel blocker diltiazem. Furthermore, the effects of insulin alone and in combination with Ca 21 on the membrane fluidity were reduced in the erythrocytes from hypertensive subjects compared with the erythrocytes from normotensive controls. The high concentrations of glucose alone produced no significant effects on the membrane <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> erythrocytes. These results demonstrated that insulin might actively participate in the regulation <b>of</b> membrane <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> erythrocytes, which might be mediated by the intracellular Ca 21 kinetics...|$|R

40|$|The {{membranous}} {{structures of}} the pulmonary extracellular lining {{were removed from the}} lungs of rabbits by pulmonary lavage and isolated by differential centrifugation. This membranous fraction contained 93 % of the total extracellular phospholipids present in lavage effluents and consisted of membranous vesicles, membrane fragments, tubular myelin and secreted lamellar bodies. The fraction was rich in phosphatidylcholine (79. 4 %) containing 85. 2 % palmitic acid in the 1 -position and 57. 4 % palmitic acid in the 2 -position. Phosphatidylglycerol was the next most abundant phospholipid, accounting for 9. 4 % of the total. E. p. r. spectra, obtained by using 5 -doxylmethylstearate as a probe, showed that the extracellular phospholipids of the pulmonary lining were organized into structures which were much more fluid than erythrocyte-ghost membranes. The <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> phosphatidylcholine isolated from the membranous fraction was {{similar to that of the}} fraction itself, indicating that the minor phospholipids had very little influence on the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> the major phospholipid. At physiological temperature, the <b>fluidity</b> <b>of</b> dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine was relatively low, but could be markedly increased by the presence of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylglycerol (10 %).

40|$|The history <b>of</b> {{transnational}} <b>trade</b> unionism {{has been}} analysed {{in terms of}} mutual assistance, regulating global capital, augmenting the legitimacy, prestige and power of unions and their leaders, and providing avenues for states to prosecute national interests. From the 1920 s to the 1980 s, international organisations <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> unionists constituted a site of struggle between the antagonistic philosophies <b>of</b> transnationalism and <b>trade</b> unionism <b>of</b> Communists, social democrats and liberals, the USSR and the capitalist democracies.
