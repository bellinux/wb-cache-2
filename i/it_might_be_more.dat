25|$|In addition, {{several of}} the indoor arenas would be {{assembled}} elsewhere in the UK. The construction of the Aquatics Centre and the Velopark was confirmed before London won the Games, so <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> accurate to call them legacies of the bid rather than of the Games. While the legacy venues would be tailored to London's ongoing needs, {{some of them would}} be expensive for that purpose. For example, London will have paid for an 80,000-seat athletics stadium, but will only possess a 25,000-seat stadium.|$|E

25|$|The road's {{northern}} terminus {{had still}} not been settled. In 1942 state highway commissioner H.O. Schermerhorn suggested <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> useful if the road veered west north of Chatham towards Albany {{to connect to}} a proposed bridge over the Hudson there. The TSPC inspected the proposed route and found {{it would be very}} expensive to acquire and build, and in 1943 Schermerhorn agreed that the Taconic should continue on its planned course northwards. Three years later, in 1946, the commission also considered the Hyde Park extension proposed by the recently deceased Roosevelt, but dropped it as construction was resuming {{with the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} with anterograde amnesia can still acquire some semantic information, even though <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult and might remain rather unrelated to more general knowledge. H.M. could accurately draw a floor {{plan of the}} home in which he lived after surgery, {{even though he had}} not lived there in years. The reason patients could not form new episodic memories is likely because the CA1 region of the hippocampus was lesion, and thus the hippocampus could not make connections to the cortex. After an ischemic episode following surgery, an MRI of patient R.B. showed his hippocampus to be intact except for a specific lesion restricted to the CA1 pyramidal cells.|$|E

He highlighted weaknesses in the manual and Sinclair's accompanying software, criticising them for [...] "a misconceived design and sloppiness in execution which make the machine seem harder to use and more limited than it should" [...] and questioned whether <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> worthwhile to save up for a more powerful computer such as Acorn or Commodore's offerings. Overall, he concluded, the ZX81 might have a limited value in helping to teach BASIC programming and overcoming psychological barriers to computing, but [...] "the Sinclair systems {{have a long way}} to go before they raise the quality and level of understanding of the nature and use of computer-based information systems among computer unbelievers." ...|$|E

500|$|While this {{administrative}} structure was decreed {{by a government}} anxious to deal with [...] interlocutors, such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance. Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy. It has no leader with genuine permanent authority. Instead, there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made. According to Italian anthropologist Paolo Palmeri, {{the leader of the}} village has very little power in reality, as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration. He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions. In a society where politics are inextricably linked to religion, the real holders of power are the fetish priests. The very notion of a village is almost inappropriate in this context: <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> appropriately considered a clan or an aggregation of kinship. Other specialists, such as Christian Sina Diatta, compare Jola communities to those of mound-building termites, in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable.|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to get to that place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I think with these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alternative {{splicing}} is one {{of several}} exceptions to the original idea that one DNA sequence codes for one polypeptide (the One gene-one enzyme hypothesis). <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> correct now to say [...] "One gene – many polypeptides". External information is needed in order to decide which polypeptide is produced, given a DNA sequence and pre-mRNA. Since the methods of regulation are inherited, this provides novel ways for mutations to affect gene expression.|$|E
50|$|Adherents {{of several}} interpretations of quantum mechanics, QBism included, have been {{motivated}} to reconstruct quantum theory. The goal of these research efforts {{has been to}} identify {{a new set of}} axioms or postulates from which the mathematical structure of quantum theory can be derived, in the hope that with such a reformulation, the features of nature which made quantum theory the way <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> easily identified. Although the core tenets of QBism do not demand such a reconstruction, some QBists - Fuchs, in particular - have argued that the task should be pursued.|$|R
5000|$|Jini {{claims the}} {{distinction}} of being the first recursive anti-acronym: 'Jini Is Not Initials'. <b>It</b> <b>might,</b> however, <b>be</b> <b>more</b> properly termed an anti-backronym because the term [...] "Jini" [...] never stood for anything in the first place. The more recent [...] "XNA", on the other hand, was deliberately designed that way.|$|R

[...] In her comments, Lash likens Blache’s work to the American realists of the early twentieth century, stating, “Although Blache {{in the past has}} been called a [...] "contemporary impressionist," [...] <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> accurate to compare his work to that of these American realist painters from the early twentieth century.

The [...] "White Paintings" [...] were shown at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery in New York during October 1953. They appear at first to be essentially blank, white canvas. However, one commentator said that [...] "…rather than thinking of them as destructive reductions, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> productive to see them, as John Cage did, as hypersensitive screens – what Cage suggestively described as 'airports of the lights, shadows and particles.'
