40|$|Abstract—Queueing {{networks}} are typically subject to demulti-plexing operations, whereby network nodes split flows into mul-tiple sub-flows. The <b>demultiplexing</b> operation captures relevant network aspects such as packet loss or multi-path routing. In this {{paper we propose}} a novel approach to analyze queueing networks with <b>demultiplexing.</b> The basic idea is to represent a network node implementing a <b>demultiplexing</b> operation on an output flow as an equivalent system for which the corresponding input flow is logically <b>demultiplexed</b> according to the <b>demultiplexing</b> operation at the output. In this way, the service given to one of the <b>demultiplexed</b> sub-flows at the output can be expressed in terms of a leftover service curve, and consequently performance bounds can be derived using the network calculus methodology. Using numerical illustrations, we show that the obtained bounds improve upon existing bounds, {{especially in the case of}} the rather small sub-flows.

5000|$|Narrowband RF (radio frequency) {{channels}} {{with low}} power and long wavelengths (i.e., low frequency) are affected primarily by flat fading, and PPM is better suited than M-FSK {{to be used}} in these scenarios. One common application with these channel characteristics, first used in the early 1960s with top-end HF (as low as 27 MHz) frequencies into the low-end VHF band frequencies (30 MHz to 75 MHz for RC use depending on location), is the radio control of model aircraft, boats and cars, originally known as [...] "digital proportional" [...] radio control. PPM is employed in these systems, with the position of each pulse representing the angular position of an analogue control on the transmitter, or possible states of a binary switch. The number of pulses per frame gives the number of controllable channels available. The advantage of using PPM for this type of application is that the electronics required to decode the signal are extremely simple, which leads to small, light-weight receiver/decoder units. (Model aircraft require parts that are as lightweight as possible). Servos made for model radio control include some of the electronics required to convert the pulse to the motor position - the receiver is required to first extract the information from the received radio signal through its intermediate frequency section, then <b>demultiplex</b> the separate channels from the serial stream, and feed the control pulses to each servo.|$|E
