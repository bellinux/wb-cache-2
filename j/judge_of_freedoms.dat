30|$|De Toqueville’s {{statement}} encapsulates, very briefly, {{the crucial}} {{point of the}} argument on which high salience of the local-urban dimension is based for the theorists of the idealistic kind of democracy, and envisages the following logical steps. In the democratic models of the idealistic type, what counts is the judgement on good functioning of the democracy, in decisional terms. The judges are the citizens, considered free and equal in expressing their opinion. In order to <b>judge</b> in conditions <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and equality, these same citizens {{need to know the}} reasons for the decisions as thoroughly as possible and to participate as inclusively as possible in their implementation. Knowledge and participation depend on the proximity of the decisional institutions; the city is the institutional place that is closest to the citizens; high salience of the local-urban dimension enhances the citizens’ capacity for judgement in conditions <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and equality. It thus follows that good functioning of democracy (good democracy) entails high salience of the local-urban dimension.|$|R

40|$|Based {{on three}} years of ethnographic {{fieldwork}} in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, People's Republic of China, I offer a reading of Reform and Opening (Gaige Kaifang) {{in terms of how}} individuals recognized, manipulated, avoided, and responded to the Chinese state apparatus during the Deng years (1978 [...] 1997). I suggest that strategic recognition [...] -a concept I develop through an analysis of the performance and interpretation of mianzi [...] -provides useful insight into the political, economic, and cultural infrastructure of contemporary China. My analysis of strategic recognition in Shenzhen has a double focus: the changing structure of the Chinese state within a world system and the concomitant production of legal residents. This double focus allows me to track how interlocutors strategically read each other's mianzi and provides the empirical basis for a working definition of strategic recognition: the ability to <b>judge</b> relative degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> within relationships that were variously mediated by the state apparatus...|$|R
