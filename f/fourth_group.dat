5|$|Initially most Luftwaffe fighter wings {{consisted}} of three groups (Gruppe), which were the equivalent of USAAF groups or RAF Wings. Groups were identified using Roman numerals, followed by the unit number; e.g. I./JG 1. In 1942 JG 1 was the first unit to be expanded to incorporate a <b>fourth</b> <b>group.</b> Partly {{as a result of}} JG 1's expansion, other Luftwaffe fighter wings incorporated a <b>fourth</b> <b>group</b> from mid-1943.|$|E

Desktop computers were brought into the classrooms to teach math, language arts, music, art, and computer programming, in 1978. Students begin learning basic keyboard and mouse skills in kindergarten and progress to multimedia presentations, data management, and software coding in the eighth group.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the <b>fourth</b> <b>group,</b> the Britons of Alt Clut, later the kingdom of Strathclyde, leaves little trace in the record.

5|$|Construction of {{the system}} took more than 2,000 {{professional}} engineers from 20 countries and over 20,000 foreign and domestic workers six years to complete. Construction work was broken into several specialized lots that were contracted separately. One group of contracts was for civil works, covering {{the construction of the}} superstructure of open line sections. Stations and depots were the subject of separate groups of construction lots. A <b>fourth</b> <b>group</b> of lots was for track work.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the wound-healing {{efficiency}} of the Prunella vulgaris extract (PVE) on thermally injured rats. Sixty adult, female rats were divided into four groups, with group I serving as a sham control (without a burn injury). A burn was inflicted on the dorsum of all the rats in the second, third and <b>fourth</b> <b>groups.</b> Group II rats served as the burn-injury control group without any treatment. The burn-injured areas of the rats in the third and <b>fourth</b> <b>groups</b> were treated topically by 1 % silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream or 10 % PVE-based cream, respectively. Biochemical (antioxidant, lipid peroxidation, hydroxyproline, mucopolysaccharide), morphological and histopathological evaluations showed the burn-healing efficiency of PVE to be better than that of the SSD group. In conclusion, topical application of PVE enhanced collagen synthesis and antioxidant levels by suppressing lipid peroxidation as well as increasing proliferation of keratinocytes, and thus positively influenced wound-healing...|$|R

5|$|The Charodis, {{the second-largest}} group, were {{converts}} from the Kshatriya (warrior class) and Vaishya (merchant class) castes. They were generally engaged in trade and commercial vocations. The artisan converts formed the third-biggest group and {{were known as}} Sudirs (the Konkani word for Shudras, which were the labour class). They were workers and agricultural labourers engaged in service professions. The converts from the fisher caste residing around Ullal, Kuloor, and other places around the seacoast were called Gaudis, and formed the <b>fourth</b> <b>group.</b> They cultivated the lands of the Bamonns and the high-caste Hindus. Other minor castes included the Padvals, whom historian Severine Silva assumes to be local Jain converts.|$|E
5|$|The drama program begins {{engaging}} {{students in}} acting and dramatic writing, directing, and the technical {{arts in the}} <b>fourth</b> <b>group.</b> Students practice both rehearsed and improvised performances to create pantomimes, monologues, films, and short plays. Their theatrical work culminates in the eighth group {{with the performance of}} one-act plays the students write and direct themselves and the production of a professionally scripted full-length play. Artistically inclined students can extend their arts studies outside of class in optional activities including Art Club, Chorus, Orchestra, Tech Club, Drama Club, and the Variety Show.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} {{that allow them to}} learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The <b>fourth</b> <b>group</b> holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E

5|$|Piquet {{clinched}} the first pole position {{of his career}} and the maiden first position start for his team NextEV {{with a time of}} one minute and 3.099 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Turvey who was 0.132 seconds slower than Piquet's time. In his first Formula E qualifying session, López qualified third in front of his teammate Bird. Buemi went out first in the <b>fourth</b> <b>group</b> and was initially two-tenths of a second slower than Piquet despite not running wide or making contact with the barriers on his full power lap and took fifth place. Rosenqvist was the first driver to go onto the track in the group three and drove aggressively which saw him make light contact with the barrier to qualify sixth. Abt took seventh place, ahead of Duval but he served a three-place starting position penalty after he was observed speeding under red-flag conditions in the shakedown session. As a result, Vergne inherited the position and his fastest time was achieved on cold tyres and brakes. Prost's full power lap saw him narrowly avoid impacting the chicane and his car slid at the final turn which restricted him to starting ninth. Heidfeld rounded out the top-ten qualifiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} of {{requested}} amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status {{to be left}} unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control {{over a five-year period}} and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian-Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in Đeletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to local autonomy for Serb villages in the area and reduced the transitional period to two years. The <b>fourth</b> <b>group</b> of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and international treaties. After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co-chairs. The co-chairs began drafting their version of the plan; Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat (and ICFY ambassador) Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1944, Bezen Perrot was {{evacuated}} from Rennes joining the Germans in their {{retreat to the}} east, as Allied troops continued their advance from the north. During the unit's stay in Paris, Chanteau deserted causing others to follow his example. Three of the deserters later defected to the French Forces of the Interior, fighting in the Liberation of Paris. On 15 August, it was stationed in Creney-près-Troyes where it participated in the execution of 49 suspected Maquis. It passed through Strasbourg in October, reaching Tübingen in December. On 16 December, the unit celebrated {{the first anniversary of}} its formation. Lainé and Péresse were promoted to Untersturmführer and Sturmscharführer respectively, 18 other members received promotions and Wound Badges when they were due. On 29 December, Lainé reorganized the unit into four groups of 8 to 10 men. The first group joined the Waffen-SS, the second and third groups were dispatched to the Black Forest where they received sabotage and radio operation training accordingly. The <b>fourth</b> <b>group</b> consisted of members who were unsuitable for all other tasks, a self-proclaimed propaganda section. The Allies continued to pressure on forcing the 2nd and 3rd Groups to relocate to Fürstenfeldbruck on 25 April 1945. The staff of Bezen Perrot moved to Marburg in the same month. As Germany's defeat seemed imminent members were instructed to return to Brittany and go into hiding to areas where they would not be likely to be recognized. Those who had not joined the Waffen-SS were left on their own.|$|E
