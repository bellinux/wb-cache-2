5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E
5|$|Apart from <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is {{a constituent}} of organic compounds {{as diverse as}} Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E

To improve productivity, Airbus Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed hangar where new technologies can be tested. Upon entering the hangar, cameras study the aircraft to detect damages. Mobile robots, {{such as the one}} of the Air-Cobot project, and drones, such as the one of the Aircam project, carry out more detailed inspections.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> folk medicine, P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail.

This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading {{producer}} of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron which has a niobium content of 60-70%. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for <b>its</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> jet and rocket engines.|$|E

So I pass lastly to consider <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> <b>in</b> policy; dependent chiefly upon its tenacity-- that is to say, on its power of bearing a pull, and receiving an edge. These powers, which enable it to pierce, to bind, and to smite, render it fit for the three great instruments, by which its political action may be simply typified; namely, the Plough, the Fetter, and the Sword.|$|R
