40|$|<b>Dermatofibromas</b> are benign, fibrohistiocytic, dermal tumors. Solitary <b>dermatofibromas</b> may be {{incidental}} findings, whereas multiple <b>dermatofibromas</b> may {{be associated}} with systemic conditions or previous therapies. Two women and one man with multiple <b>dermatofibromas</b> and an associated systemic condition, immunosuppression, or both, are described. Nine <b>dermatofibromas</b> developed in a woman with hypothyroidism, optic neuritis, and Arnold Chiari I malformation. Five <b>dermatofibromas</b> developed in a woman with breast cancer who had received several systemic antineoplastic therapies. Eleven <b>dermatofibromas</b> developed in a man with HIV whose systemic therapies included acyclovir, darunavir/cobicistat, dolutegravir, etravirine, and ritonavir. Conditions associated with multiple <b>dermatofibromas</b> include autoimmune diseases, cancer, chromosomal abnormalities, immunodeficiencies, metabolic disturbances, and altered physiologic states such as pregnancy. Medications received by patients with multiple <b>dermatofibromas</b> included immunosuppressive agents, psoriasis therapies, and antineoplastic drugs. Multiple <b>dermatofibromas</b> can be observed in patients with associated medical conditions, systemic therapies, or both. Therefore, in individuals presenting with multiple <b>dermatofibromas,</b> not only evaluation for associated disorders, but also review of prior and current drug therapies, should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Dermatofibromas</b> {{are common}} benign tumors in women, {{and breast cancer}} {{is the most common}} {{malignancy}} in women. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine if there is any relationship between the two conditions. Materials and Methods: Five patients with <b>dermatofibromas</b> and 10 control patients (two groups) had their skin biopsies measured for arsenic by inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Fifty randomly selected patients with breast cancer and 50 control patients were examined for the presence of <b>dermatofibromas.</b> Results: The <b>dermatofibromas</b> were found to have an arsenic concentration of 0. 171 micrograms/gram, compared with 0. 06 and 0. 07 micrograms/gram of the two control groups. Forty-three out of 50 patients with breast cancer had <b>dermatofibromas</b> and 32 / 50 patients with breast cancer had multiple <b>dermatofibromas,</b> compared to 10 / 50 control patients with <b>dermatofibromas</b> and only 1 / 50 with multiple <b>dermatofibromas.</b> Conclusions: Arsenic is important in the development of <b>dermatofibromas</b> and <b>dermatofibromas</b> represent a reservoir and important sign of chronic arsenic exposure. <b>Dermatofibromas</b> represent an important sign for women at risk for breast cancer, and arsenic may represent the cause of the majority of cases of breast cancer...|$|R
50|$|Some {{physicians}} and researchers believe <b>dermatofibromas</b> form {{as a reaction}} to previous injuries such as insect bites or thorn pricks. They are composed of disordered collagen laid down by fibroblasts. <b>Dermatofibromas</b> are classed as benign skin lesions, meaning they are completely harmless, though they may be confused with a variety of subcutaneous tumours. Deep penetrating <b>dermatofibromas</b> may be difficult to distinguish, even histologically, from rare malignant fibrohistocytic tumours like dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.|$|R
50|$|The dimple sign or Fitzpatrick's sign is a {{dermatological}} sign {{in which}} lateral {{pressure on the}} skin produces a depression. It is associated with <b>dermatofibroma.</b>|$|E

50|$|Dermatofibromas {{are hard}} solitary slow-growing papules (rounded bumps) that may {{appear in a}} variety of colours, usually {{brownish}} to tan; they are often elevated or pedunculated. A <b>dermatofibroma</b> is associated with the dimple sign; by applying lateral pressure, there is a central depression of the <b>dermatofibroma.</b> Although typical dermatofibromas cause little or no discomfort, itching and tenderness can occur. Dermatofibromas can be found anywhere on the body, but most often they are found on the legs and arms. They occur most often in women; the male to female ratio is about 1:4. The age group in which they most commonly occur is 20 to 45 years.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dermatofibromas</b> are benign skin lesions that {{consist of}} {{pigmented}} papules or nodules. They produce the dimple sign when laterally squeezed {{and are usually}} found on the legs. These clinical features lead to the diagnosis in most cases. However, the differential diagnosis with other lesions, such as atypical nevi and melanoma can be difficult, and the dermoscopy may help the diagnosis. There are several dermoscopic patterns associated with <b>dermatofibromas,</b> the most common being a central white scar like patch with delicate pigment network at the periphery.

5000|$|Clear cell {{acanthoma}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Acanthome cellules claires of Degos and Civatte," [...] "Degos acanthoma," [...] and [...] "Pale cell acanthoma") is a benign clinical and histological lesion initially described as neoplastic, which some authors now {{regard as a}} reactive dermatosis. It usually presents as a moist solitary firm, brown-red, well-circumscribed, 5 mm to 2 cm nodule or plaque on the lower extremities of middle-aged to elderly individuals The lesion has a crusted, scaly peripheral collarette and vascular puncta on the surface. It is characterized by slow growth, and may persist for years. The clinical differential diagnosis includes: <b>dermatofibroma,</b> inflamed seborrheic keratosis, pyogenic granuloma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, verruca vulgaris, psoriatic plaque, and melanoma.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dermatofibroma</b> is {{a common}} benign fibrohistiocytic tumor and its {{diagnosis}} is easy when it presents classical clinicopathological features. However, a <b>dermatofibroma</b> may show {{a wide variety of}} clinicopathological variants and, therefore, the diagnosis may be difficult. The typical <b>dermatofibroma</b> generally occurs as a single or multiple firm reddish-brown nodules. We report here two atypical presentations of <b>dermatofibroma</b> - Atrophic <b>dermatofibroma</b> and keloidal presentation of <b>dermatofibroma.</b> Clinical dermal atrophy {{is a common}} phenomenon in dermatofibromas as demonstrated by the dimpling on lateral pressure. However, this feature is exaggerated in the atrophic variant of <b>dermatofibroma.</b> Atrophic <b>dermatofibroma</b> is defined by dermal atrophy of more than 50 % of the lesion apart from the usual features of common <b>dermatofibroma.</b> The keloidal variant of <b>dermatofibroma</b> should not be overlooked as a simple keloid. The findings of keloidal change in dermatofibromas may support that trauma is a possible cause of <b>dermatofibroma...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Dermatofibroma,</b> {{also known}} as benign fibrous histiocytoma, is a soft-tissue tumour that usually occurs in the mid-adult life and shows a slight female predominance.

40|$|Twenty-nine {{cases of}} Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH), non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (N-LCH), non-infectious granulomas, and fibroblast-related lesions were examined with {{a panel of}} monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies on freshly frozen tissue sections to characterize the macrophage phenotype of N-LCH syndromes. MS- 1 high molecular weight extracellular protein, specific for sinusoidal endothelial cells and dendritic perivascular macrophages in normal human organs, was expressed by N-LCH cells but was not found in LCH cells, epithelioid cells in sarcoidosis, or palisading histiocytes in granuloma annulare. The subcellular location of MS- 1 protein, i. e., cytoplasmic vs. peripheral/extracellular, allowed discrimination of small and large (foamy or multinucleated) N-LCH cells. MS- 1 -positive cells, which were found intermingled in cellular <b>dermatofibromas</b> but not in fibrous <b>dermatofibromas,</b> differed from MS- 1 -positive N-LCH cells by their dendritic morphology, and thus rather resembled their normal dermal counterparts. A preserved functional relationship of these two MS- 1 -positive cell types was indicated {{by the fact that}} N-LCH and cellular <b>dermatofibromas</b> were the only lesions found to be highly vascularized. As expected, CD 1 a showed high specificity for LCH, while CD 34 was predominantly expressed by fibroblast-related lesions; in cellular <b>dermatofibromas,</b> CD 34 and MS- 1 expression partially overlapped. The other antigens tested showed non-specific or overlapping patterns of expression. In conclusion, assessment of MS- 1 protein expression (in addition to assessment of CD 1 a and CD 34) promises to be of diagnostic value in the discrimination of N-LCH from related skin disorders, and it may indicate a common differentiative pathway for most N-LCH disease entities...|$|R

40|$|Background : <b>Dermatofibroma</b> {{sometimes}} clinically presents as a nodular lesion without gross skin surface change. Clinicopathologic {{features of}} this variant of <b>dermatofibroma</b> have not been evaluated. Aims : To assess clinicopathologic features of <b>dermatofibroma</b> presenting as a subcutaneous nodule. Methods : This study reviewed the clinical and histological features of 42 cases of subcutaneous dermatofibromas and compared them with 95 cases of conventional <b>dermatofibroma.</b> Results : <b>Dermatofibroma</b> without gross skin surface change {{was associated with a}} shorter pre-diagnosis duration than conventional <b>dermatofibroma.</b> Increase in size during the pre-diagnosis period was significantly more frequent in the conventional type. In addition, these dermatofibromas were more likely than the conventional type to occur {{in the head and neck}} region. Although tumor depth was deeper than in the conventional type, less than half of the dermatofibromas without gross skin surface change were found histologically to be "subcutaneous" or "deep-penetrating dermatofibroma". Subcutaneous extension was more frequent in these dermatofibromas while focal stromal hyalinization and hemosiderin deposits were more common in the conventional type. Limitations: This study is a retrospective, single center design. Conclusion : The present study suggests that <b>dermatofibroma</b> without gross skin surface change is a variant type with distinct clinical and histological features that distinguish them from conventional <b>dermatofibroma...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} impact of skin surgery in general {{practice}} on the workload of a pathology laboratory and to identify what further training might be helpful. DESIGN [...] Analysis of skin biopsy specimens from general practitioners before and after their new contract to determine numbers of specimens, changes in diagnoses, adequacy of treatment of malignant tumours, and areas of low diagnostic accuracy. SETTING [...] District general hospital. SUBJECTS [...] All 1017 skin biopsy specimens from general practice for 15 months before and 12 months after the new general practitioner contract. RESULTS [...] The number of pathology specimens received increased from 16 to 65 per month (median = 6 submitted by each general practitioner in the post-contract year). The proportion of the more common pathological diagnoses was unchanged between the two periods, but the proportion of correctly diagnosed naevi, cysts, and seborrhoeic keratoses increased in the second. Although few diagnoses were overtly incorrect, accurate diagnosis of <b>dermatofibromas</b> and malignancies decreased after the contract, and the overall correct diagnosis rate for seborrhoeic keratoses, <b>dermatofibromas,</b> rashes, and malignancies was below 30 %. Only nine out of 21 squamous cell carcinomas were adequately excised with tumour free margins, and follow up of malignant tumours may have been inadequate. CONCLUSIONS [...] Skin surgery in general practice has advantages but matters of concern are the increase in laboratory workload, the excision of some benign lesions, and the inappropriateness of biopsy of rashes. Squamous cell carcinoma and other malignant tumours submitted for pathological examination were often unsuspected and inadequately excised, and heightened suspicion is recommended. Pathology request forms may need redesigning to encourage provision of clinical details...|$|R
40|$|Background: Multiple <b>dermatofibromas</b> (“DFs”) {{are defined}} by the {{presence}} of 15 lesions in the same patient or the development of five to eight DFs over the period of 4  months. Fifty-six percent of multiple DFs are associated with other diseases. The most common associated disease is systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”) followed by immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”) infection. Main observation: We report a case of a 25 -year-old Saudi Arab female with SLE on immunosuppressive drugs with multiple DFs. Conclusion: The most common association with multiple DFs is SLE followed by HIV. Most of the patients with SLE were on immune suppressive medications. Dermatologists, rheumatologists, surgeons and internists should note that patients with SLE who are on immune suppressive medications are at risk of developing multiple DFs...|$|R
40|$|The human dermis {{contains}} {{a series of}} dendritic cells which express different phenotypes including Factor XIIIa immunoreactivity. This compound is related to a blood coagulation factor participating in angiogenesis, {{in the final stages}} of the clotting cascade and in wound healing. In normal skin, Factor XIIIa is expressed in specific dermal dendrocytes (DD) derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage or from a mesenchymal origin. DD are located predominantly around the microvasculature in the adventitial dermis, at the dermo-epidermal junction, and around skin appendages, but normally not within the epidermis. Increased numbers of Factor XIIIa+ DD are present in a host of specific cutaneous inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. In tumor pathology, immunophenotypic differences are found between <b>dermatofibromas</b> and other fibrohistiocytic entities, most notably dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. In addition, Factor XIIIa+ DD are likely to be involved in the progression and regression of some malignancies including cutaneous melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. Peer reviewe...|$|R
