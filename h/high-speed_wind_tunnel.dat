50|$|The Lippisch P.13a was an {{experimental}} ramjet-powered delta wing interceptor aircraft designed in late 1944 by Dr. Alexander Lippisch for Nazi Germany. The aircraft {{never made it}} past the drawing board, but testing of wind-tunnel models in the DVL <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> showed that the design had extraordinary stability into the Mach 2.6 range.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1930s, Jacobs became {{interested}} in <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> and helped to build {{one of the first}} in the United States. He became the first person to observe a shock wave propagating over an airfoil using Schlieren photography. In 1935, he was invited to the now famous fifth Volta conference on aerodynamics titled [...] "High Velocities in Aviation". There, he gave a presentation on <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and his Schlieren images which exposed the technology {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|R

40|$|Studies of noisy {{supersonic}} flow past aerodynamic objects are very limited. On the experimental side, {{the presence of}} inherent noise in <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> make them unreliable predictors of fight performance, street for stationary cylinders (2 S pattern). This phenomenon is discussed in detail in [2] and independent experimental validation {{can be found in}} [4]...|$|R
50|$|To achieve reduced drag in the {{transonic}} phase, Whitcomb {{realized that}} the wing's pressure distribution must be modified to delay and weaken the shock wave created on the upper surface where the high-velocity flow decelerated to subsonic. Using intuition rather than mathematics, he built a 2 ft chord wing section and tested it repeatedly in the Langley <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> adding (with auto body putty) or removing (with a file and sandpaper) material until the desired flows were achieved.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, the CNES (France’s National Centre for Space Studies) {{decided to}} build a low density and <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{essential}} for aerodynamic and aerothermal studies in rarefied gas flows. This wind tunnel called SR3 was located in the Aerothermodynamics Laboratory from the CNRS (France's national scientific research center) in Meudon. The construction of the facility was delegated to the SESSIA (engineering consultants for aeronautical industrial works) and was achieved in 1963. The wind tunnel was then moved to the ICARE Laboratory in Orléans in 2000, {{as a result of}} the merging of the Aerothermodynamics Laboratory and the LCSR (Combustion and Reactive Systems Laboratory). Then, it was renamed MARHy which is the acronym for Mach Adaptable Rarefied Hypersonic.|$|E
5000|$|Allen {{did not fit}} {{the image}} of the daredevil test pilot Hollywood promoted. He was very slender, and some {{described}} him as frail. He considered himself an engineer as well as a pilot, and insisted the test pilot should be involved in the development of new aircraft, not just fly them. Allen developed a systematic approach to flight testing and set standards that are the basis for modern flight testing. He also formed a dedicated flight-test and aeronautical research organization at Boeing and insisted that the company develop its own <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> an idea directly responsible for Boeing being in position to take the leadership in the development of large swept-wing jets.|$|E

However, the deployment of these for routine use in <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> has lagged behind.

5000|$|Eddie Allen's {{contributions}} {{were recognized}} {{with some of}} aviation's greatest awards, including the very first Octave Chanute Award in 1939. On 17 December 1942, he presented the prestigious Wright Brothers lecture, [...] "Flight Testing for Performance and Stability." [...] He was posthumously awarded the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1943, the citation for which read: [...] "For major contributions to aeronautics leading to important advances in airplane design, flight research, and airline operation; particularly for the presentation of new methods for operational control and {{for the development of}} scientific and systematic methods in the flight testing of aircraft for basic design and performance data." [...] The Boeing Company dedicated its <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> and aeronautical research laboratories to him. Those facilities are still known today as the Edmund T.

50|$|Smoot {{returned}} to BYU in 1967 {{and was named}} chairman of the chemical engineering department in 1970. Smoot's research and work was extensive in his early years of teaching at BYU. He participated in multiple scientific conferences, including a three-nation scientific conference in Washington D.C. in 1968 (of which {{he was one of}} only ten delegates from the United States). Smoot served as the chemical engineering department chairman from 1970-1977. His time as department chairman is marked by a number of important research projects and accomplishments. The department received numerous grants, including a contract for research in rocket propulsion in 1971 amounting to $71,000. Also in 1971 BYU acquired and assembled a <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> test facility - a project spearheaded by Smoot and John Simonsen, chairman of the mechanical engineering department. The wind tunnel was acquired from a closed Navy Laboratory and was sold to BYU partially because it was to assist Smoot in his rocket propulsion research being conducted for the Navy.|$|E

40|$|The Temperature-Sensitive Paint (TSP) {{method is}} a thermographic {{measurement}} technique and mainly {{used to do}} flow visualizations, but also quantitative temperature, heat transfer and skin friction measurements are possible. To perform flow visualizations in low speed facilities the contrast needs to be enhanced by generating a heat flux between model and fluid. This way the measurement relies on the spatial variation of the heat transfer coefficient, which depends on the local skin friction coefficient (Reynolds analogy). Therefore, the department of Experimental Methods at DLR Göttingen develops a combination of Temperature-Sensitive Paints and electrical-heating methods for the application in lowspeed and <b>high-speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> (ambient and cryogenic Temperatures) and water facilities. The application of the TSP method in two different <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> campaigns investigating crossflow instability is shown.
