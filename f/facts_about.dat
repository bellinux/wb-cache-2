5|$|Bacon: A Love Story, A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat is a 2009 non-fiction {{book about}} bacon, written by American writer Heather Lauer. Lauer started the blog Bacon Unwrapped {{and a social}} {{networking}} site about bacon in 2005, after the idea came to her while she was out drinking with her two brothers; her online success inspired her to write the book, which describes curing and cooking bacon, gives over 20 bacon recipes, and analyzes the impact of bacon on popular culture. The text is interspersed with <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> bacon and bacon-related quips from comedian Jim Gaffigan.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he is investigating the what (the existing <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Charles Darwin {{formulated}} the scientific {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed {{from generation to generation}} (heritability of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.|$|E
5|$|The <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk War have been disputed.

A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at the grove to help bury the dead. One of these soldiers was Lincoln, who assisted with the burial. His later statement about the events has been linked to both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E

A nine-to-nine score {{leads to a}} lightning round. Monica raises the stakes: If the women win, Joey and Chandler must give up their birds, as the maturing Chick is crowing in the mornings and waking them up. Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica give up their apartment to them, which Monica agrees to without consulting Rachel. The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler's job, and the boys win.|$|E
5|$|Double Dares lasting {{popularity}} {{has led to}} a variety of products being made available. Pressman Toy Corporation released two traditional board games based on the show: The Double Dare home game was released in September 1987 and Wet 'N Wild Double Dare was released in March 1989. Another board game titled Double Dare: The Game was manufactured by Mattel in 2001. GameTek published a PC game in 1988, and a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 based on the program. Containing <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> the show, along with trivia and activities to host a home version of the game, two editions of The Double Dare Game Book were released by Parachute Press in 1988 and 1989. Based on substances referenced on Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, Mattel and Jakks Pacific manufactured a series of toy slimes called Gak and Goooze. Other toys, apparel, lunchboxes, and school supplies have been sold featuring the show's logo and art.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{interested}} in the ministers of the Empire, Phipps was diverted to a deeper interest in Napoleon's marshals, primarily by the difficulty of obtaining <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> them. He capitalized on the growing interest of both Britons and the French in the Napoleonic period by purchasing, as they came out, the many personal memoirs published by {{the descendants of the}} participants. Indeed, by 1920, he had acquired over 2,000 volumes, plus sundry maps and letters. That year, in failing health, he moved to the house of his son, Charles, in Carlyle Square (21), Chelsea, London. There was no room for the books at his son's house, so Phipps gave them to All Souls College, Oxford; the majority of them were placed in the Codrington Library. He selected All Souls for its established reputation in military history, and for the Codrington's collection left to it by Sir Foster Cunliffe, who had been killed in action in 1916. The collection, called the Phipps Collection, numbered more than 2,000 volumes, and includes Napoleon's published correspondence, that of the marshals, and has been kept up to date with modern works issued by the Historical Department of the French General Staff.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed {{a broad range of}} colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range of}} compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.|$|E
5|$|The Americans stopped sharing any {{information}} on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of bomb design, or the <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> fast neutron reactions. This was a major disappointment which hindered the British and the Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several {{other aspects of the}} research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the pace of work there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain's help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
