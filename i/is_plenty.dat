5|$|On 27 February 2007 (Horne's centenary), BBC Radio 4 {{broadcast}} a half-hour documentary tribute entitled Sound the Horne, hosted by Jimmy Carr. The following year, on 18 September, another Radio 4 documentary was broadcast, Thoroughly Modest Mollie, {{which focused on}} Horne's frequent ghost-writer, Mollie Millest, and featured Jonathan Rigby again as Horne.. Rigby reprised the role yet again in a new stage show, devised by Barry Took's widow Lyn, called Round the Horne – Unseen and Uncut, which toured in 2008 and 2009. Also in 2009, an unbroadcast pilot script written by Horne and Millest in 1966 was produced by Radio 4. Called Twice Ken <b>is</b> <b>Plenty</b> and intended as a two-man showcase for Horne and Kenneth Williams, the 21st-century version, broadcast on 1 September 2009, was performed by Rigby and, as Williams, Robin Sebastian.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munias have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that if most of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.|$|E
5|$|A giant {{meteoroid}} {{approaches the}} earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the Aurora, is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the Aurora, but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run a hose from Chester's ship, Sirius, to the Aurora, and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E

The Koran {{does not permit}} Mohammedans to drink. Their natural {{instincts}} do not permit them to be moral. They say the Sultan has eight hundred wives. This almost amounts to bigamy. It makes our cheeks burn with shame to see such a thing permitted here in Turkey. We do not mind it so much in Salt Lake, however.|$|R

5|$|Various {{types of}} aquatic {{habitats}} {{are used by}} different crocodilians. Some species are relatively more terrestrial and prefer swamps, ponds, and the edges of lakes, where they can bask {{in the sun and}} there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of plant life supporting a diverse fauna. Others spend more time in the water and inhabit the lower stretches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. These habitats also have a rich flora and provide plenty of food. The Asian gharials find the fish on which they feed in the pools and backwaters of swift rivers. South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, turbid lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers flowing across China's floodplains. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or turbid water. Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the Venezuelan llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. Desert crocodiles in Mauritania have adapted to their arid environment by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods. When it rains, the reptiles gather at gueltas.|$|E
5|$|Within the Macedonian commonwealth, or the Koinon of Macedonians, {{there is}} some epigraphic {{evidence}} from the 3rd century BC that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although Macedonian cities nominally participated in panhellenic events on their own accord, in reality the granting of asylia (inviolability, diplomatic immunity, {{and the right of}} asylum at sanctuaries) to certain cities (e.g. Kyzikos in Anatolia) was handled directly by the king or a preexisting regulation. Likewise, the city-states within contemporary Greek koina (i.e., federations of city-states, the sympoliteia) obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league. In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, the granting of proxenia (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities. While there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of surviving evidence that the granting of proxenia was the sole prerogative of central authorities in the neighboring Epirote League, a small amount of evidence suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth. However, city-states that were allied with the Kingdom of Macedonia and existed outside of Macedonia proper issued their own decrees regarding proxenia. Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings, such as when the Cretan League signed treaties with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army, and elected Philip V of Macedon as honorary protector (prostates) of the league.|$|E

25|$|Backed by low dunes, {{the top of}} {{the beach}} {{comprises}} about 80m of dry, very loose sand, making it very popular with families. Lower down it is hard-packed. The beach slopes gently, and therefore the sea is shallow for quite a long way out. Even at high tide there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of soft sand exposed.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{effects have}} also been {{observed}} in dense populations of beetles. When overcrowding occurs, female beetles destroy their eggs and turn cannibalistic, eating each other. Male beetles lose interest in the females and although there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of water and food, there is no population growth. Similar effects have been observed in overcrowded situations in jack rabbits and deer.|$|E
25|$|Inspection of the {{finished}} screw threads can be achieved in various ways, with {{the expense of the}} method tailored to the requirements of the product application. Shop-floor inspection of a thread is often as simple as running a nut onto it (for male threads) or a bolt into it (for female threads). This <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> good enough for many applications (e.g., MRO or hobbyist work), although it is not good enough for most commercial manufacturing. Higher-precision methods are discussed below.|$|E

25|$|From 1943, the BBC Polish Service {{had been}} {{broadcasting}} about the exterminations but the BBC Hungarian Service had not mentioned Jews. After the German invasion in March 1944, the Hungarian Service did broadcast warnings {{but by then}} it was too late. According to Cesarani and Götz Aly, although Jews who survived the deportations claimed that they had not been informed by their leaders, that no one had told them, there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of evidence that Hungarian Jews could have known.|$|E
25|$|Unlike some {{cars and}} motorcycles, a Wankel aero-engine will be {{sufficiently}} warm before full power is asked {{of it because}} of the time taken for pre-flight checks. A Wankel aero-engine spends most of its operational time at high power outputs, with little idling. This makes ideal the use of peripheral ports. An advantage is that modular engines with more than two rotors are feasible. If icing of any intake tracts is an issue, there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of waste engine heat available to prevent icing.|$|E
25|$|In 331, Constantine I {{commissioned}} Eusebius {{to deliver}} fifty Bibles for the Church of Constantinople. Athanasius (Apol. Const. 4) recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for Constans. Little else is known, though there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of speculation. For example, it is speculated {{that this may}} have provided motivation for canon lists, and that Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus may be examples of these Bibles. Those codices contain almost a full version of the Septuagint; Vaticanus is only lacking 1–3 Maccabees and Sinaiticus is lacking 2–3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Baruch and Letter of Jeremiah.|$|E

25|$|The reef {{surface is}} the shallowest {{part of the}} reef. It {{is subject to the}} surge and {{the rise and fall of}} tides. When waves pass over shallow areas, they shoal, as shown in the diagram at the right. This means the water is often agitated. These are the precise {{condition}} under which corals flourish. Shallowness means there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of light for photosynthesis by the symbiotic zooxanthellae, and agitated water promotes the ability of coral to feed on plankton. However, other organisms must be able to withstand the robust conditions to flourish in this zone.|$|E
25|$|The Zugspitze {{was first}} climbed on 27 August 1820 by Josef Naus, his survey assistant, Maier, and {{mountain}} guide, Johann Georg Tauschl. Today {{there are three}} normal routes to the summit: one from the Höllental valley to the northeast; another out of the Reintal valley to the southeast; and the third from the west over the Austrian Cirque (Österreichische Schneekar). One {{of the best known}} ridge routes in the Eastern Alps runs along the knife-edged Jubilee Ridge (Jubiläumsgrat) to the summit, linking the Zugspitze, the Hochblassen and the Alpspitze. For mountaineers there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of nearby accommodation. On the western summit of the Zugspitze itself is the Münchner Haus and on the western slopes is the Wiener-Neustädter Hut.|$|E
25|$|Gouldian finches {{will usually}} make their nests in tree-holes, {{generally}} within a kilometer {{or so of}} water. They usually breed {{in the early part}} of the dry season, when there <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of food around. The male courtship dance is a fascinating spectacle. When a male is courting a female, he bobs about ruffling his feathers to show off his colors. He expands his chest and fluffs out his forehead feathers. After mating, a female lays a clutch of about 4–8 eggs. Both parents help brood the eggs during the daytime, and the female stays on the eggs at night. When the eggs hatch, both parents help care for the young. Gouldian finches leave the nest at between 19 and 23 days and are independent at 40 days old.|$|E

25|$|Drugs, supplements, or diets {{are often}} used to alter {{physiology}} {{in an attempt to}} relieve common autistic symptoms such as seizures, sleep disturbances, irritability, and hyperactivity that can interfere with education or social adaptation or (more rarely) cause autistic individuals to harm themselves or others. There <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of anecdotal evidence to support medical treatment; many parents who try one or more therapies report some progress, and there are a few well-publicized reports of children who are able to return to mainstream education after treatment, with dramatic improvements in health and well-being. However, this evidence may be confounded by improvements seen in autistic children who grow up without treatment, by the difficulty of verifying reports of improvements, and by the lack of reporting of treatments' negative outcomes. Only a very few medical treatments are well supported by scientific evidence using controlled experiments.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{throughout}} the year, {{but there is}} a peak that enables the birds to make use of periods that food <b>is</b> <b>plenty,</b> such as between August and December in South Sudan and between March and May in eastern Africa. Three or four eggs are laid in a roofed nest, that is suspended from a thin branch an in ant-gall acacia (Vachellia drepanolobium), or another spined and ant-housing acacia. The nest consists of grass straws, and during breeding and feeding the nestlings has one downward-facing opening. Eggs are approximately 19mm long and 14mm in diameter, greenish, bluish or white, unadorned or with fine black or olive colored specks, more dense at thick end, or so heavily blotched that the overall color seems olive-brown or ash-grey. Both parents share breeding duty but the female about twice as often as the male, until after thirteen or fourteen days, the eggs hatch.|$|E
25|$|The {{process whereby}} the {{indigenous}} population of 'Wales' came {{to think of themselves}} as Welsh is not clear. There <b>is</b> <b>plenty</b> of evidence of the use of the term Brythoniaid (Britons); by contrast, the earliest use of the word Kymry (referring not to the people but to the land—and possibly to northern Britain in addition to modern day territory of Wales) is found in a poem dated to about 633. The name of the region in northern England now known as Cumbria is derived from the same root. Only gradually did Cymru (the land) and Cymry (the people) come to supplant Brython. Although the Welsh language was certainly used at the time, Gwyn A. Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke, the people to its west saw themselves as Roman, citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century. However, it is unclear whether such inscriptions reveal a general or normative use of Latin as a marker of identity or its selective use by the early Christian Church.|$|E
