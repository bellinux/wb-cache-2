5000|$|The Pais {{has one of}} {{the longest}} viticultural history in Chile, {{believed}} to have been brought to the region by Spanish conquistadors from Peru during their colonization of the continent in the 16th century. Ampelographers believe that along with the Criolla Grande grape of Argentina and Mission grape of California, that the Pais grape is descended by the Spanish [...] "common black grape" [...] brought to Mexico in 1520 by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés. That <b>early</b> <b>grape</b> was then cultivated by Spanish missionaries and spread throughout the Americas. The Pais remained Chile's primarily wine grape until the emergence of the Bordeaux wine varietal in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
50|$|The {{homestead}} is {{centrally located}} within the allotment, the boundary of which is marked on all sides except the northern one with a low, painted post-and-rail fence. The block is grassed and features a number of mature trees, {{as well as more}} recent shrubs, mostly around the perimeter, and a number of garden beds close to the house, most particularly in front of the east-facing verandah. In the garden bed adjacent to the northern elevation of the house is an <b>early</b> <b>grape</b> vine, which possibly dates to the early 1900s. On the northern edge of the site, toward the western corner of the block, is a Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), which is one of three visible in a number of photographs dating from the late nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries. In the south-west corner is the grave of Patrick Dwyer marked with a stone/concrete memorial and surrounded by a number of trees. There are two garages sited {{at the edges of the}} allotment: one entered off the easement near the grave and another near the south-eastern corner of the house accessed from the east. Both have gable roofs; one is clad with vertical timber boarding and the other with vertical steel cladding. The latter garage is later and is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. There is a fenced pool in the north-east corner of the site (also not of cultural heritage significance). Four painted iron gates open through the perimeter fence line: a wide double one near the north-western corner of the site, two single ones that align with the doors opening out of either end of the north-facing wing of the house and the respective verandah stairs, and another that aligns with the south-facing porch. The single gate that opens through the eastern boundary fence sits near a large stand of mature bougainvillea, which is on an adjoining allotment. The 1846 grave of Margaret Coulson, marked with an engraved headstone, is located approximately 15m to the south of the single gate that opens through the southern boundary fence, again on a separate allotment to the homestead block.|$|E
30|$|The Campbell <b>Early</b> <b>grape,</b> {{which is}} the most {{dominant}} cultivar in Korea, has a high malic acid content due to early harvesting for enhancing grape color. High malic acid content lowers the quality of Korean wine due to high acidity, which has resulted in the poor competitive value of indigenously manufactured wine against imported wine (Kim et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2016). For this reason, isolating and utilizing indigenous yeasts instead of imported yeast starters are necessary to make Korean wine competitive. Developing optimal industrial starter cultures for winemaking is essential for increasing the prevalence of indigenous Korean yeast starter products. Previously, S. cerevisiae D 8, Hanseniaspora uvarum S 6, and Issatchenkia orientalis KMBL 5774 were isolated from Korean Campbell <b>Early</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar and their biological and physiological characteristics were studied. Kim et al. (2013 b) reported that wine fermented by S. cerevisiae D 8 had higher color and taste scores compared to the wine fermented by S. cerevisiae W- 3. Hong and Park (2013) described that wine fermented by H. uvarum S 6 (previously SS 6) showed slower fermentation rate but had higher organic acid content and sensory evaluation scores compared to wine fermented by S. cerevisiae W- 3. Seo et al. (2007) and Kim et al. (2008) reported that I. orientalis KMBL 5774 could degrade malic acid during alcohol fermentation, and co-fermentation with I. orientalis KMBL 5774 and S. cerevisiae W- 3 resulted in better color, flavor, and taste compared to the fermentation using only S. cerevisiae W- 3.|$|E

40|$|International audienceEarly {{definition}} of oenologically significant zones within a vineyard {{is one of}} the main goals of precision viticulture, as it would allow an increase in profitability through the adaptation of agronomic practices to the specific requirements of each zone, and/or segregation of the harvest into different batches to produce wines with different qualities. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether <b>early</b> <b>grape</b> sampling is a relevant tool for within-vineyard zone definition. The study was carried out in 2010 and 2011 in a 4. 2 ha vineyard, where a grid of 60 sampling points was defined. 300 -berry samples were picked from each sampling point after veraison and at harvest, post-veraison information being used to define zones within the vineyard after fuzzy k-means analysis and subsequent application of a zoning procedure that took into account membership degree and neighbourhood criteria. Two variations of the zoning procedure were used, standard (StdZ) and top (TopZ) zoning. Each was designed to meet different requirements of wineries; StdZ gave the same oenological relevance to all the zones, and TopZ differentiated the zones producing "top class" grapes, minimizing the within-zone variability in the top-class zone. Grape composition obtained at harvest from the zones delineated post-veraison was compared. Zone delineation using post-veraison data was proved to be oenologically relevant, provided sampling is performed once veraison is completed. The two zoning algorithms designed were shown to be suitable for objective zone delineation according to the goals intended for each...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Color {{stability}} and mouth feel quality {{are two of}} the most important aspects of red wine quality. Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins are responsible for these attributes and {{it has been shown that}} weather conditions during the growing season and grape maturity can effect these components in wine. However, investigations into proanthocyanidin development are for the most part incomplete. Although it is known that weather affects vine metabolism, it has not clearly understood how phenolics are affected by temperature and heat summation. It is generally believed that the wines made with riper grapes improve in flavor and mouth feel as a result of an "improvement" in skin tannin "ripeness". The idea of "tannin ripeness" is usually used in the wine industry to explain this phenomenon, however, no scientific explanation for this concept has been given. The objective of this project was threefold: I) Monitor phenolic development in Pinot noir grapes over three consecutive growing seasons and determine how anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin development in grapes was affected by heat summation, II) investigate the transfer of grape phenolics into wine during fermentation and maceration and III) understand how grape maturity affected wine composition with a specific focus on proanthocyanidin structure. In this study, anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin development in Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot noir grapes (Pommard clone) were monitored for three consecutive vintages (2001 - 2003). Five cluster samples (x 5 replicates) were collected for analysis each week beginning approximately 4 weeks prior to veraison and continued through commercial harvest. Weather information (temperature and heat summation) showed that the growing seasons became increasingly warmer from 2001 to 2003. By harvest time, 2003 had the highest concentration of proanthocyanidins in seeds (per berry weight) in comparison with the other two vintages. Similarly, proanthocyanidins in skins had the highest concentration in 2003 (per berry weight). However, there was not difference in the concentration of flavan- 3 -ol monomers in seeds (per berry weight) between the three vintages. Anthocyanins were not significantly different over the three vintages. There was some relationship between the concentration of some proanthocyanidin components in grape seeds and fresh seed weight. Information of grape and wine phenolics was compared with each year's temperature. The results suggested that changes in temperature and heat summation between vintages are associated with changes in proanthocyanidin content in grapes and wine. The data indicates that it is possible to predict proanthocyanidins in wine based upon <b>early</b> <b>grape</b> analysis. However, the anthocyanin content in grapes did not correlate with either weather or the anthocyanin content in wine. The concentration of seed and skin proanthocyanidins in grapes were compared with the proportions of seed and skin proanthocyanidins found in wine. Based upon proanthocyanidin extraction from seeds and skin during winemaking, a formula to predict proanthocyanidin content in wine based upon grape analysis at harvest and veraison was developed. From this formula, Pinot noir wine contained 7. 8...|$|E
25|$|For {{other types}} of wines, such as {{sparkling}} wines like Champagne, maintaining {{a certain amount of}} acidity in the grapes is important to the winemaking process. As the concentration of acids in the grapes decrease the further along the ripening process you go, grapes destined for sparkling wines are often some of the <b>earliest</b> <b>grapes</b> to be harvested in a vintage. With their high acidity and low sugar levels, these grapes would be under ripe and would produce table wines that many wine drinkers would consider unpalatable yet the balance of sugars and acids is well suited for sparkling wine production.|$|R

50|$|Although wine is made {{throughout}} the United States, 90% {{of it comes}} from California. The Gallo Winery runs an industrial facility in Modesto, California that produces {{the majority of the}} state's wine exports. Most of the rest is split between Washington state and New York state, followed by Oregon. California's <b>earliest</b> <b>grape</b> vines were imported from New Spain, or Mexico, which in turn were brought by Spanish explorers and settlers. North America has several native species of Vitis, from which wine has been made {{for a long time in}} the east of the country, although the 'foxy' aromas of wines produced from these species are not to everyone's taste. The Catawba variety led the way for winemaking from native species, first in Ohio and later in the Finger Lakes area of New York state. California followed a similar path to Latin American countries, with Spanish missionaries starting the first vineyard of vinifera vines in 1769, and later immigrants from Bordeaux and Italy bringing their native grapes with them. Soon a thriving industry developed, particularly in the Napa Valley, which was stopped in its tracks by phylloxera and, uniquely, Prohibition (1920-1933).|$|R

25|$|The <b>earliest</b> <b>grape</b> vines {{planted in}} Washington State were at Fort Vancouver in 1825 by traders {{working for the}} Hudson's Bay Company {{but it is not}} known for sure whether wine was ever {{produced}} from these plantings. The first people who were definitely known to produce wine were German and Italian immigrants who planted their wine grapes in Washington during the 1860s and 1870s. Washington {{was one of the first}} states to usher in the start of Prohibition, going dry in 1917 and shutting down most of the state's wine production. Some scattered grape growers stayed afloat during this period selling grapes to home winemakers but nearly all the state's commercial wines went out of business. Following the end of Prohibition, Washington's fledgling wine industry was based primarily on fortified sweet wine production made from the Vitis Labrusca variety Concord. The Nawico and Pommerelle wineries were the most widely recognized producers, making millions of gallons each year of sweet jug wine made from Concord and other varieties. In the 1950s, the planting of Vitis vinifera saw an increase spearheaded, in part, by the work of Dr. Walter Clore and Washington State University which conducted a series of trials on which grape vines could produce the best wine in various soils and climates of Washington.|$|R
5000|$|The Walla Walla Valley {{became an}} early {{leader in the}} {{beginnings}} of the Washington wine industry when the town of Walla Walla was founded by the Hudson's Bay Company as a trading post in the 1840s. French fur trappers settled in a small town outside the city known as Frenchtown near Lowden and began planting grapes. In the late 1850s, a settler named A.B. Roberts established the first nursery in Walla Walla, importing grape vines from Champoeg, Oregon. [...] In 1859, the city of Walla Walla was incorporated and the Idaho gold rush of 1860 helped make the area a bustling trade center. When the gold rush ended, the economic focus of the state switched to Western Washington and the city of Seattle, lessening the influence of Walla Walla. In 1883, Northern Pacific Railway bypassed the Walla Walla Valley for a route from Spokane to Seattle. This essentially cut off Walla Walla from the growing market of the west. That same year a severe frost devastated the area's grapevines and caused a lot of the <b>earlier</b> <b>grape</b> growers to abandon their crops. The dawning of Prohibition in the United States in the early 20th century finished off the remaining aspect of the area as a wine region.|$|R
