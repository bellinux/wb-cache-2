50|$|Projected {{traffic density}} {{warranted}} {{the introduction of}} additional signal indications. One of these was a small green light under the two main red lights of a Stop signal, indicating Low Speed. The Low Speed indication was provided in the Underground City Railway from its opening on 28 February 1932. The standard speed restriction imposed by train stops with the Low Speed indication was originally 17 mph. However, at some locations, the maximum permissible speed is as low as 5 mph, subject to local conditions. In the Underground City and Eastern Suburbs railway lines, a speed restriction of 30 mph also applies to the Caution indication. The train stops can be seen dropping as the signals step-up to Medium. Closely spaced 'multi home signals', {{similar to those used}} on the London Underground, are also a feature of the Underground City and Eastern Suburbs lines. Speed control by <b>intermediate</b> <b>train</b> stops, based on Mr Byles' system, was introduced on the London Underground following the accident at Moorgate on 28 February 1975, in which 43 people were killed.|$|E
40|$|Bluetooth is a {{promising}} wireless technology enabling (portable) devices to form short-range starshaped wireless networks (or wireless personal area networks- PAN). Bluetooth {{relies on a}} frequency hopping physical layer, implying that hosts {{are not able to}} communicate unless they have previously discovered each by synchronizing their frequency hopping patterns. This further implies, that even if all nodes are within direct communication range, only those nodes that are synchronized within the personal area network can overhear a transmission. To support any-to-any communication such personal area networks (or in Bluetooth terminology piconets and possibly scatternets) need to be established among nodes. Thus, it is of utmost importance to be able to model or predict the time required for nodes to discover each other, i. e., to synchronize them. This paper provides a mathematical analysis and corresponding simulation results for the Bluetooth discovery (inquiry) time in a fully connected (personal area network) situation with the population as a parameter. The simplification to the analysis and simulation is due to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>train</b> changes in the inquiry process as it is outlined in the paper. 1...|$|E

Pilots thus arrived at No. 5 FTS RAF Sealand as APOs (Acting Pilot Officers) and upon satisfactory completion of <b>intermediate</b> <b>training</b> became Pilot Officers (POs), and were prepared for posting to a squadron or OTU (Operational Training Unit). Kenneth Cross spent time at No. 5 FTS as an instructor in the early 1930s. From 5 August 1940, the CFI (Chief Flying Instructor) was Edward Mortlock Donaldson.

On May 1, 1960, METG was redesignated into Training Squadron 6 (VT-6) as a primary squadron stationed aboard NAS Whiting Field in Milton, FL, flying the T-45C. At the time VT-6 provided primary and <b>intermediate</b> flight <b>training</b> for students, as well as advanced flight training for students in the rotary and lighter-than-air pipeline. During the T-28 era, VT-6 functioned as a complete training squadron, primary to advanced. With {{the introduction of the}} T-34 and T-6B, the mission of VT-6 shifted to only primary training. Since that time, VT-6 has served as one of five primary training squadrons in the Navy, responsible for initial training of Student Naval Aviators.|$|R
