500|$|In a December 2006 interview, Shearer added, [...] "Now, [...] {{refuse to}} talk about it. They realize <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> mistake. They never mention it. It's like they're {{punishing}} [...] for paying attention." [...] In {{the introduction to the}} ninth season DVD boxset, series creator Matt Groening describes [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as [...] "one of [...] least favorite episodes". He also called the episode [...] "a mistake" [...] in an interview with Rolling Stone.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{boost its}} declining readership, Deadline {{featured}} Tank Girl {{on its cover}} many times in 1994 and 1995 {{in anticipation of the}} film's release. Subsequently, Tom Astor said the release of the film: [...] "was very helpful, but it did not make up the difference, it lost some of its cult appeal without gaining any mainstream credibility." [...] The magazine ceased publication in late 1995. Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film, calling it [...] "a bit of a sore point" [...] for them. [...] "The script was lousy," [...] Hewlett recalled, [...] "me and Alan kept rewriting it and putting Grange Hill jokes and Benny Hill jokes in, and they obviously weren't getting it. They forgot to film about ten major scenes so we had to animate them... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> experience." [...] Talalay complained that the studio interfered significantly in the story, screenplay, and feel of the film. She said that she had been [...] "in sync" [...] and on good terms with Martin and Hewlett until the studio made significant cuts to the film, which she had no control over. Peter Milligan wrote an adaptation comic in 1995, and a novelization of the film by Martin Millar was published in 1996.|$|E

60|$|At {{the same}} time, {{we want to}} be warlike tigers. That is the horror: the {{confusing}} of the two ends. We warlike tigers fit ourselves out with machinery, and our blazing tiger wrath <b>is</b> emitted through <b>a</b> machine. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> thing to see machines hauled about by tigers, at the mercy of tigers, forced to express the tiger. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> still more <b>horrible</b> thing to see tigers caught up and entangled and torn in machinery. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>horrible,</b> <b>a</b> chaos beyond chaos, an unthinkable hell.|$|R
2500|$|Ferguson {{refused to}} give {{interviews}} to the BBC after a documentary called Fergie and Son was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004. According to an article in The Independent newspaper, the documentary had [...] "portrayed his agent son, Jason, as somebody who exploited his father's influence and position to his own ends in the transfer market". The same newspaper article {{made it clear that}} [...] "Ferguson Jnr" [...] was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Ferguson Senior as follows: [...] "They [...] did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense. It all [...] made-up stuff and 'brown paper bags' {{and all that kind of}} carry-on. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> attack on my son's honour and he should never have been accused of that." [...] Subsequent interviews on BBC programmes such as Match of the Day were done by his assistant Carlos Queiroz, and later Mike Phelan.|$|E
2500|$|At a Republican {{fund-raising}} {{event in}} February 2015, Giuliani stated, [...] "I do not believe, and I {{know this is}} a horrible thing to say, but I {{do not believe that the}} president [...] loves America", and [...] "He doesn’t love you. And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country." [...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E
2500|$|In Baltimore {{with the}} famous Fifth ("Dandy Fifth") and Sixth Regiments of the former state militia, now reorganized since the war as the Maryland National Guard were also called up by 37th Maryland Governor John Lee Carroll, (1830-1911), in Annapolis at the request [...] of {{powerful}} B. & O. President John Work Garrett, (1820-1884). The Fifth marched down North Howard Street from their armory above the old Richmond Market (at present North Howard and West Read Streets) in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood and were generally unopposed heading south for the B. & O.'s general headquarters and main depot at the Camden Street Station to board the waiting westward trains to Hagerstown and Cumberland. But the unfortunate Sixth assembled at their armory at East Fayette and North Front Streets (by the old Phoenix Shot Tower) in the Old Town /Jonestown area and had to fight their way west [...] through regular sympathetic Baltimore citizens, rioters and striking workers erupted bloodshed along main downtown commercial thoroughfare of Baltimore Street to get to Camden. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> scene reminiscent of {{the worst of the}} bloody [...] "Pratt Street Riots" [...] of the Civil War era disturbances of April 1861, over 15 years earlier of the [...] "first bloodshed" [...] of the war. [...] When the outnumbered troops of the 6th Regiment finally fired volleys on an attacking crowd on Baltimore Street, they killed 10 civilians and wounded 25. The rioters injured several members of the militia, damaged B. & O. engines and train cars, and burned portions of the train station at South Howard and West Camden Streets. The militia remained trapped in the surrounding Camden Yards, besieged by armed rioters until July 21–22, when the 19th President Rutherford B. Hayes sent federal troops and the U.S. Marines to Baltimore to restore order.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> {{scene and}} one that {{impressed}} me very much, especially as even then there fell upon me a conviction that this unfortunate man was doomed, that a fate which he could not escape was upon him.|$|E

500|$|At the Senate {{hearing in}} Washington D.C., Schumer stated, [...] "If this <b>is</b> true, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> outrage.

[...] Sullivan, then acting {{director}} of the ATF, replied to the criticism, stating, [...] "I'm not sure why the request was turned down", and pledged to look into the matter and provide further clarification in writing.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> moment. I {{felt sick}} with misery, and yet I {{could not believe}} it. To die for one's {{theological}} beliefs is the worst use a man can make of his life, but to die for a literary theory! It seemed impossible.|$|E
60|$|From {{under the}} table, calm and smiling, rose Dirkovitch, {{who had been}} roused from healthful slumber by feet upon his body.

5000|$|Amstell first {{appeared}} on the comedy show Never Mind the Buzzcocks as a guest during Mark Lamarr's tenure as host, in 2003 and 2006.

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> {{thing to}} have said it, he felt {{now that he had}} spoken; a sense of the indelicacy, the shamefulness, seemed to {{alienate}} him from all high concern in the matter, and to leave him a mere self- convicted eavesdropper. His face flamed; the wavering hopes, the wavering doubts alike died in his heart. He had fallen below the dignity of his own trouble.|$|E
60|$|These {{were days}} of waiting--horrible days {{of waiting for}} Ciccio to be called up. One batch of young men left the village--and there was a lugubrious sort of saturnalia, {{men and women alike}} got rather drunk, the young men left amid howls of lamentation and shrieks of distress.
