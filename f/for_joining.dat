From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently.

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, King Kamehameha IV declared the Kingdom of Hawaii's neutrality on August26, 1861. Despite this stance of neutrality, many Native Hawaiians and Hawaii-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands acted independently and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Native Hawaiian participation in American wars was not unheard of; Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more fought during the American Civil War. There were varying reasons <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> the war. Hawaiians abroad often sought economic gains and adventures through their enlistment. These included the unemployed sailors on whaling ships who joined the Union Navy and sailors on whaling ships captured by the Confederate Navy who served on the CSS Shenandoah. There was also an ideological sympathy for the cause of the war. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaii's ties to New England through missionaries and the whaling industry, and the opposition of many people in the islands to slavery.|$|E
5|$|Alex Parrish, {{a former}} FBI recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a {{terrorist}} attack on Grand Central Terminal and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> the bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The current time-line focuses on Parrish's constrained relationship with her friends while {{she is on the}} run in an attempt to prove her innocence. In the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI; in flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the current time-line, a hostage crisis at a G-20 summit in New York City is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President Claire Haas and CIA director Matthew Keyes form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by Clay Haas) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in the hostage crisis.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, {{the display}} of unity by white farmers against {{chartered}} rule at the 1920 elections fell apart. The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> South Africa. The {{role of women in}} the defeat of the Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting for responsible government, even when their husbands voted for Union.

Many of the local village headmen in the Jaffa region were executed by Ali for supporting the revolt. Jaffa's urban notables, who also backed the rebels in their earlier attempt to capture Jaffa's fortress, escaped a similar fate by fleeing to the island of Cyprus. A number of major notables from other parts of Palestine were rounded up as well, including the religious leaders Sheikh Abdullah al-Fahum of Nazareth and Sheikh Said al-Sa'di of az-Zeeb. Both were exiled to Egypt. Mas'ud al-Madi, the mutassalim of Jaffa, and his son Isa al-Madi, the mutassalim of Safad, were arrested and executed by beheading <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> the revolt.

Lem, however, never had a high opinion of American science fiction, describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms. After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded, an action that some of the SFWA members apparently intended as a rebuke, and it seems that Lem interpreted it as such. Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined. After many members (including Ursula K.
