Globalization tendencies in modern educational environment induce the problem of necessity to integrate educational and scientific resources into Russian education. The aim {{of this article is}} to demonstrate a significant part of scientific research as a consistent factor in formation of the competence-based model of a professional. It is shown that students’ research work beyond the process of education becomes a unique sort of teaching activity, which has a number of essential differences from the main traditional teaching techniques for compulsory courses. The results of students’ research work in the ecological situation of Siberian region are presented. The competencies acquired by students during this work are revealed. It is noticed that integrating the theme of students’ research work with compulsory courses is one of the most important teaching peculiarities in formation of personal attributes of a future <b>highly-qualified</b> <b>professional,</b> which form the basis of professional mobility and competitiveness. It is summarized that an interdisciplinary character of research work in the modern educational paradigm is aimed at solving innovative tasks of integrating educational, scientific and practice-oriented constituents in the context of the competency building approach...|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{it has been}} {{grounded}} that under the conditions of forming postindustrial epoch, which is characterised by the processes of globalisation and informatisation, there exists a social demand for the specialists who have a formed preparedness for continuous self-education, including linguistic self-instruction. This presupposes developing innovative and strategic thinking as well as realising the objective necessity of continuous enhancing of their proficiency level, which is a key factor of interaction with dynamic and changeable professional environment with rapid obsolescence of knowledge, constant technological advancement, etc. It has been proved that nowadays the role of self-education, as the instrument of forming <b>highly-qualified</b> <b>professionals</b> with sufficient knowledge of foreign languages, is always growing in different countries. Therefore, educators are continually facing the task of improving the theoretical and methodological base of teaching students to be autonomous in their studies. It has been substantiated that, {{in view of the}} principle of continuity in science, introducing any innovations into the learning process in linguistic self-education should be preceded by the profound studying of the pedagogically valuable theoretical and practical experience, gained by the previous generations of researchers. Thus, the retrospective analysis of basic historical milestones of evolving the phenomenon “linguistic self-education” has been conducted and its results have been presented in this work...|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 30 {{informants}} {{were chosen for}} interviews from among those who answered the survey. Three of the interviewees directly communicated their willingness to participate, while the other 27 were selected from the survey respondents who agreed to be contacted for the follow-up interviews by systematic random sampling according to their gender and residential area. 7 Only 28 of the interviews are analyzed as 2 of the interviewees did not provide any effective answers. 8 Among the 28 interviews that are analyzed, 16 are women and 12 are men. The ages of the informants ranged from 21 to 71  years, and they had diverse occupational backgrounds, including students, <b>highly-qualified</b> <b>professionals,</b> and unskilled workers. Some were employment seekers at that time. The interviewees were all of Swedish origin, {{with the exception of}} four, who had at least one parent of West European, Central East European or Latin American origin. I have included them in the analysis since they identified themselves as part of the majority society; {{the manner in which they}} answered the interview questions did not differ from other interviewees of a white Swedish origin. I carried out eight interviews face-to-face and the rest via the telephone. The responses show no significant differences in the length, effectiveness or the content of the interviews whether the interview was conducted face-to-face or by telephone. For ethical reasons, the interviewees and the answers that the interviewees gave to the survey cannot be matched and compared. 9 All the answers given during the interviews are treated anonymously and confidentially.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the results}} of this analysis, the {{following}} recommendations for future surveys can be made. Traditional sampling methods (e.g. multi-stage sampling with screening for the target population) are generally preferable due to their known characteristics and wider application. However, for minor domains (sub-populations), such as immigrants, the coverage of the survey usually needs to be limited through either excluding certain areas with lower concentration of the target population and/or further geographical restrictions to make the survey feasible with limited resources (for example by only covering selected cities in a country). This, however, excludes a certain part of the target population from the survey by definition. A restriction of the survey target group to cities, for example, is a common approach because nation-wide samples can be rarely financed. Such limitations need to be discussed and taken into account when the results are presented and interpreted. As discussed with respect to the interpretation of general migrant integration indicators, the contextualisation of results is crucial for the interpretation of statistics on migrants, particularly on the international level (see for example the discussion in Huddleston, Niessen, & Tjaden, 2013). Close scrutiny is necessary when comparing cities across and within a country to understand differences reported in a survey. As an example, the ICS yields different results for the cities covered in Belgium. These come from differences in the situation of the target population in the cities. The contextual situation in terms of immigrant integration differs across the country, given the different immigration waves and trajectories experienced in Wallonia (Liège) and Flanders (Brussels and Antwerp), as well as the particular situation for Brussels in certain aspects, especially as a magnet of <b>highly-qualified</b> <b>professionals</b> not just as the Belgian capital city but also the administrative capital of European institutions (cf. for example Phalet & Swyngedouw, 2003).|$|R

In the complex framework of European migration, both Eastern European countries and Spain play an important role. With great analogies in the past, transformations occurred {{at the end of}} the 1980 s which have led Eastern European countries to be one of the main sources of emigrants in Europe. Spain is now on the receiving end. The relationship between the two is established in this context, with Spain today being one of the destinations of Eastern European emigrants, who are in an intermediate position within the array of peoples emigrating to the country - from <b>highly-qualified</b> first-world <b>professionals</b> holding important jobs and belonging to the highest socio-economic class to unskilled or under-skilled third world emigrants living at the lower end of the socio-economic scale and often marginalized...|$|R

Rapidly changing technology and growth of ICT-related activities in all sectors led to shortages of <b>highly-qualified</b> ICT <b>professionals.</b> Recruitment difficulties indicated imbalances between existing skills and company demands. ICT skills were obtained through formal education and training or more informally through using ICTs and gaining experience with them. High standards in mathematics, science, and informatics in most CCs were promising for the future supply of highly skilled professionals. The promising medium and longer-term supply of ICT professionals was associated with increasing numbers of young people in higher education and vocational schools. The rising number of students in ICT higher education had not led to a corresponding increase in numbers of teaching staff. Aging of academi...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho refere-se à análise do processo de implementação da orientação por competências em escolas públicas, na Região Metropolitana de São Paulo, na primeira metade dos anos 2000, com o objetivo de compreender as mudanças introduzidas no sistema educacional, no curso dos dois últimos decênios. A hipótese {{principal}} que orientou a pesquisa é de que há um movimento de racionalização que contamina todas as esferas da vida social, transformando o processo educacional em meio para responder aos imperativos do mercado de trabalho. Para tanto, foram pesquisadas duas escolas públicas que oferecem o Ensino Fundamental, a primeira vinculada a uma universidade pública e estadual (Escola A) e a segunda integrante da rede de escolas estaduais, subordinada à Secretaria Estadual de Educação, e que mantém parceria com empresa privada (Escola B). O estudo das escolas, realizado entre 2003 e 2006, indagou os professores, coordenadores, mediante entrevistas semi-estruturadas, como estavam colocando em prática a orientação do ensino por competências; quais eram, na ótica desses trabalhadores, as inovações, as mudanças nas ações educativas, sejam elas curriculares, na organização do trabalho escolar; e, na orientação por competências, como se estabelecem consentimentos ou resistências ao processo. A pesquisa também investigou a percepção dos pais dos estudantes sobre os reflexos da orientação por competências sobre o processo educativo. O estudo foi complementado não só com a análise de documentos produzidos pelas escolas, pelo poder público, em especial o Ministério da Educação, pelos organismos internacionais ou empresariais, mas também com as observações no campo das atividades de trabalho dos professores, funcionários, coordenadores e diretores. A pesquisa encontrou na Escola A coletivos de trabalhadores altamente qualificados, com contratos de trabalho estáveis (embora pela Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho) e jornadas semanais de trabalho em tempo integral; com condições de trabalho favoráveis não só pela proximidade acadêmica com Faculdade de Educação, mas pela disponibilidade de recursos didáticos e pedagógicos e pela presença de estudantes originários de diferentes grupos sociais. Essas condições e relações de trabalho não foram suficientes para construir espaços de resistência ao movimento de orientação por competências. Quando foram encontradas eram difusas e individualizadas. De modo geral, o coletivo de trabalhadores se apropriou da orientação por competências e buscam implementar as mudanças, considerando o trabalho docente como um espaço de autonomia relativa. Por outro lado, na Escola B, a pesquisa encontrou coletivo de trabalhadores com menor qualificação, com contratos de trabalho, na sua maioria, temporários (embora Estatutários), com alta rotatividade de professores e diretores; uma diversidade de jornadas de trabalho (organizadas por hora-aula); e com condições de trabalho desfavoráveis se comparadas com a Escola A. Essas condições e relações de trabalho informam as dificuldades desse coletivo de trabalhadores de construírem propostas educacionais que tenham continuidade, que se enraízem e que produzam ações educativas duradouras (como na Escola A). O ensino por competências é implementado por meio de projetos de trabalho, limitando a formação dos estudantes à sua realidade. Ambos os coletivos compreendem o trabalho docente como espaço de autonomia relativa, como portador de possibilidades de transformação cultural e social de estudantes. No entanto, na Escola B, a proximidade com a empresa coloca finalidades contraditórias para a educação escolar, legitimando os imperativos do mercado de trabalho. Na Escola A, a proximidade com a universidade não se constituiu em ruptura com o processo de legitimação vivenciado pela Escola B, concretizado na preocupação com o vestibular. This {{current research}} is {{an analysis of}} the process of implementing competence orientation in state (public) schools situated in São Paulo metropolitan area. The analysis took place {{in the first half of}} the 2000 ?s and aimed at understanding the changes inserted in the educational system throughout the last two decades. The hypothesis for the research is that there is a rationalization movement which contaminates all aspects of social life, transforming the on-going educational process in order to correspond to job market needs. To fulfill the research, the investigation was carried out in two state schools which have primary and secondary education: the first one is a school which is related to a state, public university (school A); the second one, a school which is part of a network of state schools- supervised by the State Bureau of Education, which has partnership with a private enterprise (school B). The study in the schools was implemented from 2003 to 2006, and used semistructured questionnaires applied to teachers and coordinators as data resource. The informants were asked how they were implementing the competence orientations and which were, according to their point-of ?view, the innovations and changes in the educational actions (in different aspects such as curriculum and school work organization), as well as how resistance or consent to the process happened. The research also investigated the parents? understanding about the competenceorientation outcomes on the educational process. The study was complemented not only with the analysis of documents produced by the schools, by the state educational offices, mainly by the Federal Department of Education, by business and international associations, but also with field observations of school staff (teachers, coordinators, servants, directors) at work. The research in school A found <b>highly-qualified</b> <b>professionals,</b> hired under stable job contracts (Work Regulation Laws, in Portuguese called ?CLT?) and full-time week periods of work with positive conditions, not only because of the close relationship with the School of Education in the university, but also because of the availability of pedagogical resources, and the presence of students from different social groups. These conditions and work relationships were not sufficient to create spaces of resistance to the competence-orientation movement; where they were found, they were scattered, isolated and individualized. In general terms, most workers accepted the orientations in a positive way and worked towards the implementation of the changes, considering the teachers? work as a space of relative autonomy. However, in school B, the research found groups of less-qualified professionals, hired under temporary job contracts (although being regulated by statute) with high turnover of teachers and directors and several different week time periods of work (organized by hour-class); and unfavorable work conditions, compared to school A. These conditions and work relationships reported the difficulties of school staff to build and implement educational actions, ones which could last, root and produce long-term educational actions (like the ones in school A). The teaching of competencies is implemented through work projects, framing the students? education to their own reality. In both contexts, school staff sees their work as a space with relative autonomy, as well as a space of possibilities towards students? cultural and social change. However, in school B, the close relationship with the enterprise sets learning goals with are contradictory with school education, favoring job market orientations and needs. In school A, the close relationship with the university does not mean there is a process of breaking up with the process of educating towards job market needs (what is explicit in school B); this fact is revealed in the orientation towards university preparatory exams (in Portuguese, called ?vestibular?) ...|$|R
