5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed <b>down</b> <b>any</b> progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} in the pre-climax sequences was toned down to match the sensibilities of the Telugu audience after Venkatesh expressed scepticism {{as to whether the}} audience would accept him getting beaten up badly in the police station. During set construction for the police station and the house in the film, the producer and the director {{wanted to get rid of}} some coconut trees. However, art director Vivek managed to erect those sets without cutting <b>down</b> <b>any</b> trees.|$|E
5|$|Schafer noted at {{the time}} of Grim Fandango {{original}} development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace <b>down</b> <b>any</b> of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E

Although all of the LST-519 guns fired at the enemy, the ship was not credited with <b>downing</b> <b>any</b> of the attacking German aircraft.|$|R

5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the United States still {{has the ability to}} conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the Pakistani military, the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones, as well as for emergency landings and logistical support, and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot <b>down</b> <b>any</b> future US drones intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay <b>down</b> <b>any</b> ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental changes could be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E
5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot <b>down</b> <b>any</b> commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by Glazer to {{purchase}} Manchester United {{came in the form}} of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60million per annum. The remainder {{came in the form of}} PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds. Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum. Despite this, the Glazers did not pay <b>down</b> <b>any</b> of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means. In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).|$|E
5|$|The battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a type {{of capital}} ship {{of the first half}} of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and {{armament}} to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase <b>down</b> <b>any</b> ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.|$|E
5|$|In September 1967, {{the first}} {{successful}} Roundabout recruitment was Curtis' flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore {{had been a member}} of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he was hanging out in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed <b>down</b> <b>any</b> development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling out the rest of the band.|$|E
