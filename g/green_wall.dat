Beyoncé and Jay-Z then start to {{simultaneously}} play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune. Scenes of Beyoncé are then shown in several different rooms wearing different outfits. As the chorus begins, she is shown running around and dancing out in a large sugarcane field. At {{the end of the}} chorus, she dances in a red dress in front of a pond and in a large red dress out in front of a mansion. When Jay-Z's verse begins, the two are shown alone inside a room, Beyoncé is now barefoot and bare-legged, she dances seductively around Jay-Z, and leads to the controversial oral sex scene. Beyoncé is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with Beyoncé leaning back in a pose as fireflies race away.|$|E

25|$|The new Social Sciences Building at the University of Ottawa is the university’s latest green initiative. The fifteen-storey {{building}} that took {{about four years}} of planning and construction to complete opened its doors in September 2012. The Social Sciences Building that cost {{a grand total of}} $112.5 million provides students and faculty with an array of space for individual studying and group work. This building is the newest addition to the University of Ottawa with its green and sustainable architecture and facilities. This building is very different among the rest of the university’s buildings as its structure and characteristics are very eco-friendly. Some features that the building includes are: construction materials that were chosen due to their recycled content, a living wall that is five stories tall and composed of numerous plants that with act as an air filtration system, and a green roof. The <b>green</b> <b>wall</b> is the tallest living biofilter wall in North America. The wall is situated in the main agora of the Faculty of Social Science building and is visible from the outside. The <b>green</b> <b>wall</b> is a unique component of the building’s air handling system, for it is capable of treating a large quantity of air at a time, and it provides a source of humidity that doesn’t need to be artificially introduced.|$|E

The simulation results show that <b>green</b> <b>walls</b> could be more effective in urban morphologies with narrow streets. During overheated periods, the streets with <b>green</b> <b>walls</b> have a higher relative humidity in the surrounding areas than those with trees.

40|$|A {{building}} façade {{is considered}} to form {{the first line of}} protection against adverse climate and environmental conditions in an urban area, such as wind and rain, leading it to be affected and eventually damaged by continued and direct interaction. Furthermore, the increasing ecological and environmental concerns, due to the global warming associated with air and noise pollution, is proved to be linked to the small quantity of vegetation and green areas in urban environments and to technological development. Depending on that, new approaches to improve the environment quality in urban areas started to be developed. One of these approaches is Vertical and Horizontal Gardens, which are taking increasing roles in the recent years. Historically, vertical gardens were the starting point for considering the possibility of growing plants on vertical surfaces and some examples are dated back to 2000 years in Mediterranean regions. <b>Green</b> <b>walls</b> were first used in buildings for simply decorative purposes in many cities of Europe and north America in the 19 th century. However, the environmental control value of the <b>green</b> <b>walls</b> in Europe was not noticed until 1980 s, where a lot of programs and studies recognized their ability to mitigate particulate matter, reduce noise and provide cooling effects leading {{to the development of a}} lot of projects that promoted the usages of <b>green</b> <b>walls.</b> The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of <b>green</b> <b>walls</b> regarding their ability to mitigate environmental conflicts, taking in consideration the different methods of implementation and their respective advantages and disadvantages. This study systemically reviews recent researches on nature-based solutions namely <b>green</b> <b>walls.</b> Followed by an analysis of the environmental properties of different models of solutions, and an analysis of the costs and the average payback periods. The results of the review can provide a feedback of the most efficient green solutions that could offer good environmental quality with economic advantages. The first part of the paper provides an overall introduction considering the <b>green</b> <b>walls</b> and their implementing methodologies. While the second part presents the environmental and economic effects of the different vertical greening systems on the envelope of the building compared to common building materials. The final results prove that each system of vertical greening varies depending on the levels of environmental benefits and costs, where some systems are proved to be economically sustainable with good environmental properties while others offer a wider range of plants with several implementation methods making them easierinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
