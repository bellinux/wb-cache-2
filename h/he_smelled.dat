5|$|Lavender's primary pitch was the spitball, and {{his method}} of {{preparation}} was to lick the ball. In a game on July19, Lavender was about to load the ball when <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> a liniment on the ball. He reported this to the home plate umpire, who then ejected the Phillies manager, Red Dooin, from the game. Dooin had been caught doing this to another spitballer, Marty O'Toole, a few days earlier. On September26, Lavender and the Cubs were ahead 9–0in {{the top half of}} the ninth inning versus Cincinnati, when the Reds scored 10runs against Lavender and two other pitchers to take the lead 10–9. The Cubs ultimately prevailed and gained the victory by scoring two runs in the bottom half of the ninth. Lavender started just one more game in 1912, a 3–2victory on October5 against St. Louis. Following the season, the Cubs played a series of exhibition games with the Chicago White Sox of the American League called the City Series. Lavender started the first game against Ed Walsh, and the game ended after nine innings with a scoreless tie. Lavender gave six hits and Walsh just one. After the two teams played to a 12-inning tie two days later, Lavender pitched the Cubs to victory in game three. Two additional victories gave the Cubs a 3–0series lead, but the White Sox were able to win four straight games, twice defeating Lavender, including in the series finale. He completed his rookie season with his career-high 16victories, against 13losses, and a 3.04earned run average(ERA) in 251innings pitched.|$|E
25|$|Before the explosion, most of {{the workers}} had {{evacuated}} the building. Police Chief Nannette Hegerty stated that an evacuation had begun 10 to 14minutes before the explosion. According to reports by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a Falk spokeswoman stated that the evacuation {{was limited to the}} area near a propane leak. The Journal's report also stated that a man said that <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> gas about thirty minutes before the explosion occurred. Another worker reported a propane leak, and shut off the tank and issued a warning, but could still smell the gas. The Journal interviewed six employees that said they were never formally evacuated because it would have led them through the Annex building.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1937, Gershwin {{began to}} {{complain}} of blinding headaches and a recurring impression that <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> burning rubber. On February 11, 1937, he performed his Piano Concerto in F {{in a special}} concert of his music with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra {{under the direction of}} French maestro Pierre Monteux. Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance. He was at the time working on other Hollywood film projects while living with Ira and his wife Leonore in their rented house in Beverly Hills. Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table. She suspected mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist Yip Harburg's empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller. The headaches and olfactory hallucinations continued.|$|E

500|$|Daltrey's {{voice is}} {{negatively}} affected by marijuana smoke, {{to which he}} says he is allergic. On 20 May 2015, during a Who concert at Nassau Coliseum, <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> a joint burning and told the smoker to put it out or [...] "the show will be over".

500|$|Tomlinson {{can be seen}} briefly remonstrating {{with police}} as {{he sits on the}} ground. None of the {{officers}} offered assistance. After being helped to his feet by a protester, Tomlinson walked [...] along Cornhill, where he collapsed at around 7:22pm outside 77 Cornhill. Witnesses say he appeared dazed, eyes rolling, skin grey. They also said <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> of alcohol. An ITV News photographer tried to give medical aid, but was forced away by police, as was a medical student. Police medics attended to Tomlinson, who was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.|$|E
2500|$|According to JCG, {{the patrol}} boat Mizuki of the 11th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters {{encountered}} Minjinyu 5179 at about 10:15 (JST) on September 7, 2010. Mizuki ordered Minjinyu 5179 {{to stop for}} inspection since Minjinyu 5179 was traveling [...] north-west of the Senkaku Islands, which is outside the agreed area for Chinese fishing, and within disputed Japanese territorial waters. Minjinyu 5179 refused the order and attempted to flee from the scene. During the chase and interception, Minjinyu 5179 collided with JCG's patrol vessels. On September 8, 2010, JCG boarded the Chinese trawler and arrested its captain for obstruction of performance of public duty and illegal fishing. The trawler, the captain, and 14 crew members, were transported to Ishigaki Island of Japan for detention. An investigator told the press that <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> alcohol on the arrested captain but apparently no alcohol test results were ever released.|$|E

2500|$|The strongest drug in {{the early}} Tour de France was strychnine. Other than that, riders would take {{anything}} to survive the tedium, {{the pain and the}} exhaustion of stages that could last more than 300km. That included alcohol, which was already strong in French culture and sometimes purer than water after World War I destroyed water pipes and polluted water tables, and ether. There are photographs of riders holding ether-soaked handkerchiefs to their mouths, or leaving them knotted under the chin so the fumes would deaden the pain in their legs. The smell, enough to turn a man's stomach said Pierre Chany, discouraged some but also showed the extent of suffering by others. Roger Lapébie, winner of the Tour in 1937, said <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> ether [...] "in the bunch near the finish; it used to be taken in a little bottle called a topette." [...] Its use lasted decades; riders were caught using it as late as 1963.|$|E
2500|$|On May 30, Powell {{checked on}} Harlow, {{and when he}} found that her {{condition}} had not improved, he recalled her mother from a holiday trip and summoned her doctor. [...] Harlow's illnesses had delayed three previous films (Wife vs. Secretary, Suzy, and Libeled Lady), {{so there was no}} great concern initially. On June 2, it was announced that Harlow was suffering from influenza. [...] Dr. Ernest Fishbaugh, who had been called to Harlow's home to treat her, diagnosed her with an inflamed gallbladder. [...] Harlow felt better on June 3 and co-workers expected her back on the set by Monday, June 7. Press reports were contradictory, with headlines including [...] "Jean Harlow seriously ill" [...] and [...] "Harlow past illness crisis." [...] Clark Gable, who visited her during these days, later said that she was severely bloated and that <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> urine on her breath when he kissed her—both signs of kidney failure.|$|E
2500|$|... when Isaac {{was old and}} {{his sight}} had dimmed, he called Esau {{and asked him to}} hunt some game and prepare a dish, so that Isaac might give him his {{innermost}} blessing before he died. Rebekah had been listening, and when Esau departed, she instructed Jacob to fetch her two choice kids so that she might prepare a dish that Jacob could take to Isaac and receive his blessing. Jacob complained to Rebekah that since Esau was hairy, Isaac might touch him, discover him to be a trickster, and curse him. But Rebekah called the curse upon herself, insisting that Jacob do as she directed. So Jacob got the kids, and Rebekah prepared a dish, had Jacob put on Esau's best clothes, and covered Jacob's hands and neck with the kid's skins. When Jacob went to Isaac, he asked which of his sons had arrived, and Jacob said that he was Esau and asked for Isaac's blessing. Isaac asked him how he had succeeded so quickly, and he said that God had granted him good fortune. Isaac asked Jacob to come closer that Isaac might feel him to determine whether he was really Esau. Isaac felt him and wondered that the voice was Jacob's, but the hands were Esau's. Isaac questioned if it was really Esau, and when Jacob assured him, Isaac asked for the game and Jacob served him the kids and wine. Isaac bade his son to come close and kiss him, and Isaac smelled his clothes, remarking that <b>he</b> <b>smelled</b> like the fields. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

The god was actually offering him another piece of meat. Again he refused to take it from the hand, and again it was tossed to him. This was repeated a number of times.
