Downstream of the nip, the twisted yarn is drawn sequentially across first and second runs of travelling endless belts, such that the yarn wraps about a first convex surface of the first run, then passes {{between the first and second}} runs, before wrapping about a second convex surface of the second run. Friction between each of the first and second convex surfaces and the yarn imparts the false twist in a common direction.

30|$|During {{hybrid yarn}} {{preparation}} in hollow spinning, the core component {{had to be}} kept in high tension for winding the cover properly around the core. To achieve the required tension in case of copper core samples (A 1 and B 1), a draft of 1.3 between the <b>front</b> <b>drafting</b> roller and the take-up roller had to be maintained. Since copper has very less elasticity due to its high modulus, this draft during spinning made it permanently elongated, hence the elongation values in the hybrid yarn sample A 1 and B 1 were reduced. This is also reflected in the resultant count of the sample A 1 and B 1 in Table  2. The resultant count of 75 Tex copper wire and 31.60 Tex polyester turned out to be 89.40 Tex only (sample A 1).

40|$|A peloton may {{be defined}} as two or more cyclists riding in {{sufficiently}} close proximity to be located either {{in one of two}} basic positions: 1) behind cyclists in zones of reduced air pressure, referred to as 'drafting', or 2) in zones of highest air pressure, described here alternately as 'riding at the front', 'in the wind', or in 'non-drafting positions'. Cyclists in <b>drafting</b> <b>zones</b> expend less energy than in front positions. Two broad models of peloton dynamics are explored. The first is an energetic model that describes peloton dynamics that oscillate through observable phase states as they emerge from collision avoidance and riders' coupled energy outputs. These phases exhibit behavioural characteristics such as convection patterns and synchronization, among others. Under the second, economic model, we discuss some basic parameters of the peloton as a system of economic exchange, and identify the resources within a peloton for which riders compete and cooperate. These include the energy savings of drafting, a near-front positional resource, and an information resource. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 1 Appendi...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{geophysical}} {{mapping of}} the Arctic seafloor has revealed extensive erosion caused by ice and glacial landforms on ridge crests and plateaus where present water depths are shallower than. Such erosion stems from thick outlet glaciers and massive ice shelf complexes. Cores and glacigenic landforms {{suggest that the}} largest ice shelf complex was confined to the Amerasian sector of the Arctic Ocean, roughly 135, 000 years ago. We apply a peak over threshold approach to assess whether the calving fronts of this ice shelf complex comprise a likely source of the deep draft icebergs responsible for the mapped plow marks. This approach is novel to modeling Arctic paleoglacial configurations. Predicted extreme calving <b>front</b> <b>drafts</b> match observed deep-draft iceberg marks if the ice shelf complex is sufficiently large. We explain the methodology of Kirchner, Furrer, Jakobsson and coauthors [1] in a storyboard framework, i. e., with figures and sketches. Here, we extend their approach by using shelf specific threshold selection, an alternative estimate to scale ‘coastlines’, supervised pooling of estimates and uncertainty estimates based on parametric bootstrap.

40|$|Conventional ring {{spinning}} {{is known as}} traditional spinning system and it is most widely used system in textile industry. Despite being the most prevalent system and supplying approximately 60 % of short-staple yarn production, {{there are still some}} limitations as lower production rate, longer production flow and higher production costs. That is why, researches in textiles started to accelerate to develop alternative spinning systems. Siro-spun spinning system which is an important type of twist spinning, had been developed with the aim of reducing yarn manufacturing costs by eliminating plying and twisting processes in the production flow. The main principle of Siro-spun spinning is to feed two parallel fibre strands in <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> and allow these two fibre strands twist together on each other when they leave the front roller. In this study, it was aimed to compare the properties of two ply yarns produced by {{ring spinning}} system and Siro-spun spinning system. For this purpose, properties of Ne 40 / 2 yarns made of cotton, Tencel, polyester and micro Modal were analysed. Results showed that Siro-spun yarns have lower hairiness and unevenness than ring-spun yarns, besides mechanical properties of both spinning systems are approximate. Besides the advantages in terms of production costs, it can be also concluded that Siro-spun spinning system is a strong alternative of conventional system in terms of many yarn characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Solospun is a {{spinning}} technology which provides {{the means to}} produce a singles yarn that can be successfully woven as either warp or weft. The technology is a versatile and cost effective alternative to two-folding, Sirospun or sizing. It offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity. Solospun is a simple, inexpensive, clip-on attachment for the spinning of long staple, weavable singles yarns. The technology {{is the result of}} a joint development between CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, The Woolmark Company and WRONZ and was commercially released in 1998. It is now successfully operating in worsted mills worldwide. The Solospun hardware consists of a pair of rollers held in a bracket, which is clipped onto the front of the pendulum-drafting arm. Each roller is positioned immediately below, and parallel to, each top <b>front</b> <b>draft</b> roller where it interacts with the emerging drafted fibre strand before twist insertion. The roller-fibre interaction subtly changes the structure of the yarn, which dramatically increases its abrasion resistance. This allows Solospun yarns to be woven without two-folding or sizing, providing significant cost savings. Depending on fabric structure, weaving performance is equivalent to that of conventional two-fold yarns. Fabrics woven from Solospun yarns are of good quality and appearance. Some aspects, including preferred hand and FAST results, are equal or superior to two-fold yarn fabrics. As with compact and condensed spinning, Solospun offers significant reductions in yarn hairiness. However, Solospun can be simply implemented on existing spinning frames and goes much further by making the singles yarns weavable...|$|R
40|$|Geophysical mapping and coring of {{the central}} Arctic Ocean {{seafloor}} provide evidence for repeated occurrences of ice sheet/ice shelf complexes during previous glacial periods. Several ridges and bathymetric highs shallower than present water depths of ∼ 1000 m show signs of erosion from deep-drafting (armadas of) icebergs, which originated from thick outlet glaciers and ice shelves. Mapped glacigenic landforms and dates of cored sediments suggest that the largest ice shelf complex was confined to the Amerasian sector of the Arctic Ocean during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6. However, the spatial extent of ice shelves can not be well reconstructed from occasional groundings on bathymetric highs. Therefore, we apply a statistical approach to provide independent support for an extensive MIS 6 ice shelf complex, which previously was inferred only from interpretation of geophysical and geological data. Specifically, we assess whether this ice shelf complex comprises a likely source of the deep-draft icebergs responsible for the mapped scour marks. The statistical modeling is based on exploiting relations between contemporary Antarctic ice shelves and their local physical environments and the assumption that Arctic Ocean MIS 6 ice shelves scale similarly. Analyzing ice thickness data along the calving front of contemporary ice shelves, a peak over threshold method is applied to determine sources of deep-drafting icebergs in the Arctic Ocean MIS 6 ice shelf complex. This approach is novel to modeling Arctic paleoglacial configurations.
