5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} the <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges.

Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service.

The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
