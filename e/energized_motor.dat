50|$|A variant on the {{electric}} starter motor is the inertia starter (not {{to be confused}} with the Bendix-type starter described above). Here the starter motor does not turn the engine directly. Instead, when <b>energized,</b> the <b>motor</b> turns a heavy flywheel built into its casing (not the main flywheel of the engine). Once the flywheel/motor unit has reached a constant speed the current to the motor is turned off and the drive between the motor and flywheel is disengaged by a freewheel mechanism. The spinning flywheel is then connected to the main engine and its inertia turns it over to start it. These stages are commonly automated by solenoid switches, with the machine operator using a two-position control switch, which is held in one position to spin the motor and then moved to the other to cut the current to the motor and engage the flywheel to the engine.|$|R

It consists of an ∼ 50 -nm rotor and up to ∼ 10 independent stators anchored to the cell wall.

We used the results to explore the 25 -dimensional parameter space of generalized kinetic models for the motor mechanism, finding 830 parameter sets consistent with the data.

In the Dolter system the current was supplied from metal studs placed between the rails that became live and rose from the road to <b>energize</b> the <b>motors</b> of the tram passing over, being then supposed to become dead.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated the use of electrical signature analysis (ESA), that is, the use of induction motor currents and voltages, for early detection of motor faults {{in the form of}} embedded algorithms. In the event of multiple <b>motors</b> <b>energized</b> by a common voltage bus, the cost of installing and maintaining fault monitoring and detection devices on each motor may be avoided, by using bus level aggregate electrical measurements to assess the health of the entire population of motors. In this research an approach for detecting commonly encountered induction motor mechanical faults from bus level aggregate electrical measurements is investigated. A mechanical fault indicator is computed processing the raw electrical measurements through a series of signal processing algorithms. Inference of an incipient fault is made by the percentage relative change of the fault indicator from the ??healthy?? baseline, thus defining a Fault Indicator Change (FIC). To investigate the posed research problem, healthy and faulty motors with broken rotor bar faults are simulated using a detailed transient motor model. The FIC based on aggregate electrical measurements is studied through simulations of different motor banks containing the same faulty motor. The degradation in the FIC when using aggregate measurements, as compared to using individual motor measurements, is investigated. For a given motor bank configuration, the variation in FIC with increasing number of faulty motors is also studied. In addition to simulation studies experimental results from a two-motor setup are analyzed. The FIC and degradation in the FIC in the case of load eccentricity fault, and a combination of shaft looseness and bearing damage is studied through staged fault experiments in the laboratory setup. In this research, the viability of using bus level aggregate electrical measurements for detecting incipient faults in <b>motors</b> <b>energized</b> by a common voltage bus is demonstrated. The proposed approach is limited in that as the power rating fraction of faulty motors to healthy motors in a given configuration decreases, it becomes far more difficult to detect the presence of incipient faults at very early stages...|$|R

In {{this thesis}} work, the {{electronic control system}} design and design method of a refrigerator that is supplied from PV panel have been studied. The designed system includes PV panel, accumulator and a compressor with a high efficiency BLDC (brushless DC) motor. For the system, motor has an input power of 100 W and the controlled speed range is 2200 – 3600 min- 1. Open-circuit voltage range for the PV panel is 15 – 50 V and design is suitable for both 12 V and 24 V accumulators. For such an application, {{it is necessary to}} use PV panel at the voltage and current that gives maximum power. Using MPPT algorithms, energy supplied from PV panel is transferred to the accumulator with maximum energy efficiency. Having high efficiency and being suitable for using in variable speed applications, BLDC motor was preferred at this study. A compressor {{is a part of the}} cooling system (compressor, evaporator, condenser etc.) and it is driven with the BLDC motor. This cooling system ensures the inside temperature of the refrigerator cabin as low as desired. A boost DC/DC converter that is supplied from the accumulator is used for adjusting the DC bus voltage at the input of 3 -phase motor inverter. The speed of the BLDC motor is controlled by adjusting the DC bus voltage. On the other hand, three phase motor inverter is used for <b>energizing</b> the <b>motor</b> phases at the right instances according to the rotor position information coming from sensorless position detection circuit. As a result, BLDC motor is controlled with six-step trapezoidal control method. Below are the criteria for the MPPT charger circuit design: • Flexibility in using(being compatible with various kind of accumulators and PV panels), • Successful MPPT operation during the whole day and all climate conditions, • Low electromagnetic radiation and low electrical noise, • Cost-effectiveness (single switch topologies were considered) Input impedance of buck-boost type DC/DC converters can be adjusted in range [0,&# 8734;) in continuous conduction mode. Consequently, regardless of the ratio between input voltage and output voltage of the converter, a successful MPPT operation can be done and converter can run the PV panel from open-circuit point to short-circuit point. Therefore, buck-boost type DC/DC converter topologies were considered for MPPT charger circuit. Classical buck-boost converter and Zeta converter has a controlled switch at the input side. Thus these converters have high input current ripple, harmonic and differential mode electromagnetic noise. On the other hand, &# 262;uk and SEPIC topologies are better in harmonic and noise performance because of the input inductor. In battery supplied systems, peak value of the battery charge current is crucial because high ripple current affects battery life and parasitic losses. Because of the output inductor, ripple of the battery charging current for &# 262;uk converter is low, whereas SEPIC converter has a discontinuous and high ripple output current because of the diode at the output. As a result, &# 262;uk converter is the best alternative among other single switch topologies for MPPT charger circuit. With the &# 262;uk MPPT charger an efficiency of 92, 04 % has been obtained. MPPT algorithms are used for obtaining maximum power from the panel that is available. At this thesis work, open circuit voltage method, perturb&observe method and incremental conductance method have been studied. There are various other MPPT algorithms in the literature. Open circuit (OC) voltage method adjusts panel voltage to a k multiple of open circuit voltage. But this method is satisfactory only certain conditions because maximum power point voltage depends on irradiance and ambient temperature. On the other hand, OC voltage method is a useful method to approach maximum power point rapidly after power-on. Perturb and observe (PO) algorithm is the method that the PV panel voltage or current is increased and decreased, the PV power is calculated at each time and the direction of change is reversed when the PV power decreases. As a result, PO algorithm is an algorithm of trial and error that the PV power works and oscillates around maximum power point. According to the incremental conductance algorithm maximum power point for the PV panel is located when the instantaneous conductance is equal to the negative value of incremental conductance. When instantaneous conductance is greater than negative of the incremental conductance, this means operating point is at the left of the MPPT point. Then, algorithm will decrease PV voltage. When instantaneous conductance is smaller than negative of the incremental conductance, this means operating point is at the right of the MPPT point. Then, algorithm will increase PV voltage. Incremental conductance algorithm is successful in rapidly varying irradiance conditions. However, it is not immune to noise, then noise reduction will be important in the implementation of this algorithm. At this thesis work, two implementations of MPPT algorithms have been done and MPPT efficiencies have been measured. MPPT efficiency is the ratio of generated PV output power to available PV power under test irradiance and temperature conditions. During MPPT tests, Chroma 62150 H 400 S DC power supply, which has solar panel simulation property, has been used. A model of Kyocera KC 85 T PV panel has been done and two parallel KC 85 T panel model has been used in MPPT efficiency tests. At the first implementation, OC method is used after first power-on and approach to maximum power point rapidly. Then, PO algorithm starts to work and find the MPPT point. At this first hybrid MPPT method an MPPT efficiency of 99 % has been obtained under constant 600 W/m 2 irradiance. At the second MPPT test, from 600 W/m 2 to 300 W/m 2 and from 300 W/m 2 to 600 W/m 2 a rapidly varying irradiance at each 5 second has been implemented. At this test, an MPPT efficiency of 96, 2 % has been obtained. At the second implementation, OC method is used after first power-on and approach to maximum power point rapidly. Then, IC algorithm starts to work and find the MPPT point. At this hybrid MPPT method an MPPT efficiency of 98, 5 % has been obtained under constant 600 W/m 2 irradiance. At the second MPPT test, from 600 W/m 2 to 300 W/m 2 and from 300 W/m 2 to 600 W/m 2 a rapidly varying irradiance at each 5 sec has been implemented. At this test, an MPPT efficiency of 96. 6 % has been obtained. A boost DC/DC converter is used for boosting 12 / 24 V accumulator voltage to 35 - 50 V. Peak current mode control has been used for the control of boost converter. An efficiency of 91. 41 % has been obtained for this boost converter with 100 W maximum output power. BLDC motors have generally three phase winding in the stator and they have permanent magnet in the rotor. Back-EMF voltages induced in phase windings are trapezoidal for BLDC motors. Brushed DC motors need frequent maintenance due to the arcs caused by brush-commutator structure and mechanical frictions. On the other hand, for BLDC motors commutation action is done electronically instead of mechanical brush-commutator action. Thus, BLDC motors do not require maintenance and do not have risk of arcs. Moreover, compressor contains oil for the protection of mechanical parts of the compressor; arcs that result from mechanical friction of brushes can ignite or cause fire. Therefore, BLDC motor was preferred for this thesis work. When two of the three phases of BLDC <b>motors</b> are <b>energized</b> consecutively, this <b>motor</b> model does not have a difference with simple brushed DC motor. To obtain maximum torque from BLDC motor and to drive efficiently each phase should be energized at the 120 electrical degrees part where the EMF is maximum. In a BLDC inverter there are six semiconductor switches that enable electronic commutation. In six step trapezoidal drive method there are six combinations for two of three <b>motor</b> phase winding <b>energizing.</b> At every 60 degrees two of three phases are energized and there will be a sequence of energizing according to the rotor position. If this action is done in the right sequence, motor runs at desired speed and torque. Speed control of the motor is done via adjusting the input DC bus voltage of the three phase inverter with a boost DC/DC converter, thus there is no need to a high frequency PWM operation in motor inverter. As a result, at the motor inverter, switching frequency of semiconductor switches is equal to the motor electrical commutation frequency. Therefore, switching losses of motor inverter transistors and parallel diode reverse recovery losses are very low. There is a relationship between motor EMF voltage and rotor’s mechanical position. Rotor position information is critical for six step trapezoidal drive. Thus, there are sensored and sensorless position detection methods for BLDC motors. There are various position detection sensors such as Hall effect sensors, optical sensors etc. that generate three sensor signals at the same phase and frequency of back EMF voltage. According to information coming from these sensors, <b>motor</b> inverter switches <b>energize</b> the <b>motor</b> windings. In sensorless position detection methods, by sensing the back EMF voltage on motor terminals, it is possible to detect rotor position without sensors. Generally, there are two kinds of sensorless position detection methods. At the first method, zero crossing points of the back EMF voltages are detected and delayed digitally. As the commutation point has a phase difference of 30 degrees with respect to zero crossing point, commutation signals can be determined with digital delay. At the second type of sensorless methods, phase voltages are filtered first and delayed after filtering. Delaying and/or filtering is done in such a manner that the result exactly gives the commutation point when they are compared to each other or compared with the neutral point. The sensorless position detection method used in this thesis work is belonging to the second group. In this method, delay time is adjusted according to the rotating speed and motor phase voltages are compared to each other. As a result, method gives three position signals that have the same electrical frequency with the back EMF voltage. Square wave position detection signals have a phase difference of 120 degrees to each other and they have 180 degrees on time. Magnitude of back EMF voltage has a linear relationship with the motor speed. Thus, at low speeds motor back EMF voltages are small and not enough to give correct commutation instant. Sensorless motor control methods are not able to detect motor position at low speeds. Then, sensorless position detection algorithms work as follows: firstly, rotor is aligned to a known position. Secondly, during free run interval, <b>motor</b> phases are <b>energized</b> according to six step trapezoidal drive for predetermined time intervals in an open loop manner. After this open loop interval, closed loop sensorless position detection algorithm starts to work and all commutation is done according to the position signals coming from sensorless position detection circuit. As a result, BLDC motor control has three steps: align, free run, closed loop operation. With the stated sensorless position detection and motor control method, motor speed control and drive has been done and motor speed has been regulated to desired reference between 2200 - 3600 min- 1 speed interval.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel scheme for speed regulation/tracking of Switched Reluctance (SR) motors based on Higher-Order Sliding-Mode technique. In particular, a Second-Order Sliding-Mode Controller (SOSMC) based on Super Twisting algorithm is developed. Owing to the peculiar structural properties of SRM, torque produced by each motor phase {{is a function}} of phase current as well as rotor position. More importantly, unlike many other motors the polarity of the phase torque in SR motors is solely determined by the rotor position and is independent of the polarity of the applied voltage or phase current. SR motor needs an electronic commutation scheme for its operation. So design of commutation scheme {{plays an important role in}} motor efficiency and performance. This commutation scheme is embedded in its power supply as switching timers. The existing commutation schemes cause high power loss and based on those commutation schemes, the existing controller techniques for SR motor show low robustness especially when motorâ€™s parameters change. Therefore a new commutation scheme is developed which optimizes power consumption in motor phases. On the bases of this commutation scheme, a new controller technique is used to design controller for SR motor which is highly efficient, simple to design and easy to implement and also provides sufficient robustness against parameter variations and unknown disturbances. The proposed controllers take advantage of this property and incorporate a commutation scheme which, at any time instant, selects to <b>energize</b> only those <b>motor</b> phases for the computation of control law, which can contribute torque of the desired polarity at that instant. This feature helps in achieving the desired speed regulation/tracking objective in a power efficient manner as control efforts are applied through selective phases and phases producing the torque of opposite polarity are kept switched off. This approach also minimizes the power loss in the motor windings reducing the heat generation within the motor. The common techniques for designing the SR Motor controls are fuzzy logic control, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and feedback linearization. Fuzzy logic control provides sufficient robustness against parameter variations but at a high computational cost. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) shows good dynamic response against unknown disturbances but problem in using this technique is requirement of a large training data set. In the feedback linearization technique, nonlinear control problem is transformed into linear control problem and then any one of the well established and mature linear controller techniques are applied on the resulting system. Feedback linearization cannot be applied to all types of nonlinear systems; and in case of parameters uncertainties, the robustness cannot be guaranteed. All the deficiencies in discussed techniques can be overcome by introducing sliding mode control which is simple, easy to implement and provides robustness. The inherent problem of chattering in classical FOSMC can further be improved by using higher order sliding mode control (HOSMC). In order to highlight the advantages of Higher-Order Sliding-Mode controller, a classical First-Order Sliding-Mode controller (FOSMC) is also developed and applied to the same system. The comparison of the two schemes shows much reduced chattering and low power consumption in case of SOSMC. This feature is especially very important for SR motor control, due to reduced chattering; wear and tear problem of actuators is reduced. The responses of synthesized controllers are also investigated against changes in moment of inertia which could be due to engagement of load; stator phase resistance which could vary due to temperature variations in winding during operation and coefficient of viscous friction as a model uncertainty. The performance of the proposed SOSMC controller for speed regulation is also compared with that of another sliding mode speed controller published in the literature and also with dynamic sliding mode controller. The same technique is also applied on position control problem and, FOSMC and SOSMC are developed for position regulation problem; making it possible candidate for servo drive application...|$|R
