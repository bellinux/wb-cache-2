5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, <b>employed</b> <b>a</b> staff of almost 200; the smallest may only {{have had a}} porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E

The team lined up in a 4–4–1–1 formation.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} in English {{cities in the}} Middle Ages, Canterbury <b>employed</b> <b>a</b> town band known as the Waits.

Waits were eventually abolished nationally by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. A modern early music group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the Acurad system <b>employed</b> <b>a</b> {{patented}} double shot piston design. The {{idea was}} to use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
