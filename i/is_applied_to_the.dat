5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|Because it hardens {{platinum}} and palladium alloys, ruthenium is used {{in electrical}} contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability. With similar properties and lower cost than rhodium, electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium. The plate <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base by electroplating or sputtering.|$|E

5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E
5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> glans penis {{to trigger a}} reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly {{due to differences in}} vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E

5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E

Videos are iteratively reviewed with probe questions designed to target underlying cognitive, psychomotor, and perceptual skill components, as well as skill integration in the form of knowledge concepts that can <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> training system student model. Probe questions can also be designed to target training requirements, performance metrics, and scenario requirements <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resulting system design.|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} d'Hondt formula <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vote (except for {{the twelfth}} constituency in which national minority representatives are elected), with a five-percent election threshold in each constituency. Since 2015, the parliamentary elections have {{an element of}} preferential voting by letting voters choose not only {{for a list of}} candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E
5|$|The {{travel times}} {{are not the}} same, which should be {{indicated}} by an interference shift. However, if Fresnel's dragging coefficient <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water in the aether frame, the travel time difference (to first order in v/c) vanishes. Using different setups Hoek actually obtained a null result, confirming Fresnel's dragging coefficient. (For a similar experiment refuting the possibility of shielding the aether wind, see Hammar experiment).|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure that}} there are enough signal {{transitions}} for clock recovery {{to occur in the}} bitstream, a bit stuffing technique <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> data stream: an extra 0bit is insert into the data stream after any occurrence of six consecutive 1bits. (Thus ensuring that there is a 0bit to cause a transmission state transition.) Seven consecutively received 1bits are always an error. For USB3.0, additional data transmission encoding is used to handle the higher data rates required.|$|E

5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E
