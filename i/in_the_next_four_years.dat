5|$|King John enjoyed regular {{hunting in}} the Forest each November, and used St Briavels Castle as his base for such trips. The king entertained the Welsh lord Gruffyd ap Cadwallon at the castle in 1207. This royal {{interest}} resulted in further building works and substantial expenditure, with £291 being spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years.</b> A stone curtain wall replaced an earlier wooden one between 1209–11, complete with a tower and gateway. Inside the bailey a number of buildings suitable {{for use by the}} king as a lodge were constructed. A wooden chapel was built within the castle in 1236–7. The castle expansion may have been funded by the increased taxes from iron-working across the areas, {{and by the end of}} John's reign, the castle was almost in its mature form.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.|$|E
5|$|Following {{these deaths}} Lie {{was unable to}} support his wife. He {{therefore}} sold his school to Oey Kim Hoat and left his position at Zending Press {{to take a job}} as a land surveyor. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> he held various jobs. In 1881 Oey Pek Nio gave birth again. She died soon afterwards and the baby was sent to live with her grandfather father in Gadog, a village to the southeast of Buitenzorg, to be raised. The child died in 1886. Lie published his first books in 1884. Two of these, Kitab Edja and Sobat Anak-Anak, were published by Zending Press. The former was a study book to help students learn to write Malay, while the latter was a collection of stories for children that Aprinus Salam of Gadjah Mada University credits as the first work of popular literature in the Indies. The other two books were published by W. Bruining&Co., based in the colonial capital at Batavia (now Jakarta). One of these, Malajoe Batawi, was a grammar of Malay intended to standardise the language's spelling. The other was the four-volume syair (a traditional Malay form of poetry) Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari; this book, dealing with a gender-disguised warrior who conquers the Sultanate of Hindustan to save her husband, became one of Lie's best-known works.|$|E

25|$|In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach {{patented}} {{the first}} of their engines fueled by ligroin. This engine was patented on December 16, 1883. It achieved Daimler's goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm. Improved designs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> brought that up to 900 rpm. Daimler had three engines built to this design early in 1884, and a flywheel was included {{in one of the}} engines. This design was smaller and lighter than engines by other inventors of the time. Daimler relied on hot tube ignition, until 1897, when he adopted the electrical ignition designed by Bosch.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{population}} decline {{continued to}} slow through 2008—2012 due to declining death rates and increasing birth rates.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> {{the focus}} of the war shifted to the south of the Balkan mountains. Ivan Asen's {{strategy}} of swiftly striking in different locations paid off, and he soon took control of the important cities Sofia and Niš to the south-west, clearing the way to Macedonia. In 1194, the Byzantines gathered a huge force composed of the eastern and western armies, but were defeated at the Battle of Arcadiopolis. Unable to resist, Isaac II tried to ally with the Hungarian king Béla III and make a joint attack against Bulgaria, but was deposed and blinded by his brother Alexios III Angelos. The Byzantines tried to negotiate peace but Ivan Asen demanded the return of all Bulgarian lands and the war continued. In 1196, the Byzantine army was again defeated at Serres, far to the south. Upon his return to Tarnovo, Ivan Asen was murdered by his cousin Ivanko in a plot inspired by Constantinople. Peter IV besieged Tarnovo and Ivanko fled to the Byzantine Empire, where he was made governor of Philippopolis. Peter IV was murdered {{less than a year after}} his brother's death.|$|E

She personally donated £2,000 (equivalent to about £ in 2016 terms) to the British Relief Association, more than any other individual famine relief donor, and also supported the Maynooth Grant to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland, despite Protestant opposition. The story that she donated only £5 in aid to the Irish, and on the same day gave the same amount to Battersea Dogs Home, was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century.|$|E
