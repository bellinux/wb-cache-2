An available computer tool was used to aid in an objective and efficient quantification <b>of</b> fissure <b>integrity.</b> <b>The</b> correlations between fissure integrity, and pulmonary functions (e. g., FEV 1, and FEV 1 /FVC) and COPD severity were assessed using Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients, respectively.
