The trail used to traverse many <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> private property; currently 99% of the trail is on public land.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. <b>Hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
25|$|Sa Pa {{is now in}} full {{economic}} boom, {{mainly from}} the thousands of tourists who come every year to walk the <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> trekking trails between and around the villages of Dao villages of Ta Van and Ta Phin.|$|E

25|$|BST {{is used on}} <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> the Alaska Highway {{and other}} similar roadways in Alaska, the Yukon Territory, and {{northern}} British Columbia. The ease of application of BST is one reason for its popularity, but another is its flexibility, which is important when roadways are laid down over unstable terrain that thaws and softens in the spring.|$|E
25|$|FCHQ and Group Control centres, {{in keeping}} with their {{importance}} in the battle, were located in bomb-proof bunkers away from airfields. Most of these were built just before the war. Communications were ensured by <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> dedicated phone lines laid by the GPO and buried deep underground {{to prevent them from}} being cut by bombs.|$|E
25|$|A new era for National Parkways {{began with}} {{authorization}} of the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways during the 1930s. These were not fairly short county or metropolitan parkways serving {{a variety of}} local and national traffic but protected recreational roadways traversing <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> scenic and historic rural landscape. These different National Parkways started out as public works projects during the New Deal and were transformed into units of the National Park System.|$|E

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1901, Gerlinger {{purchased}} 7000 acre of timber in Polk County, Oregon for a railroad. Just west of Dallas, Oregon, in the Oregon Coast Range, grew <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> square <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> untouched Douglas fir and other commercial timber species.|$|R
25|$|In the {{judgement}} of one urban historian, 'Johnson was {{a superb}} municipal technician. He grasped {{not only the}} ethics but the mathematics of government'. The new administration paved <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> streets and expanded the city's park system, building {{a large number of}} playgrounds, ball fields and other facilities. To popular acclaim, the mayor tore up all the 'Keep off the Grass' signs in the city parks, a symbol of his belief in changing parklands' role from passive to active recreation.|$|E
25|$|The New York City Fire Department faces highly {{multifaceted}} firefighting {{challenges in}} many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise structures, there are many secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires. New York {{is also home to}} one of the largest subway systems in the world, consisting of <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> tunnel with electrified track.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of this}} project, {{the known}} mineral and {{potential}} oil and gas deposits in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago were considered for development. Shipping the products {{proved to be an}} enormous problem; the sea lanes were ice-free for only a few months a year, and building a railhead to even the closest suitable shore point would still require <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> rail to be laid over tundra. A pipeline would have to cross both land and water, and was likewise considered extremely difficult to build.|$|E
5000|$|Because basalt has a {{tendency}} to fracture at abrupt angles, topographic features made of basalt often have a [...] "postpile" [...] appearance.

25|$|Four paved {{highways}} {{connect the}} city to the national highway system. Running north from the Farol (lighthouse) de Itapoã are <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> wonderful beaches. These beaches are accessible via the BA-099 Highway or (Line of Coconut and Green Line), a (toll) road, kept in excellent condition, running parallel to the coast, with access roads leading off to the coast itself. The road runs along dunes of snow-white sand, and the coast itself is an almost unbroken line of coconut palms. The communities along this coast range from fishing villages to Praia do Forte.|$|E
25|$|The {{railway network}} in the Chinese provinces {{bordering}} North Vietnam was of vital importance in importing war material. American rules of engagement forbid strikes against this network for fear of provoking Chinese intervention. Thousands of Chinese troops (the PLA's 1st and 2nd Divisions) made important contributions to Hanoi's war effort- building or repairing <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> track and numerous other facilities such as bridges, tunnels, stations and marshaling yards. Chinese troops also built bunkers and other fortifications, and manned dozens of anti-aircraft batteries. In all, some 320,000 Chinese soldiers served in Vietnam during the war.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} an {{modernization}} of the upstream logistics. A breakthrough occurred when it was established that lumber {{did not have to}} be air-dried for two years before being made to pulp, freeing up a storage site at Veden which had stored up to one million logs. Trucks were introduced in transport and hundreds of kilometers (<b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles)</b> <b>of</b> lumber roads were built to ease extraction. For instance they were used to truck lumber from Store Le to Øymarkasjøen, thus closing the Otteeid Canal. Increased lumber demand was covered through procurement from Värmland and the Glomma watershed. Log driving was eliminated on tributaries and limited to the main course of Haldenvassdraget.|$|E

The company still operates <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> square <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> forest in Namdalen, {{as well as several}} hydroelectric power stations.|$|R
5000|$|Triassic climates {{progressively}} became dryer, {{prompting the}} formation of sand dunes that buried dry stream beds and their flood plain. This sand became the cliff-forming several hundred feet (many tens of meters) high and red-colored Windgate Sandstone. Outcrops tend to run for <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> (<b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> kilometers) with few breaks, creating an impediment to human travel.|$|R

He called the islands Más Afuera, Más a Tierra, and Santa Clara.|$|R
25|$|In winter, {{a variety}} of sports are enjoyed by the locals which also draw {{visitors}} to Northern Michigan. Snowmobiling, also called sledding, is popular, and with <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> interconnected groomed trails cross the region. Ice fishing is also popular. Tip-up Town on Houghton Lake is a major ice-fishing, snowmobiling and winter sports festival, and is unique {{in that it is}} a village that assembles out on the frozen lake surface. Higgins Lake also offers good ice fishing and has many snowmobiling, cross country skiing, and snowshoeing trails at the North Higgins Lake State Park. Grayling and Gaylord and their environs are recognized for Nordic skiing. Cadillac is reputed to be even more popular during the winter {{than it is in the}} summer.|$|E
25|$|Of {{primary concern}} {{with respect to}} the Hayward Fault is the huge Chevron Richmond Refinery in Richmond. Although founded on better ground than most of the shoreline, this {{refinery}} has extensive crude oil and finished product docks and pipelines extending into the bay, which could produce catastrophic spills into the bay, with the potential to adversely affect <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> sensitive wetlands. Dismantling of high pressure and temperature process units and the consequent fire danger to personnel and equipment could produce substantial economic consequences for the western states. Large liquid storage tanks are protected by berms that are designed to contain the contents should a tank fail under normal conditions. Similar process and product conditions exist at other refineries further inland near Martinez, but mostly these plants are exposed to earthquakes from other faults.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of August 20, 1969, the {{headwaters}} of the Tye River were near ground zero during one of the worst natural disasters in Virginia history. A few days earlier, Hurricane Camille had come ashore on the Gulf Coast near the mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category 5 storm, one of only three to strike the US mainland during the 20th century. The hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of Mississippi, and caused additional flooding and deaths inland. The storm had lost strength as it crossed <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> land, and was downgraded by the National Weather Service to tropical storm status as it moved northward along {{the eastern side of the}} Appalachian Mountains and into Virginia. It still carried incredible amounts of moisture and contained sufficient strength and low pressure to pull in additional moisture.|$|E
