40|$|We {{describe}} the complex global structure of giant components in <b>directed</b> <b>multiplex</b> networks which generalizes the well-known bow-tie structure, generic for ordinary directed networks. By definition, a <b>directed</b> <b>multiplex</b> network contains vertices of one type and directed edges of $m$ different types. In <b>directed</b> <b>multiplex</b> networks, we distinguish {{a set of}} different giant components based {{on the existence of}} directed paths of different types between their vertices, such that for each type of edges, the paths run entirely through only edges of that type. If, in particular, $m= 2 $, we define a strongly viable component as a set of vertices, in which for each type of edges, each two vertices are interconnected by at least two directed paths in both directions, running through the edges of only this type. We show that in this case, a <b>directed</b> <b>multiplex</b> network contains, in total, $ 9 $ different giant components including the strongly viable component. In general, the total number of giant components is $ 3 ^m$. For uncorrelated <b>directed</b> <b>multiplex</b> networks, we obtain exactly the size and the emergence point of the strongly viable component and estimate the sizes of other giant components.

40|$|A nested {{multiplex}} PCR {{was developed}} as a rapid (< 12 h), sensitive test for the simultaneous identification of equine herpesviruses (EHV 1, EHV 4, EHV 2 and EHV 5) in clinical samples from horses. Peripheral blood and nasal swab (NS) samples from 205 weanling Thoroughbred foals on 6 different studs over 3 consecutive seasons and from 92 adult horses without clinical signs of respiratory disease were examined using <b>direct</b> <b>multiplex</b> PCR of clinical samples (direct PCR) and conventional cell culture with differentiation of EHV in cell cultures by multiplex PCR. Multiplex PCR proved a sensitive and specific technique {{for the detection of}} EHV in cell culture and clinical samples. The technique described appeared equally sensitive as one using a single set of primers for individual EHV but reduced labour and reagent costs. Cell cultures showing cytopathic effect (CPE) were always positive for EHV on PCR. EHV were also detected by multiplex PCR in 11 samples which failed to show CPE. By a combination of multiplex PCR and cell culture or <b>direct</b> <b>multiplex</b> PCR, the presence of up to three EHV in the same sample was detected. Overall, EHV 5 was detected by <b>direct</b> <b>multiplex</b> PCR of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or NS samples from 78 % of foals and 47 % of adult horses. Repeated sampling or cell culture in combination with multiplex PCR and with the incorporation of IL- 2 in culture medium increased the sensitivity for detection of EHV in PBMC and demonstrated that EHV 5 DNA could be identified in PBMC from 89 % of foals and 100 % of adult horses. EHV 2 was identified from approximately 30 % of foals, but was more frequently identified in samples from 17 foals with mild respiratory disease and was isolated infrequently from adult horses.

Fast and accurate identification of staphylococci and confirmation of their methicillin resistance are crucial for immediate treatment with effective antibiotics. A multiplex real-time PCR assay that targets mecA, femA specific for S. aureus, femA specific for S. epidermidis, 16 S rRNA for universal bacteria, and 16 S rRNA specific for staphylococci was developed and evaluated with 290 clinical blood culture samples containing Gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCC). For the 262 blood cultures identified to the species level with the MicroScan WalkAway system (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, USA), the direct real-time PCR assay of positive blood cultures showed very good agreement for the categorization of staphylococci into methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant non-S. epidermidis CoNS (MRCoNS), and methicillin-susceptible non-S. epidermidis CoNS (MSCoNS) (κ= 0. 9313).

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} hydrogel DNA microarray {{is developed}} {{to overcome the}} limitations of conventional planar microarrays such as low sensitivity, long overnight hybridization time, lack of a melting verification of proper hybrid, and complicated sample preparation process for genotyping of clinical samples. Unlike our previous prototype hydrogel array which can analyze only single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) targets, the device {{is the first of}} its type to allow <b>direct</b> <b>multiplexed</b> single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection of human clinical samples comprising double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). This advance is made possible by incorporating a streptavidin (SA) hydrogel capture/purification element in a double T-junction {{at the start of the}} linear hydrogel array structure and fabricating ten different probe DNAs-entrapped hydrogels in microfluidic channels. The purified or unpurified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products labeled with a fluorophore and a biotin are electrophoresed through the SA hydrogel for binding and purification. After electrophoretic washing, the fluorophore-labeled DNA strand is then thermally released for hybridization capture by its complementary probe gel element. We demonstrate the precise and rapid discrimination of the genotypes of five different clinical targets by melting curve analysis based on temperature-gradient electrophoresis within 3 h, which is at least 3 -fold decrease in incubation time compared to conventional microarrays.

Moreover, the presence of organic matter and bacteria of different origin can favor gene transfer and recombination. Whereas the consequences of such activities on environmental microbiota are well explored, little is known of their effects on allochthonous and potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as enterococci. Sediments from three sampling stations (two inside and one outside) collected in a fish farm in the Adriatic Sea were examined for enterococcal abundance and antibiotic resistance traits using the membrane filter technique and an improved quantitative PCR.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the study of {{multi-layer}} complex networks has received significant attention. In this work, we provide new measures to analyse dependencies between directed links in different layers of multiplex networks. We show that this requires more than a straightforward extension of the corresponding multiplexity measures {{that have been developed}} for undirected multiplexes. In particular, one should take into account the effects of reciprocity, i. e. the tendency of pairs of vertices to establish mutual connections. It is well known that reciprocity is a crucial property of many directed single-layer networks, affecting several dynamical processes taking place on such systems. Here we extend this quantity to <b>directed</b> <b>multiplexes</b> and introduce the notion of multireciprocity, defined as the tendency of links in one layer to be reciprocated by links in a different layer. We introduce multireciprocity measures valid for both binary and weighted networks and then validate these novel quantities on the World Trade Multiplex (WTM), representing the import-export bilateral relations between world countries in different commodities. We show that several pairs of layers exhibit strong multiplexity, an effect which can however be largely encoded into the degree or strength sequences of the various layers. Moreover, we find that most of the pairs of commodities are characterised by positive multireciprocities, even though such values are significantly lower than the usual reciprocity measured on the aggregated network. These results confirm that a multiplex approach to the phenomenon of reciprocity conveys much more information than the analysis of the aggregated network does. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hearing loss is {{the most}} common sensory deficit in humans, {{affecting}} approximately 10 % of the global population. In developed countries, one in every 500 individuals suffers from severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. For those up to 5 years old, the proportion is higher, at 2. 7 in 1000 individuals, and for adolescents the average is 3. 5 in 1000. Among the causes of hearing loss, more than 50 % are related to genetic factors. To date, nearly 150 loci and 64 genes have been associated with hearing loss. Mutations in the GJB 2 gene, which encodes connexin 26, constitute the main genetic cause. So far, more than 300 variations have been described in this gene. As a response to the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss and the importance of correct molecular diagnosis of individuals with hereditary hearing loss, this study worked in the optimization for a diagnostic protocol employing a high-throughput genotyping technology. Methods: For this work, was used the TaqMan (R) OpenArray (TM) Genotyping platform. This is a high performance, high-throughput technology based on real-time PCR, which enables the evaluation of up to 3072 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), point mutations, small deletions, and insertions, using a single genotyping plate. For the study, were selected the layout allowing to analyze 32 alterations in 96 individuals simultaneously. In the end, the generated results were validated by conventional techniques, as <b>direct</b> sequencing, <b>Multiplex</b> PCR and RFLP-PCR. Results: A total of 376 individuals were analyzed, of which 94 were healthy controls, totaling 4 plates in duplicate. All 31 of the changes analyzed were present in the nuclear genes GJB 2, GJB 6, CRYL 1, TMC 1, SLC 26 A 4, miR- 96, and OTOF, and in the mitochondrial genes MT-RNR 1 and MT-TS 1. The reactions were subsequently validated by established techniques (<b>direct</b> sequencing, <b>multiplex</b> PCR, and RFLP-PCR) that had previously been used to perform molecular screening of hearing loss at the Human Genetics Laboratory of the Center for Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering (CBMEG), at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).

A total of 34 probands carried a mutant PROS 1 allele, compared to one proband in cohort 2 (P < 10 (- 10)). The proband's mutation was identified in all type I, but only in 57 % of type III PS deficient relatives. MLPA-analysis in the mutation negative families did not reveal PROS 1 deletions or insertions. Linkage analysis in 16 families showed cosegregation of PROS 1 markers in the family with type I deficiency, but not in the 15 families with type III deficiency. The genotype-phenotype associations point to differences in genetic architecture. Whereas PS deficiency type I is a monogenic disease due to PROS 1 allelic heterozygosity, PS deficiency type III is most likely a more complex or heterogeneous disorder...|$|R

An ideal assay platform would allow multiplex type-specific detection with minimal sample requirement. We used the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) electrochemiluminescence based detection platform to develop a <b>multiplex</b> <b>direct</b> virus-like particle (VLP) ELISA to detect antibodies to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 with a protocol developed for detection using the SI 6000 imager (M 4 ELISA). MSD prepared the plates in the 7 -spot/well format, using the purified VLPs (4 spots) and PBS+BSA pH 7. 4 (3 blank spots). Three-point titrations and the parallel line method were used to calculate antibody levels. Dynamic range, precision, and stability of pre-printed plates were determined using a panel of previously characterized sera. Cut-off values using children's sera were established using 99...|$|R
40|$|While microarrays hold {{considerable}} {{promise in}} large-scale biology {{on account of}} their massively parallel analytical nature, {{there is a need}} for compatible signal amplification procedures to increase sensitivity without loss of multiplexing. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is a molecular amplification method with the unique property of product localization. This report describes the application of RCA signal amplification for <b>multiplexed,</b> <b>direct</b> detection and quantitation of nucleic acid targets on planar glass and gel-coated microarrays. As few as 150 molecules bound to the surface of microarrays can be detected using RCA. Because of the linear kinetics of RCA, nucleic acid target molecules may be measured with a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. Consequently, RCA is a promising technology for the direct measurement of nucleic acids on microarrays without the need for a potentially biasing preamplification step...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{cavernous}} malformations (CCMs) are vascular abnormalities {{that may}} cause seizures, intracerebral haemorrhages, and focal neurological deficits. Familial form shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable clinical expression. Three genes {{have been identified}} causing familial CCM: KRIT 1 /CCM 1, MGC 4607 / CCM 2, and PDCD 10 /CCM 3. Aim {{of this study is}} to report additional PDCD 10 /CCM 3 families poorly described so far which account for 10 - 15 % of hereditary cerebral cavernous malformations. Our group investigated 87 consecutive Italian affected individuals (i. e. positive Magnetic Resonance Imaging) with multiple/familial CCM through <b>direct</b> sequencing and <b>Multiplex</b> Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) analysis. We identified mutations in over 97. 7 % of cases, and PDCD 10 / CCM 3 accounts for 13. 1 %. PDCD 10 /CCM 3 molecular screening revealed four already known mutations and four novel ones...|$|R
40|$|Background. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} caused by loss-of-function mutations in a {{tumor suppressor gene}} (NF 1) which codifies the protein neurofibromin. The frequent genetic alterations that modify neurofibromin function are deletions and insertions. Duplications are rare and phenotype in patients bearing duplication of NF 1 gene {{is thought to be}} restricted to developmental abnormalities, with no reference to cancer susceptibility in these patients. We evaluated a patient who presented with few clinical signs of neurofibromatosis type 1 and a conspicuous personal and familiar history of different types of cancer, especially lymphoproliferative malignancies. The coding region of the NF- 1 gene was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and <b>direct</b> sequencing. <b>Multiplex</b> ligation-dependent probe amplification was performed to detect the number of mutant copies. The NF 1 gene analysis showed the following alterations: mosaic duplication of NF 1, TRAF 4, and MYO 1 D. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using probes (RP 5 - 1002 G 3 and RP 5 - 92689) flanking NF 1 gene in 17 q 11. 2 and CEP 17 for 17 q 11. 11. 1 was performed. There were three signals (RP 5 - 1002 G 3 conRP 5 - 92689) in the interphases analyzed and two signals (RP 5 - 1002 G 3 conRP 5 - 92689) in 93 % of cells. These findings show a tandem duplication of 17 q 11. 2. Conclusion. The case suggests the possibility that NF 1 gene duplication may be associated with a phenotype characterized by lymphoproliferative disorders...|$|R
40|$|Silicon -on -insulator (SOI) optical {{microring}} resonators fabricated {{with the}} standard CMOS fabrication technology have recently gained considerable attention for energy efficient, compact and low cost biomedical and environmental sensing applications. High sensitivity to the surrounding refractive index variations, high compactness, <b>direct</b> wavelength <b>multiplexing</b> capabilities, simplicity, and the promise for mass fabrication are among the interesting features supported by SOI microring resonators. On the other hand, despite the strong case for microring resonators for sensing, there exist some issues which {{need to be addressed}} in order to ensure the feasibility of such sensors. One major limitation currently is the cost of optical sources and /or spectrum analyzers required to drive and interrogate these sensors. Either expensive light sources or spectrum analyzers are usually used with sensors built around microring resonators. An attractive approach to address this problem is the use of on-chip spectrometers along with cheap broadband light sources. We experimentally demonstrate on-chip interrogation of an SOI microring resonator based gas sensor with a compact Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) spectrometer. We have designed and fabricated a 200 GHz AWG with strongly overlapping output channels, and used it to interrogate the wavelength shift from a ring resonator based ethanol vapor sensor on the same chip. Ethanol vapor concentrations in 100 - 1000 ppm range are readily detected by monitoring the intensity ratio between two adjacent AWG channels to which the microring resonance overlaps. Such an integrated sensor-interrogator approach is presented {{as an alternative to the}} current costly and off-chip read-out systems used for ring resonator based sensors...|$|R
