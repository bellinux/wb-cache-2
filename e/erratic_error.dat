40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} the need for occupational hygiene professionals to require evidence {{of the quality of}} welding fume data from analytical laboratories. The measurement of metals in welding fume using atomic spectrometric techniques is a complex analysis often requiring spe-cialist digestion procedures. The results from a trial programme testing the proficiency of lab-oratories in the Workplace Analysis Scheme for Proficiency (WASP) to measure potentially harmful metals in several different types of welding fume showed that most laboratories under-estimated the mass of analyte on the filters. The average recovery was 70 – 80 % of the target value and> 20 % of reported recoveries for some of the more difficult welding fume matrices were < 50 %. This level of under-reporting has significant implications for any health or hygiene studies of the exposure of welders to toxic metals for the types of fumes included in this study. Good laboratories ’ performance measuring spiked WASP filter samples containing soluble metal salts did not guarantee good performance when measuring the more complex welding fume trial filter samples. Consistent rather than <b>erratic</b> <b>error</b> predominated, suggesting that the main analytical factor contributing to the differences between the target values and results was the effectiveness of the sample preparation procedures used by participating laboratories. It is concluded that, with practice and regular participation in WASP, performance can im-prove over time...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for the routine determination of specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in serum and milk samples. The procedures include standardized extraction, cleanup and quantitation by high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) and comprehensive quality assurance program to minimize systematic and <b>erratic</b> <b>errors.</b> The analyses of 68 PCB congeners and three pesticides, p,p'-dichloro diphenyl dichloro ethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and Mirex, at part-per-billion levels include {{the addition of}} surrogate congener standards (IUPAC isomers # 46 and # 142), extraction with hexane after protein precipitation, cleanup with Florisil, and analysis by GC with capillary column and electron capture detection. Quantitation is based on calibration standards and response factors using isomers # 30 and # 204 as internal standards. The quality control activities consist of analyses of samples in batches of 6 to 10 simultaneously with quality control (QC) samples. The quality assurance program checks that the procedures are under control {{by the use of}} control charts and set the criteria for data acceptability. The detection limits for the congeners and pesticides associated with the analyses of 500 serum samples and of 100 milk samples are reported. In addition, typical profiles of congener distribution in both matrices are illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Deeply scaled CMOS {{circuits}} {{are increasingly}} sus-ceptible to transient faults and soft errors; emerging post-CMOS devices {{can be more}} vulnerable, sometimes exhibiting <b>erratic</b> <b>errors</b> of arbitrary duration. Applying timing and supply voltage margin is wasteful and becoming ineffective, and conventional checking and sparing techniques provide only a limited error coverage against widely varying errors. We propose a confidence-driven computing (CDC) model for an adaptive protection against nondeterministic errors. The CDC model employs fine-grained temporal redundancy and confidence checking for a faster adaptation and tunable reliability. The CDC model can be extended to deeply scaled CMOS circuits that are mainly affected by transient faults and soft errors, where an early checking (EC) technique {{can be used to}} perform independent error checking for more flexibility and better performance. To evaluate the CDC model, we apply a sample-based field-programmable gate array emulation along with real-time error injection. The CDC model is shown to adapt to fluctuating error rates and enhance the system reliability by effectively trading off performance. To evaluate the EC technique at a finer time scale, we create a new event-based simulation to capture path delay distribution, error model, and their interactions. The EC technique improves the system reliability by more than four orders of magnitude when errors are of short duration. Both the CDC model and the EC technique are synthesized in a 45 -nm CMOS technology for cost estimates: 1) the area overhead is as low as 12 % and 2) energy overhead can be limited to 19 %.

40|$|Abstract—Probabilistic {{applications}} such as data mining, image recognition and case synthesis (often referred to as Recognition, Mining and Synthesis or RMS), constitute a class of emerging applications expected to drive future demand for computational capacity. This paper describes the design and prototyping of a low-cost Error-Resilient System Architecture (ERSA), specifically targeted for these applications, featuring a combination of cheap, unreliable compute power together with {{a small fraction of}} reliable processor cores for running system software, controlling application flow, and recovering from errors generated on unreliable cores. ERSA enables economical system designs that are resilient to very high error rates, beyond current radiationinduced soft error levels, caused by highly frequent <b>erratic</b> intermittent <b>errors,</b> process variations and transistor aging. Experimental results on a prototype system with representative probabilistic computation applications show that this architecture is resilient to error rates on the order of trillion-plus failures-intime (FITs, defined as the number of failures in 10 9 hours), while still delivering robust results with competitive performance...|$|R

Taddle Creek has emphasized the importance of grammar and proofreading in a number of ways. For example Taddle Creek has taken a firm but humorous stand against the <b>erratic</b> and <b>error</b> filled ways modern writers use apostrophes. It encouraged its readers to join in a letter writing campaign to inform misusers of apostrophes of the error of their ways. At another date it published all the errors it had ever made in a series of entertainingly [...] "absurd" [...] online error messages. Despite the lighthearted approach Tobias calls the error page a [...] "serious business" [...] and intends to report any new errors that slip through. [...] The magazine has even offered free two year subscriptions to any readers that discover new errors. It has also published a reference book calledThe Taddle Creek Guidebook to Fact-Checking Fiction that aims to help writers avoid anachronisms and other factual errors.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} describes various data {{problems and}} procedures {{for the treatment of}} merchandise trade. Preparation of bilateral merchandise trade for the GTAP 7 Data Base involves different approaches for confronting multiple challenges. Although wide discrepancies in reported bilateral trade flows are not a new problem, some of the largest discrepancies in bilateral trade are the result of re-export activity. With China now playing a more prominent role in world trade there are growing complexities because of indirect trade. Indirect trade is not permitted in the GTAP Data Base and it must be dealt with. Most methods for reconciling trade flows have generally not worked well for China and its trading partners because of the intermediary role of Hong Kong in China’s external trade. Nearly every country is a trading partner of China directly or indirectly, including China itself. 1 Transshipment activity presents one of the most complex and growing problems, not just for China and Hong Kong, but for reconciling global bilateral trade flows. 2 Ideally, a single-global approach would provide the most consistent means for simultaneously redirecting trade flows and resolving bilateral discrepancies for all countries. However, data availability and irregularities in reporting practices for different countries make this difficult. Furthermore, large and <b>erratic</b> reporting <b>errors</b> prevent estimation of statistica...|$|R
40|$|Call-by-push-value (CBPV) {{is a new}} {{programming}} language paradigm, based on the slogan “a value is, a computation does”. We claim that CBPV provides the semantic primitives from which the call-by-value and call-by-name paradigms are built. The primary goal of the thesis is to present the evidence for this claim, which is found in a remarkably wide range of semantics: from operational semantics, in big-step form and in machine form, to denotational models using domains, possible worlds, continuations and games. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we come to CBPV and its equational theory by looking critically at the call-by-value and call-by-name paradigms in the presence of general computational effects. We give a Felleisen/Friedman-style CK-machine semantics, which explains how CBPV can be understood in terms of push/pop instructions. In the second part we give simple CBPV models for printing, divergence, global store, <b>errors,</b> <b>erratic</b> choice and control effects, as well as for various combinations of these effects. We develop the store model into a possible world model for cell generation, and (following Steele) we develop the control model into a “jumping implementation ” using a continuation language called Jump-With-Argument (JWA). We present a pointer game model for CBPV, in the style of Hyland and Ong. We see that the game concepts of questioning and answering correspond to the CBPV concepts of forcing and producing respectively. We observe that this game semantics is closely related to the jumping implementation. In the third part of the thesis, we study the categorical semantics for the CBPV equational theory. We present and compare 3 approaches: ¯ models using strong monads, in the style of Moggi; ¯ models using value/producer structures, in the style of Power and Robinson; ¯ models using (strong) adjunctions. All the concrete models in the thesis are seen to be adjunction models. Submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosoph...|$|R
