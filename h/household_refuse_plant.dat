40|$|Leachate was {{collected}} from a watertight pit at a landfill center dealing mainly with <b>household</b> <b>refuse</b> and <b>plant</b> waste. This effluent {{was characterized by}} a moderate organic matter content, a pH slightly higher than neutral and strong electrical conductivity. This latter {{was due to the}} presence of chlorides, Na, K, and ammonium. The organic content could be divided into two fractions: Fraction A consisting of large molecules (5000 Da and above) and Fraction B of smaller (between 300 to 1000 Da), more acidic molecules. The presence of phenols (sinapic acid, acetosyringone, and pyrogallol) could be identified in the leachate as a whole. A biological treatment of this leachate, involving methanization followed by aerated lagooning, was set up on the site: this led to a reduction of nearly 60 % in the organic content and almost total elimination of the ammonium. This treatment was not however sufficient to allow direct evacuation of the resulting effluent into the surface ground water. As heavy metals were absent from this effluent, the leachates from this landfill site could possibly be envisaged in the fertilization of soil-grown crops or for furrow irrigation-fertilization of tree plantations. The effect of irrigating soil-grown plants with a solution of leachate was examined using pots of ryegrass (Lolium sp.). Application of solutions containing dilutions of 1 to 400 mL L(- 1) of this effluent had a highly favorable effect on plant growth. Toxicity phenomen a were apparent above this concentration. The optimum effect on ryegass growth, under the conditions of this trial, was obtained by watering each pot with 30 mL of a solution containing 400 mL L(- 1) of leachate, every 2 d. This solution improved water and N nutrition in these plants...|$|R

40|$|Industrial and {{commercial}} enterprises, administration facilities and service companies generate waste that is jointly disposed with <b>household</b> <b>refuse.</b> This waste from {{all kinds of}} work places is similar to <b>household</b> <b>refuse.</b> It is collected both together with, as well as separately from <b>household</b> <b>refuse.</b> Usually a difference is made between industrial, commercial and institutional (IC and I) waste, collected with <b>household</b> <b>refuse,</b> and IC and I waste, similar to <b>household</b> <b>refuse,</b> but collected separately. Until now there were only incomplete data about quantity and composition, above all because available statistics did not include all work places in a district or because waste quantities were not recorded separately from other municipal wastes. Aim of the nation-wide industrial, commercial and institutional waste study (Bundesweite Gewerbeabfalluntersuchung- BWGU) was to determine quantity, composition and statistical characteristics of both kinds of IC and I waste. In 15 German districts (all belonging to the 'former' Federal Republic of Germany, meaning prior to German reunification in 1989) IC and I waste was inspected or sorted and compared, according to trade sector and size (number of employees) of the work places. The study was rounded off by a thorough questionnaire of the work places analysed and by an evaluation of the 1987 national work place census. The resulting statistical characteristics describe the waste quantity, the waste composition and the densities of the waste fractions, according to trade sector clusters (formed by cluster analysis {{on the basis of a}} three-digit trade key). With these values waste calculations for the whole of (former) Germany were carried out. (orig.)
