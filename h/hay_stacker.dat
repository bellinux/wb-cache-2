5000|$|Hay bucking, or [...] "bucking hay", {{is a type}} {{of manual}} labor where {{rectangular}} hay bales, ranging in weight from about 50 to 150 lb, are stacked by hand in a field, in a storage area such as a barn, or stacked on a vehicle for transportation, such as a flatbed trailer or semi truck for delivery to where the hay is needed. The act of throwing the bales up to a higher level is called [...] "bucking". The work is very strenuous and physically demanding, and is dependent upon using a proper technique in order to not become fatigued and avoid injury. Large quantities of small square bales are sometimes gathered with mechanical equipment such as a <b>hay</b> <b>stacker,</b> which can hold up to about 100 hay bales.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{the noise}} {{exposure}} of agricultural machine operators requires that machine operation time and intermittancy of work patterns be determined. One method of obtaining such data is by using event activity recorders. These data are available for haying machines operated at the University of Nebraska Field Laboratory, Mead during the 1963 through 1966 seasons. Approximately 60 machine operator days per season were recorded on service recorder charts for the following machines: 1. self-propelled windrowers 2. self-propelled and pull-type balers 3. self-propelled and pull-type bale wagons In addition some motion-time study data are available for the newer loose <b>hay</b> <b>stackers</b> and large roll balers. One seasons data, 1965, has been analyzed for a self-propelled baler to illustrate the information already available. Machine operator time and intermittancy work patterns were determined for the 35 days of baling when activity charts were obtained. Briefly, the results are summarized as follows...|$|R
40|$|R. Douglas Hurt {{deals with}} the {{invention}} and development of American farm implements and machinery with a special emphasis on the nineteenth century. The material is organized around the functions of various agricultural machines used in the major grain-growing states. Ten chapters focus on the improvements made in plows, grain drills, corn planters, cultivators, reapers, binders, headers, corn binders, corn shellers, threshing machines, combined harvesters, mowing machines, <b>hay</b> <b>stackers,</b> feed mills, and steam traction engines. The author decided to describe certain lines of farm equipment without trying to catalogue all agricultural tools, implements, and machines. Therefore the reader will not find descriptions of such items as cotton gins, saw mills, blacksmith tools, windmills, irrigation pumps, wagons, buggies, washing machines, and hardware materials. Also, during the period 1892 to 1914, no mention is made of the manufacture of {{the internal combustion engine}} and its uses in stationary gas engines, the early tractors, automobiles, trucks, and electric light plants. The judicious use of 219 photographs and illustrations gives a visual presentation of the evolution of rural technology. The verbal descriptions of mechanical and technical matters can be readily understood by the general reader. The book includes a good bibliography and a helpful appendix to aid the reader in understanding the importance of metallurgy as an important factor in the manufacture of farm machinery. Better farm machinery had to wait until the making of steel had been perfected. Some readers would welcome more analysis and interpretation of rural technology. For example, virtually all historians mention that our colonial forefathers used the wooden plow, the sickle, and the flail to grow crops, the same tools used thousands of years earlier in Biblical times. Why was this progress so slow? Why were no new machines invented in colonial America in the 170 years prior to the Revolutionary War? Why did it take two hundred years of experimentation before the first successful track-type Caterpillar engines were built in 1904 ? Combines were widely used in the Pacific Coast states in the 1880 s, yet they were not adopted in the Midwest until the late 1920 s, a lag of forty years. Perhaps historians should give more attention to the factors that deter progress and to the obstacles that prevent the adoption of new ideas, to try to explain the inability of people to adopt new methods. Nevertheless, the narrative is informative and well written. American Farm Tools is a fine addition to the historical record...|$|R
