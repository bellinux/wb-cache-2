40|$|Description: The {{precipitation}} rate {{is defined as}} the average volume of water in the form of rain, snow, hail, or sleet that falls per unit of area and per unit of time at the site.

The <b>deep</b> water <b>percolation</b> rate is ultimately used to calculate the radionuclide leaching rate of the contaminated zone and the subsequent contamination of the underlying groundwater system. For a given site, the precipitation rate varies with time because the annual precipitation changes from year to year.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the integration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and the TOPographic MODEL (TOPMODEL) features for enhancing the physical representation of hydrologic processes. In SWAT, four hydrologic processes, which are surface runoff, baseflow, groundwater re-evaporation and <b>deep</b> aquifer <b>percolation,</b> are modeled by using a group of empirical equations. The empirical equations usually constrain the simulation capability of relevant processes. To replace these equations and to model the influences of topography and water table variation on streamflow generation, the TOPMODEL features are integrated into SWAT, and a new model, the so-called SWAT-TOP, is developed. In the new model, the process of <b>deep</b> aquifer <b>percolation</b> is removed, the concept of groundwater re-evaporation is refined, and the processes of surface runoff and baseflow are remodeled. Consequently, three parameters in SWAT are discarded, and two new parameters to reflect the TOPMODEL features are introduced. SWAT-TOP and SWAT are applied to the East River basin in South China, and the results reveal that, compared with SWAT, the new model can provide a more reasonable simulation of the hydrologic processes of surface runoff, groundwater re-evaporation, and baseflow. This study evidences that an established hydrologic model can be further improved by integrating the features of another model, which is a possible way to enhance our understanding of the workings of catchments. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Proceedings {{published}} in APPEA Journal 2013 A technology called graded proppant (propping agent) injection {{that consists of}} the injection of proppant particles, with increasing sizes and decreasing concentrations, into a naturally fractured reservoir results in <b>deeper</b> <b>percolation</b> of the particles into the natural fracture system, and thus expansion of the stimulated reservoir area. The placement of graded proppant particles keeps the fractures open, even after pressure decline due to production. There is, therefore, an enhancement in the well productivity. This proposed technology {{could be used to}} improve the productivity of CSG wells and other unconventional resources; for example, in shales, tight gas, and geothermal reservoirs. In this peer-reviewed paper, a mathematical model for well injectivity/productivity was developed for graded particle injection in a vertical well, lying at the centre of a circular drainage area. The model is based on an analytical solution of the quasi 1 D problem of coupled axisymmetric fluid flow and geomechanics. Explicit analytical equations were derived for stress, and pressure and permeability distributions, {{as well as for the}} well index during injection and production. Results of previous computational fluid dynamic studies were used to determine the hydraulic resistance resulting from proppant plugging in the fractured system. An optimal stimulation radius was identified, which resulted in the highest increment in the productivity index due to the application of graded proppant injection technology. The model was subsequently used for a sensitivity analysis using field data. The results showed that the productivity index increased more than four times by the application of this technology. A.

Deep continuous contour trenches (CCT) structures are used for the rainwater harvesting, in the hills that cover about 1/4 of the area of the village.

30|$|The {{study area}} is under stress due to rock element {{reactions}} with groundwater (and influences geochemistry of groundwater), and some effects of land-use change (especially where the aquifer is unconfined) {{are due to}} urbanization, sea (saline) water interference (study area near of sea) and aquifer refreshing, and over-exploitation. The hydro-geochemical index-based study reveals that the groundwater is hard to very hard. The groundwater {{of the study area}} is more influenced by rock–water interaction, sea water, dominance and evaporation (due to high temperature) dominance field. The r 1 and r 2 indexes show that groundwater is Na+–SO 42 − and <b>deep</b> meteoric <b>percolation</b> (DMP) type. Based on the indexes [SAR, SSP (or %Na), RSC (or RA), KR, PI, CAI, PS, MH, TDS and TH] groundwater majority of the wells is falling under moderate to the unsuitable category of water for irrigation purposes. Thus, the use of groundwater for irrigation (without treatment) in the study area will damage crops and reduces production. However, more saline or salt-tolerable crops could be grown with a good irrigation system to stop soil salinization [also use lime/gypsum treatment to bout permeability of the soils (base-exchange process)]. The outcomes of this study show that index-based irrigation water quality can be useful in decision-making processes such as identifying no. of suitable wells for irrigation systems and prevent the damage of crops and production. It is also suggested that regular monitoring of irrigation water quality and pollution is essential to help farmers and the concerned department for making irrigation policy to the state government. This would be helpful in developing the suitable management plan and sustainable utilization of groundwater in irrigation. To recover the good quality of groundwater, the Government, semi-government and non-government organization (NGO) should make available and support to design the artificial recharge structures and rainwater harvesting structures in the study area.|$|R
40|$|<b>Deep</b> {{preferential}} <b>percolation</b> of {{melt water}} in snow and firn brings water lower along the vertical profile than a laterally homogeneous wetting front. This widely recognized process {{is an important}} source of uncertainty in simulations of subsurface temperature, density, and water content in seasonal snow and in firn packs on glaciers and ice sheets. However, observation and quantification of preferential flow is challenging and therefore it is not accounted for by most of the contemporary snow/firn models. Here we use temperature measurements in the accumulation zone of Lomonosovfonna, Svalbard, done in April 2012 - 2015 using multiple thermistor strings to describe the process of water percolation in snow and firn. Effects of water flow through the snow and firn profile are further explored using a coupled surface energy balance - firn model forced by the output of the regional climate model WRF. In situ air temperature, radiation, and surface height change measurements are used to constrain the surface energy and mass fluxes. To account for the effects of preferential water flow in snow and firn we test a set of depth-dependent functions allocating a certain fraction of the melt water available at the surface to each snow/firn layer. Experiments are performed for a range of characteristic percolation depths and results indicate a reduction in root mean square difference between the modeled and measured temperature by up to a factor of two compared to the results from the default water infiltration scheme. This illustrates the significance of accounting for preferential water percolation to simulate subsurface conditions. The suggested approach to parameterization of the preferential water flow requires low additional computational cost and can be implemented in layered snow/ firn models applied both at local and regional scales, for distributed domains with multiple mesh points...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{hydrothermal}} {{condition is}} one of the most important factors affecting crop growth in arid regions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mulching and tillage on moisture and temperature variations in soil under drip irrigation in the arid Hetao Irrigation District, northwest China. Four treatments were included: (1) alternating ridges (40 cm wide and 20 cm high) and furrows (40 cm wide) with plots fully mulched with plastic film (RFM); (2) alternating ridges (40 cm wide and 20 cm high) and furrows (40 cm wide) with partial film mulch (only the plant rows mulched) (RPM); (3) flat tillage with plots fully mulched with plastic film (FFM); and (4) flat tillage with partial film mulch (only the plant rows mulched) (FPM). The ridge tillage and plastic film increased soil temperature and significantly conserved soil water, and thus increased the maize yield and water use efficiency (WUE). The RFM treatment had a greater effect than the RPM, FFM, and FPM treatments on the soil moisture and water storage over 0 – 70 cm in depth during the entire growing period in 2014 and 2015, indicating that full transparent plastic film mulch increased soil water status and promoted <b>deep</b> water <b>percolation,</b> and ridge tillage further enhanced water redistribution to deep soils. Furthermore, RFM proportionally increased soil temperature by 0. 36 °C, 1. 49 °C, and 1. 27 °C above the temperatures under RPM, FPM, and FFM, respectively, in 2014 and by 1. 19 °C, 1. 62 °C, and 0. 35 °C, respectively, in 2015. During the drought year of 2014, tillage influenced temperature more than mulching; however, mulching played a more important role in preserving thermal conditions than tillage during the humid year of 2015. Consequently, RFM increased the maize yield and WUE significantly. We conclude that a combined system of full plastic film mulch and ridge tillage creates beneficial soil hydrothermal conditions under drip irrigation and thus promotes the growth and performance of field crops...|$|R

Mineral nutrients added to media with a high void content such as coarse grained sand will provide more oxygen to roots than ordinary soil and share some of the advantages with aeroponics. Sand also has a low water retention potential that makes it easier for plants to extract water by expending less energy due to the sand's relatively large particle size, which consequently does not bind very well to water.

40|$|The Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer is a {{valuable}} groundwater resource, situated in a semi-arid landscape of Southwest Texas, where over-use by dependent farming practices has lowered aquifer levels. In semi-arid regions, rates of groundwater recharge are predominantly low due to high potential evapotranspiration rates; however, least understood is the role that vegetation plays in soil-plant-water dynamics. Vegetation management potentially {{plays a major role}} in countering the loss to recharge because evapotranspiration (ET) varies with vegetation type and cover. The conversion from shrubland to grassland likely reduces rooting depths and total plant cover. Subsequently, <b>deep</b> drainage (<b>percolation</b> below the root zone) will likely increase and lead to groundwater recharge, at least temporarily. The primary aims of the study were to identify those biotic and abiotic factors facilitating deep drainage and to examine differences in recharge for the years following clearing of natural shrub vegetation. Soil chloride was examined to estimate long-term recharge rates, since its concentration in the soil is influenced by the movement of water. Short-term soil moisture trends were also monitored for any water movement deep in the soil profile in response to individual rain events. Rooting depths decreased following removal of vegetation; yet root biomass unexpectedly increased due to successful grass establishment during the first five years after treatment. Soil properties did not vary between treatments, indicating that the majority of chloride differences seen were a consequence of vegetation change. Peak and total soil chloride concentrations were expected to decrease and occur deeper in the soil profile 15 - 30 years following the clearing of woody vegetation. Total chloride decreased by up to 65 % after 30 years and resulted in an estimated 14. 9 mm/yr more recharge compared to adjacent untreated controls. Evidence in this study suggest that much of this chloride is leached during the first five years following treatment and that more leaching occurs in especially wet periods. During the wet 2007 growing season, soil moisture below the root zone increased by up to 17 % after vegetation clearing. The results of this study indicate that hydrologic changes following brush removal were evident in this system and are likely to positively influence groundwater recharge in the long-term...|$|R

Often these schemes include growing soybean {{in a sequence}} of crops including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). The full impact of various rotation schemes on soil water balance through a sequence of seasons has not been explored, although {{the value of these}} rotations has been studied experimentally. The objective of this work was to investigate through simulations, potential differences in temporal soil water status among rotations over five years. In this study, mechanistic models of soybean (Soy), maize (Maz), and wheat (Wht) were linked over a five-years period at Marcos Juárez, Argentina to simulate soil water status, crop growth, and yield of four no-till rotations (Soy/Soy, Soy/Wht, Soy/Maz, and Soy/Maz/Wht). Published data on sowing dates and initial soil water contents in the first year from a no-till rotation experiment were used as inputs to the model. After the first year, soil water status output from the model was used to initiate the next crop simulation in the sequence. The results of these simulations indicated a positive impact on soil water balance resulting from crop residue on the soil surface under no-till management. Continuous soybean and the two-year soybean/maize rotation did not efficiently use the available water from rainfall. Residue from maize was simulated to be especially effective in suppressing soil evaporation. Thus, the Soy/Maz simulation results indicated that this rotation resulted in enhanced soil water retention, increased <b>deep</b> water <b>percolation,</b> and increased soybean yields compared with continuous soybean crops. The simulated results matched well with experimental observations. The three-crop rotation of Soy/Maz/Wht did not increase simulated soybean yields, but the additional water retained as a result of decreased soil evaporation resulting from the maize residue allowed the addition of a wheat crop in this two-year rotation. Simulated soybean yields were poorly correlated with both the amount of soil water at sowing and the rainfall during the cropping period. These results highlight the importance of temporal distribution of rainfall on final yield. These models proved a valuable tool for assessing the consequences of various rotation schemes now being employed in Argentina on temporal soil water status, and ultimately crop yield.

The results of this test showed that the technique of subsurface film strips placement can reduce <b>deep</b> <b>percolation</b> and conserve irrigation water for greenhouse vegetables cultivation. However, the optimal layout variables {{for the use of}} the technique of subsurface film strips placement need further experimental and numerical analysis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Genetic Programming {{is able to}} {{systematically}} explore many alternative model structures of different complexity from available input and response data. We hypothesised that Genetic Programming {{can be used to}} test the structure of hydrological models and to identify dominant processes in hydrological systems. To test this, Genetic Programming was used to analyse a data set from a lysimeter experiment in southeastern Australia. The lysimeter experiment was conducted to quantify the <b>deep</b> <b>percolation</b> response under surface irrigated pasture to different soil types, watertable depths and water ponding times during surface irrigation. Using Genetic Programming, a simple model of <b>deep</b> <b>percolation</b> was recurrently evolved in multiple Genetic Programming runs. This simple and interpretable model supported the dominant process contributing to <b>deep</b> <b>percolation</b> represented in a conceptual model that was published earlier. Thus, this study shows that Genetic Programming can be used to evaluate the structure of hydrological models and to gain insight about the dominant processes in hydrological systems. ...|$|E
