25|$|In {{the case}} of the Evans' method, the chiral {{auxiliary}} appended is an oxazolidinone, and the resulting carbonyl compound is an <b>imide.</b> A number of oxazolidinones are now readily available in both enantiomeric forms. These may cost roughly $10–$20 US dollars per gram, rendering them relatively expensive. However, enantiopure oxazolidinones are derived in 2 synthetic steps from comparatively inexpensive amino acids, which means that large-scale syntheses can be made more economical by in-house preparation. This usually involves borohydride mediated reduction of the acid moiety, followed by condensation/cyclisation of the resulting amino alcohol with a simple carbonate ester such as diethylcarbonate.|$|E

Low-molecular-weight <b>imides</b> of varying chain lengths (4, 6, 7, 8, 18, and 20 carbons) were biodegrable.

2500|$|Metals {{bound to}} {{so-called}} triply bonded carbyne, <b>imide,</b> nitride (nitrido), and oxide (oxo) ligands are generally assigned to high oxidation states with low d electron counts. [...] The high oxidation state stabilizes the highly reduced ligands. [...] The low d electron count allow for many bonds between ligands and the metal center.

2500|$|In {{coordination}} chemistry, a pi-donor ligand {{is a kind}} of ligand {{endowed with}} filled non-bonding orbitals that overlap with metal-based orbitals. [...] Their interaction is complementary to the behavior of pi-acceptor ligands. [...] The existence of terminal oxo ligands for the early transition metals is one consequence of this kind of bonding. [...] Classic pi-donor ligands are oxide (O2−), nitride (N3−), <b>imide</b> (RN2−), alkoxide (RO−), amide (R2N−), and fluoride. [...] For late transition metals, strong pi-donors form anti-bonding interactions with the filled d-levels, with consequences for spin state, redox potentials, and ligand exchange rates. [...] Pi-donor ligands are low in the spectrochemical series.|$|E

40|$|The AgI-promoted {{coupling}} reaction of thioamides and carboxylic acids {{is shown to}} be a useful method for the generation of unsymmetrical <b>imides.</b> The reaction proceeds efficientlywith unhindered and electron-rich or neutral coupling partners, but not with hindered thioamides (such as thiopivalamides) or electron deficient thioamides (such as trifluorothioace-tamides). Intriguingly, thioformamides are also ineffective coupling partners, despite having minimal steric or electronic influence. Hindered carboxylic acid coupling partners (such as pivalic acid) are tolerated, but electron deficient acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid, are ineffective coupling partners. Furthermore, an interplay of both steric and electronic effects is observed in the subsequent hydrolysis of unsymmetrical <b>imides.</b> <b>Imides</b> with a dimethoxybenzoyl group give high regioselectivity upon hydrolysis, favouring cleavage of the distal acyl group. <b>Imides</b> with a p-nitrobenzoyl or pivaloyl group give reversed selectivity, favouring cleavage of the proximal acyl group...|$|R
50|$|Many high {{strength}} or electrically conductive polymers contain <b>imide</b> subunits, i.e., the polyimides. One example is Kapton where the repeat unit {{consists of two}} <b>imide</b> groups derived from aromatic tetracarboxylic acids. Another example of polyimides is the polyglutarimide typically made from polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and ammonia or a primary amine by aminolysis and cyclization of the PMMA at high temperature and pressure, typically in an extruder. This technique is called reactive extrusion. A commercial polyglutarimide product based on the methylamine derivative of PMMA, called Kamax, was produced by the Rohm and Haas company. The toughness of these materials reflects the rigidity of the <b>imide</b> functional group.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism starts with {{an attack on}} the carbonyl group by a strong base, such as methoxide ion. The ring is then opened, forming an <b>imide</b> anion. This is then followed by a rapid isomerization of the <b>imide</b> anion to the carbanion. This is facilitated by the electron withdrawing effect of the substituent, which allows for greater stabilization of the adjacent carbanion with respect to the <b>imide</b> anion. The reaction is then completed when the methoxide is displaced by the ring closing, which results in a ring expansion. The rate determining step of this reaction is the attack of the carbanion on the carbomethoxy group.|$|E
