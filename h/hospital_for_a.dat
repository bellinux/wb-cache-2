LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under the pretense of being one of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers).

5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire.

Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier.

Months later, Fenmore returns a moody teenager, kindling a friendship with a teenaged Summer. They became close and later began a relationship. When Summer began harassing a boy named Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo) online, Fenmore was against the idea, but when his father, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), began looking out for Jamie, he became jealous and took over the bullying by sending him harassing text messages from a disposable cell phone. Fenmore's jealously continued when Michael and Lauren had Jamie move in with them temporarily. He attempted to frame Jamie for stealing his mother's expensive decoration, and attempted to take pictures of him with the decoration on a rooftop. The boys struggled and Jamie was found face down in the snow below. He accused Fenmore of pushing him, Michael believed Jamie over his own son and he was arrested. However, Jamie later confessed that Fenmore did not push him and he was exonerated. Michael and Lauren's marriage suffered due to the bullying ordeal.|$|E
