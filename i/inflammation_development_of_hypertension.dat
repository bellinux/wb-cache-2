40|$|BACKGROUND: Early-life {{reduction}} in nephron number (uninephrectomy [UNX]) and chronic high salt (HS) intake {{increase the risk}} <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> and chronic kidney disease. Adenosine signaling via its different receptors has been implicated in modulating renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic functions as well as inflammatory processes; however, the specific role of the A 3 receptor in cardiovascular diseases is not clear. In this study, gene-modified mice were used to investigate the hypothesis that lack of A 3 signaling prevents the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> and attenuates renal and cardiovascular injuries following UNX in combination with HS (UNX-HS) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type (A 3 (+/+)) mice subjected to UNX-HS developed hypertension compared with controls (mean arterial pressure 106 ± 3 versus 82 ± 3  mm Hg; P< 0. 05) and displayed an impaired metabolic phenotype (eg, increased adiposity, reduced glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia). These changes were associated with both cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis together with renal injuries and proteinuria. All of these pathological hallmarks were significantly attenuated in the A 3 (-/-) mice. Mechanistically, absence of A 3 receptors protected from UNX-HS-associated increase in renal NADPH oxidase activity and Nox 2 expression. In addition, circulating cytokines including interleukins 1 β, 6, 12, and 10 were increased in A 3 (+/+) following UNX-HS, but these cytokines were already elevated in naïve A 3 (-/-) mice and did not change following UNX-HS. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in nephron number combined with chronic HS intake is associated with oxidative stress, chronic <b>inflammation,</b> and <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in mice. Absence of adenosine A 3 receptor signaling was strongly protective in this novel mouse model of renal and cardiovascular disease...|$|R

In accord with the ACE distribution, these mice also had reduced circulating angiotensin II and high plasma renin concentration but maintained normal kidney angiotensin II levels.

Intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) 6 -OHDA attenuated the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and also lowered the systolic blood pressure (BP) in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Norepinephrine was markedly and dose-dependently de-pleted in brain areas of all three substrains. Dopamine was affected also, although to a lesser extent. Pretreatment with the norepinephrine-uptake inhibitor desmethylimipramine (DMI) did not influ-ence the effect of 6 -OHDA on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in SHR. DMI largely antagonized the 6 -OHDA-induced depletion of brain norepinephrine, while dopamine depletion was not affected. Specif-ic depletion of brain norepinephrine by treatment with DSP- 4 did not alter the rise in BP in SHR.

40|$|Abstract—Hypertension is a {{major risk}} factor for {{cardiovascular}} and cerebrovascular disease. Lifelong environmental factors (eg, salt intake, obesity, alcohol) and genetic factors clearly contribute to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension,</b> {{but it has also}} been established that stress in utero may program the later <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the disease. This phenomenon, known as fetal programming can be modeled in a range of experimental animal models. In maternal low protein diet rat models of programming, administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists in early life can prevent <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension,</b> thus implicating the renin-angiotensin system in this process. Here we show that in this model, expression of the AT 1 b angiotensin receptor gene in the adrenal gland is upregulated by the first week of life resulting in increased receptor protein expression consistent with the increased adrenal angiotensin responsiveness observed by others. Furthermore, we show that the proximal promoter of the AT 1 b gene in the adrenal is significantly undermethylated, and that in vitro, AT 1 b gene expression is highly dependent on promoter methylation. These data suggest a link between fetal insults to epigenetic modification of genes and the resultant alteration of gene expression in adult life leading ultimately to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> It seems highly probable that similar influences may be involved in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> human <b>hypertension.</b> (Circ Res...|$|R

Systolic blood pressure measured by tail cuff started to increase in both sinoaortic-denervated and sham-operated rats 7 days after DOCA treatment, and the hypertension developed identically in both denervated and sham-operated rats. These {{findings suggest that the}} baroreceptor reflex cannot act against the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> To {{determine whether}} the baroreceptor reflex is attenuated before the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension,</b> bradycardic and sympathoin-hibitory responses to i. v. injections of norepinephrine were examined.

In urethane-anesthetized DOCA-loaded and control rats on the 5 th day after treatment, aortic depressor nerve stimulation elicited frequency-dependent depressor and bradycardic responses accompanied by inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity in both DOCA-loaded and control rats.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the possible relation between changes in behaviour and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), {{the effect of}} intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of the catecholamine neurotoxin 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) on blood pressure and spontaneous behaviour was studied. In addition to an attenuation of the rise in blood pressure in SHR, 6 -OHDA induced a marked decrease in rearing activity in the open field towards levels found in WKY. Other parameters were either not changed (stereotyped sniffing) or influenced in a comparable way in SHR and WKY (increase in locomotion). These results suggest that ICV 6 -OHDA may simultaneously affect the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> and certain components of the changed behaviour of SHR. The exact relation between the two phenomena awaits further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that high urinary albumin excretion (UAE; indicating mild renal damage) may precede <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> was tested, and the relation among UAE, GFR, and <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> was investigated. Data of 4635 patients of a prospective cohort study {{who participated in}} an extensive screening in 1997 to 1998 and 2001 to 2003 at our outpatient unit and were normotensive at baseline were used. Hypertension was defined according to the Seventh Report of the joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure criteria, UAE was measured in two consecutive 24 -h urine samples, and GFR was calculated with the modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Mean follow-up was 4. 3 yr. Baseline UAE {{was significantly associated with}} the risk for developing hypertension (odds ratio 2. 29; 95 % confidence interval 1. 77 to 2. 95 per 10 -fold increase of UAE). This association was independent of potential confounders. An interaction between UAE and GFR was found (P = 0. 030), indicating that with elevated UAE and lowered GFR, but still within the normal range, the risk for developing hypertension was highest. In conclusion, these findings support the {{hypothesis that}} mild renal damage may precede the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension...</b>|$|R
40|$|Inflammation {{contributes}} to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Whether C-reactive protein (CRP) has a causal role in hypertension remains unknown. We studied the relationship between circulating CRP levels and <b>hypertension.</b> The role <b>of</b> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene as determinants of its plasma levels and the propensity to develop hypertension was investigated. Plasma CRP and genotypes of nine SNPs were determined in 1925 unrelated subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study- 2 (CRISPS- 2) in 2000 - 2004. Among 1378 subjects normotensive in CRISPS- 2, 1115 subjects had been followed up in CRISPS- 3 after a median interval of 5. 3 years, 236 of whom had developed hypertension. Plasma CRP was independently associated with the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in CRISPS- 3 (odds ratio per quartile 1. 26, P= 0. 010). Six SNPs were associated with plasma CRP (all P< 0. 001). However, none of the SNPs {{was significantly associated with}} blood pressure, prevalent or incident hypertension, or change in blood pressure. In conclusion, plasma CRP predicts the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Genetic variants in the CRP gene are significantly associated with plasma CRP but not with hypertension. The future risk <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> is therefore more related to plasma CRP than SNPs in the CRP gene in this population. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} whether early treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril could permanently alter the course <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Mating pairs <b>of</b> SHR were treated with captopril, and their pups were maintained on captopril until experimentation. Some captopril-treated rats were taken off treatment at 2 months of age, and then some of these rats were mated at 3 months of age. The mean arterial pressures of conscious captopril-treated rats, the rats removed from therapy, and the offspring of the rats removed from therapy were significantly smaller than control rats at 4 and 9 months of age. Central administration of angiotensin I or II induced significantly smaller increases in blood pressure and drinking in captopril-treated rats and the rats removed from therapy compared with control rats. The increase in blood pressure in response to intravenous Injection of angiotensin I or II was similar among all groups, with the exception that captopril-treated rats showed lesser pressor responses to angiotensin I. Early administration of captopril, even after administration was stopped, prevented the subsequent <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in SHR and altered the course <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in their progeny. This effect was associated with decreased central responses to angiotensin I and II. Our data suggest that captopril may permanently alter the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in SHR through an alteration in the central renln-angiotensi...|$|R

40|$|Hypertension is a {{major risk}} factor for {{cardiovascular}} and cerebrovascular disease. Lifelong environmental factors (eg, salt intake, obesity, alcohol) and genetic factors clearly contribute to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension,</b> {{but it has also}} been established that stress in utero may program the later <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the disease. This phenomenon, known as fetal programming can be modeled in a range of experimental animal models. In maternal low protein diet rat models of programming, administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists in early life can prevent <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension,</b> thus implicating the renin-angiotensin system in this process. Here we show that in this model, expression of the AT 1 b angiotensin receptor gene in the adrenal gland is upregulated by the first week of life resulting in increased receptor protein expression consistent with the increased adrenal angiotensin responsiveness observed by others. Furthermore, we show that the proximal promoter of the AT 1 b gene in the adrenal is significantly undermethylated, and that in vitro, AT 1 b gene expression is highly dependent on promoter methylation. These data suggest a link between fetal insults to epigenetic modification of genes and the resultant alteration of gene expression in adult life leading ultimately to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> It seems highly probable that similar influences may be involved in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> human hypertensio...|$|R
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} the long-term intake of a cocoa powder, with high concentration of polyphenols, named CocoanOX (CCX), on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> <b>of</b> spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly in the rats, from the 6 th to 24 th week of life, by the tail cuff method. The <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> was attenuated in the groups treated with captopril or CCX. The antihypertensive effect was more accentuated in the group treated with captopril, and it was paradoxically more accentuated in the group treated with the lowest dose of CCX than in the other CCX groups. The arterial blood pressure increased in the treated SHR when the corresponding antihypertensive treatment was removed. Both, CCX and the standard cocoa, improved the aorta endothelial function in the SHR. In conclusion, CCX {{could be used as a}} functional food ingredient with antihypertensive activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
