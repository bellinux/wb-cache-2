5000|$|While all western gorillas are Critically Endangered (in {{the case}} of the western lowland gorilla due in part to Ebola virus), the Cross River gorilla is the most {{endangered}} of the African apes. A 2014 survey estimated that less than 250 mature individuals were left in the wild.

In efforts to conserve other species, it has already been determined that scattered populations should be brought together to prevent inbreeding. One problem with the scattered populations of Cross River gorillas is that they are surrounded by human populations that cause threats such as bushmeat hunting and habitat loss. Also, the protected habitats of Cross River gorillas along the Nigeria-Cameroon border are close to <b>hunting</b> <b>regions,</b> which increases the threat of extinction. The Cross River gorilla is especially significant to the ecosystem because they are excellent seed dispersers for certain tropical plant species that would otherwise face extinction.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the inherent steady state stability of salient-pole-type synchronous machines with damper windings. Eigen values method is used {{in the same manner as}} in the preceding paper. Since the general purpose of the damper windings is to stabilize hunting instability, this paper discusses the effects of them on hunting regions. At first, the basic linearized differential equations for a synchronous generator system with damper windings are derived and the characteristics of the eigen values are considered. It is shown that the steady state stability is determined by the three dominant eigen values in the same way as in a damper-less system. Next, calculations of the steady state stable regions for the various circuit conditions are carried out, and the effects of circuit parameters on the stable region are discussed. In particular, the effects of damper circuit parameters on the <b>hunting</b> <b>region</b> are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the inherent steady state stability of damper-less salient-pole-type synchronous machines. Although some methods have been used for this problem, this paper uses eigen values method because it gives the most exact solutions for the problem and both step-out and hunting instabilities can be evaluated by using the method. The effects of various parameters on the steady state stable region of synchronous mrchines are discussed in this paper. At first, the characteristics of the eigen values of synchronous machines are considered after deriving the linearized version of basic differential equations, and it is shown that the steady state stability of synchronous machines is generally determined by the three dominant eigen values. Next, calculations of the steady state stable regions for the various circuit conditions of a syn-cronous generator system are carried out, and the effects of circuit parameters on the stable region, especially on the <b>hunting</b> <b>region,</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} samples of four {{species of the}} most {{consumed}} fishes (Sefid, koli, kilca and kafal fish) were analyzed for concentrations of Chlorobenzilate (organochlorine pesticides). Fish were captured using electric fishing on four sites (Chalous and Babolsar city and Khazar Abad and Miankaleh regions) in Mazandaran provinces of Iran. Quantitative determination of the Chlorobenzilate was performed by gas chromatography electron-capture detection (GC–ECD). Samples contained detectable concentrations of Chlorobenzilate but at concentrations below the maximum residue limit (MRL). No different found between kinds of fishes in each sites about Chlorobenzilate concentrations {{but there are two}} groups of sites that were significantly different from one another in terms of Chlorobenzilate concentrations. According to insecticides analyzed in four kinds of fishes the Kafal in the <b>hunting</b> <b>region</b> of Khazar abad had greatest amount of 0. 038 PPM. Kilca from Babolsar had the highest amount of Chlorobenzilate, 0. 035 PPM (P< 0. 05). In the case of Sefid and Koli fishes in regions, significant difference was not seen. It is necessary to mention that no research has so far been done to be a criterion for comparison in this area sites. However, the concentrations of Chlorobenzilate residues in the muscle were found to be lower than the FAO/WHO recommended permissible and should not be public concern among peoples in Mazandaran province...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Despite {{the obvious}} {{importance}} of the Oregon big game resource to Oregon citizens, economic data regarding the actual magnitude of net and gross values have been lacking. Thus an attempt {{has been made in}} this thesis to supply the missing information by estimating the gross economic value and by formulating a demand model from which the net economic value of the Oregon big game resource can be derived. The gross economic value of the Oregon big game resource, including both the investment in hunting and related equipment and hunting trip expenses, was obtained from two questionnaires mailed to a random sample of Oregon big hunters during the summer and fall of 1968. It was estimated that hunter families averaged about 239 per year for hunting and associated equipment. A total investment by all Oregon hunters of 44. 6 million in 1968 was estimated. It was also estimated that hunter families averaged about 118. 70 on big game hunting trips during 1968. Total big game hunting trip expenses for all Oregon hunters were estimated to be 18. 6 million. Thus, combining investment in hunting and associated equipment with total trip expenses gave a total estimated expenditure of 63. 2 million by Oregon big game hunters in 1968. Net economic value (which is defined in this study as the potential value of the resource if the opportunity to hunt big game animals were a marketable commodity) was sensitive to the specification of the demand model employed. In this study, the two most important explanatory variables were average trip expenses and distance to the <b>hunting</b> <b>region.</b> As compared to traditional distance zone estimation procedures, estimation based upon individual observations was much more efficient, and better separated the monetary versus the non monetary costs of distance. Several algebraic forms of the demand equation were fitted for each of the five hunting regions of Oregon. However, best overall results were obtained from the exponential demand function, fitted by logarithmic transformation, but corrected for bias in terms of the real numbers. One measure of net economic value (net revenue to a non discriminating monopolist) gave an estimated value of the Oregon big game resource of about 4 million. However, consumer surplus, which is more generally accepted by economists, gave an estimated net 4 economic value of about 11 million for the Oregon big game resource in 1968. The 11 million net economic value {{is considered to be a}} conservative estimate since expenditures for hunting and related equipment were not included. It is thought that the estimation of net economic values for each of the five hunting regions makes the study more useful from the viewpoint of big game management and resource allocation in Oregon...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Alaska and Inuvialuit Beluga Whale Committee (AIBWC) {{was formed}} in 1988 to {{facilitate}} and promote the wise conservation, management and utilization of beluga whales in Alaska nd the western Canadian Arctic. The membership of the committee consists of representatives h m coastal beluga whale <b>hunting</b> <b>regions</b> and communities in Alaska and the Mackenzie River Delta in Canada, U. S. federal, state and local govemment agencies, and others, such as researchers and technical advisors. Only representatives from beluga whale hunting communities vote on matters related to hunting, while the committee as a whole votes on other issues. Harvest monitoring programs are planned and coordinated at the spring meeting, implemented during the whaling season by hunters and others and reported upon during the fall meeting. To date, the AIBWC has 1) established beluga whale research priorities, 2) coordinated or assisted with the collection of samples for genetic, contaminant and basic biological studies, 3) provided funding for DNA studies, 4) commented on federal actions (e. g., relating to {{oil and gas exploration}} activity) with the potential to affect beluga whales, beluga habitat or beluga hunting, 5) collected the most complete harvest data ever available for Alaska, 6) produced a newsletter highlighting important marine mammal issues for coastal residents of Alaska, and 7) sponsored the attendance of committee members at meetings of the International Whaling Commission. The AIBWC recently ratified its draft Alaska beluga whale management plan, a counterpart to the existing plan for beluga whale management in the western Canadian Arctic, and has initiated discussions on a joint Inupiat-Inuvialuit plan for managemen...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{differences}} in the monitored quality indicators of roe deer venison depending on {{the region of the}} Czech Republic where roe deer are hunted. Quality of roe deer venison was evaluated based on pH values, colour (CIEL*a*b * system) and chemical composition (content of haem pigments, dry matter, pure protein, collagen and fat). Samples of muscle from the leg (m. gluteus medius) were taken from 22 female roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) from two <b>hunting</b> <b>regions</b> (Liberec and South Moravia) in the Czech Republic. In roe deer from Liberec, higher pH value (5. 65, P < 0. 001) was found; muscles were darker (L * = 36. 03), contained higher redness (a * = 14. 41, P < 0. 001) and yellowness values (b * = 12. 10) and higher chroma (C * = 18. 86). In roe deer from South Moravia, higher (P < 0. 05) hue (h°) values, and higher level of haem pigments (2. 45 mg·g- 1) were found. Muscles from roe deer from South Moravia contained higher amounts of dry matter (29. 52 %, P < 0. 001), pure protein (23. 84 %, P < 0. 001) and total collagen (0. 86 %), and lower amounts of intramuscular fat (0. 48 %).
