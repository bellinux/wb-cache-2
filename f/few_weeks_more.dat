25|$|The disease {{suddenly}} appeared in Hamburg, spreading so rapidly that, in a <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>more</b> {{than a thousand}} people died. The sickness swept through eastern Europe as an epidemic causing high mortality rates. It arrived in Switzerland in December, then was carried northwards to Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and eastwards to Lithuania, Poland and Russia.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>more</b> B-57Bs were moved from Clark AB to Bien Hoa {{to make good}} these losses and to {{reinforce}} the original deployment. The B-57s shared an open-air, three-sided hangar with the Vietnamese Air Force that flew A-1E Skyraider aircraft, and things got so crowded at Bien Hoa {{at that time that}} some of the B-57s had to be sent back to Clark AB. Also, maintenance facilities for the B-57 at Bien Hoa were scarce.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1952, Ramsey {{would call}} joining the army [...] "one of the {{greatest}} things which ever happened to me", adding [...] "I learnt, in a <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>more</b> about life in general that I had picked up in years at home." [...] Military life taught Ramsey about discipline and leadership, and improved his social skills: [...] "I have never been very good at mixing with people {{but you have to}} in the army or else you are in trouble," [...] the journalist Nigel Clarke recalled him saying. Ramsey rose to be a company quartermaster sergeant in an anti-aircraft unit.|$|E
50|$|After a {{short period}} of feeble health, {{followed}} by a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of <b>more</b> rapid failure, he died in Chelsea, on January 5, 1888, at the age of 82.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{long moment}} of silence, during which he studied certain pencilled entries against the name. The {{sections}} had {{been working in the}} last <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> much <b>more</b> systematically than was generally suspected.|$|R
50|$|The bursa is not required, so {{the main}} {{potential}} complication is potential reaction to anaesthetic. The surgery {{can be performed}} arthroscopically and, consequently, on an outpatient basis. Patients often have to use crutches {{for a few days}} following surgery up to a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> for <b>more</b> involved procedures.|$|R
60|$|But Theodora wished herself less {{necessary}} at home, when, in a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> she had {{to gather}} that matters were going on well from the large round-hand note, with nursery spelling and folding, in which Johnnie {{announced that he had}} a little brother.|$|E
60|$|Charlie {{was obliged}} to content himself with this arrangement. Next day he was {{galloping}} eastward--convoyed {{part of the way}} by the scout on Black Polly and Dick Darvall on Wheelbarrow. Soon he got into the region of railways and steam-boats, and, in a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> was once again in Old England.|$|E
60|$|But {{this remark}} of my friend's {{appeared}} more evident in a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> for the decrease went on, and another week in October it decreased 1843, {{so that the}} number dead of the plague was but 2665; and the next week it decreased 1413 more, {{and yet it was}} seen plainly that there was abundance of people sick, nay, abundance more than ordinary, and abundance fell sick every day but (as above) the malignity of the disease abated.|$|E
50|$|The first {{crack in}} the German coldness towards Finland was {{registered}} in late July, when Ludwig Weissauer, a secret representative of the German Foreign Minister, visited Finland and queried Mannerheim and Ryti about Finland's willingness to defend the country against the Soviet Union. Mannerheim estimated the Finnish army could last a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> without <b>more</b> arms. Weissauer left without any promises.|$|R
5000|$|Sebastian is the 2006 {{debut album}} from Swedish pop/rock singer Sebastian Karlsson, {{led by the}} first single and four weeks #1 hit [...] "Do What You're Told". The album was {{released}} on March 1, debuting at #1 in Sweden, and not falling until a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> thereafter. <b>More</b> than 30.000 copies of the album have been sold, certificating gold the album.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear you must. I have {{foreseen}} {{it a long}} time; and so, I fear (and he rose from his seat), must I, unless I mean to be very rude. You will at least take away with you the knowledge, that you have given to one person's existence, {{at least for a}} <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> pleasure <b>more</b> intense than he thought earth could hold." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is not my}} {{intention}} to delay over my life either at home or at North Villa, during the spring and summer. This would be merely to repeat much {{of what has been}} already related. It is better to proceed at once to the closing period of my probation; to a period which it taxes my resolution severely to write of at all. A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> of toil at my narrative, and the penance of this poor task-work will be over.|$|E
6000|$|Four {{years he}} lingers; friends begin to arise from one quarter and another, but he, not {{altogether}} wisely or well, refuses all pecuniary help. At last Mr. Hugh Miller recommends {{him to be}} editor of a projected [...] "Non-Intrusion" [...] paper in Dumfries, with a salary, to him boundless, of 100l. a-year. Too late! The iron has entered too deeply into his soul; in a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> he is lying in his brother's grave--"Lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their deaths not divided." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing but the {{immediate}} finger of God, nothing but omnipotent power, {{could have done}} it. The contagion despised all medicine, death raged in every corner; and, had it gone on as it did then, a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> would have cleared the town of all and everything that had a soul. Men everywhere began to despair; every heart failed them for fear; people were made desperate through the anguish of their souls; and the terrors of death sat in the very faces and countenances of the people.|$|E
50|$|Several {{studies have}} found that {{anisometropia}} occurs more frequently and tends to be more severe for persons with high ametropia, and that this is particularly true for myopes. Anisometropia follows a U-shape distribution according to age: it is frequent in infants aged only a <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> is <b>more</b> rare in young children, comparatively more frequent in teenagers and young adults, and more prevalent after presbyopia sets in, progressively increasing into old age.|$|R
50|$|Soon enough, he {{was told}} he could stay in Canada permanently. Although he had to stay in jail for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> he was {{released}} as soon as his documents were processed.|$|R
50|$|Usually either contestants {{themselves}} {{would start}} {{appearing on the}} show with the technique in mind, or audience members would shout it out {{to try to help}} them. A stunt would usually take a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> before the audience realized the technique, and then a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> before someone was able to properly employ it.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Howe's {{account of}} this pupil's first {{instruction}} is so very striking, and so intimately connected with Laura herself, that I cannot refrain from a short extract. I may premise that the poor boy's name is Oliver Caswell; that he is thirteen years of age; {{and that he was}} in full possession of all his faculties, until three years and four months old. He was then attacked by scarlet fever; in four weeks became deaf; in a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> blind; in six months, dumb. He showed his anxious sense of this last deprivation, by often feeling the lips of other persons when they were talking, and then putting his hand upon his own, as if to assure himself that he had them in the right position.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{replied the}} youth, with a sprightly toss of the head, [...] "Lucien and I shall enjoy {{at least a}} <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> of our old life on the blue sea before he takes to musty books and I to the stool of the clerk. Ah, why did you allow father {{to give us a}} good education? How much more enjoyable it would have been to have lived the free life of a fisherman--or of that pig," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to one which had just strayed into the garden and lain down to roll in the earth--"what happy ignorance or ignorant happiness; what concentrated enjoyment of the present, what perfect oblivion as to the past, what obvious disregard of the future--" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had arrived}} at a {{satisfactory}} arrangement when Aynsley left the office, and during the next <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> work was offered the new firm than they could comfortably attend to. In a few months they decided to buy a large and powerful tug, which was somewhat out of repair, and after refitting her they found {{that they were able}} to keep her busy. Then they were fortunate in towing one or two exceptionally large booms of logs safely down the coast in bad weather, and it soon became known that they could be relied on. When the work was difficult Jimmy took charge of it in person with Moran’s help, while Bethune attended to the office and secured the good opinion of their customers.|$|E
40|$|Bullying and {{victimisation}} among {{school-age children}} are recognised {{as a major}} public health problem. In its 2009 report on the Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Study (ACBPS), the Child Health Promotion Research Centre of Edith Cowan University reported that just over one quarter (27 per cent) of school students aged 8 to 14 years were bullied and 9 per cent bullied others on a frequent basis – every <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or <b>more</b> often (Cross et al, 2009) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Wrayson," [...] he said, [...] "lend me a quid. I've got {{the flat}} {{to sleep in}} for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> but I haven't got money enough for a meal. I'll pay you back some day--perhaps before you expect it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can {{do nothing}} else, man!" [...] said Henchard scornfully. [...] "The little money I have will just keep body and soul {{together}} for a <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> and no <b>more.</b> I have not felt inclined {{to go back to}} journey-work yet; but I can't stay doing nothing, and my best chance is elsewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Skene says, {{in a note}} to Letter 28, that [...] "they {{were men}} of {{remarkable}} talents, and James of great learning, both evincing a dash of their father's eccentricity, but joined to greater talent. Sir Walter took great pleasure in their society, but James being resident in London, the opportunity of enjoying his company had of late been rare. Upon the present occasion he had dined {{with me in the}} greatest health and spirits the evening before his departure for London, and in a week we had accounts of his having been seized by a sudden illness which carried him off. In a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> his brother, Sir Alexander, was killed in a duel occasioned by a foolish political lampoon which he had written, and in a thoughtless manner suffered to find its way to a newspaper."--Reminiscences.|$|E
60|$|A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> {{and there}} were other partings, sad indeed, yet cheery. Dr. May told Mrs. Arnott that, though he grieved that so much of sorrow had come to dim her visit, he could not but own that it was the very time when her coming could be most comforting; and this, as she truly said, was {{satisfaction}} enough for her, besides that she could not rejoice enough that her arrival had been in time to see their dear Margaret. She should carry away most precious recollections; and she further told Dr. Spencer that she was far more comfortable about her brother-in-law, than if she had only known him in his youthful character, which had seemed so little calculated to bear sorrow or care. She looked at him now only to wonder at, and reverence the change that had been gradually wrought by the affections placed above.|$|E
60|$|On December 24, 1863, {{a gentle}} rain was still falling over {{the length and}} breadth of the Lone Star claim. It had been falling for several days, had already called a faint spring color to the wan landscape, {{repairing}} with tender touches the ravages wrought by the proprietors, or charitably covering their faults. The ragged seams in gulch and canyon lost their harsh outlines, a thin green mantle faintly clothed the torn and abraded hillside. A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> and a veil of forgetfulness would be drawn over the feeble failures of the Lone Star claim. The charming derelicts themselves, listening to the raindrops {{on the roof of}} their little cabin, gazed philosophically from the open door, and accepted the prospect as a moral discharge from their obligations. Four of the five partners were present. The Right and Left Bowers, Union Mills, and the Judge.|$|E
50|$|After a plot {{to imply}} the {{drainage}} {{in the house is}} faulty fails, Ukridge decides to claim the house is infected with Scarlet fever, but receiving a telegram from his aunt saying she will arrive in Paris the following week, and knowing a trip there always takes his aunt a <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> decides to delay shutting down his plan to grab a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> rent.|$|R
50|$|The {{dawn of the}} 1990s saw a {{fundamental}} shift in the way computer games were developed. Whereas the games of the 8-bit era were typically developed by a single individual {{within a matter of}} months (sometimes even a <b>few</b> <b>weeks),</b> the <b>more</b> demanding 16-bit titles required larger teams, longer development times and considerably larger budgets. Royalties from their impressive back catalogue of titles allowed Graftgold to make this transition with ease, hiring in excess of 30 additional people to work on a large number of products within a team environment.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few months}} after the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science Crosse was {{conducting}} another electrocrystallization experiment when, on the 26th day of the experiment, he saw what he described as [...] "the perfect insect, standing erect on a few bristles which formed its tail". More creatures appeared and two days later they began moving their legs. Over the next <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> hundreds <b>more</b> appeared. They crawled around the table and hid themselves wherever they could find shelter. Crosse identified them as being members of the genus acarus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{unable to}} measure the {{interval}} that elapsed: my memory fails me. I only know that the time came, when I could see the skylark in the heavens, but could no longer hear its joyous notes. In a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> the nightingale, and even the loud thrush, became silent birds to my doomed ears. My last effort to resist my own deafness was made at my bedroom window. For some time I still heard, faintly and more faintly, the shrill twittering just above me, under the eaves of the house. When this last poor enjoyment came to an end--when I listened eagerly, desperately, and heard nothing (think of it, nothing!)--I gave up the struggle. Persuasions, arguments, entreaties were entirely without effect on me. Reckless what came of it, I retired to the one fit place for me--to the solitude in which I have buried myself ever since." ...|$|E
60|$|Alas, D'Arnaud is {{not well}} gone, when there has begun brewing in {{threefold}} secrecy a mass of galvanic matter, which, in <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> filled the Heavens with miraculous foul gases and the blackness of darkness;--which, in short, exploded about New-year's time, as the world-famous VOLTAIRE-HIRSCH LAWSUIT, still remembered, though only as a portent and mystery, by observant on-lookers. Of which it is now our sad duty to say something; though nowhere, in the Annals of Jurisprudence, is there a more despicable thing, or a deeper involved in lies and deliriums by current reporters of it, about which the sane mind can be called upon accidentally to speak a word. Beaten, riddled, shovelled, washed in many waters, by a patient though disgusted Predecessor in this field, there lies by me a copious but wearisome Narrative of this matter;--the more vivid portions of which, if rightly disengaged, and shown in sequence, may satisfy the curious.|$|E
6000|$|Karl Albert {{has turned}} off, leftwards, towards his Bohemian Enterprises: French, Bavarians, Saxons, by their several routes, {{since the last}} days of October, are all on march that way. We will mark an exact date here and there, as fixed point for the reader's fancy. Poor Karl Albert, he had sat some six weeks at Linz,--about three weeks since that Homaging there (October 2d);--imaginary Sovereign of Upper Austria; looking over to Vienna and the Promised Land in general. And that fine Pisgah-view was all he ever had of it. Of Austrian or other Conquests earthly or heavenly, there came none to him in this Adventure;--mere MINUS {{quantities}} they all proved. For a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> there are, blended with awful portents, an imaginary gleam or two in other quarters; after which, nothing but black horror and disgrace, deepening downwards into utter darkness, for the poor man. Belleisle is an imaginary Sun-god; but the poor Icarus, tempted aloft in that manner into the earnest elements, and melting at once into quills and rags, is a tragic reality!--Let us to our dates:-- ...|$|E
50|$|When a cell is completed, {{the adult}} wasp {{typically}} collects beetle larvae, spiders, or caterpillars and, paralyzing them, places {{them in the}} cell to serve as food for a single wasp larva. As a normal rule, the adult wasp lays a single egg in the empty cell before provisioning it. Some species lay the egg in {{the opening of the}} cell, suspended from a thread of dried fluid. When the wasp larva hatches, it drops and starts to feed upon the supplied prey for a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> before pupating. The complete lifecycle may last from a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> to <b>more</b> than a year from the egg until the adult emerges. Adult potter wasps feed on floral nectar.|$|R
50|$|The action {{takes place}} in ancient Rome (with {{events of the last}} four years of Nero's reign (AD 64-68) being {{compressed}} within a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or <b>more),</b> a period after Emperor Claudius' illustrious and powerful reign, during which the new corrupt and destructive Emperor Nero ascends to power and eventually threatens to destroy Rome's previous peaceful order. The main subject is the conflict between Christianity and the corruption of the Roman Empire, especially in the last period of the Julio-Claudian line. The characters and events depicted are a mixture of actual historical figures and situations and fictionalized ones.|$|R
50|$|For {{the next}} <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> there was <b>more</b> heavy {{fighting}} {{on a daily}} basis and the Taliban who had begun fighting the battle in a conventional way of trenches started to retreat from the battlefield. Canadian forces then faced sporadic resistance until Canadian forces gained the upper hand. Reconstruction efforts began immediately and small cells of Taliban fighters returned to their deadly tactics of suicide and roadside bombings.|$|R
