30|$|Sage AI {{produces}} textile interiors {{based on}} two manufacturing routes: woven or knitted. Most developments are related to enhancing these processes, e.g. through embossing, stitch and <b>HF</b> <b>welding.</b> The samples are developed through their plants overseas; thus, knowledge of their capabilities is essential. This knowledge accrues through experience, and the creative or technical designers visit the partner manufactures every month. Most innovations are for enhancing the fabrics, e.g. rotary embossing, 12 head embroidery machine and <b>HF</b> <b>welding.</b> Various OEMs now produce shorter runs and offer special editions to add more interest to the colour and design of the automotive Powell NB (2006). The use of embroidery is a new technical capability, enabling mass customization service. When developing initial ideas (for either internal or external clients), Sage AI liaise with their suppliers’ technicians to establish feasibility with partner companies; where, {{if it is not}} possible, they will develop new supplier relationships and run feasibility trials.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary notes Structural life of welded pipes made of API J 55 steel by {{high-frequency}} (<b>HF)</b> <b>welding</b> {{has been}} evaluated. Experimental tests {{of base metal}} mechanical properties, including fatigue properties, were conducted on pipes after 70. 000 hours of service in an oil drilling rig. The fatigue crack growth rate and fatigue threshold is obtained using the pre-cracked Charpy specimens. The number of cycles to the final fracture is then calculated using initial and critical crack depths. Based {{on the number of}} cycles to the final fracture and the remaining fatigue lifetime of pipes with axial outer surface crack are determined. It was shown that the remaining fatigue lifetime is more sensitive to the changes in the stress range than to the initial crack depth...|$|E
40|$|The debates {{study the}} {{influence}} of the molecular structures for polymers welding and establish the conditions when is possible to obtain a welding joint of these and a transition area near welding with properties which ensure good usage. The testing of aptitude of materials for high frequency (<b>HF)</b> <b>welding,</b> were done with Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) foils with textile insertion and Malivat materials, defining in an experimental way, the optimum process parameters which ensure a good resistance breaking for welding. Key words: polymer, structure, welding ability The usage of plastic materials in industry suffered an important increase in the last 50 years, and development of new welding technologies of these materials was the main focus. This development is an effect of these new components asked in design phase in the innovative fields as medical, automotive and packaging industry [2, 5]. In this direction, the welding of thermoplastic materials with HF proceed is a field with a big interest in production and manufacture...|$|E
40|$|The dual-phase alloy Zr 2. 5 Nb alloy is an {{important}} nuclear material, because of its use in current and possible use in future nuclear reactors. It is, however, well-known that Zr 2. 5 Nb weldments can fail through a time-dependent mechanism called delayed hydride cracking which is typically driven {{by the presence of}} tensile residual stresses. With a view to understanding the development of residual stresses associated with Zr 2. 5 Nb welds the current study focuses on the evaluation of the residual stresses in a mock-up of a reactor beam tube flange made from Zr 2. 5 Nb 0. 9 Hf. The present results suggests that, like ferritic welds which undergo a solid-state phase transformation upon welding, Zr 2. 5 Nb 0. 9 <b>Hf</b> <b>welds</b> also develop high tensile residual stresses in the heat-affected zone whereas the stresses closer to the weld tip are reduced by the effects of the beta -> alpha solid-state phase transformation. © 2013, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : Containers for {{the storage}} of {{platelets}} are made using polyvinyl chloride plasticised with di, (2 -ethyl hexyl) phthalate, n-butyryl, tri (n-hexyl) citrate and tri (2 -ethyl hexyl) mellitate or using special poly olefins without plasticiser. Of these, the first two have disadvantages such as plasticiser leaching and impairment of platelet function. Polyolefin bags cannot be <b>HF</b> <b>welded</b> or steam sterilized. Mellitate plasticised bags can store platelets well for five days {{but they are not}} completely phthalate free. Research and Development: We have developed a new generation of containers made of PVC plasticised with the non DEHP, non aromatic plasticiser, 1, 2 - Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, diisononyl ester (Hexamoll DINCH) which can store platelets without loss of function for at least six days. Observation: The present studies show that DINCH plasticised PVC bags (TPL- 167) are well suited for {{the storage of}} platelet concentrates for more than five days. Conclusion: The present studies show that the PVC plasticised with the non phthalate, non aromatic, non toxic plasticiser DINCH is a viable alternative to other existing containers for the storage of platelets for more than five days...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is {{investigation}} of the damage level of API J 55 steel, used for manufacturing casing pipes by high frequency (<b>HF)</b> contact <b>welding.</b> The analysed pipe was withdrawn after about 70 000 hours of service in an oil drilling rig. Experimental analysis included determining the mechanical properties of the base material and welded joint, in particular the tensile and impact toughness testing. Fracture behaviour is examined by testing the modified compact tension (CT) specimens machined with a pre-crack in the base metal, weld metal and heat affected zone (HAZ). The critical value of the stress intensity factor KIc is determined using the critical value of the J integral JIc. Fatigue crack growth rate and fatigue threshold stress intensity factor range are determined by three point bending tests of the Charpy specimens with a V-notch. The investigation conducted on specimens cut from the exploited pipe and the new pipe of the same grade revealed that material properties were not seriously altered during the analysed period of service...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} {{technology of}} steel pipe production {{is the high}} frequency (<b>HF)</b> inductive <b>welding.</b> A mechanically formed profile is introduced into an inductor. Inside the pipe, {{in the position of}} the inductor there is an impeder, whose function is to form a suitable distribution of the electromagnetic and temperature field. In previous paper of the authors, the new magneto-dielectric (MD) material for the impeder is proposed and results of extraordinary energy saving are shown. This paper treats the aspect of the pipe quality, which represent the essential parameter in a production technology. The analyses were made for the widely spread ferrite impeder and for the proposed MD impeder. From this point of view, the MD impeder appeared to be advantageous material also. In addition to the standard mechanical tests of pipes quality, extensive chemical and physical analyses of the material in the weld, {{as well as in the}} basic section of the pipe, have been performed. The aim of the investigation was to explain the bad results in the standard flattening and hydrostatic testing of pipes produced using the ferrite impeder of TDK-IP 1 type.

40|$|In {{practice}} the pulsedDirect Current (DC) welding {{is associated with}} Tungsten Inert GasArc welding process. This paper presents a novel Direct Current Arc Welding Technology named as High Frequency Pulsed Direct Current Shielded Metal Arc <b>Welding</b> (<b>HF</b> Pulsed DC SMAW) in whichthe square pulsed Direct Current superimposed by the high frequency Alternating Current is developed for welding any metal joint. This specialized Direct Current Arc Welding Technology uses one High Frequency Unit (HF) and one half-wave rectifier (Pulsar) with conventional welding machine. The performances of this technology have beeninvestigated and compared with the conventional Steady Direct Current Shielded Metal Arc Welding (DCSMAW) technology for the study on energy consumption, thermal gradient, heat input, metallurgical characteristics, weld quality and consumption of filler metal. HF Pulsed DC SMAW technology has been found superior to the conventional steady DC SMAW technology in respect toall the above parameters. Accordingly, instead of using steady DC SMAW technology, the HF Pulsed DC SMAW can be commercially used for any metal fabrication, manufacturing and maintenance of pressure vessels & pressure parts and any other applications...|$|R
