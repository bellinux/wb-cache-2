40|$|Basal {{pressure}} {{has been recorded}} at the Svartisen Subglacial Laboratory, northern Norway, for 20 years, and is measured by load cells installed at the <b>ice–rock</b> <b>interface</b> under ∼ 200 m of glacier ice. Synchronous pressure variations between load cells are investigated as evidence of stress redistribution and hydrological bed connectivity. A running Pearson correlation is used to study the temporal variation in the response of several sensors. By studying {{the nature of this}} correlation as well as the correlation between sensor pairs, it is possible to investigate the evolution of the degree of synchronous response, and to some extent basal connectivity, at the glacier bed. Persistent seasonal variations associated with the melt season are observed throughout the measurement period, indicating dependence on surface hydrological forcing. Overlying this pattern, specific years with longer periods of positive and negative correlation of pressure between sensors are presented to show contrasting interannual variability in basal pressure. An anticorrelated connectivity is associated with a local increase in the rate of daily subglacial discharge, and is caused by load transfer or passive cavity opening. Stable weather appears to enhance connectivity of the sensors, which is attributed {{to the development of a}} persistent drainage system and stress redistribution...|$|E
40|$|Since 1994, {{at least}} six major (volume > 106 m 3) ice and rock {{avalanches}} have occurred on Iliamna volcano, Alaska, USA. Each of the avalanches was preceded by up to 2 hours of seismicity believed to represent {{the initial stages of}} failure. Each seismic sequence begins with a series of repeating earthquakes thought to represent slip on an <b>ice–rock</b> <b>interface,</b> or between layers of ice. This stage is followed by a prolonged period of continuous ground-shaking that reflects constant slip accommodated by deformation at the glacier base. Finally the glacier fails in a large avalanche. Some of the events appear to have entrained large amounts of rock, while others comprise mostly snow and ice. Several avalanches initiated from the same source region, suggesting that this part of the volcano is particularly susceptible to failure, possibly due to the presence of nearby fumaroles. Although thermal conditions at the time of failure are not well constrained, it is likely that geothermal energy causes melting at the glacier base, promoting slip and culminating in failure. The frequent nature and predictable failure sequence of Iliamna avalanches makes the volcano an excellent laboratory for the study of ice avalanches. The prolonged nature of the seismic signal suggests that warning may one day be given for similar events occurring in populated regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of meteorological conditions on rockfall occurrence has been often highlighted, but knowledge {{of it is}} still not sufficient {{due to the lack of}} exhaustive and precise rockfall databases. In this study, rockfalls have been detected in a limestone cliff by annual terrestrial laser scanning, and dated by photographic survey over a period of 2. 5 years. A near-continuous survey (one photo every 10  min) with a wide-angle lens has made it possible to date 214 rockfalls larger than 0. 1  m 3, and a monthly survey with a telephoto lens has dated 854 rockfalls larger than 0. 01  m 3. Analysis of the two databases shows that the rockfall frequency can be multiplied by a factor as high as 7 during freeze–thaw episodes and 26 when the mean rainfall intensity (since the beginning of the rainfall episode) is higher than 5  mm h − 1. Based on these results, a three-level scale has been proposed for predicting the temporal variations of rockfall frequency. The more precise database and freeze–thaw episode definition make it possible to distinguish different phases in freeze–thaw episodes: negative temperature cooling periods, negative temperature warming periods and thawing periods. It appears that rockfalls occur more frequently during warming and thawing periods than during cooling periods. It can be inferred that rockfalls are caused by thermal ice dilatation rather than by dilatation due to the phase transition. But they may occur only when the ice melts, because the cohesion of the <b>ice–rock</b> <b>interface</b> can be sufficient to hold the rock compartment which has been cut...|$|E
40|$|The Ortles-Cevedale Group was {{the setting}} of {{repeated}} clashes occurring under extreme conditions and at the highest altitudes of all fightings in the Great War (WWI). The research scenario associated with the group is very challenging because modern research faces a series of logistical and climatic obstacles. The gradual retreat of glaciers has unearthed several archaeological remains of WWI such as barracks, barbed wire, military ammunition, weapons and other materials. The study site is the saddle between M. Vioz and Punta Linke, where the Historic War Museum of Pejo, {{under the direction of}} the Archaeological Service of the Province of Trento (Soprintendenza per i Beni Culturali, Ufficio Beni Archeologici), started an archaeological excavation in the year 2009 of some of the infrastructure of the cableway station, which also includes a tunnel section in the bedrock. The saddle is placed at the head of Forni Glacier. GPR and seismic imaging was the best survey choice to characterize the glaciological and geo-archaeological context and to find structures or remains within the ice mass. Geophysical imaging spanned two campaigns in the years 2010 and 2011. The <b>ice-rock</b> <b>interface</b> was reconstructed in detail to depths greater than 45 - 50 m. The surface of the bedrock reveals a complex morphology, with several undulations and two rocky ridges elongated in the NNW-SSE direction. They identified some anomalous reflectors within the ice mass located near the western edge of the saddle of Punta Linke. The interpretation of radar profiles seems to indicate the presence of a tunnel in the ice, whose geometry and position is similar to others excavated in alpine glaciers during the Great War...|$|E
40|$|Glacial erosional systems {{exhibit a}} complex, highly scaledependent phenomenology. Some aspects of {{modelling}} {{the development of}} glacial erosional landforms in response to glacial erosional processes [...] . acting {{over a wide range}} of scales are considered. The physics of ice at the glacier sole is discussed. A simple ice-water mixture theory is proposed. A method for finding the solution of the equations of motion of ice at the glacier sole based on the finite element velocities-pressure formulation is shown, which includes novel formulations for the sliding boundary condition, compression of ice and flow of water between ice and bedrock. These finite element formulations are used to simulate flows at the <b>ice-rock</b> <b>interface.</b> The use of the Laplace equation in simulating uni-axial flow is also considered, and further simulations are carried out using this equation. The results from these finite element simulations are used to consider erosional processes occurring at the glacier bed. The processes of abrasion are considered, and previous models are shown to be physically inconsistent. Cavitation, transiency and heterogeneity are shown to have an effect on clast-bed contact forces, and the local viscosity of ice is identified as being a further controlling variable on abrasion. These results are used to consider the likely development of hummocks of bedrock. A mass-balance analysis of basal debris is carried out and shown to have an important effect on erosional patterns. The equations describing the movement of a surface normal to itself are considered. Various solution techniques for these equations are tested, and requirements for the persistence of form under lowering are given. The modelling strategy used in this thesis is a nested hierarchy, with the various hierarchical levels corresponding to different scales. The effect of this hierarchisation on the modelling is discussed with respect to the generic properties of the systems, explanation and testability...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrology}} of glaciers {{is known}} to have a significant influence on glacier dynamics. Rapid variations in dynamics can occur due to changes in the glacial and subglacial hydrology. However, our understanding of the subglacial drainage system is based on few direct and usually short-term observations. In this thesis, two decades of pressure measurements at the glacier bed are investigated. The measurements were carried out at the Svartisen Subglacial Laboratory in Northern Norway where load cells installed at the <b>ice-rock</b> <b>interface</b> under = 200 m of glacier ice record normal stress. A statistical study of the records for the period 1992 - 2014 demon- strates that the glacier bed response depends strongly on surface melt and the routing of subglacial water. Changes in subglacial hydrology cause several types of mechanical response at the glacier base. Water increases basal connectivity in summer whereas local processes, such as local ice flow, dominate the pressure signal in winter. The comparison of two summers with high, but contrasting connectivity (correlated vs anti-correlated pressure signal) demonstrates that fluctuations in meltwater input force a load transfer from the connected hydrological system to the unconnected part of the drainage system. Modelling of load transfer near a pressurised channel simulates the observed anti-correlated response in normal stress at the glacier bed. Daily pressure events are also investigated and characterise the response in pressure of the unconnected system, which differs from daily fluctuations in water pressure as measured in boreholes. The peak and decay in pressure that comprise these events are inferred to be a result of the stress bridging effect that occurs during the contraction of the drainage system. The peak in pressure is reproduced with an experiment where an artificial cavity contracts over the load cell and with a stress bridging model that incorporates shear stress transfer near a subglacial cavity. Observations from load cells and boreholes are not contradictory; instead they com- plement each other and help us characterise the mechanical and hydrological dynamics occurring at the glacier bed.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has revealed differing {{points of view}} {{as to whether the}} physical characteristics of glacial debris are determined by the lithology of eroded bedrock or are a function of the environment of transport and deposition. A gap exists in the literature concerning short distances of transportation where relatively soft sedimentary rocks predominate and the resultant eroded bedform morphologies. [...] In the proglacial zone of Yoho Glacier, British Columbia, there are seven main sedimentary lithologies which have been exposed by recent, post-Neoglacial recession. The beds lie across the former direction of ice movement. Both erosional and depositional surfaces are exposed and virtually unmodified by other geomorphic and subaerial processes. It is therefore possible to compare the bedrock erosion and comminution processes for varying adjacent sedimentary bedrock types under the same general ice conditions. [...] In order to gain an understanding of sub-glacial erosional processes from the examination of bedrock lithology, contents of related tills, and surface roughness, certain field and laboratory procedures were adopted and designed. In an attempt to combine glaciological and glacial-geological practices, certain procedures can be viewed as standard. Others have been adopted from the engineering and computer sciences disciplines to help demonstrate some physical and chemical characteristics of lithology, tills and surfaces (bedrock) that have in the past been given only passing examination. [...] Laboratory analyses conducted on till samples did not produce results that enable definite conclusions to be drawn about the relationship between bedrock type and their volumetric abundance in till. Although bimodality is observed in the grain size distribution curves with apparent terminal grade modes, it is doubtful that these characteristics are solely the result of either bedrock type, distance of transport, or mode of transport, but rather a combination of these. The excavation of large boulders and their subsequent deposition down-valley from their source (1. 5 km) clearly indicates that not all materials are greatly reduced in bulk. However, because bimodality is observed in all samples, the bedrock units were probably comminuted to some degree due to a combination of abrasion and plucking, in transport for up to 1. 5 km from their source. [...] To indicate the roughness of a given bedrock unit, the extent of each physical and chemical characteristic of the bedrock unit must be specified. It is hypothesized that 'ideal plane' or 'ideal sliding surface' configurations (surface roughness) of bedrock units need not necessarily be horizontally level to enhance glacier flow. Based on physical and chemical characteristics of bedrock types, and of glacier ice conditions at the <b>ice-rock</b> <b>interface,</b> each bedrock unit tends toward its own configuration which enhances flow and retards erosion. The roughness of a bedrock unit can be viewed as its morphological variation from its ideal plane or ideal sliding surface configuration which may not necessarily be a smooth surface (horizontally level). [...] The results of bedrock unit strength tests (susceptibility to erosion by physical and chemical processes), and of the ranking of bedrock units with reference to slope frequency distribution, ideal plane configuration and degree of horizontal levelness clearly indicates that over a given time period, relatively weaker bedrock units will erode to a smoother surface than stronger bedrock units...|$|E
