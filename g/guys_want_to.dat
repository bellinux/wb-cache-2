Sheffield recalls that McCartney ensured their cooperation by demanding: [...] "Do you <b>guys</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get fucking paid or not?" [...] During the first few takes, McCartney was unhappy {{about the lack of}} energy and passion in the orchestra's performance, so he stood up on the grand piano and started conducting the musicians from there.|$|E

500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour.

[...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why {{she thought it would}} be a good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E

5000|$|The thing I {{love about}} Ishtar, - and I love {{it with all}} of its flaws - is that it has a {{statement}} to make.
