25|$|Although it {{is widely}} thought that Another World {{expansion}} to 90 minutes was a cause of ratings erosion, the decision to expand the show was made {{at a time when}} its ratings (and that of NBC's other serials) were already in steady decline. During the period when Another World ran daily for 90 minutes it remained NBC's highest-rated soap opera, as it had been for a decade. In the second half of 1980, after the show returned to 60 minutes, Another World and fellow NBC serials <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Lives and, most dramatically, The Doctors, experienced a collapse in ratings from which NBC's daytime lineup never fully recovered. It would not be until 1983 that both <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives and Another World would recover some of their lost ground.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of a}} 15-year {{period between}} 1965 and 1980, Another World was NBC's highest-rated soap opera. During that time, NBC ran a 90-minute drama block {{consisting}} of <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives, The Doctors and Another World, all of which enjoyed great ratings and critical success before declining {{at the end of}} the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|As {{that year}} began, Another World was {{expanded}} to 60 minutes, {{with their first}} hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect As the World Turns, as the two shows were not in competition for {{anything other than the}} overall ratings win, CBS' afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put a dent in the ratings of both of CBS' popular afternoon game shows, The Price Is Right and Match Game. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network, elected {{to do the same thing}} with <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives beginning on April 21, 1975; this put <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives and As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring seven years after the last two 15-minute serials, Search for Tomorrow and The Guiding Light, expanded to 30 minutes.|$|E
