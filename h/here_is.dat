5|$|The phonological system {{described}} <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{the inventory}} of sounds of the standard spoken language, represented using appropriate symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).|$|E
5|$|Until around 1900, medical {{recipes and}} most European pharmacopoeias {{were written in}} Latin. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> a typical example {{from the middle of}} the 19th century.|$|E
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> the Laughing Brook {{laughing}} no longer. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> the Smiling Pool smiling no longer. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> a {{brand new}} pond deep in the Green Forest. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> a wall of logs and bushes and mud called a dam, built by some one whom nobody had seen. And <b>here</b> <b>was</b> Grandfather Frog asking Jerry Muskrat if his big cousin had {{come down from the}} North, when Jerry didn't even know that he had a big cousin.|$|R
6000|$|There was not {{the least}} doubt that Lady Baxby had been mistaken for her husband by this {{intriguing}} damsel. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> a pretty underhand business! <b>Here</b> <b>were</b> sly manoeuvrings! <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> faithlessness! <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> a precious assignation surprised in the midst! Her wicked husband, whom till this very moment she had ever deemed the soul of good faith--how could he! ...|$|R
60|$|Dorothea was {{altogether}} {{captivated by}} the wide embrace of this conception. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> something beyond the shallows of ladies' school literature: <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile complete knowledge with devoted piety; <b>here</b> <b>was</b> a modern Augustine who united the glories of doctor and saint.|$|R
5|$|A {{character}} {{who is a}} literary scholar at a fictional New England college in the comic campus novel by Pamela Hansford Johnson Night and Silence Who Is <b>Here?</b> <b>is</b> intent on proving that Emily Dickinson was a secret dipsomaniac. His obsession costs him his job.|$|E
5|$|A table {{comparing}} the different writing systems {{used for the}} Tajik alphabet. The Latin <b>here</b> <b>is</b> based on the 1929 standard, the Cyrillic on the revised 1998 standard, and Farsi letters are given in their stand-alone forms.|$|E
5|$|A third {{example was}} applied to bus 720 on route 3, with the legend 3 Connect. The base colour <b>here</b> <b>is</b> yellow, and was applied {{together}} with a new interpretation of the classic madder and white livery. The 3 Connect branding was replaced by The Lady Victoria branding in October 2010.|$|E
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> altruism, truly! <b>Here</b> <b>were</b> {{words that}} should have {{inspired}} Janet, yet she was silent. Mrs. Brocklehurst gazed at her solicitously.|$|R
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> a {{new phase}} in her life. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> a man willing to marry her {{even though she had}} no assured fortune.|$|R

5|$|Each area of his output can {{be further}} {{subdivided}} by form or by hypothetical period of composition. Since dating Josquin's compositions is particularly problematic, with scholarly consensus only achieved on a minority of works, discussion <b>here</b> <b>is</b> by type.|$|E
5|$|Five {{people have}} {{declined}} their {{election to the}} Federal Council by the Federal Assembly. Their number <b>here</b> <b>is</b> that of the Federal Councillor in the list above who was later elected in their place.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} {{viewpoints}} is at Minsterworth at the Severn Bore Inn on the A48. Another good place to see the spectacle is Over Bridge, but the view <b>here</b> <b>is</b> rather restricted by the adjacent railway bridge.|$|E
50|$|Purseni {{village is}} also popular {{as not only}} people from <b>here</b> <b>are</b> farmers, people from <b>here</b> <b>are</b> {{also a part of}} both {{national}} and international companies.|$|R
60|$|The Government saw {{no harm in}} all this; <b>here</b> <b>was</b> no Law broken, <b>here</b> <b>was</b> {{nothing but}} Oppression {{answered}} with Policy, and Mischief fenc'd against with Reason.|$|R
6000|$|I nearly {{cried out}} in my joy. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> communication! <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> companionship! I listened eagerly, and the nearer tapping, which I guessed must be Ed Morrell's, replied: ...|$|R
5|$|Pamiat' Merkuria was {{originally}} named Kagul {{and did not}} receive her name until 25 March 1907. This has caused much confusion {{between her and her}} sister Ochakov regarding construction data. Some of the data presented <b>here</b> <b>is</b> taken from Russian-language sources.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 artwork <b>here</b> <b>is</b> called In Memory of The Lost Battalion by Pablo Tauler. It uses nine support beams in the station's {{mezzanine}} {{wrapped in}} different materials— including glass, iron, and stainless steel—to honor {{the soldiers who}} served in the 77th Infantry Division during World War I.|$|E
5|$|The 28th edition is {{illustrated}} with 60, mostly small, engravings. There is a full-page frontispiece of the author, drawn by Auguste Hervieu and engraved by Samuel Freeman (1773–1857). Freeman {{is known for}} working mainly in stipple, and the portrait <b>here</b> <b>is</b> no exception.|$|E
60|$|But, I knew this:- <b>here</b> <b>was</b> the man, this sultry night, on {{his knees}} at my feet, because I was the Englishman's friend; <b>here</b> <b>were</b> his tears upon my dress; <b>here</b> <b>were</b> his sobs choking his utterance; <b>here</b> <b>were</b> his kisses on my hands, because they had touched the hands that had worked out his release. He {{had no need to}} tell me it would be {{happiness}} to him to die for his benefactor; I doubt if I ever saw real, sterling, fervent gratitude of soul, before or since.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the present}} {{instance}} <b>here</b> <b>was</b> his fact: American young married {{women are not}} pursued by the corruptor; and <b>here</b> <b>was</b> the question: What is it that protects her? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>was</b> {{a pretty}} complication! <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> my sister's {{handsome}} legacy made dependent on my outliving my grandmother! This was diverting enough; but Mr. Batterbury's conduct was more amusing still.|$|R
5|$|The contradiction <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{that high}} {{macroeconomic}} {{stability in the}} form of ongoing historically low inflation over time leads to economic problems, creating higher interest rates and political and economic instability for the weaker partners.|$|E
5|$|The entire Lackawanna {{region is}} idle. Week before last this region sent nearly 150,000 tons of coal to market. Last week {{it did not}} send any... The {{situation}} <b>here</b> <b>is</b> absolutely painful, {{and there is no}} knowing what moment an outbreak will occur.|$|E
5|$|The grammar <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{also based}} {{primarily}} on Khalkha Mongolian. Unlike the phonology, most of what is said about morphology and syntax also holds true for Chakhar, while Khorchin is somewhat more diverse.|$|E
50|$|Frenchpark - The Ciarrage groups <b>here</b> <b>were</b> {{the early}} lords of Airteach. Mac Donagh is cited as later lords of Airtech. The O'Flanagan <b>here</b> <b>were</b> {{hereditary}} stewards to the Kings of Connacht.|$|R
60|$|And {{now they}} had {{finished}} the rooms, but the matron, catching a glow from these enthusiastic pilgrims, had yet other things to show them. There was the back garden. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> the green pottery seat upon which the unphilosophic philosopher had smoked his pipe--a singularly cold and uncomfortable perch. And <b>here</b> <b>was</b> where Mrs. Carlyle had tried to build a tent and to imagine herself in the country. And <b>here</b> <b>was</b> the famous walnut tree--or at least the stumpy bole thereof. And <b>here</b> <b>was</b> where the dog Nero was buried, best known of small white mongrels.|$|R

5|$|The {{second example}} applies to new, buggy {{friendly}} vehicles on route 22, with the branding 22 Connect: Gyle + Edinburgh Park, City Centre, Ocean Terminal The base colour <b>here</b> <b>is</b> pink.|$|E

5|$|What we've got <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{failure to}} communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So {{you get what}} we had here last week. Which {{is the way he}} wants it. Well, he gets it. And I don't like it any more than you men.|$|E
