5000|$|At the Breeders' Cup {{meeting at}} Keeneland, Liam's Map's {{connections}} opted {{to miss a}} clash with American Pharoah in the Classic and instead contest the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile on 30 October. Shortly before the race {{it was announced that}} an interest in the horse had been bought by Lane's End and that Liam's Map would be retired to the Versailles, Kentucky-based stud for the 2016 season. In the Dirt Mile, Liam's Map started 1/2 favourite against ten opponents headed by Lea, with the others including Red Vine, Wicked Strong, Bradester (Monmouth Cup), Tapiture (runner-up in the race in 2014), War Envoy (Britannia Stakes), Mr Z (Ohio Derby) and Valid. Castellano tracked the leaders as Bradester set the pace before switching out to make his challenge in the straight. Liam's Map overtook Lea inside the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a half lengths. Lea took second, three and a quarter lengths ahead of Red Vine who was in turn three and a quarter lengths clear of Wicked Strong in fourth. Castellano explained that he had intended to lead from the start and had to change his tactics when the colt did not break as quickly as expected. He commented [...] "In this game {{you have to have a}} Plan B. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> was patience. He waited behind horses and it was phenomenal. He showed great skill. He can run on the pace or off the pace. I had to fight a little to put him behind horses, but when he was in the clear, he exploded".|$|E

Footage for the series was shot in rural Somerset and Wiltshire, with the Saxon Tithe Barn in Bradford-on Avon functioning as the great hall of Nottingham Castle, Great Chalfield Manor in Melksham doubling as Maid Marion's family home, and numerous battles were shot at Leaford Grange and Nettleton Mill near Castle Combe, locations which Mantle considered to be [...] "wonderfully realised and breathtaking". The waterfall scene for the quarterstaff battle between Robin and Little John in the first episode [...] "Robin Hood and the Sorcerer" [...] was shot at Bowood House.

60|$|In {{the course}} of his reply Senator Douglas remarked in {{substance}} that he had always considered this government was made for the white people and not for the negroes. Why, in point of mere fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so too. But in this remark of the Judge there is a significance which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to <b>the</b> great mistake (if there is any such mistake) which he has made in this Nebraska measure. It shows that the Judge has no very vivid impression that the negro is human, and consequently has no idea that there can be any moral question in legislating about him. In his view the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter of as utter indifference as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horned cattle. Now, whether this view is right or wrong, it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view. They consider slavery a great moral wrong, and their feeling against it is not evanescent, but eternal. It lies at the very foundation of their sense of justice, and it cannot be trifled with. It is a great and durable element of popular action, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> no statesman can safely disregard it.|$|R
40|$|Patriarchy is an {{ideology}} {{which refers to}} men?s dominance in all spheres of life. In my study I trace it through family life in which the father holds {{the authority of the}} family, and later from the work place and the life of female criminals in prison. In this novel these institutions are proven to perform the patriarchal ideology and they oppress women, especially Grace. Therefore, in this thesis I want to reveal how the patriarchal system oppresses Grace and how she struggles to liberate herself. In order to analyze this work I choose cultural approach utilizing feminist concepts with the concepts of patriarchal ideology in family and society. My finding is that patriarchal ideology uses family, work place and prison to oppress Grace. Moreover, the unequal power division between man and woman may be the source of female oppression. Finally, Grace struggles to fight back the oppression and has made a great contribution toward her own life. Therefore, I conclude that patriarchal oppression is unavoidable but in order to fight back, self-awareness is firstly important and after that taking the action. To be free and not to be submissive <b>I</b> <b>think</b> are <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> of Grace?s success; she is not afraid of those who oppress her and she also has self-protection from anybody that might harm her...|$|R
40|$|The {{teaching}} of computational economics to graduate students has mostly {{been in a}} single course {{with a focus on}} algorithms and computer code. The shortcoming of this approach is that it neglects {{one of the most important}} aspects of computational economics- namely model development skills. These skills are the ability to conceptualize the science, engineering and economics of a problem and to convert that understanding first to a mathematical model and then to a computational representation in a software system. Thus I recommend that a two course sequence in computational economics be created for graduate students with the first course focusing on model development skills and the second course on algorithms and the speed and accuracy of computer codes. I believe that a model development course is most helpful to graduate students when it introduces the students to a wide variety of computational models created by past generations and ask them to first make small modification in order to better understand the models, the mathematics and the software. This, in turn, is followed by encouraging them to make more substantial modifications of the student’s own choosing so as to move the models in directions that permit the students to address current economic problems. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> element of this process is it enhancement of the creative abilities of our students. 1.

5000|$|... "I {{was quite}} lucky with the safety car, and I didn't really expect to win, but this feeling is amazing. I still can't believe it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> {{was doing what}} I heard from one guy before the start. He said the thing is {{to stay out of}} trouble on the first lap - so I did that. Yesterday I was {{thinking}} to attack a lot in the first moments, but staying out of trouble in tight moments was the key for winning this race. So when the second safety car came and I was second, I knew I had my chance. My top speed was really good today and I could overtake Marco Wittmann. But I had to really concentrate when I overtook him under braking, because I nearly crashed into the wall. I cannot believe how lucky I am to win this race. When I was in first place on that lap he took the lead, I had never made so many mistakes in my life. I was lucky that the guy in P2, I think it was Yuhi Sekiguchi, was not really a serious contender for the win. So I pushed really hard in the second sector and I made so many mistakes as I was shaking in the car, honestly. I tried to stay calm and concentrate on pushing a lot in the second sector, so Felipe Nasrcould not get close to the slipstream. Then the safety car came out and it was all over. On the last lap with the safety car I have never cried that much in my life!" [...] Daniel Juncadella, after becoming the first Spaniard to win the Macau Grand Prix. At the next restart, Wittmann did not hold the lead like he had done previously; such was the slipstream of the other cars, that Wittmann finished the tenth lap in fifth place. Juncadella took the lead, with Sekiguchi moving into second place almost unnoticed, barging his way past Nasr into Lisboa, with van Asseldonk following close behind. Nasr eventually found his way back past Sekiguchi into second place, and after closing back in on van Asseldonk, Wittmann reeled off times in the 2:12 bracket even while passing the Hitech driver. Wittmann then set the fastest lap of the race on lap 13, while passing Sekiguchi for third place. Just like in the Qualification Race, the race was finished under neutralised safety car conditions after two separate incidents on lap 14 of the race. At the Mandarin, Yamauchi made an error after being passed by Foresti, and caused a chain reaction within the next few cars to approach the incident. Magnussen was trying to pass Buller, and went over the back over his car at 165 mph, flying into the catch-fencing {{on the outside of the}} circuit, but escaped with just a left knee injury. Lloyd braked to avoid the incident but was hit from behind by Sainz; as a result, Lloyd was taken to the circuit's medical centre for a checkup. Sims was also involved, and retired as well.|$|E

NST (Tan, 1998) questioned CNBC’s objectivity for reporting in a consistently critical fashion the Malaysian government’s decision to impose capital controls. They pointed out that media organisations like CNBC have a vested interest in opposing such measures to control the “free flow of capital ” because their survival depended on “going where US money flows”...|$|E
40|$|Sam Shepard {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{contemporary}} American playwrights, yet in Hungary barely more than a handful of people (except for scholars and academic circles) know his name, despite the fact that his most successful plays are available in Hungarian as well, thanks to Árpád Göncz and Mária Révész. The obscurity of Shepard is particularly intriguing if we consider his thematic occupa-tions: he is far from being elitist and abstract. The wide range of themes he deals with in his plays includes everyday problems like love, family and personal fulfillment (amongst others). As the reader can see, these are issues that everybody has to deal with at one point in their lives. What is more, they universally apply both to Americans, and Hungarians (and every other people in the wide world). This unexplainable anonymity of Shepard is exactly why I chose him (and my favorite play by him, Buried Child) to be the subject of <b>the</b> present thesis. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to un-locking <b>the</b> secret of Shepard’s unpopularity in Hungary lies in the text of his plays, or to be more precise, the way he conveys meaning in his plays.

40|$|Abstract What {{is certain}} is that {{mathematics}} cannot possibly be a valid means (to advances in economic understanding) unless and until it is used properly. That means that dimensions must be used consistently and correctly. Barnett (Barnett, Quart J Austrian Econ, pp. 27 - 46, 2003) is about problems {{with the use of}} mathematics in economics involving the failure to use dimensions/units consistently and correctly. Professor Emeritus Folsom and Professor Gonzalez (Folsom and Gonzalez, Quart J Austrian Econ, pp. 45 - 65, 2005), hereinafter F&G, say, essentially, that what is correct therein is not new and that what is new is not correct. Additionally, they imply, by raising them, that I did not address issues that I should have, e. g., how to introduce dimensions into introductory economics and problems with the Cobb-Douglas (CD) function unrelated to dimensions. Herein, because of space limitations, I respond only to some oftheir criticisms. Responses to others are posted on the Ludwig von Mises Institute Working Papers site.

Those last Enallagma civile added a dash of blue {{to the edge of}} ponds, flying in tandem {{as if it were the}} height of the season for them. What a season it has been! With several collectors in the northern lower peninsula, and a number of great collecting trips in the south, the MOS has really made some good progress this year. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> point to made from this season is to not get complacent about what's in your "backyard. " Some of us have very interesting back yards- ask Carl Freeman in Arcadia (Benzie Co.), and he can point out Nannothemis bella and Cordulegaster diastatops in his "backyard. " Likewise, I have collected more times in Washtenaw Co. than in previous years, and have added a number of species to the Washtenaw Co. list (elsewhere in this issue). I spent a day with Carl in Manistee and Benzie Counties in late June, and thoroughly enjoyed collecting near his house and also on the Manistee River. Carl is a talented photographer, birder, and well-known wildlife artist, and this year he really got interested in the Odonata that occur in his area. Carl photographed a Gomphaeschna furcillata near the Betsie River, making it the second LP locality, and sent me photos of Cordulegaster diastatops. I just had to go up there and see what the habitats were like. We collected in Manistee National Forest along a slough near the Manistee River, and found Enallagma antennatum, E. carunculatum, E. hageni, E. ebrium, Chromagrion conditum...|$|E
40|$|As I {{write this}} editorial, I am on an airplane, {{reflecting}} on the EBLIP 6 conference, held June 27 - 30, 2011 in Salford, U. K. In my personal opinion, the conference was a great success. There were {{a wide variety of}} concurrent paper sessions from an international group of delegates, thought provoking keynotes, and {{just the right amount of}} social activity, including the main conference dinner at the Manchester United Football Club! This journal will have a Feature section in our next issue (December) that highlights the conference, including keynote presentations, some of the papers that were presented, and commentaries from attendees about the conference itself. So for now, I’ll just offer my warmest congratulations to the organizers. As I left Salford and tried to reflect on what I had learned and discussed with others, there were many things that came to mind. Immediate things that stood out for me had to do with impact, reflection, and the complexity of decision making. The theme of EBLIP 6 was “Valuing Knowledge and Expertise”. This is a somewhat controversial theme for an evidence based practice conference, where research evidence and its implementation are the focus, and expert opinion is not generally held in high regard. None of the keynote speakers’ presentations spoke directly to the theme, however several paper presentations did include some reference to the importance of professional knowledge. Expertise is a loaded word, filled with notions of snobbery and over-confidence, even close-mindedness. If anything, those involved with EBLIP remove themselves as far from the notion of “expert” as they can. But if we consider an expert to be someone who has built up a significant amount of professional knowledge (both through experience and research) on a topic, then the EBLIP movement should not simply dismiss this notion of “expert”. Perhaps, we more appropriately should consider expert voices (knowledgeable, reasonable, experienced voices) as ones that we need to listen to as another source of evidence within our profession. Reflecting on this made me realise that in my own professional approach, I often seek out different experts depending upon the questions I am trying to answer. When I was a newer librarian, my more senior colleagues were the experts I learned from and they gave me guidance at that point in my career. Now, when starting new projects, I may consult experts from other institutions to help me by passing on their knowledge of something that is new to me; and I, in turn, do the same for other librarians. That consultation is a starting point, a guidepost, and yes, I certainly value it. Without it, where does one even begin? As someone who tries to be evidence based in my practice, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> is to not stop with that expert opinion, but to build upon it, test it, ensure that it works in a given context. That process usually involves research evidence and local data, and a quest to build upon previous professional knowledge. The theme of EBLIP 6 was perfect. It came at a time when evidence based practice in LIS is looking inward. There were many people presenting similar thoughts – about just how complex decision making is, how there are other forms of evidence besides research, that practice is messy, and that the EBLIP model is perhaps a bit too simple. We need to think about values, about what we already know, and how to build on that knowledge without simply being dismissive. We also need to look at the model we hold up as an evidence based one, and test it – there needs to be more research on evidence based practice itself. The conference reinforced for me that EBLIP is at an exciting point where we have moved into a reflective phase that is sure to result in growth and change. The conference taught me that we must value knowledge and expertise, but at the same time, also question knowledge and expertise. We should acknowledge and embrace the complexity of the work we do as LIS professionals, and be glad it never fits in a tidy box. Each and every one of us uses our own knowledge and expertise to assist with deciding what to do in a situation, and if we are active, conscious professionals, our knowledge continues to grow and our minds remain open to new possibilities. Valuing our profession and why we do this work, requires such openness and above all else drives us to make the best decisions we can at a particular point in time. I think of EBLIP as a movement within LIS that strengthens our knowledge and expertise as a profession by reminding our professional community of the importance of both doing and using research. The scientific aspect of our work continually needs to be reinforced and built upon. Paired with professional knowledge and expertise, we may have a winning combination...|$|E
