The results illustrate that the reliability and efficiency of existing drive system are lower. Therefore, improvement measures are proposed: use high-quality bush roller chain that shall be regularly maintained and changed; the chain drive shall be replaced with gear drive. <b>Ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is a washing <b>machine.</b> The traditional <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is mainly equipped {{with one or two}} rollers; modern <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> consists 3 ~ 6 rollers for high efficiency, so which is called multi-roller <b>ironing</b> <b>machine.</b> Chain drive in the machine has simple structure, costs low and is easy to maintain, but gear and chain slippage even chain scission accident can happen after wear [1]. Multi-roller <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is a continuous-working machine, so serious accident due to poor quality can be caused by failure in the drive system.
