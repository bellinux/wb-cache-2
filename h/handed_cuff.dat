50|$|Such {{restraints}} {{are often}} used in the United States in courtrooms, or for transporting prisoners, or in other public situations as a safeguard against escape. They are used above all when detainees are to be restrained {{over a longer period}} of time, for example during transport or at court hearings. The reason for the use of belly chains is that there still remains a relatively large freedom of movement to the detainee when his <b>hands</b> are <b>cuffed</b> in front of the body. As an alternative, the <b>hands</b> could be <b>cuffed</b> behind the detainee's back, but this will soon inflict discomfort and even pain when being handcuffed like this for a longer period of time. Therefore, as a more gentle but almost equally secure alternative to <b>cuffing</b> the detainee's <b>hands</b> behind his back, the <b>hands</b> are <b>cuffed</b> to a belly chain and thus shackled to the detainee's waist.|$|R
