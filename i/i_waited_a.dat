He wanted his brother to win. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> little. The infernal bank-note still tempted me. In {{spite of}} myself, I tried him again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{moment for}} Marble to recover his self-command, and then {{urged him to}} {{continue}} his story.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a startling}} discovery, my dear child--there {{is no denying}} that. Shall <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little, and let you recover yourself?" ...|$|R
60|$|HOW {{long was}} I {{left alone in}} the {{carriage}} {{at the door of}} Mrs. Van Brandt's lodgings? Judging by my sensations, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> half <b>a</b> life-time. Judging by my watch, <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> half <b>an</b> hour.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no more," [...] said Noie, [...] "for {{the leaves}} of yonder tree are deadly poison, and here grows no other living thing. Still, eat and live on, for <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> message." ...|$|R
60|$|At length {{the train}} {{came along and}} she was off. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few moments longer and then drove away.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{asks for}} her valise {{to be sent}} to her town address," [...] Mrs Fyne uttered reluctantly and stopped. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> bit--then exploded.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> second. [...] "No," [...] I answered, slowly. [...] "I {{have not}} been practising of late. I am looking about me. I travel for enjoyment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope it will}} be {{confined}} to that!" [...] She had now let go my hand; she turned away <b>a</b> little. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>an</b> instant; then <b>I</b> brought out: [...] "Go to church. Goodbye. I must watch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I swear, Harmachis!--I swear! May {{everlasting}} torments, too hideous to be dreamed--more hideous, even, by far, {{than those}} that wring me now--be my portion if I fail thee in one jot or tittle--ay, though <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> lifetime for thy word!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he replied, [...] "I {{have been}} put off long enough! You must let me in, you must talk with me for half an hour. I will go then, I promise. Half an hour! Elizabeth, haven't <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>an</b> eternity for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, gone, {{and there}} stood Bougwan {{staring at the}} wall like one asleep, and {{presently}} he went too, and <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> while and came away also.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With those words, he {{released}} {{me from the}} sight of him. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> minute alone, to recover myself in the air, {{and then returned to}} the house.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{considerable}} time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought. Presently {{he closed the}} catch of his bag with a snap, and said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend of mine you {{may have}} heard of," [...] he said, [...] "asked me to leave this with you. I am {{catching}} the Princess Cecilia from Southampton tomorrow. I thought, perhaps, if <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>an</b> hour or so, I might take the answer back with me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little, {{to enjoy}} the full luxury of hearing him say those words--to revel in the love and the {{gratitude}} that moisten his dear eyes as they look at me. Then I rouse my resolution, and put the momentous question on which our future depends.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>an</b> hour. <b>I</b> {{read the}} Ladies Companion for 1912, the Girls Magazine for 1902 and the Infants Journal for 1888. I {{began to see}} that I had done an unwarrantable thing in {{breaking}} in on the privacy of this man's scientific pursuits with a face like mine.|$|R
60|$|And {{that was}} all I {{got in the way}} of a wigging. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> little while and then went out, {{shutting}} carefully the door of the state- room after me.|$|E
6000|$|I waited {{till the}} noise of his {{footsteps}} had died out of the dining-room, and <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> little longer. Then turning towards the distant door I raised my voice along the verandah: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{little to}} give Mrs. Clements time to compose herself. Was {{the light that}} I {{had been looking for}} so long glimmering on me--far off, as yet--in the good woman's {{recollections}} of Anne's early life? ...|$|E
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} I got {{him and his}} {{correspondence}} into the motor, {{and he had the}} decency to ask whether he had been unpolished over-night. I replied that <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>an</b> apology. This he made excuse for renewed arguments, and used wayside shows as illustrations of the decadence of England.|$|R

6000|$|Graham {{sat down}} abruptly. [...] "I suppose since <b>I</b> have <b>waited</b> {{so long to}} resume life," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>I</b> must <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{would be}} a good place to learn history. Now I must be going. Don't forget to give the note. I shall have to say that <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> long while before I found anyone. Goodbye, Godfrey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{turn will}} come," [...] I said. [...] "But, remember, {{there is no}} weak place in his life {{that we know of}} yet." [...] <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> little to let her recover her self-possession, and then spoke the decisive words-- ...|$|E
60|$|The old {{man with}} the cough jerked his head back so {{suddenly}} that it startled me, and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under the shade; but no one answered me. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> minute, glancing {{from one to the}} other.|$|E
6000|$|The new world's wisest did {{surround}} [...] Me; and it pains me {{to record}} [...] I {{did not think}} their views profound, [...] Or their conclusions well assured; [...] The simple life I can't afford, [...] Besides, I {{do not like the}} grub-- [...] <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> mash and sausage, [...] "scored"-- [...] Will someone take me to a pub? ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{grunted and}} went on eating. <b>I</b> <b>waited.</b> After <b>a</b> couple of minutes he looked up with an I-thought-you-were-gone {{expression}} on his face, and demanded:-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{little before}} I trusted myself to say any more. In {{that moment of}} silence, I hardly know which I felt most keenly--the sting which her {{contempt}} had planted in me, or the proud resolution which shut me out from all community with her distress.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{moment to}} give her breathing-time. Just as {{we were about to}} proceed she stopped me again, and signed to me with her hand to listen once more. We both heard {{distinctly}} a long, heavy sigh behind us, in the black depths of the trees.|$|E
60|$|With a stifled exclamation, the hesitating girl {{vanished}} {{out of the}} path. A bush near by rustled; then silence. I waited wondering. The {{lights on}} the verandah went out. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> while longer then continued down the path to my boat, wondering more than ever.|$|E
5000|$|Rocky {{is based}} on Kellerman's own life. According to Kellerman, [...] "My friends are just such perfect cartoon characters. A lot of times they say things and all I {{have to do is}} write it down. Their personalities match and {{complement}} each other so well, it's impossible not to write it down. If <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> while, even the upsetting stuff they can still laugh about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{promised him}} {{it should be}} <b>a</b> secret. <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> in <b>a</b> perfect frenzy of expectation. Twice he tried to begin, and twice his courage failed him.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>waited</b> <b>an</b> {{hour and}} then {{concluded}} {{the thing was}} square. I slid down the tree, got the note, slipped along the fence till I struck the woods, and {{was back at the}} cave in another half an hour. I opened the note, got near the lantern and read it to Bill. It was written with a pen in a crabbed hand, and the sum and substance of it was this: ...|$|R
