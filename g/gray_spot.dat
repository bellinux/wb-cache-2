6000|$|I saw {{the little}} fellow again, {{in a curious}} way, a few nights later. A wild storm was raging over the woods. Under its lash the great trees writhed and groaned; and the [...] "voices"--that strange {{phenomenon}} of the forest and rapids--were calling wildly through {{the roar of the}} storm and the rush of rain on innumerable leaves. I had gone out on the old wood road, to lose myself for a little while in the intense darkness and uproar, and to feel again the wild thrill of the elements. But the night was too dark, the storm too fierce. Every few moments I would blunder against a tree, which told me I was off the road; and to lose the road meant to wander all night in the storm-swept woods. So I went back for my lantern, with which I again started down the old cart path, a little circle of wavering, jumping shadows about me, the one <b>gray</b> <b>spot</b> in the midst of universal darkness.|$|E

The forewings {{are dark}} brown, {{with a slight}} reddish luster and a small silvery <b>gray</b> <b>spot</b> {{at the base of}} the costa, as well as a brilliant silvery fascia just before the middle and a narrow silvery spot at the tornus.

50|$|Central serous {{retinopathy}} (CSR), {{also known}} as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC or CSCR), is an eye disease which causes visual impairment, often temporary, usually in one eye. When the disorder is active it is characterized by leakage of fluid under the retina that has a propensity to accumulate under the central macula. This results in blurred or distorted vision (metamorphopsia). A blurred or <b>gray</b> <b>spot</b> in the central visual field is common when the retina is detached. Reduced visual acuity may persist after the fluid has disappeared.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{symptoms}} of <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot</b> {{can be seen}} on leaves as small, spherical lesions with a yellow halo around them. These first lesions may be tan or brown before fungal sporulation begins. The initial disease can be hard to identify as <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot</b> at this stage because it looks similar to eyespot and common rust. However, as the lesions mature, they elongate into rectangular, narrow, brown to <b>gray</b> <b>spots</b> that usually develop on the lower leaves and spread upward on the plant during the season. The lesions elongate and expand parallel to the leaf veins and can be 1.5 to 2 inches long. With favorable weather the lesions can rapidly merge and kill the entire leaf. Mature <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot</b> symptoms can also be confused with {{symptoms of}} anthracnose leaf blight.|$|R

There is a cinnamon colored dorsal stripe {{running from the}} crown of the head or the shoulders {{to the end of}} the tail. The head of this species has a pale neutral <b>gray</b> <b>spot</b> above the nose, cinnamon around the eyes, a clay colored crown, and eras that are light neutral gray. The dorsal side of the tail is cinnamon colored while the ventral side is grayish-beige on the most distal two-thirds and cinnamon with faint brownish black streaks on the proximal one-third. The hands and feet are colored grayish-white and the vibrissae are dark in color. This species has a relatively robust skull.|$|E

40|$|A target <b>gray</b> <b>spot</b> looks darker {{on a white}} {{background}} than on a black one: the contrast illusion. If the target is embedded in a context consisting of black spots on the {{white background}} and white spots on the black background, the effect reverses: the dungeon illusion. Whether the dungeon figure produces contrast or contrast reversal depends on which of its three parts (target, context, and background) is gray, black, or white. In some variants, the effect further depends on whether the figures are themselves surrounded by larger white and black regions, implying that even the illumination and wall color of the laboratory might be critical. Here, the various versions of the dungeon illusion are presented and explained {{with the help of}} the double-anchoring theory of lightness—that computes the gray shade of objects by “anchoring ” them both to their context and to the brightest region in the scene...|$|E
40|$|Diseases {{are one of}} the {{limiting}} factors to bean production in L. A.

5000|$|If available, {{choosing}} a maize hybrid that is resistant to <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot</b> {{is the most}} cost-effective way to control the disease. No maize hybrid is completely immune to <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot,</b> but there are varieties that have very good levels of resistance. Most seed companies have a <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot</b> resistance rating for their hybrids that are available. As far as controlling Pyricularia grisea, ryegrass, tall fescue, and St. Augustinegrass are all fairly susceptible to <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot</b> and neither of them are considered resistant. Planting other types of grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass, bentgrass, or annual bluegrass {{would be a lot}} more beneficial as they are not affected by <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot.</b> Managing crop residue is another important thing to keep in mind when trying to control <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot.</b> Continuous corn and a no-till or reduced tillage system are at a very high risk for disease development because of the amount of residue being left on the soil surface. Rotating crops away from corn followed by tillage is recommended to prevent disease in the subsequent crop. In fields with a history of grey leaf spot with a no-till system, a two-year rotation may be needed. [...] Using fungicides effectively can also reduce the amount of diseased crops and help stop the spread of <b>gray</b> leaf <b>spot.</b> Some research has shown that strobilurin and strobilurin/triazole fungicides are the most effective at preventing yield loss from the disease. Fungicides should be applied when lesions are first seen on basal leaves. A secondary application may be needed 30 days after the first application depending on the weather conditions.|$|R
