2500|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the longitudinal}} input shaft (or prop shaft) to the pinion, which in turn drives the transverse ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an axle housing, or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the engine crankshaft and the <b>gearbox</b> <b>shafts</b> transverse, and with the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel. A differential consists of one input, the drive shaft, and two outputs which are the two drive wheels, however the rotation of the drive wheels are coupled to each other by their connection to the roadway. [...] Under normal conditions, with small tire slip, the ratio of the speeds of the two driving wheels is defined by the ratio of the radii of the paths around which the two wheels are rolling, which in turn is determined by the track-width of the vehicle (the distance between the driving wheels) and the radius of the turn.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} aimed at {{providing}} a computerised design procedure based on Australian Standard AS 1403 : 1979, 2 ̆ 7 Design of Steel Shafts for Transmission of Power 2 ̆ 7 which is a metrication and revision of ASB 249 : 1969, 2 ̆ 7 Recommendations for the Design of Shafts for Cranes and Hoists 2 ̆ 7, which it supersedes. The presentation given in AS 1403 and particularly ASB 249 lends itself to computerised calculations owing to the rigorous design procedure and time required for complete analysis. The programme {{has the capacity to}} analyse shafts supported by two bearings, being either simply-supported or cantilevered and is best suited to the design of <b>gearbox</b> <b>shafts.</b> The programme may also be used to analyse drive shafts where the peak shaft torque is entered directly in the input data. Shafts with one or two gears being either spur, helical or double-helical type may be analysed. AS 1403 also provides for- the design of hollow construction shafts. In keeping with modern design practice, a comprehensive array of gear and bearing fits have been provided. Optimisation in this study {{is aimed at}} developing a solution criterion for minimising the shaft diameter. Recent design practice requires reduced shaft diameters where possible in order to locate components and reduce drive inertia. Savings in material and manufacturing costs can thus be expected. Execution of the optimisation programme follows entry of all input data in the required format. Within the data arrays, all geometrical restrictions and operational requirements are detailed. The programme does not rely on the designer 2 ̆ 7 s need to use 2 ̆ 7 previous experience 2 ̆ 7 in shaft design. Following all calculations in which the resultant geometry of the shaft has been optimised, a data sheet containing all relevant input and calculated data is produced including shaft diameters at all critical locations along the shaft. In addition, the slopes and deflections at gears and bearings are displayed with which to compare with manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations. As an aid in the presentation of final shaft geometry, computer graphics has been utilised. Each gearbox shaft analysed may be displayed on a single frame in which all critical shaft diameters and relevant data are shown...|$|E
40|$|This paper evaluates {{methods used}} for {{separating}} vibrations {{produced by a}} gear transmission from the vibration signal acquired on the gearbox. The paper presents a novel method for evaluating the algorithms used for this separation. The evaluation method {{takes into account the}} statistical reliability of the results achieved on multiple sets of signals acquired on the same machine and conditions. The signal separation was applied in order to process data obtained during an experiment carried out with the aim of analyzing the influence of a torque load affecting a gearbox on the vibrations produced by the gear transmission. It is supposed that the vibration characteristics of the gear transmission are strongly affected by the value of the torque load influencing the <b>gearbox</b> <b>shafts.</b> This influence is analyzed using the vibration signal acquired on the gearbox housing. The vibration signal contains significant disturbances, and its interpretation is unclear. The vibration signal generated by the gear transmission can be separated using methods that make it possible to select the valid features included in the signal. Methods for feature selection which implement a systematic search in the state space and methods based on the genetic algorithm were applied. The genetic algorithm poses a robust stochastic global search in the state space that is well suited to deal with nonlinear problems and also shortens the necessary computing time. The evaluation and comparison of the results achieved during the separation process using different methods have to be taken into account. In the case of signal separation, it is important to evaluate differences between the results achieved during particular executions of the separation process performed by the same method on different datasets which were acquired {{in the case of the}} same experiment and conditions. Methods with results that vary, or that are different from the results given by other methods, are assumed not to be statistically reliable. It is also necessary to penalize methods leading to results that can vary greatly in some executions according to the scatter data. Conversely, methods that give results varying around the right set of features seem more acceptable. A novel method for rating the statistical reliability of the results has been proposed. This method is essential for methods using a stochastic search in the state space. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{low speed}} <b>gearboxes,</b> <b>shaft</b> {{rotation}} and Gear Mesh Frequencies are lower and closer requiring higher spectral resolution {{in order to}} identify each one. Normally this problem is avoided increasing the acquisition time. Nevertheless, sometimes load and speed are variables, so the working period on stationary conditions is shorter. In these cases, it is useful to apply other kinds of tools such as the high resolution parametric methods. In this work a parametric method is applied in the misalignment detection of low-speed gears.

5000|$|Automatic and semi-automatics {{typically}} use a {{centrifugal clutch}} which operates {{in a different}} fashion. At idle, the engine is disconnected from the <b>gearbox</b> input <b>shaft,</b> allowing both it and the bike to freewheel (unlike torque converter automatics, there is no [...] "idle creep" [...] with a properly adjusted centrifugal clutch). As the throttle is opened and engine speed rises, counterweights attached to movable inner friction surfaces (connected to the engine shaft) within the clutch assembly are thrown gradually further outwards, until they start {{to make contact with}} the inside of the outer housing (connected to the <b>gearbox</b> <b>shaft)</b> and transmit an increasing amount of engine power. The effective [...] "bite point" [...] is found automatically by equilibrium where the power being transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the engine can provide. This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the engine will be turning near its maximum-torque rpm) without the engine slowing or bogging down, as well as more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle settings and rpms.|$|R
