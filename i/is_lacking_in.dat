The male can be distinguished from Z.rufipes by the large spot of white scales {{at the beginning of}} the thoracic slope (which <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp (Z. rufipes has a transverse division).

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Caribbean reef shark as Near Threatened; its population has declined off Belize and Cuba from overfishing and exploitation continues in other regions. They are also {{threatened by the}} degradation and destruction of their coral reef habitat. Commercial fishing for this species is prohibited in United States waters. They are protected in the Bahamas due to their significance to ecotourism, {{as well as in}} a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) off Brazil and elsewhere. However, enforcement against illegal fishing <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> some of these reserves, and many areas in which this species is abundant are not protected.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few years}} of the end of World War II, the United States {{deactivated}} all of its remaining battleships and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four Iowa-class battleships were not, and on several occasions {{one or more of these}} four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four Iowa-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as long as they did. The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive power that <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

25|$|The {{differences}} between attested Proto-Norse and unattested Proto-Germanic are rather small. Separating Proto-Norse from Northwest Germanic {{can be said}} {{to be a matter of}} convention, as sufficient evidence from the remaining parts of the Germanic-speaking area (Northern Germany and the Netherlands) <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> a degree to provide sufficient comparison. Inscriptions found in Scandinavia are considered to be in Proto-Norse. Several scholars argue about this subject matter. Wolfgang von Krause sees the language of the runic inscriptions of the Proto-Norse period as an immediate precursor to Old Norse, but Elmer Antonsen views them as Northwest Germanic, but his views on Runic Script and related subjects might be considered extreme.|$|E

Many have never heard of Ozma, making it impossible for them to acknowledge her as their rightful queen.

The Lost Princess of Oz, for instance is set entirely in rough country in Winkie Country, between two settled areas. In Glinda of Oz, Ozma speaks of her duty to discover all these stray corners of Oz.|$|E

25|$|Some {{practices}} of manipulation and adulteration {{have gone through}} stages of being considered fraudulent and later accepted as common practice. One {{of these is the}} practice of blending other grape varieties in order to add a characteristic that <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> the original wine. This most often occurred {{in the case of a}} wine lacking color. A wine with a deep dark color is often associated with being of a higher quality, so blending a darker color variety (or a teinturier) into a lighter wine could enhance the marketability of the wine. Today the practice of blending grape varieties together is commonly accepted (such as blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot), except where such blending is against the regulation of a particular appellation (such as the controversy over the Brunellopoli scandal in Brunello di Montalcino).|$|E
25|$|There is one {{mutation}} {{found in}} patients with classical Timothy syndrome, G406R, located just past the 6th membrane spanning segment of domain 1 (D1S6). The conserved glycine at this position seems to be vital for proper voltage dependent inactivation as the mutant <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> this respect. Atypical Timothy syndrome mutations are similar, one being the identical G406R mutation in the other splice form and the second mutation being G402S, located a few amino acids upstream. The effect of these mutations on channel function {{is identical to the}} G406R mutation in classical Timothy syndrome. The lack of proper voltage-dependent inactivation in these mutants causes prolonged inward current and depolarization during cardiac action potentials. This leads to long QT syndrome and resultant arrhythmia. Because exon 8 has greater expression in the heart versus exon 8a, patients with atypical Timothy syndrome have worsened cardiac defects compared to those with the classical form.|$|E
25|$|Brazil is {{a country}} with highly diverse levels of {{development}} across its 27 states. The southern and southeastern regions show a much higher level of industrialization and scientific development than the northern ones, some of which encroach on the Amazonian forest and river basin. The centre-west is Brazil’s agricultural and cattle-raising powerhouse and has been developing rapidly recently. The starkest example of this contrast is the southeastern State of São Paulo. Home to 22% (44 million) of the country’s 202 million inhabitants, it generates about 32% of GDP and a similar share of the nation’s industrial output. It also {{has a very strong}} state system of public research universities that <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> most other states and hosts the well-established São Paulo Research Foundation. The State of São Paulo is responsible for 46% of GERD (public and private expenditure) and 66% of business R It hosts 10 of the country's 18 research universities.|$|E

25|$|Animal persons (usually {{mammals and}} birds, but {{including}} insects) appear {{to enjoy a}} relative autonomy which <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> {{the case of the}} animal 'co-essences'. Perhaps representing the transformed human beings of a former creation, they play varying social roles. In the Popol Vuh, for example, grandfather 'Great White Peccary' and grandmother 'Great White Coati' act as healers, whereas the owl messengers of the lords of the underworld wear military titles. Turning to the 'ceramic codex', one finds that animal persons are often clothed and acting like persons at court. The howler monkey, for example, is commonly depicted in the social role of a writer and sculptor, and functions as a divine patron of these arts. Other mammals function as musicians. In the Dresden Codex, certain animals (dog, jaguar, vulture, owl, parrot, frog), most of them clothed as human beings, are seated in between deities, and seem thus to be treated {{on a par with the}} latter, while other animals, again acting as human beings, fulfill important ritual roles. In the New Year rites, for example, an opossum traveller introduces the patron of the incoming year. Similarly, in the Paris Codex, a turkey person alternates with deities in offering the head of the lightning deity (god K) to the new king. Animal persons are repeatedly shown interacting with Goddess I.|$|E

500|$|Hydnellum diabolus (the species epithet {{is given}} the neuter diabolum in some publications) has a very similar appearance, {{so much so that}} some {{consider}} it and H.peckii to be synonymous; H.diabolus is said to have a sweetish pungent odor that <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> H.peckii. The differences between the two species are amplified in mature specimens: H.diabolus has an irregularly thickened stem, while the stem of H.peckii is thickened by a [...] "definite spongy layer". Additionally, old specimens of H.peckii have a smooth cap, while H.diabolus is tomentose. The related species H.pineticola also exudes pink droplets of liquid when young and moist. Commonly found growing under conifers in northeastern North America, H.pineticola tastes [...] "unpleasant", but not acrid. Fruit bodies tend to grow singly, rather than in fused clusters, and, unlike H.peckii, they do not have bulbous stems.|$|E
