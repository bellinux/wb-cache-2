40|$|Computer has {{influenced}} our daily work, activities {{and played a}} vital role in every corner of our life. We are surfing the net for news, jobs, entertainment, transferring information and data online, purchasing, checking accounts, sending and receiving emails almost every day. For this widespread use, some computer users have misused this technology in illegal activities. As a result the computer forensic and investigation has emerged to carry out the investigation process for solving and discovering different types of internet or computer crimes and bring it to the court. In the paper we will discuss the challenging aspects of forensic investigation, skills needed by a computer forensics, knowledge needed by computer forensic investigator, and phases of computer forensic investigation. Overall the purpose of the paper is to provide the scientific awareness about the computer forensic to face the <b>e-criminal</b> activities of the e-user...|$|E

With click-based graphical passwords, user click-points form hotspots, {{areas of the}} image that {{are more likely to}} be selected, which <b>e-criminals</b> can predict and use to launch dictionary attacks. Our system, Persuasive Cued Click-Points, helps users select more random click-points and reduces the appearance of hotspots while still maintaining usability. 1...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examined}} {{the extent of}} e-crime in the United Kingdom. Conclusions The Committee concluded that:A dedicated {{state of the art}} espionage response team should be established so that British companies, media, and institutions can immediately contact it to report an attack so that effective action can be taken. There appears to be a ‘black hole’ where e-crime is committed with impunity. Online criminal activity which defrauds victims of money is often not reported to or investigated by law enforcement. Banks simply reimburse the victims with no pursuit of the perpetrators. Criminals who commit a high volume of low level fraud can still make huge profits. Banks must be required to report all e-crime fraud to law enforcement. It is alarmed that CEOP is having its budget cut by 10 % over 4 years and it could lose its laser-like focus when merged with the NCA. It is still too easy for people to access inappropriate online content, particularly indecent images of children, terrorism incitement and sites informing people how to commit online crime. There is no excuse for complacency. The Committee urges those responsible to take stronger action to remove such content. The Government should draw up a mandatory code of conduct with them to remove material which breaches acceptable standards. The DPP should review sentencing guidance and ensure <b>e-criminals</b> receive the same sentences as if they had stolen {{the same amount of money}} or data offline. The Government should look at setting up a similar organisation to the Internet Watch Foundation focused on reporting and removing online terrorist content. The Committee encourages those companies who donate to the Internet Watch Foundation to give more...|$|R
