25|$|The Reverend John Wilson and the {{minister}} of Hester's church, Arthur Dimmesdale, question the woman, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Roger Chillingworth, a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage {{and the fact that}} they were both in the wrong. Her lover, however, is another matter and he demands to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> is; Hester refuses to divulge such information. He accepts this, stating that he will find out anyway, and forces her to hide that he is her husband. If she ever reveals him, he warns her, he will destroy the child's father. Hester agrees to Chillingworth's terms although she suspects she will regret it.|$|E

Wood was not interested and suggested that Brownlee should take the position, to the latter's astonishment. [...] Brownlee did not believe that, as an urbanite and lawyer, he would be acceptable to the rural UFA caucus, and declined; the position went to Herbert Greenfield.|$|E

I think it's mostly because of all the legal shit. I didn’t clear the samples because I was in my fucking bedroom on Grand Street.

They may, however, have been acting out of anger at some grievance she caused to someone closer to her.|$|E

2500|$|On September 30, 2003, President Bush {{said that}} {{if there had been}} [...] "a leak" [...] from his {{administration}} about Plame, [...] "I want to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> is ... and if the person has violated law, the person will be taken care of."

2500|$|At the Old Trafford Roses Match in 1926, {{a record}} 78,617 spectators paid {{to watch the}} match peter out into a high scoring draw, with centuries from Lancashire's Harry Makepeace (126), Ernest Tyldesley (139) and 92 from Frank Watson being {{answered}} by Yorkshire legends Percy Holmes (143) and Herbert Sutcliffe (89) who put on 199 {{as if to make}} amends for events 2 years previously. Leonard Green, Lancashire's captain, was batting when the score stood at 499. Neville Cardus relates the story that Green said to himself [...] "It's not likely that Lancashire ever again will score 500 against Yorkshire, so I'm going to get this single run if it kills me." [...] He pushed a ball from Wilfred Rhodes to the off-side and ran 'like the wind'. The ball was hurled back in anger by Yorkshire legend Emmott Robinson, striking Rhodes on the wrist while Green dived to make his ground. Picking himself up he heard Rhodes muttering to himself:"There's somebody runnin' up and down this wicket. Ah don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> is, but there's some-body runnin' up and down this wicket." [...] The operative words in that famous lamentation are, [...] "Ah don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Darwin {{continued}} plotting his [...] "Canary scheme", and on 11 May he told Fox [...] "My {{other friends}} most sincerely wish me there I plague them so with talking about tropical scenery [...] ". His father gave him [...] "a 200£ note" [...] {{to pay his}} college debts. In addition, [...] "Some goodnatured Cambridge man has made me a most magnificent anonymous present of a Microscope: did ever hear of such a delightful piece of luck? one would like to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> was, just to feel obliged to him."

2500|$|Criticisms of the CoT {{began with}} its first tests, with the {{magazine}} Speedway Illustrated noting the car's {{poor performance in}} traffic (February 2006 issue). [...] The Winston-Salem Journal also noted extensive criticism of the project during 2006 testing, with drivers becoming more vocal by July 2007 and most fans rejecting the model, citing the falsity of many of its technical claims; one angle of criticism was the differing philosophies of NASCAR officials Gary Nelson and John Darby, with Darby a particularly ardent supporter of the CoT based on a misreading of the sport's competition packages. Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth were pointedly critical of the car's poor performance in traffic, with Gordon stating after the 2007 New England 300, [...] "I'd like to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> was who said this car would reduce the aero push because I could have told you from when I first drove this car {{that it would be}} worse." [...] Kyle Busch, who won the very first race with the car at Bristol in 2007, proclaimed that the car [...] "sucks" [...] afterward and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 in noting how the CoT was [...] "hitting a wall of air" [...] {{in the wake of a}} leading car, thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.|$|E

2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>it</b> is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
