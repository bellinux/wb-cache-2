25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

I made a lot of political statements. But now, I feel that I just want to have fun; I want to dance; I want to feel buoyant. And <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Duchess is {{left alone}} before Ribby's fire, and discovers her ham and veal {{pie in the}} oven. [...] "Then I must have been eating MOUSE! ... No wonder I feel ill," [...] she muses. Knowing she cannot {{adequately}} explain her ham and veal pie to Ribby, she puts it outside the back door intending to sneak back and carry it home after she leaves for home. Ribby and Dr. Maggoty arrive and, after much fuss, Duchess takes her leave, {{only to find that}} the magpie (who has left by the back door) and a couple of jackdaws have eaten her ham and veal pie. [...] Ribby later finds the remains of the pie dish and the patty-pan outside the back door and declares, [...] "Well I never did! ...

500|$|Robben was {{selected}} by new manager Bert van Marwijk for the final 23-man Dutch squad for the 2010 World Cup. In the team's last friendly match against Hungary, just before its flight to South Africa on 4 June, Robben fell awkwardly {{and picked up a}} hamstring injury, causing concern over his fitness for the tournament. On 5 June, Van Marwijk announced that he had [...] "decided not to summon any substitute for Arjen. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him every chance to still participate in the World Cup". On 12 June, Robben arrived in South Africa to join the team. He was an unused substitute for the opening match against Denmark as they coasted to a 2–0 victory, and again in the 1–0 victory against Japan. He came on in the 73rd minute against Cameroon in their 2–1 victory, hitting the post from which Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored from the rebound.|$|E

500|$|Chimes, {{whose career}} {{aspirations}} owed {{little to the}} punk ethos, had left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said, [...] "The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, why are we working together, if we want completely different things?" [...] As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as [...] "Tory Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: [...] "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that's why we were lost until we found Topper Headon." [...] Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed [...] "Topper" [...] by Simonon, who felt he resembled the Topper comic book character Mickey the Monkey. An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, [...] "I really wanted to join the Clash. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them even more energy than they've got—if that's possible"; interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, {{and then move on}} to a better gig. In any event, Strummer later observed, [...] "Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us".|$|E

2500|$|Jacques Vallée {{attempted}} to interest Spielberg in an alternative {{explanation for the}} phenomenon. In an interview on Conspire.com, Vallée said, [...] "I argued with him that the subject was even more interesting if it wasn't extraterrestrials. If it was real, physical, but not ET. So he said, 'You're probably right, but that's not what the public is expecting— this is Hollywood and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> people something that's close to what they expect.'" ...|$|E
