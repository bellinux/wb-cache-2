25|$|In a {{different}} direction, for compact operators on a Banach space, a result {{analogous to the}} Jordan normal form holds. One restricts to compact operators because every point x in the spectrum of a compact operator T, the only exception being when x is the limit point of the spectrum, is an eigenvalue. This is not true for bounded operators in general. To give some idea of this generalization, we first reformulate the <b>Jordan</b> <b>decomposition</b> {{in the language of}} functional analysis.|$|E

40|$|A {{repetitive}} pin-jointed, pre-twisted {{structure is}} analysed using a state variable transfer matrix technique. Within a global coordinate system the transfer matrix is periodic, but {{introduction of a}} local coordinate system rotating with nodal cross-sections results in an autonomous transfer matrix for this Floquet system. Eigenanalysis reveals four real unity eigenvalues, indicating tension–torsion coupling, and equivalent continuum properties such as Poisson’s ratio, cross-sectional area, torsion constant and the tension–torsion coupling coefficient are determined. A variety of real and complex near diagonal <b>Jordan</b> <b>decompositions</b> are possible for the multiple (eight) complex unity eigenvalues and these are discussed in some detail. Analysis of the associated principal vectors shows that a bending moment produces curvature in {{the plane of the}} moment, together with shear deformation in the perpendicular plane, but no bending–bending coupling; the choice of a structure having an equilateral triangular cross-section is thought responsible for this unexpected behaviour, as the equivalent continuum second moments of area are equal about all cross-sectional axes. In addition, an asymmetric stiffness matrix is obtained for bending moment and shearing force coupling, and possible causes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} and investigate the concept of pseudo-atoms of a real-valued function m defined on an effect algebra L; a few examples of pseudo-atoms and atoms are given in the context of null-additive, null–null-additive and pseudo-null-additive functions and also, some fundamental results for pseudo-atoms under the assumption of null–null-additivity are established. The notions of total variation |m|, positive variation m+ and negative variation m− of a real-valued function m on L are studied elaborately and it is proved for a modular measure m (which is of bounded total variation) defined on a D-lattice L that, m is pseudo-atomic (or atomic) if and only if its total variation |m| is pseudo-atomic (or atomic). Finally, a <b>Jordan</b> type <b>decomposition</b> theorem for an extended real-valued function m of bounded total variation defined on an effect algebra L is proved and some properties on decomposed parts of m such as continuity from below, pseudo-atomicity (or atomicity) and being measure, are discussed.

40|$|We present {{abstract}} acceleration {{techniques for}} computing loop in-variants for numerical programs with linear assignments and condi-tionals. Whereas abstract interpretation techniques typically over-approximate {{the set of}} reachable states iteratively, abstract accel-eration captures {{the effect of the}} loop with a single, non-iterative transfer function applied to the initial states at the loop head. In contrast to previous acceleration techniques, our approach applies to any linear loop without restrictions. Its novelty lies {{in the use of the}} <b>Jordan</b> normal form <b>decomposition</b> of the loop body to de-rive symbolic expressions for the entries of the matrix modeling the effect of n ≥ 0 iterations of the loop. The entries of such a matrix depend on n through complex polynomial, exponential and trigonometric functions. Therefore, we introduces an abstract do-main for matrices that captures the linear inequality relations be-tween these complex expressions. This results in an abstract matrix for describing the fixpoint semantics of the loop. Our approach integrates smoothly into standard abstract inter-preters and can handle programs with nested loops and loops con-taining conditional branches. We evaluate it over small but complex loops that are commonly found in control software, comparing it with other tools for computing linear loop invariants. The loops in our benchmarks typically exhibit polynomial, exponential and os-cillatory behaviors that present challenges to existing approaches. Our approach finds non-trivial invariants to prove useful bounds on the values of variables for such loops, clearly outperforming the existing approaches in terms of precision while exhibiting good performance. 1...|$|R
