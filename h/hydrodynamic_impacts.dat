This paper investigates the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> due to tidal power lagoons, an approach to power generation that involves temporarily storing seawater behind a circular engineered dyke and generating power by gradually releasing the impounded seawater through conventional low-head hydroelectric turbines. This paper describes a study in which a two-dimensional, depth-averaged hydrodynamic model based on the TELEMAC modelling system was developed, calibrated, and applied to analyze, predict, and quantify the potential changes in tidal hydrodynamics (water levels, tide range, circulation patterns and tidal currents) throughout the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine due to the presence of a single tidal lagoon and multiple lagoons operating at various locations in the upper Bay of Fundy. The sensitivity of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> to changes in lagoon type, size, location, the number of lagoons, and their operating mode have also been investigated.

40|$|Among {{sources of}} {{renewable}} energy, development of tidal energy {{has traditionally been}} plagued by relatively high costs and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal amplitudes or flow velocities. However, many recent technology developments and improvements, both in design (e. g. dynamic tidal power, tidal lagoons) and turbine technology (e. g. new axial turbines, crossflow turbines), showed that the economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels comparing to other conventional energy sources. It has long been identified that the Bay of Fundy {{is one of the}} world’s premier locations for the development of tidal power generating systems, since it has some of the world’s largest tidal ranges. Consequently, several proposals {{have been made in the}} recent years to find economical ways to harness the power of tides. Presently, there is considerable interest in installing tidal lagoons in the Bay of Fundy. The lagoon concept involves temporarily storing seawater behind an impoundment dike and generating power by gradually releasing the impounded seawater through conventional low-head hydroelectric turbines. A tidal lagoon will inherently modify the tides and tidal currents regime in the vicinity of the lagoon, and possibly induce effects that may be felt throughout the entire Bay of Fundy. The nature of these <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> will likely depend on the size of the tidal lagoon, its location, and its method of operation. Any changes in the tidal hydrodynamics caused by a tidal lagoon may also impact on the transport of sediments throughout the region and upset ecosystems that are well adapted to existing conditions. The scale and character of the potential <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> due to tidal lagoons operating in the Bay of Fundy have not been previously investigated. The present study endeavours to investigate these potential impacts to help the development of sustainable, science-based policies for the management and development of clean energy for future generations. After outlining fundamental aspects of tidal power projects taken in consideration in the Bay of Fundy, an analysis of present knowledge on tidal lagoons was conducted in order to provide a focus for subsequent investigations. Hydrodynamic modeling was used to quantify any of the potential hydrodynamic changes induced in the Bay of Fundy due to the presence of tidal lagoons. In the last part of the thesis, new relationships were derived in order to describe the amount of energy removed from tidal lagoons associated with its <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts...</b>|$|E

Nano-scale surface roughness-induced <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> on particle deposition were evaluated {{in the absence of}} an energy barrier to deposition in a parallel plate system. A non-linear, non-monotonic relationship between deposition surface roughness and particle deposition flux was observed and a critical roughness size associated with minimum deposition flux or “sag effect” was identified. This effect was more significant for nanoparticles (< 1 μm) than for colloids and was numerically simulated using a Convective-Diffusion model and experimentally validated.

40|$|Tidal current energy {{resources}} {{have the potential}} to provide a sizable proportion of our future energy requirements. However, significant questions still exist on the impacts of tidal turbines on the hydrodynamic environment. This thesis is concerned with the development of a 3 D nested hydrodynamic model capable of simulating energy extraction from coastal waters via tidal turbines. Of particular interest was the ability of the model to simulate the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> of tidal turbine devices and the interactions between adjacent devices in an array. Due to high computational costs, most hydrodynamic models of coastal waters are resolved at scales much larger than the typical size of tidal turbine rotor diameters. As a result, they cannot be used to accurately simulate turbine impacts and interactions. Nested models allow high resolution in an area of interest only, without the cost of high resolution across the full model domain. The 3 D Nested Turbine Model (3 DNTM) was developed to facilitate selective high resolution around a turbine array, at similar scales to the turbine rotor diameters, in an effort to better capture turbine interactions. To 3 DNTM was developed and validated in two stages. First, a 3 D tidal turbine extraction model was developed and the model results were compared to those from a previously published one-dimensional (1 D) model study. This model was also applied to the Severn Estuary to demonstrate its ability to capture the change in vertical velocity profile due to turbine rotors and support structures and to incorporate a thrust coefficient that changes in response to a turbines defined cut-in and rated speeds. Second, one-way and two-way nesting functionality was added to the model and the model results were compared to a high resolution single grid model solution to assess the model accuracy. The final 3 DNTM was then used to reproduce scaled turbine experiments and the model results were compared with experimental data. The results show that the 3 DNTM is capable of simulating the interaction between individual tidal turbines in an array, and hence the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> of these turbines, at a similar accuracy to a single grid high resolution model of the same domain.

In such cases, mostly related to cliff shores, theoretical modelling of sediment transport should take the properties of the dynamic layer into account...|$|R
40|$|Tidal range {{power plants}} {{represent}} an attractive approach for the large-scale {{generation of electricity}} from the marine environment. Even though the tides and by extension the available energy resource are predictable, they are also variable in time. This variability poses a challenge regarding the optimal transient control of power plants. We consider simulation methods which include the main modes of operation of tidal power plants, along with algorithms to regulate the timing of these. This paper proposes a framework where simplified power plant operation models are coupled with gradient-based optimisation techniques to determine the optimal control strategy over multiple tidal cycles. The optimisation results inform coastal ocean simulations that include tidal power plants to gauge whether the benefits of an adaptive operation are preserved once their <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> are also taken into consideration. The combined operation of two prospective tidal lagoon projects within the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary is used as an example to demonstrate {{the potential benefits of}} an energy maximisation optimisation approach. For the case studies considered, the inclusion of pumping and an adaptive operation is shown to deliver an overall increase in energy output of 20 – 40 % compared to a conventional two-way uniform operation. The findings also demonstrate that smaller schemes stand to gain more from operational optimisation compared to designs of a larger scale...|$|E
40|$|Tidal stream {{generators}} extract {{kinetic energy}} from tidal flows and convert it to electricity. Such <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> could {{have implications for}} sediment movement and the larger-scale morphology of a site. This study investigates the likely relative impacts of multiple large-scale extraction-scenarios upon a real-world submarine sandbank, the Alderney South Banks. The {{first phase of the}} study is an analysis of the South Banks, rooted in the literature of sandbank morphology, and performed using high-resolution bathymetry and sedimentary data. Cross-sections of large migrating sandwaves superimposed upon the sandbank were interpreted to generate a map of the sediment transport pathways. Unusually large sandwave migration rates of up to 70 m across a 50 day period were observed {{in one part of the}} Bank. The second, larger phase of the study involved the development of a 2 -D numerical model to simulate the tidal flows in the vicinity of Alderney and across the wider English Channel. The model was elevation-forced using nine tidal constituents at its open boundaries and validated against tidal level and tidal-stream velocity data obtained from port tide-gauges and ADCP deployments. An existing, area-averaged roughness method for parameterising the effects of energy extraction for tidal arrays was incorporated into the model. A numerical sediment model was setup to be coupled and run in parallel with the hydrodynamic computation. An identical 300 MW tidal array parameterisation was applied to the model in 17 different locations to simulate 17 different energy extraction scenarios. The model was run for one-spring neap cycling, lasting 14. 8 days. Outputs from each model run were combined with outputs from a non-extraction baseline model to assess the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> of the modelled extraction scenario in the sandbank vicinity. A set of sedimentary model-runs were also performed for a longer 90 -day period with the sediment module activated. A hard-bottom method was used to limit potential erosion depths within the sediment model and to ensure realistic sediment supply. Three difference metrics were used to systematically compare the impact of each extraction scenario upon the South Banks. These were the residual current, the residual sediment transport and the bed-level evolution. The difference metrics were used to rank the 17 extraction scenarios in terms of likely impact upon the South Banks from highest to lowest. The results show that the impact of energy extraction decreases with the distance of array placement from the North-Eastern tip of the South Banks. A propagating eddy shed from the headland is closely related to velocities in this region with energy-extraction decreasing the rotational velocity and life-time of the eddy. The processed modelling outputs are interpreted within the context of the initial morphological analysis to help predict how the sediment transport pathways will be altered. Results suggest that the most favourable locations for maximising power output whilst minimising impacts over the South Banks are two particular regions, T 63 or T 49...|$|E
40|$|A hemodynamic {{study of}} {{hydrodynamic}} gene delivery (HGD) from the tail vein in rodents has inspired a mechanism and {{an approach to}} further improve the efficacy of this procedure. However, there is no report on the hemodynamics of a regional HGD, which is an inevitable approach in large animals. Here, we report the hemodynamics of a regional hydrodynamic injection in detail based on 3 D volume data and the dynamism of tissue intensity over time by using computed tomography (CT) both during and after a regional hydrodynamic injection that targeted the liver of a pig weighing 15. 6 kg. Contrast medium (CM) was injected at a steady speed of 20 mL/s for 7. 5 s under the temporal balloon occlusion of the hepatic vein (HV). A retrograde flow formed a wedge-shaped strong enhancement area downstream of the corresponding HV within 2. 5 s, which was followed by drainage into another HV beginning from the target area and the portal vein (PV) toward a non-target area of the liver. After the injection, the CM was readily eliminated from the PV outside the target area. These data suggest that an interventional radiology approach is effective in limiting the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impacts</b> in large animals at a target area and that the burden overflowing into the PV is limited. A further investigation that simultaneously evaluates gene delivery efficiency and hemodynamics using CT is needed to establish feasible parameters for a regional HGD in large animals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe parallel, Double Wall, {{hypervelocity}} {{impact shield}} configuration has been heavily tested and characterized for ballistic performance for normal and oblique impacts for the ISS and other programs. However, in many locations with spacecraft designs, the rear wall cannot be modeled as being parallel or concentric with the outer bumper wall and in cases with a cylindrical outer wall, the effective non-parallel angle commonly varies as the outer wall impact location changes. This complicates micrometeoroid and orbital debris assessment of critical spacecraft components located within outer spacecraft walls. Based {{on a study}} combining hypervelocity <b>impact</b> testing and <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impact</b> simulations on multiple shield configurations including non-parallel first and rear walls, this paper provides equation adjustments for use with the double wall Ballistic Limit Equation (BLE) {{for a variety of}} impact speeds, non-parallel wall angles and impact obliquities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydrodynamic</b> <b>impact</b> {{of bodies}} onto the water surface {{is a problem}} of great {{importance}} in the design of off-shore and naval structures (wave energy converters, off-shore platforms, highspeed boats, etc). Classical measurement techniques, namely pressure sensors, present major drawbacks in the determination of impact loads because of their intrusive nature. In this paper, we propose a method to determine the impact loads on rigid bodies during water entry, based on high-speed particle image velocimetry. The method consists of two steps: firstly, an automated procedure is developed to determine the velocity field from high-speed images during water impact. Secondly, the unsteady pressure field is estimated from the velocity fields, using a Poisson-based solver. The method is validated on a rigid wedge slamming experiment and the results are compared with results from computational fluid dynamics simulations (performed with the software LS-Dyna) and from the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{foreign object}} damage {{resistance}} of composite fan blades was studied. Edge impact stresses in an anisotropic plate were first calculated incorporating a constrained layer damping model. It is shown that a very thin damping layer can dramatically decrease the maximum normal impact stresses. A multilayer model of a composite plate is then presented which allows computation of the interlaminar normal and shear stresses. Results are presented for the stresses due to a line impact load normal to the plane of a composite plate. It is shown that significant interlaminar tensile stresses can develop during impact. A computer code was developed for this problem using the fast Fourier transform. A marker and cell computer code were also used to investigate the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>impact</b> of a fluid slug against a wall or turbine blade. Application of fluid modeling of bird impact is reviewed...|$|R
