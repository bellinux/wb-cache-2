5|$|The {{genre of}} Midas bears {{the marks of}} gender debates, as well, with Percy writing in the {{traditionally}} male-dominated form of the lyric and Mary focusing {{on the details of}} <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> her verse drama. Since the play's first publication in 1922, critics have paid more attention to Percy Shelley's lyrics than Mary Shelley's drama. However, in the last fifteen years or so, this trend has reversed itself as scholars explore works of Mary Shelley other than Frankenstein (1818).|$|E
5|$|SI {{has become}} the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both {{everyday}} commerce and science.

The CGPM has a role of recommending changes, but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes—another inter-governmental organisation, the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) provides a forum for harmonisation of national standards and legislation in respect of metrology.|$|E
