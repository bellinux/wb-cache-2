25|$|Early {{detection}} of pathology {{can be the}} <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death. CADe {{can be done by}} auscultation with a digital stethoscope and specialized software, also known as Computer-aided auscultation. Murmurs, irregular heart sounds, caused by blood flowing through a defective heart, can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity. Computer-aided auscultation is sensitive to external noise and bodily sounds and requires an almost silent environment to function accurately.|$|E
25|$|The 1841 census {{showed a}} {{population}} of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords {{in return for the}} patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into monoculture, since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland could mean the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death in the early 19th century.|$|E

The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> expectancy <b>and</b> healthy <b>life</b> expectancy should be considered. Furthermore, the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> expectancy <b>and</b> the actual <b>life</b> duration depends not only on random but also on social factors.

25|$|Flags are {{particularly}} important at sea, where they can mean the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death, and consequently where {{the rules and regulations}} for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign. A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or {{in the face of a}} foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.|$|E
25|$|The combatants {{were very}} close together, but never close enough for grappling, {{probably}} because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in {{the right amount of}} powder, then putting in the shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death. Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the charge}} of {{vandalism}} in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent bolts and other anchors. Although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death. But the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure {{for long periods of}} time, changing the dynamic of the structure itself. Due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the Wilderness Act. However, in 1990, there was a movement by the Forest Service and the Task Group to change the regulations to where fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. These improvements lead to protection for both the climbers and the Wilderness Act. Typically in the USA, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices. This can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route is perceived to be dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore don't require as much protection. Failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form. Even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like Yosemite National Park, many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.|$|E
50|$|Another major <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{universal}} <b>life</b> <b>and</b> whole <b>life</b> insurances: {{the administrative}} expenses {{and cost of}} insurance within a universal life contract are transparent to the policy owner, whereas the assumptions the insurance company uses to determine the premium for a whole life insurance policy are not transparent.|$|R
50|$|The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> eternal <b>life</b> <b>and</b> {{the more}} {{specific}} eternal youth is a recurrent theme in Greek and Roman mythology.

500|$|The poems Wordsworth wrote {{while in}} Goslar {{focus on the}} dead and dying. The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] follow this trend, and often fail to {{delineate}} the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death. Each creates an ambiguity between the sublime and nothingness, {{as they attempt to}} reconcile {{the question of how to}} convey the death of a girl intimately connected to nature. They describe a rite of passage from innocent childhood to corrupted maturity and, according to Hartman, [...] "center on a death or a radical change of consciousness which is expressed in semi-mythical form; and they are, in fact, Wordsworth's nearest approach to a personal myth." [...] The narrator is affected greatly by Lucy's death and cries out in [...] "She dwelt" [...] of [...] "the difference to me!". Yet in [...] "A slumber" [...] he is spared from trauma by sleep.|$|E
2500|$|A popular myth {{states that}} Gurkha soldiers, {{fighting}} for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces {{of the soldiers}} they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a criss-cross pattern. Criss-cross laces could therefore mean the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops. [...] Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{maternal}} {{deaths are}} avoidable, as the health-care solutions {{to prevent or}} manage complications are well known. Improving access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support {{in the weeks after}} childbirth will reduce maternal deaths significantly [...] It is particularly important that all births be attended by skilled health professionals, as timely management and treatment can make the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death. To improve maternal health, barriers that limit access to quality maternal health services must be identified and addressed {{at all levels of the}} health [...] system. Recommendations for reducing maternal mortality include access to health care, access to family planning services, and emergency obstetric care, funding and intrapartum care. Reduction in unnecessary obstetric surgery has also been suggested.|$|E

50|$|Augmented reality (AR) is the {{combination}} of real-world and computer-generated data so that computer generated objects are blended into real time projection of real life activities.

This has important implications for m-Learning (Mobile Assisted Language Learning), but hard evidence on how AR is used in language learning and teaching is difficult to come by.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{original}} manuscript, Tonio sang the opera's final line, [...] "!", paralleling the prologue, also sung by Tonio. The appropriation of this final line by Canio {{dates back to}} 1895. John Wright has analysed the dramaturgy of the opera {{in the context of}} assignment of the final line, and concluded that {{the original}} assignment of the final line to Tonio is the most consistent and appropriate assignment. Wright says that Tonio shows more deliberate control in his manipulation of the other characters in order to obtain his revenge upon Nedda, after she has rejected him, and is more aware of the demarcation between life and art. By contrast, Canio is unaware of the behind-the-scenes manipulations and surrenders control of his perception of the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> art as the opera proceeds.|$|E

Living in a partnership strengthens the loss in identity utility of men, but weakens that of women. Unemployment of a person's partner reduces the identity loss of unemployed men, but raises it for women. These results suggest that the unemployed's feeling of identity is affected by traditional gender roles, while this {{does not seem to be}} the case for the affective part of their subjective well-being...|$|R
