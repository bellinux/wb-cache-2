The nightly {{performance}} to an empty house wore on her most distressingly, and no wonder. She, who had never hitherto given a moment's troubled thought to such matters, now sat in her dressing-room listening to the infrequent, hollow clang of the falling chair seats, attempting thus to estimate the audience straggling sparsely, desolately in. To re-enter the stage after an exit was like an icy shower-bath. Each night she hoped to find the receipts larger, and indeed they did from time to time advance suddenly, only to drop back to desolating driblets the following night. These gains were due to the work of the loyal Hugh as advertising agent, or to some desperate <b>discount</b> <b>sale</b> to a club on the part of Westervelt, who haunted the front of the house, a pale and flabby wraith of himself, racking his brain, swearing strange, German oaths, and perpetually conjuring up new advertising devices. His suffering approached the tragic.|$|E

50|$|The sale of {{an entire}} {{inventory}} is not a bulk sale if it is sold to buyers {{in a manner that}} ensures adequate consideration. For example, if a merchant holds an auction sale for the entire contents of the business and the sale is in good faith, the buyer in not required to comply with bulk sales legislation. However, the buyer of a business with inventory would be expected to complete the bulk sales registration as part of the normal course of closing the sale. Similarly, if a merchant has a deep <b>discount</b> <b>sale,</b> that is not a bulk sale as deep discounts can be made in the ordinary course of business.|$|E
50|$|Roland Bacri {{takes the}} tale into fresh {{territory}} with his Fable Electorale. An unelected politician {{out of funds}} visits the ant and, on being asked what he did during the past election, replied that he sang the national anthem. Playing on the final words of La Fontaine's fable (Eh bien, dansez maintenant), the industrialist advises him to stand for president (presidensez maintenant). On the other hand, Francoise Sagan turns the satire against the too industrious. Her ant has been stockpiling all winter and urges the grasshopper to invest in her wares when spring comes. But the grasshopper's needs are few and she advises holding a <b>discount</b> <b>sale</b> instead. To take a final example, the Anti-Cancer League has turned the fable into an attack on smoking. The grasshopper's appeal, out of pocket and desperate for a cigarette, is turned down by another play on the original ending. So, she had smoked all through the summer? OK, now cough (Et bien, toussez).|$|E

Unique characteristic of Indonesian consumer who unplanned and who have unplanned spending pattern became such opportunities {{for the company to}} sell their product. Research gap about buying behaviour between previous researchers became the problem of this research. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effect of interaction, situational factors and fashion involvement on positive emotion and planned impulsive buying. This research was limited on planned impulsive buying, whereas consumer already made such plan to go shopping but in fact they bought more than what they already planned before because of spontanious or suddenly cause. Sample collection technique used in this research was purposive sampling where respondents have to meet the criteria established by the researcher. The result from path analysis proved that the first hypothesis that the interaction with the salesforce on unplanned impulsive buying was rejected. The second hypothesis until the last hypothesis accepted. This study provides an overview of the importance to give a big <b>discount</b> (<b>sale)</b> programs, product variation and new trend products which will improve positive emotion and increase planned impulsive buying. Situational factors like crowd levels of store, comfortable shopping place, and well-organized layout also raise positive emotion and planned impulsive buying. In fact, most of the respondent felt that the crowded shopping situation makes them curious and raises positive emotions that motivated to make a purchase.

40|$|Abstract: We exploit {{a natural}} {{experiment}} in Denmark to investigate when forced sales lead to fire <b>sale</b> <b>discounts.</b> Forced <b>sales</b> result from sudden deaths of house owners in an institutional {{environment in which}} beneficiaries are forced to settle the estate, and hence sell the house, within 12 months. We identify 6, 329 forced sales by suddenly deceased house owners, and find that forced sales bring in lower prices than do comparable houses as the deadline winds down: We find no <b>discounts</b> for <b>sales</b> long before the deadline, and discounts of 12. 5 % for sales shortly before the deadline. Market conditions also affect the average discount. Discounts are larger when house prices contract and in thin markets where demand is lower. We also find larger <b>discounts</b> when the <b>sale</b> {{is more likely to}} be a fire sale, either because the estate or the beneficiaries are financially constrained. Overall, our results characterize market conditions under which forced sales lead to fire <b>sale</b> <b>discounts...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTAn {{analysis}} {{of the influence of}} <b>discount</b> <b>sales</b> promotion in consumer buying intent and the moderating effects of attractivenessThe {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the influence of <b>discount</b> <b>sales</b> promotion in the purchase intention and the moderating effects of attractiveness in the relationship between intention to purchase a discounted product and the impulsiveness, hedonic perception and financial risk. Thus, an experiment involving 613 students was conducted. The hypotheses predicted that a product with discount promotion would relate positively with impulsivity, as well as with a hedonic perception about the good offered, and negatively with the perception of financial risk associated with the product offered with discount. A positive moderation was expected of the perceived attractiveness of the announced discount promotion on the intentions of behaviors. The results confirmed the hypothesis, indicating positive effects of impulsivity and hedonic perception by purchasing the discounted products, in addition to the negative link between the intention of purchasing discounted products and the perception of a financial risk. The moderating effects were not confirmed. Final considerations conclude the work...|$|R

As {{a foundation for}} this discussion, {{an example of a}} conditional sales contract and credit application is explained in detail with emphasis on dispelling confusion often surrounding installment financing. Personal interviews with banking and lending institutions revealed programs offered to automobile dealers for <b>discounting</b> the <b>sales</b> contracts. Interviews with automobile dealers from the Los Angeles area then determined what programs were chosen and why the dealer used it. The study shows that the dealer strives to use a method of <b>discounting</b> <b>sales</b> contracts which is the least expensive and which relieves the dealer of the responsibility for the customer making the payments. A compromise plan is in use today, whereby the dealer and lending institution share in the responsibility of the sales contract's unpaid balance, resulting in less expense to the dealer than if the lending institution were to accept full responsibility for the customer...|$|R
