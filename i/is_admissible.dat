5|$|In Segura v. United States, the Court {{ruled that}} {{evidence}} illegally found without {{a search warrant}} <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> if the evidence is later found and legally seized based on information independent of the illegal search.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
25|$|In the sequent calculus, {{the rule}} of cut <b>is</b> <b>admissible.</b> This result is also {{referred}} to as Gentzen's Hauptsatz ("Main Theorem").|$|E
50|$|Observe {{that the}} rules for multiplicative {{conjunction}} and disjunction <b>are</b> <b>admissible</b> forplain conjunction and disjunction under a classical interpretation(i.e., they <b>are</b> <b>admissible</b> rules in LK).|$|R
30|$|Let M {{denote the}} set of all ω which <b>are</b> <b>admissible</b> state delay vectors. Let F denote {{the set of}} all η which <b>are</b> <b>admissible</b> {{parameter}} vectors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{judge ruled}} that the letter <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> to the court proceedings. The judge also ruled that one of Grey’s [...] "without prejudice" [...] letters <b>be</b> <b>admissible.</b>|$|R
25|$|Admissibility: The {{invocation}} of every operation <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> in its execution state, i.e., every invocation must not violate any effects relation (object ordering) {{that has been}} established by earlier invocations.|$|E
25|$|Evidence unlawfully {{obtained}} from the defendant by a private person <b>is</b> <b>admissible.</b> The exclusionary rule is designed to protect privacy rights, with the Fourth Amendment applying specifically to government officials.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{criteria}} that the Committee can consider in order to determine whether the complaint <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> or not. The Committee can consider one or all of these criteria, it is entirely discretionary.|$|E
50|$|Lord Herschell {{held that}} the {{evidence}}, in this case, <b>was</b> <b>admissible,</b> however, {{as a general rule}} evidence of a past similar event should not <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> unless there <b>are</b> exceptional circumstances.|$|R
40|$|A finite {{group is}} said to <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> {{if it has a}} {{permutation}} mapping of the form g → θ(g) such that g → g. θ(g) is also a permutation. Two different necessary conditions for a group to <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>are</b> known. For abelian groups both are sufficient and for soluble groups at least one. Here, we show that both conditions are satisfied by all finite non-soluble groups and so we conjecture that all such groups may <b>be</b> <b>admissible...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{trial judge}} {{initially}} determined, at a pretrial conference, that the JAG Report was sufficiently trustworthy to <b>be</b> <b>admissible,</b> {{but due to}} Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(C) that it [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> only on its factual findings and would not <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> insofar as any opinions or conclusions are concerned." [...] The day before trial, however, the court reversed itself and ruled, over the plaintiffs' objection, {{that some of the}} conclusions would be admitted.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, even in common-law systems, the {{hearsay rule}} only applies to actual trials. Hearsay <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> as {{evidence}} {{in many other}} judicial proceedings, such as grand jury deliberations, probation hearings, parole revocation hearings, and proceedings before administrative bodies.|$|E
25|$|Admission of guilt: if a {{declarant}} makes a statement, {{verbal or}} otherwise, as {{an admission of}} guilt of the matter at hand, that statement <b>is</b> <b>admissible.</b> Unlike other cases of declarations against interest, the declarant in this situation need not be unavailable.|$|E
25|$|If the {{opposition}} <b>is</b> <b>admissible,</b> {{the grounds for}} opposition are examined as to their merits. The patent proprietor has also the opportunity to reply to the grounds of opposition developed by the opponent. Arguments and, to a certain extent, amendments may be filed in reply by the patent proprietor.|$|E
50|$|The rules proscribe {{that certain}} {{testimony}} may not <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> for one purpose, but may <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> for another. An {{example of this}} is Rule 404, specifically 404(b) as it pertains to specific instances of a person's conduct.|$|R
30|$|If n {{is an even}} integer, then {{triplets}} (n,θ _ 1 ^-,θ _ 1 ^+) and (n,θ _ 2 ^-,θ _ 2 ^+) <b>are</b> <b>admissible.</b> Otherwise, (n,θ _ 1 ^-,θ _ 2 ^+) and (n,θ _ 2 ^-,θ _ 1 ^+) <b>are</b> <b>admissible.</b>|$|R
50|$|If a {{complaint}} is {{not found to}} <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> the complaint <b>is</b> not made public and nothing comes from it. If the Commissioner finds the complaint to <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> he will investigate the complaint and send his findings to the Committee for Standards and Privileges.|$|R
25|$|When A* terminates its search, it {{has found}} a path whose actual cost {{is lower than the}} {{estimated}} cost of any path through any open node. But since those estimates are optimistic, A* can safely ignore those nodes. In other words, A* will never overlook the possibility of a lower-cost path and so <b>is</b> <b>admissible.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{admissibility}} of {{an intervention}} {{is subject to}} conditions. The so-called notice of intervention must notably be filed within {{three months of the}} date on which proceedings referred to in Article 105 are instituted. An admissible intervention is treated as an opposition. If the intervention <b>is</b> <b>admissible,</b> the intervener becomes party to the opposition proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{inconsistent}} statements: Many {{states have}} {{departed from the}} approach of the federal rules with respect to inconsistent statements. Under current law in these jurisdictions, a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness (even when not made under oath at a judicial proceeding or deposition) <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> as substantive evidence provided the declarant signed the statement.|$|E
50|$|The Presiding Officer {{determined}} when evidence <b>was</b> <b>admissible.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An arc [...] <b>is</b> called <b>admissible</b> if [...] The <b>admissible</b> network [...] <b>is</b> {{composed}} of the set of arcs [...] that <b>are</b> <b>admissible.</b> The <b>admissible</b> network <b>is</b> acyclic.|$|R
25|$|To <b>be</b> <b>admissible,</b> the {{evidence}} {{referred to in}} the document must itself <b>be</b> <b>admissible.</b> The person supplying the information must have had personal knowledge of it (or be reasonably supposed to have had), and everyone else through whom the information was supplied must have also been acting in the course of business.|$|R
25|$|A police {{notebook}}, pocket notebook or PNB is {{a notebook}} used by {{police officers in}} the United Kingdom to officially record details and incidents while on patrol. Its use is controlled {{by a number of}} guidelines, as information entered into an officer's PNB <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> in court, and the officer will use it to refresh his memory while giving evidence, and to support his statements.|$|E
25|$|The {{exclusionary rule}} is not {{applicable}} to non-U.S. nationals residing outside of U.S. borders. In United States v. Alvarez-Machain, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that property owned by aliens {{in a foreign}} country <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> in court. Certain persons in the U.S. receive limited protections, such as prisoners, probationers, parolees, and persons crossing U.S. borders. Corporations, by virtue of being, also have limited rights under the Fourth Amendment (see corporate personhood).|$|E
25|$|Characteristic of the {{national}} relations in our country are both the continued flourishing of the nations and nationalities {{and the fact that}} they are steadily and voluntarily drawing closer together on the basis of equality and fraternal cooperation. Neither artificial prodding nor holding back of the objective trends of development <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> here. In the long term historical perspective this development will lead to complete unity of the nations....|$|E
40|$|A {{sequence}} of scalars {{is said to}} <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> for a positive operator A on a Hilbert space {{if it is the}} diagonal of VAV* for some partial isometry V having as domain the closure of the range of A. When A is a projection, the celebrated Kadison's carpenter theorem provides a sufficient condition for a sequence to <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> for A. We prove that the same condition is sufficient for the sequence to <b>be</b> <b>admissible</b> for A when A is a sum of projections (converging in the SOT). This provides an independent proof of Kadison's carpenter theorem...|$|R
40|$|Partial types {{allow the}} {{reasoning}} about partial functions in type theory. The partial functions of main interest are recursively computed functions, which are commonly assigned types using fixpoint induction. However, fixpoint induction is valid only on admissible types. Previous work has shown many types to <b>be</b> <b>admissible,</b> {{but has not}} shown any dependent products to <b>be</b> <b>admissible.</b> Disallowing recursion on dependent product types substantially reduces the expressiveness of the logic; for example, it prevents much reasoning about modules, objects and algebras. In this paper I present two new tools, predicate-admissibility and monotonicity, for showing types to <b>be</b> <b>admissible.</b> These tools show a wide class of types to be admissible; in particular, they show many dependent products to <b>be</b> <b>admissible.</b> This alleviates difficulties in applying partial types to theorem proving in practice. I also present a general least upper bound theorem for fixed points with regard to a computational appro [...] ...|$|R
40|$|For Dick de Jongh, on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday. If Visser’s rules <b>are</b> <b>admissible</b> for an intermediate logic, they form a basis for the admissible rules of the logic. How to characterize the admissible rules of intermediate logics for which not all of Visser’s rules <b>are</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>is</b> not known. Here we study the situation for specific intermediate logics. We provide natural examples of logics for which Visser’s rule <b>are</b> derivable, <b>admissible</b> but non-derivable, or not admissible...|$|R
25|$|Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case {{which held}} that {{testimony}} {{in the form of}} a victim impact statement <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> during the sentencing phase of a trial and, in death penalty cases, does not violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Payne narrowed two of the Courts' precedents: Booth v. Maryland (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989).|$|E
25|$|Online Arbitration is, {{a form of}} {{arbitration}} {{that occurs}} exclusively online. There is currently an assumption that online arbitration <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> under the New York Convention and the E-Commerce Directive, but {{this has not been}} legally verified. Since arbitration is based on a contractual agreement between the parties, an online process without a regulatory framework may generate a significant number of challenges from consumers and other weaker parties if due process cannot be assured.|$|E
25|$|We {{came down}} here to offer {{evidence}} in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so {{all we can do is}} to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence <b>is</b> <b>admissible</b> or not...we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.|$|E
