25|$|Acetaldehyde is an {{intermediate}} product of yeast fermentation; however, {{it is more}} commonly associated with ethanol oxidation catalysed by the enzyme ethanol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde production is also associated {{with the presence of}} surface <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> yeasts and bacteria, such as acetic acid bacteria, which form the compound by the decarboxylation of pyruvate. The sensory threshold for acetaldehyde is 100-125 mg/L. Beyond this level it imparts a sherry type character to the wine which can also be described as green apple, sour and metallic. Acetaldehyde intoxication is also implicated in hangovers.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissolution}} behaviour in sulphate solutions {{of so-called}} non-porous anodic alumina <b>films</b> and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen and i n a moist oxygen atmosphere on chemically polished aluminium has "been investigated. Evidence is presented {{which indicates that}} the non-porous anodic <b>films,</b> <b>formed</b> at 7 - 30 volts, consisted of two regions, a thin, less soluble region adjacent to the metal and a thicker, more soluble outer region into which hydroxyl ions were incorporated. The structure {{might be related to}} the initial method of surface preparation adopted. It is suggested that <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C consist of crystalline Y-alumina, whilst those formed in the moist oxygen atmosphere a t 500 C possibly consist of amorphous alumina with someadsorbed water and are less faulted than the crystalline oxide. Again, there is some indication that the structure of these filmsis strongly influenced by the initial method of surface preparation used. The dissolution behaviour of the anodic <b>films</b> and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C can be understood in terms of the extent of sulphate ion adsorption, apparently greater under the same conditions for the former type, and its effect on rate of transfer of protons, hydroxyl ions and water across the oxide/solution interface. A reaction scheme, proposed earlier to account for the behaviour during dissolution of the barrier layer of porous <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> anodically in sulphuric acid, appears adequate to explain the dissolution behaviour observed in the present studies. However, the type of behaviour, although rather similar for both' anodic non-porous and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C, was quite different from the barrier layer of porous <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> anodically in sulphuric acid...|$|R
2500|$|The {{pinnacle}} {{of this kind}} of technology was the IBM Electronic Typewriter series. These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory. With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically backspacing and then overstriking the previous characters with minimal marring of the paper. White cover-up ribbons were used with fabric ink ribbons, [...] or an alternate premium design featured plastic lift-off correction ribbons which were used with carbon film typing ribbons.

2500|$|An airport crash tender, or [...] "crash rig", [...] is a {{specialized}} fire engine {{designed for use}} at aerodromes in aircraft accidents. Some of the features that make the crash rigs unique are their ability to move on rough terrain outside the runway and airport area, large water capacity {{as well as a}} foam tank, a high-capacity pump, and water/foam monitors. Newer ARFF vehicles also incorporate twin agent nozzles/injection systems to inject a stream of Purple-K dry chemical into the AFFF (Aqueous <b>Film</b> <b>Forming</b> Fluroprotein) foam stream, which [...] "flattens" [...] the fire faster. Some also have Halotron tanks with handlines for fires which must be extinguished with a dry chemical similar to the ones which {{can be found in a}} fire extinguisher. These features give the airport crash tenders a capability to reach an airplane rapidly, and rapidly extinguish large fires with jet fuel involved.|$|E

In March 2015, the base changed its source of drinking water, because contamination had been found. In April 2015, wells near Moose Creek, Alaska, the community to the north, were tested and found contaminated. In July 2015, water from 132 Moose Creek wells, which serve more than 200 residences, was found to contain perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) above the health advisory level of 0.2 micrograms per liter by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The highest reading in Moose Creek was 2.09 micrograms per liter, and the highest level on Eielson reached 2,000 micrograms per liter {{at the site of}} a KC-135 aircraft fire in 1989. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation [...] said [...] "contamination stretches 6.5 miles from the south of Eielson's runway to the north of Moose Creek and is found up to 100 feet deep". [...] the extent of contamination was unknown and if there was one large plume or multiple small ones. The Air Force has held meetings to discuss the type of water filtration systems for affected homes. , between 145 and 150 homes had well water with PFOS above the EPA health advisory concentrations; with EPA's national water quality standard announced in May 2016, 15 more homes in the Moose Creek community were added.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{properties}} of free-standing anodic alumina films {{obtained from the}} one-sided anodization of aluminum are discussed. The <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of high-pure aluminum were shown to have maximum flexural strength. Even {{a small amount of}} impurities decreases the flexural strength of the resulting free-standing anodic alumina films to be associated with their higher defectiveness. The microhardness of thick and thin films of anodic alumina is discussed as well. The microhardness of the free-standing porous anodic alumina <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of low binary alloys of aluminum is shown to be lower than one of <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> of high-pure aluminum...|$|R

In philosophy there are several perceptions at stake. In art forms {{in which it is}} structured systematically repetition is one of the basic elements. As for <b>film</b> <b>form,</b> there are concepts that help us to understand the function of it. The basic concern of this thesis is constructing three basic repetition types by grounding on the perceptions of repetition in philosophy by also using basic concepts of repetition in <b>film</b> <b>form.</b> These types of repetitions in <b>film</b> <b>form</b> are specified as informative, constructive and poetic repetitions.

The paper set up the fine boring squeezed liquid film damped system of multi degree of freedom vibration simulation model and solve mathematical model by transfer matrix theory.

The mechanical device of liquid film damping system is established. 20 # machine oil, 40 # machine oil, and cutting fluid are used to the system.

The evalu-ation focuses on the characteristics crucial for barrier layer usage, such as step coverage, N/Ti atomic concentration ratio, x, in TiNs, and C 1 content. Film resistivities are also measured. Excellent step coverage is confirmed. A high-aspect-ratio hole, such as one with a diameter of 0. 5 i~m and a depth of 0. 8 ~m, is completely filled by TiN film. The atomic concentra-tion ratio x for <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> at 500 ~ 176 is nearly equal to 1. Reduction i the C 1 content coming from the source material, TIC 14, {{is a matter of}} concern.
