40|$|The {{mechanical}} design of elevator elements is always performed by international standards. The engineer selects the appropriate elements of elevator according to catalogues without knowing scientific details. Therefore, a theoretical analysis is achieved at two operating conditions for <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> (1) safety gear operation, and (2) running condition with the loads unevenly distributed {{on the elevator}} car. The <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> is considered a continuous beam with variable supports. Then the British code is listed showing the equations used in it. The theoretical equations showed that <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> are never subjected to stress in simultaneous combined buckling and bending in the plane, where the bending moment is exerted. It is always a combination of pressure and bending. Consequently, {{it is wrong to}} consider a simultaneous effect of buckling and bending. The equations in the catalogues oppose the theoretical results concerning buckling of <b>guide</b> <b>rails.</b> Therefore, a recommended calculation method for <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> is presented to be an acceptable method for analysis of <b>guide</b> <b>rail.</b> <br /...|$|R

40|$|A new {{diaphragm}} and dual <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> {{system was}} designed {{for use in a}} crash cushion for high-speed race tracks. These structural components were designed to provide sufficient lateral support to redirect impacting vehicles and compress the energy-absorbing elements of the crash cushion. The primary design criteria stated that the diaphragm/guide rail system should be capable of withstanding a 100 -kip lateral impact load. The <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> was to be configured in order to not require replacement after a design impact event. Initial design and modeling resulted in two candidates for <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> sections which were evaluated during physical testing. The better of the two candidates was then paired with a prototype diaphragm and subjected to dynamic testing. The first prototype was found to develop a maximum resistive force of 175 kips, and the diaphragm <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> absorbed a total of 822 kip-in. of energy but sustained significant <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> damage. An extensive computer modeling effort was initiated to optimize both the diaphragm and the <b>guide</b> <b>rails.</b> The structural capacity of the optimized prototype diaphragm and <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> system was verified through a dynamic bogie test. The second prototype weighed 55 lbs less, developed a maximum resistive force of 212 kips, and absorbed a total of 929 kip-in. of energy, resulting in a <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> permanent deflection of 1 / 16 in. Meeting all design requirements, the second prototype is recommended for use in the continued development of the crash cushion for high-speed race track applications. Adviser: John D. Rei...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{straightening}} of {{the elevator}} <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> was analyzed using the load-deflection pressure straightening model. To the elevator <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> of the same type, the straightening stroke {{is determined by the}} deflection straightened and the distance of supporting points. A formula of straightening the T 127 -B <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> was proposed through FEM and regression analysis. The variation of the <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> bending formation in the contiguous steps of the multi-step straightening process was studied and the relationship of these steps was derived. After the straightening stroke of the first step is calculated, the straightening strokes of the steps afterwards will be obtained by using the relationship and the bending formation. A simulation of straightening process taking the T 127 -B <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> with a certain initial deflection as example was carried with the straightening strokes and the positions of the supporting points calculated by Matlab and the result met the requirement...|$|R
50|$|A <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> is {{a system}} {{designed}} to guide vehicles back to the roadway and away from potentially hazardous situations. There is no legal distinction between a <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> and a guard rail.Several types of roadway <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> exist; all are engineered to guide vehicular traffic on roads or bridges. Such systems include W-beam, box beam, cable, and concrete barrier. Each system is intended to guide vehicles back onto the road as opposed to guard them from going off the road into potential danger.|$|R
50|$|Semi-rigid {{barriers}} include {{box beam}} <b>guide</b> <b>rail,</b> heavy post blocked out corrugated <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> and thrie-beam <b>guide</b> <b>rail.</b> Thrie-beam {{is similar to}} corrugated rail, but it has three ridges instead of two. They deflect 3 to 6 ft: more than rigid barriers, but less than flexible barriers. Impact energy is dissipated through deformation of the rail elements, posts, soil and vehicle bodywork, and friction between the rail and vehicle. Box beam systems also spread the impact force {{over a number of}} posts due to the stiffness of the steel tube.|$|R

The application of a Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) is a convenient method to reduce the guide rail-counterweight/ car response and to control the system operating under seismic conditions. In the TMD arrangement vibrations of the counterweight/ car can be suppressed and the stresses in the <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> reduced by the application of an auxiliary spring – damper - mass system attached to the main structure. In the counterweight system a part of the counterweight mass can be used as the auxiliary mass.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a noncontact sliding table design and measurements of its performance via ultrasonic levitation. A slider placed atop two vibrating <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> is levitated by an acoustic radiation force emitted from the rails. A flexural traveling wave propagating along the <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> allows noncontact transportation of the slider. Permitting a transport mechanism that reduces abrasion and dust generation with an inexpensive and simple structure. The {{profile of the}} sliding table was designed using the finite-element analysis (FEA) for high levitation and transportation efficiency. The prototype sliding table was made of alumina ceramic (Al 2 O 3) to increase machining accuracy and rigidity using a structure composed {{of a pair of}} <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> with a triangular cross section and piezoelectric transducers. Two types of transducers were used: bolt-clamped Langevin transducers and bimorph transducers. A 40 -mm long slider was designed to fit atop the two <b>rail</b> <b>guides.</b> Flexural standing waves and torsional standing waves were observed along the <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> at resonance, and the levitation of the slider was obtained using the flexural mode even while the levitation distance was less than 10 pm. The levitation distance of the slider was measured while increasing the slider&# 039;s weight. The levitation pressure, rigidity, and vertical displacement amplitude of the levitating slider thus were measured to be 6. 7 kN/m(2), 3. 0 kN/mu m/m(2), and less than 1 mu m, respectively. Noncontact transport of the slider was achieved using phased drive of the two transducers {{at either end of the}} vibrating <b>guide</b> <b>rail.</b> By controlling the phase difference, the slider transportation direction could be switched, and a maximum thrust of 13 mN was obtaine...|$|R
50|$|To {{address the}} {{vaulting}} and rollover crashes, energy-absorbing terminals were developed. The {{first generation of}} these terminals in the 1970s were breakaway cable terminals, in which the rail curves back on itself and is connected to a cable that runs {{between the first and}} second posts (which are often breakaway posts). The second generation, in the 1990s and 2000s, feature a large steel impact head that engages the frame or bumper of the vehicle. The impact head is driven back along the <b>guide</b> <b>rail,</b> dissipating the vehicle's kinetic energy by bending or tearing the steel in the <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> sections. A <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> may also be terminated by curving it back to the point that the terminal is unlikely to be hit end-on, or, if possible, by embedding the end in a hillside or cut slope.|$|R
