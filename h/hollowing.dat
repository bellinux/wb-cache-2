Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity.

5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing <b>hollowing</b> can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E

Despite this, {{little is known about the}} impact fire regimes have on this resource, or the role topography may play in preserving <b>hollows</b> through the mitigation of fire intensity. This study examined the effect different combinations of fire frequency and topography have on (i) the number of <b>hollow</b> bearing logs and (ii) the presence and size of <b>hollows</b> within logs. The influence of wildfire severity and logging were also examined. <b>Hollow</b> availability (i. e. density of <b>hollow</b> bearing logs and <b>hollow</b> presence within logs) was greatest at sites burnt at ‘low’ frequency. The density of <b>hollow</b> logs was greater in gullies, though the effect of fire frequency did not vary with topographic position. <b>Hollows</b> showing signs of internal fire charring typically had a greater entrance width than unburnt <b>hollows,</b> which suggests fire plays an important role in creating large <b>hollows.</b> The number of <b>hollow</b> bearing logs increased with logging intensity, due to unmerchantable timber being left in situ. Wildfire severity had little effect on log <b>hollows.</b> The results indicate that frequent burning may reduce <b>hollow</b> availability, though it is likely that gullies will still retain a high density of <b>hollow</b> bearing logs irrespective of burning, and may play an important role in preserving connectivity of this resource across landscapes...|$|R

25|$|During {{the reign}} of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Jaigarh Fort, which is located 150 miles {{south-west}} of Delhi, became one of the world's most efficient cannon foundries mainly due to the abundance of iron ore mines {{in the vicinity of the}} fort. The cannon foundry Jaigarh Fort had a massive wind tunnel that sucked air from the high mountains into its furnace creating temperatures as high as 2400°F, the heated air would melt the metal. The liquid molten metal would fill a reservoir chamber and into a cannon mold in the casting pit. Most of those cannons were massive, mostly 16ft long and had to be prepared within a single day. The Rajput also built a large ingenious mechanical device that had a precision gear system driven by four pairs of oxen, the device was used for <b>hollowing</b> out the cannon barrels. When the Mughal war of succession broke out in 1658 Dara Shikoh secured the cannon outpost of Jaigarh Fort until he was defeated and executed by his younger brother Aurangzeb. Later however, the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah appointed Jai Singh II as the official Mughal Qiladar of Jaigarh Fort according to a Firman, ultimately Jai Singh II is known to have molded the great Jaivana Cannon by utilizing the important foundry and devices inside Jaigarh Fort.|$|E

500|$|Plants {{also provide}} housing and food items for natural enemies of herbivores, known as [...] "biotic" [...] defense mechanisms, {{as a means}} to {{maintain}} their presence. For example, trees from the genus Macaranga have adapted their thin stem walls to create ideal housing for an ant species (genus Crematogaster), which, in turn, protects the plant from herbivores. In addition to providing housing, the plant also provides the ant with its exclusive food source; from the food bodies produced by the plant. Similarly, some Acacia tree species have developed thorns that are swollen at the base, forming a <b>hollowing</b> structure that acts as housing. These Acacia trees also produce nectar in extrafloral nectaries on their leaves as food for the ants.|$|E

500|$|Two of {{the most}} complex special effects in the film were the corpses of Barrymore's and Walls' characters, Casey Becker and Steve Orth. Their deaths {{involved}} the character being gutted from ribcage to pelvis, essentially <b>hollowing</b> out the torso of internal organs, with the guts [...] "rolling" [...] from the wound. To allow Walls to continue to move and feign death while displaying the wound, KNB designed a chair with no back. The actor would kneel behind it while his upper body, head, and arms were positioned within the chair's seating area. An anatomical model representing the character's torso and legs was positioned in the chair and disguised so that the actor's upper body and the model appeared to be one piece. The fake abdomen was filled with rubber, latex, and gelatin pieces smeared in fake blood—the [...] "internal organs" [...] — which could then fall free. The other effect involved Barrymore's character being gutted and hung by the neck from a tree.

500|$|Maple {{sugaring}} parties typically {{began to}} operate {{at the start of}} the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then <b>hollowing</b> out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained [...] "sweet". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2008 Roosting {{habitat is}} one of the most {{essential}} habitat components to consider for conservation of bat populations. Basal <b>hollows</b> found almost exclusively in old growth redwood trees provide a distinct roost type that has been recognized as a widely used resource by bats in the redwood region. With the estimated removal of more than 95 percent of old growth redwood trees, the distribution of these roost types has become increasingly limited. One possible outcome of lowered roost densities is a concentration of bats in basal <b>hollows</b> more geographically isolated from others. This study examined the effect of <b>hollow</b> isolation on forest-dwelling bat populations in Del Norte County in northern California. I compared the frequency and intensity of bat use of basal <b>hollows</b> within three <b>hollow</b> isolation categories: (1) contiguous forest stands with low <b>hollow</b> isolation levels; (2) small remnant forest stands with moderate <b>hollow</b> isolation levels; and (3) second and third growth commercial forest stands with high <b>hollow</b> isolation levels. Using monthly bat guano samples as an index of use, I found no evidence for increased use of the most isolated <b>hollows.</b> To the contrary, bats appeared to use less isolated <b>hollows</b> with greater frequency and equal intensity to those <b>hollows</b> in areas with higher isolation levels. <b>Hollow</b> internal volume, overhead volume relative to the <b>hollow</b> opening, and proximity to water were important variables in predicting which <b>hollows</b> would be used most. My results fail to support past findings in the same region that showed greater use by bats of basal <b>hollows</b> in isolated remnant forest patches than those <b>hollows</b> found in contiguous forested regions. Future studies should look at species composition of bats roosting within basal <b>hollows,</b> <b>hollow</b> temperatures, and available foraging resources for increased understanding of bats in redwood forests and those factors that influence roost selection.
