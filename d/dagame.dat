50|$|About half of {{the trees}} in semi-deciduous forests are evergreen, along with shrubs, epiphytes, a few {{herbaceous}} plants, and many vines. Trees {{in this type of}} forest are often mesophyllous, with leaves 13 - 26 cm long. The canopy in forests with consistent moisture reaches a height of 15 - 20 m and may have emergent species up to 30 m high as well as 25 m palms. The lower arboreal story includes deciduous and sclerophyllous evergreen trees. Soils are either red rendzinas, black rendzinas, or brown soils. Trees grow rapidly due to heavy rainfall during the summer. The upper layer of trees includes almácigo (Bursera simaruba), cedro-cheiroso (Cedrela odorata), <b>dagame</b> (Calophyllum candidissimum), ceiba (Ceiba pentandra), baría (Cordia gerascanthus), ateje (C. collococca), cuyá (Dipholis salicifolia), caoba (Swietenia mahagoni), ayúa (Zanthoxylum martinicense), guasiriano (Celtis trinervia) and palma real (Roystonea regia). The lower layer includes jía (Casearia hirsuta), guara (Cupania americana), yamagua (Guarea trichiloides), yaya (Oxandra lanceolata) and siguaraya (Trichilia havanensis). Forests with fluctuating moisture have an 8 - 15 m canopy, an understory of microphyllous and thorny deciduous species, and a forest floor covered in herbaceous geophytes.|$|E
