5|$|Archduke Charles {{traveled}} to Villa Pianore {{and asked for}} Zita’s hand and, on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries {{about the fate of}} the Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy. Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits,</b> even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children would follow in the next decade.|$|E
25|$|Whether Mozart {{declined}} gradually, experiencing {{great fear}} and sadness, {{or whether he}} was fundamentally <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits</b> {{toward the end of}} his life, then felled by a relatively sudden illness. The former hypothesis held sway for most of the history of Mozart biography, but the latter has been advanced by contemporary scholars.|$|E

25|$|On the {{day before}} his execution, Peace was visited {{for the last time}} by his family; out of {{deference}} to their feelings, he did not ask to see Mrs. Thompson, though he had very much wished to.

25|$|In 1981, Garroway {{underwent}} open-heart surgery, {{a result}} of which he contracted a staph infection. On January 14, 1982, Today broadcast its 30th anniversary special, which featured all of the important living former and current staff members. Garroway, who had recently undergone rehab for an amphetamine addiction, appeared to be cheerful and <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits</b> during the show.

25|$|Hood's army {{departed}} Florence on November 21, {{marching in}} three columns, with Cheatham on the left, Lee in the center, and Stewart on the right, all screened by Forrest's cavalry. Hood's {{plan was to}} consolidate at Mount Pleasant and from there move to the east to cut off Schofield before he could reach Columbia and the Duck River. The rapid forced march 70 miles north was under miserable conditions, with freezing winds and sleet, which made progress difficult for the underfed and underclothed army. Nevertheless, Hood's men were <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits</b> as they returned to Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Naval corpsmen {{assessed}} the injured Marines {{and came to}} the conclusion that they needed more intensive care and thus a request was put in to the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Doha for a medical evacuation. Within ten minutes, a U.S. Army UH-60 medical helicopter arrived and flew the two wounded Marines to the mainland for treatment at an army hospital in Kuwait City. Sledd was reportedly <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits</b> when he was taken away by the helicopter, but he was ultimately mortally wounded and subsequently died. However, Simpson managed to survive his wounds and was awarded the Purple Heart Medal later that month by a general.|$|E
25|$|Hood's {{headquarters}} departed Florence at 10 a.m. on November 21, {{accompanied by}} Cheatham's corps toward Waynesboro, which they reached on November 23.

2500|$|In 1953, Lloyd {{received}} an Academy Honorary Award {{for being a}} [...] "master comedian and good citizen".

25|$|In 1980, Bill Haley and His Comets toured South Africa, but Haley's {{health was}} failing, {{and it was}} {{reported}} that he had a brain tumor. The tour was critically lambasted, but surviving recordings of a performance in Johannesburg show Haley <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits</b> and good voice. Nonetheless, according to the Haley News fan club newsletter and the Haley biography Sound and Glory, planned concerts (such as a fall 1980 tour of Germany) and proposed recording sessions in New York and Memphis were cancelled, including a potential reunion with past members of the Comets. Haley returned to his home in Harlingen, Texas, where he died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack on February 9, 1981, at the age of 55.|$|E
25|$|Pope Shenouda III died on 17 March 2012 (8 Paremhat 1728 in the Coptic calendar) of {{lung and}} liver {{complications}} at his official residence shortly {{after returning from}} medical treatment abroad. He had stopped taking medication {{because he was too}} weak. However, Al Jazeera English's Coptic Egyptian reporter Sherine Tadros reported that he had been <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits</b> prior to his death. The funeral took place after three days of lying in state; on 20 March, he was buried at the Monastery of Saint Pishoy in Wadi el-Natrun, in accordance with his wishes. Metropolitan Pachomious of Beheira and Pentapolis was appointed to take over papal duties until the election of a new Pope, being the second-most senior Metropolitan in the Holy Synod in age after Anba Mikhail, but due to his failing health and age delegated this duty to Metropolitan Pachomios during the first meeting of the Holy Synod after Shenouda's death.|$|E

500|$|It {{became known}} as the Cherry Valley {{massacre}} and was noted {{as one of the most}} horrific frontier massacres of the Revolution. Three months later, in his journal entry for February 12, 1779, McKendry describes receiving a report from an Indian of William Stacy in captivity; Stacy was apparently concerned to reassure his fellow soldiers: [...] "the last he knew of Col. Stacy he was well and <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits,</b> and told him not to mind it for it was only the fortune of war." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{writings of}} General Sullivan arrived before the French fleet reached Boston; Admiral d'Estaing's initial reaction {{was reported to}} be a dignified silence. Under pressure from Washington and the Continental Congress, politicians worked to smooth over the incident while d'Estaing was <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits</b> when Lafayette arrived in Boston. D'Estaing even offered to march troops overland to support the Americans: [...] "I offered to become a colonel of infantry, under the command of one who three years ago was a lawyer, and who certainly must have been an uncomfortable man for his clients".|$|E

500|$|On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh {{shot himself}} in the chest with a 7mm Lefaucheux à broche revolver. There were no {{witnesses}} and he died 30 hours after the incident. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits.</b> But within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died {{in the early hours of}} 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: [...] "The sadness will last forever".|$|E
500|$|Reed {{generally}} enjoyed vigorous good health. However, {{early in}} 1893 {{there were signs}} that his workload was taking its toll. In January of that year he left London for an extended stay in Ireland, hoping to recover his energies. He returned to his various duties in May, but later in the summer became seriously ill with what was identified {{at the time as}} [...] "consumption", and was probably pulmonary tuberculosis. He relinquished the secretaryship of the Bibliographical Society and returned to Ireland where, though largely confined indoors, he continued writing his regular weekly column for the Leeds Mercury and finished his final novel, Kilgorman. Letters to friends at home indicated that he remained <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits</b> and was hopeful of recovery. However, his condition worsened, and he was advised to return home for urgent medical treatment. Back in London he wrote his last piece for the Mercury, a review of Seventy Years of Irish Life by W.R. Le Fanu. He died at his home in Highgate on 28 November 1893, aged 41, and was buried in Abney Park Cemetery, by the side of his father and grandfather.|$|E
500|$|Despite these problems, {{from late}} October 1974 his {{demeanour}} appeared {{to change for}} the better. His best man, John Wilbraham, remarked that Lucan's apparent obsession over regaining his children had diminished. While having dinner with his mother he cast aside talk of his family problems and turned instead to politics. On 6November he met his uncle John Bevan, apparently <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>spirits.</b> Later that day he met 21-year-old Charlotte Andrina Colquhoun, who said that [...] "he seemed very happy, just his usual self, {{and there was nothing}} to suggest that he was worried or depressed". He also dined at the Clermont with racing driver Graham Hill. At the time, casinos could open only between 2:00pm and 4:00am, so Lucan often gambled into {{the early hours of the}} morning. He took tablets to deal with his insomnia and therefore usually awoke around lunchtime. On 7November though, he broke routine and called his solicitor early that morning, and at 10:30am took a call from Colquhoun. They arranged to eat at the Clermont at about 3:00pm, but Lucan failed to appear. Colquhoun drove past the Clermont and Ladbroke clubs, and past Elizabeth Street, but could not find his car anywhere. Lucan also failed to arrive for his 1:00pm lunch appointment with artist Dominic Elwes and banker Daniel Meinertzhagen, again at the Clermont.|$|E
