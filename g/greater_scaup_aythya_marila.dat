40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1989 The species composition, distribution, and {{seasonal}} abundance of all waterbirds using South Humboldt Bay, California were studied from July 1987 through June 1988. Birds were recorded during direct ground counts and aerial surveys. Fifty-three species were seen during the surveys. An additional 38 species were recorded incidentally {{but were not}} present in sufficient numbers to warrant individual analysis. South Bay received 3, 968, 218 waterbird use-days in the year studied, about half of which were by roosting shorebirds. The numerically dominant shorebirds were peeps Calidris spp.), marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa), dunlin Calidris alpina), and willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus). Waterfowl were the second most abundant bird group, accounting for 36. 8 {{percent of the total}} bird use-days. Dabbling ducks, diving ducks, and black brant (Branta bernicla) constituted 44, 33, and 22 percent of the total waterfowl use-days, respectively. Principal species of dabbling and diving ducks were American wigeon Anas americana) and American green-winged teal (Anas crecca carolinensis), and <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>scaup</b> <b>Aythya</b> <b>marila</b> and affinis), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), and surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata), respectively. sixty-two percent of the total waterbird use occurred from midwinter to late spring. Spatial distribution varied with different species but, in general, dabbling ducks were found in greatest densities {{at the south end of}} the study area, while diving ducks, overwater piscivores, and herons had a more general distribution. Aerial estimates were compared to ground counts and provided generally poor correlations. For loons, grebes, and black brant, ground counts were higher than aerial counts while the reverse was true for diving ducks and American coots (Fulica americana). Aerial estimates also indicated that, in general, waterfowl numbers were higher on South Humboldt Bay than on North (Arcata) Bay...|$|R

40|$|In {{ecological}} studies, {{the goal}} is often to describe and gain further insight into ecological processes underlying the data collected during observational studies. Be- cause {{of the nature of}} observational data, it can often be difficult to separate the variation in the data from the underlying process or 2 ̆ 7 state dynamics. 2 ̆ 7 In order to better address this issue, it is becoming increasingly common for researchers to use hierarchical models. Hierarchical spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal models allow for the simultaneous modeling of both first and second order processes, thus accounting for underlying autocorrelation in the system while still providing insight into overall spatial and temporal pattern. In this particular study, I use two species of interest, the lesser and <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> (<b>Aythya</b> affinis and <b>Aythya</b> <b>marila),</b> {{as an example of how}} hierarchical models can be utilized in wildlife management studies.

In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution and taxonomy of some coronaviruses have been well described, but little is known about the features of CoVs in wild birds. In this study we screened 764 samples from 22 avian species of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes in Sweden collected in 2006 / 2007 for CoV, with an overall CoV prevalence of 18. 7 %, which is higher than many other wild bird surveys.

40|$|The {{foraging}} {{skills of}} Tufted Duck <b>Aythya</b> fuligula and <b>Scaup</b> <b>Aythya</b> <b>marila</b> feeding on Zebra Mussels Dreissena polymorpha were studied in experiments under seminatural diving conditions with {{relevance to the}} IJssalmeer/Markermeer area (large lakes in the centre of The Netherlands, former Zuiderzee area), the major freshwater wintering site of both species in Europe. Daily consumption of mussels (based on fresh mass) was about {{two to three times}} the body mass of the birds because of the large water and shell content and consequently low nutritional value of mussels. Feeding costs (diving and processing food) were about 50 % of daily energy expenses in winter, as revealed from doubly labelled water measurements. Food intake rates decreased with the degree of byssal thread attachment of mussels in Tufted Duck, while intake rates of Scaup were only affected when mussels grew in tightly attached clumps. Food intake rates were usually 15 - 25 % lower in Tufted Duck than in the 25 % heavier Scaup. Both species were able to swallow all mussels available in the population, though smaller mussels were slightly favoured. Scaup had higher food intake rates at low mussel densities than Tufted Duck, but intake rates seemed unaffected at densities higher than ca. 100 gFM m(- 2), which is similar to giving-up densities observed in the field. Feeding activity consisted of short feeding bouts of a number of dives in quick succession to fill the esophagus with mussels, followed by longer resting pauses of 5 - 10 minutes to crush mussel shells in the gizzard and digest the flesh. The limited capacity to store food in the gut (less than 5 % of the daily requirement) and long digestive pauses imply that diving ducks must spend a large fraction of the day on the feeding grounds. The differences in feeding skills between the two species correspond qualitatively with their spatial segregation in the IJsselmeer area when local differences in prey properties are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{long-term}} ecological studies {{allows for}} {{a better understanding of}} processes driving populations and communities, and this understanding can be used to improve conservation eorts. These studies can describe how changes in the environment have led to current states of populations and communities, and indicate if the current state or trend falls within expectations based on past dynamics. Studies of long-term datasets also help ecologists predict how populations may shift with climate, water, or land-use change and determine necessary management action to maintain sustainable populations and community interactions. Serving as a of time, 2 ̆ 2 long-term monitoring can provide insight into the in uence of predation, intra- or interspecic competition, and other interactions on system dynamics. Studies need to explicitly include these drivers and sources of autocorrelation in data (e. g., spatial autocorrelation) to obtain unbiased estimates of ecological processes for guiding management. Fortunately, new statistical analyses for ecological applications are available that help ecologists make full use of the information present in long-term studies while properly accounting for sampling error and autocorrelation. In this study, I use advanced statistical methods to analyze a long-term dataset, the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey, and address questions about waterfowl population and community dynamics. In Chapter 2, I use multi-state occupancy models to determine how the presence of lesser and <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> (<b>Aythya</b> anis and A. marila) has changed on their breeding grounds in North America since 1955. In Chapter 3, I use a Bayesian hierarchical model to determine the drivers of the breeding scaup population in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Lastly, in Chapter 4 I incorporate more waterfowl species into the hierarchical model from Chapter 3 to determine the drivers of the pochard duck community, along with the role of species interactions. My results indicate that the occupancy of scaup has decreased in the boreal forest of Canada and increased in the prairie parklands. Additionally, scaup in the Northwest Territories are largely in uenced by density dependence and snow cover extent. Finally, the pochard community in the Northwest Territories is regulated more by environmental drivers than intra- or interspecic interactions. These results indicate that management of the species through hunting regulations likely deserves further study, as scaup likely exhibit some sort of compensation in response to hunting...|$|R

Nutrient reserves were smaller in nonreproductive than reproductive females. These results suggest that nutritional status influences timing of reproduction via condition thresholds for RFG initiation, yet acquired reserves are not used during egg production.

5000|$|The genus name Aythya {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek aithuia which refers to a seabird {{mentioned}} by Aristotle and others and is thought to refer to a duck, auklet or other seabird.

40|$|Some {{species of}} birds react to climate change by {{reducing}} the distance they travel during migration. The Odra River Estuary in the Baltic Sea is important for wintering waterfowl and is where we investigated how waterbirds respond to freezing surface waters. The most abundant birds here comprise two ecological groups: bottom-feeders and piscivores. Numbers of all bottom-feeders, but not piscivores, were negatively correlated {{with the presence of}} ice. With ongoing global warming, this area is increasing in importance for bottom-feeders and decreasing for piscivores. The maximum range of ice cover in the Baltic Sea has a weak and negative effect on both groups of birds. Five of the seven target species are bottom-feeders (<b>Greater</b> <b>Scaup</b> <b>Aythya</b> <b>marila,</b> Tufted Duck A. fuligula, Common Pochard A. ferina, Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra), and two are piscivores (Smew Mergellus albellus and Goosander Mergus merganser). Local changes at the level of particular species vary for different reasons. A local decline of the Common Pochard may simply be a consequence of its global decline. Climate change is responsible for some of the local changes in the study area, disproportionately favoring some duck species while being detrimental to others...|$|E
40|$|The European {{population}} of <b>Greater</b> <b>Scaup</b> <b>Aythya</b> <b>marila</b> has experienced an alarming, ~ 60 % decline in numbers {{over the last}} two decades. The brackish lagoons of the Odra River Estuary (ORE) in the south-western Baltic Sea, represent an important area for the species during the non-breeding season in Europe. The lagoons regularly support over 20 000 Scaup, with peaks exceeding 100 000 (38 %– 70 % of the population wintering in NW Europe and the highest number recorded in April 2011 – 105 700). In the ORE, Scaup feed almost exclusively on the non-native Zebra Mussel Dreissena polymorpha. This mussel was present in the ORE already in the 19 th century and continues to be superabundant. Using the results of 22 Scaup censuses (November to April 2002 / 2003 to 2013 / 2014) from the whole ORE (523 km 2 of water), we show that Scaup flocks follow areas with the greatest area of occurrence and biomass of the Zebra Mussel, while areas with low mussel densities are ignored.

40|$|Populations of Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) have {{declined}} markedly in North America {{since the early}} 1980 s. When considering alternatives for achieving population recovery, {{it would be useful}} to understand how the rate of population growth is functionally related to the underlying vital rates and which vital rates affect population growth rate the most if changed (which need not be those that influenced historical population declines). To establish a more quantitative basis for learning about life history and population dynamics of Lesser Scaup, we summarized published and unpublished estimates of vital rates recorded between 1934 and 2005, and developed matrix life-cycle models with these data for females breeding in the boreal forest, prairie-parklands, and both regions combined. We then used perturbation analysis to evaluate the effect of changes in a variety of vital-rate statistics on finite population growth rate and abundance. Similar to <b>Greater</b> <b>Scaup</b> (<b>Aythya</b> <b>marila),</b> our modeled population growth rate for Lesser Scaup was most sensitive to unit and proportional change in adult female survival during the breeding and non-breeding seasons, but much less so to changes in fecundity parameters. Interestingly, population growth rate was also highly sensitive to unit and proportional changes in the mean of nesting success, duckling survival, and juvenile survival. Given the small samples of data for key aspects of the Lesser Scaup life cycle, we recommend additional research on vital rates that demonstrate a strong effect on population growth and size (e. g., adult survival probabilities). Our life-cycle models should be tested and regularly updated in the future to simultaneously guide science and management of Lesser Scaup populations in an adaptive context...|$|E
40|$|Estimating the {{frequency}} of hybridization {{is important to understand}} its evolutionary consequences and its effects on conservation efforts. In this study, we examined the extent of hybridization in two sister species of ducks that hybridize. We used mitochondrial control region sequences and 3589 double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequences (ddRADseq) to identify admixture between wild lesser <b>scaup</b> (<b>Aythya</b> affinis) and <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> (A. marila). Among 111 individuals, we found one introgressed mitochondrial DNA haplotype in lesser scaup and four in <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> Likewise, based on the site-frequency spectrum from autosomal DNA, gene flow was asymmetrical, with higher rates from lesser into <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> However, using ddRADseq nuclear DNA, all individuals were assigned to their respective species with 3 ̆e 0. 95 posterior assignment probability. To examine the power for detecting admixture, we simulated a breeding experiment in which empirical data were used to create F 1 hybrids and nine generations (F 2 –F 10) of backcrossing. F 1 hybrids and F 2, F 3 and most F 4 backcrosses were clearly distinguishable from pure individuals, but evidence of admixed histories was effectively lost after the fourth generation. Thus, we conclude that low interspecific assignment probabilities (0. 011 – 0. 043) for two lesser and nineteen <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> were consistent with admixed histories beyond the F 3 generation. These results indicate that the propensity of these species to hybridize in the wild is low and largely asymmetric. When applied to species-specific cases, our approach offers powerful utility for examining concerns of hybridization in conservation efforts, especially for determining the generational time until admixed histories are effectively lost through backcrossing...|$|R

Of the 18 PAHs, only eight induced EROD activity. In chicken hepatocytes the rank order of potency of the eight EROD inducing PAHs was BkF ≥ DahA > Ind > BaA ≥ BghiP ≥ Chr ≥ BaP > BNT. A log-log plot of the ECthr plotted against the LD 50 (LD 50 data from Brunstrom et al., 1991) for BkF, DahA, BaA, and BNT resulted in a good correlation (r 2 = 0. 898) between EROD-inducing potency and in ovo lethality. The regression line was used to predict LD 50 values for Ind, Chr, and BaP. Although the regression line overestimated the LD 50 values, the estimated values appear to be within one order of magnitude of their approximate LD 50. The rank order of induction potency of the eight EROD-inducing PAHs in duck and scaup hepatocytes was BkF ≥ DahA > BaP ≥ Ind > BghiP ≥ Chr ≥ BaA > BNT, and BkF ≥ DahA > BaP ≥ Ind > BaA ≥ BghiP > Chr, respectively. Among species, there was no clear overall trend in relative sensitivity to EROD induction by individual PAHs. The EROD inducing potency of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) extracts was investigated in hepatocytes of all three species. The rank order of sensitivity to the extracts was chicken > duck ≥ scaup.

There {{is a report}} of four <b>greater</b> <b>scaups</b> in April near Chicago {{swallowing}} hibernating leopard frogs (with body length about 5 cm), which they dredged out of a roadside freshwater pond. In freshwater ecosystems, the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> will eat seeds, leaves, stems and roots, along with sedges, pondweeds, muskgrass, and wild celery. Owing to the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup's</b> webbed feet and weight, it can dive up to 6 m and stay submerged {{for up to a}} minute, allowing it to reach food sources that are unobtainable to other diving ducks. The <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> forms large flocks, some of which can contain thousands of birds. When flocks are on flowing water, they will face the current, and as the ducks float backwards, some fly {{to the front of the}} flock to maintain position.|$|R
40|$|Recent data on {{status and}} {{distribution}} of resident and migrant birds in the Cape Verde Islands are presented, including records of 11 taxa new to the archipelago, viz. Lesser <b>Scaup</b> <b>Aythya</b> affinis, White-tailed Tropicbird Phaethon lepturus, Great White Egret Casmerodius albus, Semipalmated Plover Charadrius semipalmatus, Semipalmated Sandpiper Calidris pusilla, Lesser Yellowlegs Tringa flavipes, Spotted Sandpiper Actitis macularia, Roseate Tern Sterna dougallii, Pallid Swift Apus pallidus, Black Redstart Phoenicurus ochruros, and Winchat Saxicola rubetra. Status and conservation of rare breeding taxa (including endemics) are discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are {{a popular}} game bird in North America and Europe. They are hunted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, and in Iran for both sport and {{commercial}} reasons. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are hunted with shotguns because {{they must be}} shot on the fly, a challenging task, as they can fly at up to 121 km/h. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are hunted from shorelines and in open water hunting blinds or layout boats, low-profile kayak-like boats that hunters lie inside. Hunters frequently use decoys to attract the birds, often arranged to simulate a raft of <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> and featuring an open area to attract the birds to land. In most countries where <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are hunted, a duck stamp is required along with the normal hunting licences that are required to pursue other game. In America and Canada, waterfowl must be hunted with non-toxic shot.|$|R
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> {{are rated}} {{as a species}} of least concern by the IUCN Redlist. During aerial {{population}} surveys <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>scaup</b> are counted together, because they look almost identical from the air. It was estimated that the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> made up about 11% of the continental scaup population. Since the 1980s, scaup populations have been steadily decreasing. Some of the primary factors contributing to this decline are habitat loss, contaminants, changes in breeding habitat, and a lower female survival rate. The 2010 American scaup population survey was 4.2 million scaup, however, the worldwide <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> population survey estimated 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 mature <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> Along with the aerial population surveys, there is a banding program for the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> Metal leg bands are placed on them, so that if the scaup is killed by a hunter {{or if it is}} captured by another banding group, the number on the band can be reported to biologists and wildlife organizations. These banding programs yield valuable data about migration patterns, harvest rates, and survival rates.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> faces {{numerous}} threats, {{the most}} significant challenge to their survival is habitat degradation caused by a mix of human development and runoff. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup,</b> when moulting and during the winter, are threatened by escalated levels of organochloride contaminants. Oil and sewage pollution also threaten this duck. Since 80% of the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> population winters in the urbanized part of the Atlantic Flyway, these ducks are subject {{to high levels of}} organic contaminates, along with increased levels of heavy metals in foods and habitat.|$|R
50|$|Although {{generally}} hosting {{only small}} numbers of birds (244 species recorded), the reservoir has attracted {{a considerable number of}} North American vagrant shorebirds and wildfowl, including a number of lesser <b>scaup</b> (<b>Aythya</b> affinis). In May 2016 a Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) was seen in western Cornwall and was frequently seen on the reservoir. There are 5,000 year old fossil remains of this species from Somerset and this bird could be the first recorded in Britain since then. At {{the same time as the}} Dalmatian pelican, a cackling goose, (Branta hutchinsii), which is a scarce but regular North American vagrant was at the reservoir.|$|R
