In Kansas City, Harding spoke on transportation issues; in Hutchinson, Kansas, agriculture was the theme. In Denver, he spoke on Prohibition, and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until Franklin Roosevelt. Harding had become a supporter of the World Court, and wanted the U.S. to become a member. In addition to making speeches, he visited Yellowstone and Zion National Parks, and dedicated a monument on the Oregon Trail at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer Ezra Meeker and others.|$|E

It was ultimately put on display at the patriarchate building in Belgrade, where it remains. It began undergoing restoration in 2004.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December, Div Cav {{guarded the}} {{northern}} {{flank of the}} brigade in its advance on Nofilia; B and C Squadrons engaged the German rearguard, knocking out one Panzer III and losing two carriers.

The regiment was scheduled to camp at Nofilia for a week, with C Squadron dispatched to guard the airfield at Sultan with a detachment of engineers to clear mines. The minefield was cleared by 23 December, when A Squadron replaced C Squadron. In late December, 18 new carriers arrived and the regiment prepared for another advance.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{maintained}} a garrison at the castle, but in 1647 <b>it</b> <b>cut</b> {{the levels of}} the armed forces across the country; most soldiers who lost their posts were offered two months pay, but at Pendennis only one month's pay was offered. The garrison, led by Colonel Richard Fortescue, mutinied, seized the visiting Parliamentary commissioners and refused to leave the castle until the additional pay was granted to them. Fearing a wider uprising, Parliament negotiated an end to the confrontation, paying off the garrison in full and offering Fortescue fresh employment elsewhere. A smaller, more reliable garrison was then installed. During the interregnum, the castle was used to imprison the radical pamphleteer William Prynne.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{surrender}} on July 4, 1863, {{is sometimes}} considered, {{when combined with}} Gen. Robert E. Lee's defeat at Gettysburg by Maj. Gen.

The Union victory also permanently severed communication between the balance of the Confederacy and the Trans-Mississippi Department.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help <b>it</b> <b>cut</b> through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E
5|$|About 1.22million years ago, the San Joaquin Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault (the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, {{or one that}} had formed prior to the mountains' uplift, <b>it</b> <b>cut</b> a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E
5|$|Detachment Brandenstein {{attacked}} {{towns of}} Kotka and Lahti. The Red Guards' strong defence {{in the former}} stalled the Germans' plan, but they took over Lahti on 19–20 April. The German troops advanced from east-southeast; via Nastola, through Mustankallio graveyard in Salpausselkä and Russian garrisons of Hennala. The battle was mild, but strategically important as <b>it</b> <b>cut</b> connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. Fierce battles, in {{the town and the}} surrounding area broke out between 22 April and 2 May 1918, as several thousand western Red Guard and Red civilian refugees tried to push through Lahti on their way to Russia. The German troops were able to hold major parts of the town and halt the Red advance. Around 600 Reds and 80 German soldiers perished in the Lahti combats. In total 30,000 Reds were imprisoned in the town and the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|It was {{possibly}} after the defences were finished that Urbicus {{turned his attention}} upon the fourth lowland Scottish tribe, the Novantae who inhabited the Dumfries and Galloway peninsula. The main lowland tribes, sandwiched as they were between Hadrian's Wall of stone {{to the south and}} the new turf wall to the north, later formed a confederation against Roman rule, collectively known as the Maeatae. The Antonine Wall had a variety of purposes. It provided a defensive line against the Caledonians. <b>It</b> <b>cut</b> off the Maeatae from their Caledonian allies and created a buffer zone north of Hadrian's Wall. It also facilitated troop movements between east and west, but its main purpose may not have been primarily military. It enabled Rome to control and tax trade and may have prevented potentially disloyal new subjects of Roman rule from communicating with their independent brethren to the north and coordinating revolts. Urbicus achieved an impressive series of military successes, but like Agricola's they were short-lived. Having taken twelve years to build, the wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} {{by taking a}} single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over bowled by Pollard, Hassett fell for 13 on the second ball, which lifted suddenly after bouncing. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball {{in the same place}} as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded off the pitch and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as <b>it</b> <b>cut</b> off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett. The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as <b>it</b> <b>cut</b> off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E

Before reaching Hamilton Avenue (now called Harvard Avenue), the tracks shifted southeast again, largely paralleling Harvard Avenue, Caine Avenue, and Miles Avenue before leaving the township.|$|E
