5|$|Parts to be {{injection}} moulded {{must be very}} carefully designed to facilitate the moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and {{the properties of the}} moulding machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of injection moulding is facilitated by this breadth of <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> and possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar <b>design</b> <b>considerations,</b> both being form-fitting garments. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the chief}} {{architectural}} concerns {{for the design of}} venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue can be emptied is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take a very long time to disperse from a badly designed venue and this in turn creates a safety risk. The Hillsborough disaster {{is an example of how}} poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> in most theatrical venues.|$|E

25|$|<b>Design</b> <b>considerations</b> {{will include}} strength, stiffness, and {{stability}} of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and sustainability.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{security}} concerns were not major <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> for DNS software or any software for deployment {{on the early}} Internet, as the network was not open for participation by the general public. However, {{the expansion of the}} Internet into the commercial sector in the 1980s changed the requirements for security measures to protect data integrity and user authentication.|$|E

25|$|A modern {{electrometer}} is {{a highly}} sensitive electronic voltmeter whose input impedance is so high that the current flowing into it can be considered, for most practical purposes, to be zero. The actual value of input resistance for modern electronic electrometers is around 1014Ω, compared to around 1010Ω for nanovoltmeters. Owing to the extremely high input impedance, special <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> must be applied to avoid leakage current such as driven shields and special insulation materials.|$|E
25|$|The Tesla Model X, first {{introduced}} in 2015, has double hinged gull-wing doors, called falcon-wing doors by Tesla. The Model X has several <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> {{to make the}} doors more practical. Being double hinged allows them to open with less clearance (horizontal and vertical) than would otherwise be required. The vehicle also has sensors to determine ceiling height {{and the presence of}} potential obstacles and determines how the hinges will operate to open the doors and avoid the obstacles, if possible.|$|E
25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
5000|$|These {{are also}} {{referred}} to as [...] "pistols". The main <b>design</b> <b>consideration</b> is that the projectile is large and accelerating vertically downwards and {{may or may not be}} rotating relatively slowly.|$|R
50|$|For {{high volume}} {{systems such as}} {{portable}} music players or mobile phones, minimizing cost is usually the primary <b>design</b> <b>consideration.</b> Engineers typically select hardware that is just “good enough” to implement the necessary functions.|$|R
50|$|Another most <b>design</b> <b>consideration</b> is {{the average}} stage loading. This can be kept at a {{sensible}} level either by {{increasing the number of}} compression stages (more weight/cost) or the mean blade speed (more blade/disc stress).|$|R
25|$|For maximum life, {{capacitors}} usually {{need to be}} able {{to handle}} the maximum amount of reversal that a system may experience. An AC circuit experiences 100% voltage reversal, while underdamped DC circuits experience less than 100%. Reversal creates excess electric fields in the dielectric, causes excess heating of both the dielectric and the conductors, and can dramatically shorten the life expectancy of the capacitor. Reversal ratings often affect the <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> for the capacitor, from the choice of dielectric materials and voltage ratings to the types of internal connections used.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> of RTP is {{to carry}} a range of {{multimedia}} formats and allow new formats without revising the RTP standard. The design of RTP {{is based on the}} architectural principle known as application level framing (ALF). The information required by a specific application's needs is not included in the generic RTP header, but is instead provided through RTP profiles and payload formats. For each class of application (e.g., audio, video), RTP defines a profile and one or more associated payload formats. A complete specification of RTP for a particular application usage requires profile and payload format specifications.|$|E
25|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act sets certain {{standards}} for building access and other <b>design</b> <b>considerations</b> in all new construction and major renovations in the U.S. An architectural barrier is any feature that makes access {{or use of}} a building difficult, unreasonably dangerous or impossible. This can include aisles that are too narrow for easy access by a wheelchair. Often, {{the only way to}} get from a row of chairs, shelves, workstations, etc., to an exit is by an aisle. Historically, many deaths and serious injuries have occurred due to fire, inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes, etc., because blocked or partially blocked aisles prevented persons from promptly leaving a dangerous area.|$|E

30|$|Veatch (1983) {{mentioned}} on {{the general}} treatment <b>design</b> <b>consideration</b> which limited to selecting the appropriate types of materials (e.g., fluids, additives, and proppants), the appropriate volumes of materials, injection rates for pumping these materials, and the schedule for injecting the materials.|$|R
25|$|The {{identification}} of suitable matrix compounds {{is determined to}} some extent by trial and error, but {{they are based on}} some specific molecular <b>design</b> <b>considerations.</b> They are of a fairly low molecular weight (to allow easy vaporization), but are large enough (with a low enough vapor pressure) not to evaporate during sample preparation or while standing in the mass spectrometer. They are often acidic, therefore act as a proton source to encourage ionization of the analyte. Basic matrices have also been reported. They have a strong optical absorption in either the UV or IR range, so that they rapidly and efficiently absorb the laser irradiation. This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several conjugated double bonds, as seen in the structure of cinnamic acid. They are functionalized with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} properties of FRP or GRP bars differ markedly from steel, {{so there are}} differences in the <b>design</b> <b>considerations.</b> FRP or GRP bars have relatively higher tensile strength but lower stiffness, so that deflections are likely to be higher than for equivalent steel-reinforced units. Structures with internal FRP reinforcement typically have an elastic deformability comparable to the plastic deformability (ductility) of steel reinforced structures. Failure in either case is more likely to occur by compression of the concrete than by rupture of the reinforcement. Deflection is always a major design consideration for reinforced concrete. Deflection limits are set to ensure that crack widths in steel-reinforced concrete are controlled to prevent water, air or other aggressive substances reaching the steel and causing corrosion. For FRP-reinforced concrete, aesthetics and possibly water-tightness will be the limiting criteria for crack width control. FRP rods also have relatively lower compressive strengths than steel rebar, and accordingly require different design approaches for reinforced concrete columns.|$|E
25|$|The rooms {{within the}} {{elongation}} are accessed through a 48-foot long, 6-foot wide gallery. The gallery is enclosed in its full length {{through the use}} of an original row of wooden balustrade, supporting operable wooden transoms, movable wooden louvers and wooden shutters, simultaneously providing shade and air, two important local <b>design</b> <b>considerations,</b> as Ponce is known for its hot weather and its implacable sun. Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of every room's ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof and letting the cool air circulate throughout the entire house. The fresh air is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. Every single room in the house connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with louvers and shutters, other of solid construction), allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed. In addition, every single room has, at least, one wooden double door that open toward the exterior.|$|E

500|$|The Portrait Series {{was first}} {{released}} by the Board of Commissioners of Currency Singapore (BCCS) on 9 September 1999 to welcome the new millennium, designed by local artist Eng Siak Loy. The series has a total of seven denominations in general circulation; the denominations $1 and $500 were not carried forward from the previous Ship Series. The colour for denominations up to $50 have been retained, a tradition kept since {{the era of the}} Malaya and British Borneo dollar. A more standardised approach is adopted across all banknote denominations, with features noticeably differing from all previous series. For example, the watermark no longer features the lion head symbol. Due to <b>design</b> <b>considerations,</b> the dollar sign was considered redundant and is no longer included in this series. [...] In addition, the note printing company no longer appears on any part of the portrait note.|$|E
