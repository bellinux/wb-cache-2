In 2012, evidence emerged in the media that a newspaper clipping from 1909 may have debunked the long debated argument. In the article, Pearse was quoted as having said in November of that year: [...] "I did not attempt anything practical with the idea until, in 1904, the St Louis Exposition authorities offered a prize of 20,000 {{to the man who}} invented and flew a flying machine over a specified course.

50|$|Multimedia {{is heavily}} {{used in the}} {{entertainment}} industry, especially to develop special effects in movies and animations (VFX, 3D animation, etc.). Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Some video games also use multimedia features.Multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are called interactive multimedia.In the arts there are multimedia artists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media {{that in some way}} incorporates interaction with the viewer. One of the most relevant could be Peter Greenaway who is melding cinema with opera and all sorts of digital media. Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an art gallery. Although multimedia <b>display</b> <b>material</b> may be volatile, the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional media. Digital recording material may be just as durable and infinitely reproducible with perfect copies every time.|$|E

50|$|St Bartholomew's Hospital {{has existed}} {{on the same}} site since its {{founding}} in the 12th century, surviving both the Great Fire of London and the Blitz. Its museum, which is open Tuesdays to Fridays every week, shows how medical care has developed over this time and explains the history of the hospital. Part-way around the exhibition is a door which opens on to the hospital's official entrance hall. On the walls of the staircase are two murals painted by William Hogarth, The Pool of Bethesda (1736) and The Good Samaritan (1737). They can only be seen at close quarters on Friday afternoons. Hogarth was so outraged by the news that the hospital was commissioning art from Italian painters that he insisted on doing these murals free of charge, as a demonstration that English painting was equal to the task. The Pool of Bethesda is of particular medical interest, as it depicts a scene in which Christ cures the sick: <b>display</b> <b>material</b> on the first floor speculates in modern medical terms about the ailments from which Christ's patients in the painting are suffering.|$|E

She clashes with Jack over her plans to <b>display</b> <b>material</b> about sex education and LGBT issues. A council meeting gives control of Blaze to the church, and Paige and Jack fall out. After feeling over-emotional, Paige takes a pregnancy test and learns she is pregnant with Jack's child. During a night out in the city with David Tanaka (Takaya Honda), Paige starts spotting and worries she is having a miscarriage, but an ultrasound shows the baby is okay. Paige tells her family about the pregnancy, but refuses to name the father. David later offers to say he is the father and Paige agrees. She later allows David to end the pretence early. She then confirms to Brad and Lauren that Jack is the father of the baby, but she struggles to tell Jack the truth. Paige decides to move to Queensland with her parents. She is involved in a car accident, and has to be cut free from her car. Before she is taken into surgery, Paige tells Jack that he is the father of her baby. Brad and Lauren announce that they are moving to the Gold Coast, and Paige decides to join them and raise her baby there without Jack's help, but Jack convinces her to stay as he wants to be in the baby's life. Paige drinks a tea made from mushrooms, and has to be taken to the hospital, where Jack blames Piper for not looking after Paige. Mark invites Paige to move into Number 24, after she admits that she is lonely at home. Paige learns the baby is breech and she worries about becoming a mother. The ladies of Ramsay Street form a club to support her. Paige returns to the shack where the baby was conceived and she goes into labour. Karl and Jack find her and she gives birth to a son. She then loses conscious and is rushed to hospital for surgery. Lauren returns to support Paige and Jack. Paige names their son Gabriel (Kian Bafekrpour). Paige learns that Amber has a burst appendix and accompanies Lauren to Queensland to help out. Paige returns to find Jack has left the church. She decides to move in with Terese and Piper at Number 22. It soon emerges that Mark visited Paige in Queensland and they kissed, but Paige told him it was a mistake. Paige rejects Jack and realises that she has feelings for Mark. Whilst Paige is at home with Terese and Gabriel, there's a police raid, caused by a hoax report that a baby is being threatened with a knife.|$|E

Richard Masker asked if the library would let him <b>display</b> <b>materials,</b> some of which dispute the Holocaust, in the library’s display case. He was denied after the library decided the {{literature}} was political in nature. Masker then asked the library to review its policies {{so that he could}} <b>display</b> his <b>materials</b> at a later time. While the library is still reviewing their policy residents of Corvallis feel strongly that the policy should stay as it is. Steven Sher says that Revisionism is insulting to the Jewish community. Sher said this isn’t about censorship, however for the library to <b>display</b> these <b>materials</b> would give the impression that the library endorsed this point of view.
