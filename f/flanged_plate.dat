Initially the wheels were without flanges for use on the <b>flanged</b> <b>plate</b> rails.

50|$|The longer span, (136 ft) {{uses the}} same {{materials}} but is more intricate. It has nine panels, each 15 ft wide, creating chords which arch both {{above and below the}} deck {{to the point that they}} are 22 ft apart at their most distant from each other, in mid-span. The upper chord is made of <b>flanged</b> <b>plate</b> girders riveted together with top and bottom iron cap plates bolted on; the lower of double 1+1/4 by 3 in wrought iron bars. Both are joined at the span's end with end pins. A lattice-braced system similar to that on the short span supports the lenticular truss, with similar members serving as horizontal braces below the deck. Iron tie rods 1+1/4 in wide serve as diagonal cross-braces on the panels, and there is a horizontal tension rod at each end of the truss. A set of expansion rollers at the west end, intended to provide additional stability, has since corroded due to road salt and rust.|$|E
40|$|The present thesis aims {{to study}} the effect of human {{movements}} on local exhaust ventilation. In its simplest terms, local exhaust ventilation is a system which has the function of extracting contaminated air situated close to the contaminant source, protecting a working person from exposure to hazardous substances by containing or capturing them locally, at the emission point. As an important security measure referred to terms of health, it is crucial for the healthiness of workers to control and prevent them from the exposure to vapour, mist, dust or other airborne contaminants. Additionally, {{to a lesser degree}} of significance, it can be stressed an expected increase in worker performance due to an improvement of the working conditions. There is an existing necessity for well-defined and appropriate methods to test the performance of local exhaust devices in order to reach standard efficiency values. The lack of an international standardization led to the realization of this study, which, ultimately, has the purpose of obtaining relevant results that can be utilized for future normalized test procedures. The study entails full scale experimental measurements that include air velocity measurements in 3 dimensions, a local exhaust ventilation device with circular hood and a flat <b>flanged</b> <b>plate</b> and a controlled generation of air turbulence through physical movements of a human-sized cylinder, simulating a walking person. The present study extends previous similar studies at the University of Gävle, where the controlled air turbulence was generated by a moving plate. After meaningful results obtained in that study, one of the considerations was to better simulate a walking person, by replacing the plate for a movable cylinder. The present study points at a larger similarity occurring with a cylinder than with a plate, as regards the air flow pattern produced by a real walking person. As in the previous study, the Percentage of Negative Velocities, PNV, has been used as the main measure of turbulence induced risk of contaminant spread. The PNV represents the fraction of the time when the flow is directed opposite to the suction air stream in front of the local exhaust hood. The obtained results conclude that the use of the cylinder as a moving object has been an improvement to simulate the effect of the movement of a human being on a relaxed walking pace. The present study was carried out in parallel with the thesis work by Leyre Catalán Ros, which complements this study by analyzing the effect of an added heated dummy, simulating a person seated in front of the local exhaust device...|$|E
5000|$|The type 'L' boiler {{was again}} {{substantially}} different {{to any other}} class. It was 5' 9" [...] in diameter, a foot larger than the 'J' boiler of the previous engines. A Belpaire firebox and Ramsbottom safety valves were used. A similar boiler was fitted to Hughes' 1910 large-boilered Class 9 development of the Class 30. Although this was another feature often described as being {{in common with the}} 0-8-0s, they were actually longer than the L boiler. The L boiler was unique to the Class 32, although they were made on the same <b>flanging</b> <b>plates</b> as Hughes' Dreadnought class. This unique boiler would eventually lead to the class' early withdrawal, when the boilers were due for replacement at twenty years old.|$|R
25|$|The works was {{supplied}} with compressed air for pneumatic drilling, riveting, and chipping hammers; a hydraulic plant for the 250-ton <b>plate</b> <b>flanging</b> press and a 20-ton press; and both alternating and direct electric current.|$|R
5000|$|The mortar used lime, {{water and}} ox blood. The iron {{castings}} for the trough were produced {{at the nearby}} Plas Kynaston Foundry, Cefn Mawr, which was built by the Shrewsbury ironfounder and millwright William Hazledine {{in the hope of}} gaining the contract. The rib castings may have been made at Hazledine's original works at Coleham, near Shrewsbury. The trough was made from <b>flanged</b> <b>plates</b> of cast iron, bolted together, with the joints bedded with Welsh flannel and a mixture of white lead and iron particles from boring waste. After twenty-five years the white lead was replaced with ordinary tar. As with Telford's Longdon-on-Tern aqueduct, the plates are not rectangular but shaped as voussoirs, similar to those of a stone arch. There is no structural significance to their shape: it is a decorative feature only, following the lines of the stiffening plates (see below) in the castings beneath. [...] In nearby Cefn Mawr a high quartz content sandstone was discovered at the location where the New Cefn Druids football stadium has been built. Know locally as 'The Rock' the sandstone was extracted and worked here into the many numerous shapes as required by the architects. Many remnants of the workings are still visible alongside Rock Road which links Rhosymedre to Plas Madoc.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Eagle Boat" [...] {{stemmed from}} a wartime Washington Post {{editorial}} which called for [...] "...an eagle to scour the seas and pounce upon and destroy every German submarine." [...] However, the Eagle Boats never saw service in World War I. Reports on their performance at sea were mixed. The introduction, at Ford's insistence, of <b>flanged</b> <b>plates</b> instead of rolled plates facilitated production but resulted in sea-keeping characteristics which were far from ideal. In the first years after the war, {{a number of them}} were used as aircraft tenders. Despite the handicap of their size, they serviced photographic reconnaissance planes at Midway in 1920 and in the Hawaiian Islands in 1921 before being supplanted by larger ships. Eagle boat 34, as related in Max Miller's 1932 book I Cover The Waterfront, shared the yearly duty alternately with the Navy tug USS Koka (AT-31) of capturing elephant seals on Mexico's Guadalupe Island for the San Diego Zoo. A number of the Eagle Boats were transferred to the United States Coast Guard in 1919, and the balance were sold in the 1930s and early 1940s. These vessels were used during World War II. One was stationed in Miami as a training vessel.|$|R
2500|$|These {{primitive}} rails were superseded in 1793 {{when the}} then {{superintendent of the}} Cromford Canal, Benjamin Outram, constructed a tramway with 'L'-shaped <b>flanged</b> cast-iron <b>plate</b> rails from the quarry at Crich: {{it was a little}} over a mile in length descending some [...] and had a gauge of [...] Wagons fitted with simple flangeless wheels were kept on the track by vertical ledges, or plates.

50|$|After {{the success}} of the {{corrugated}} furnace, Fox turned his attention to other products, and in 1887 exhibited in Newcastle his <b>flanged</b> frame <b>plate</b> for railway rolling stock. At that time, {{and for a long time}} to come, traditional rolling stock was built of timber frames with timber superstructure. This produced a heavy vehicle that required considerable tractive effort from the locomotive. The pressed steel product was made from relatively lightweight flanged steel that gave comparable strength with considerable saving in dead weight. The construction technique, using male and female dies in a hydraulic press, offered a considerable saving of labour compared to hand-built timber cars. Fox found an ally in the promotion of his pressed steel vehicles in E R Calthrop, who promoted pressed steel rolling stock for his system of narrow gauge railways, and used them on the Barsi Light Railway.|$|R

50|$|Hedley {{felt that}} if the pairs of wheels were connected, as with Richard Trevithick's engines, if one pair began to slip, it would be counteracted by the other. The mine owner, Christopher Blackett had just {{replaced}} the wooden waggonway with iron <b>flanged</b> 'L' section <b>plate</b> rails. Hedley first constructed a test carriage operated by manpower, to test the adhesion under various loads. He then used it as the chassis for a locomotive constructed to Trevithick's pattern with a single cylinder and a simple straight through fire tube to the boiler. This engine was not satisfactory. Its motion was erratic, because of the single cylinder, and it produced insufficient steam.|$|R
50|$|As {{the boiler}} was small, with a barrel {{diameter}} of only 2', it was practical {{to form the}} deeply curved plates for {{the inner and outer}} firebox with a hydraulic press. The inner firebox was formed in one piece as a truncated cone with a domed top. Although a small boiler, this gave a large grate area that permitted the burning of coke as a fuel. The front face of this cone was flattened inwards, to form the firebox tubeplate. 54 1½inch fire-tubes were used. The boiler barrel was cylindrical, but {{the lower part of the}} rear end was cut on a diagonal, rather than straight across. The lower part of the outer firebox was also conical and wrapped over this diagonal edge. The foundation ring was circular, avoiding the problems of mud build-up in the corners. The upper corner of the outer firebox was a separate plate, approximately a quarter of a sphere. Rather than the time-consuming and costly <b>flanging</b> of flat <b>plates,</b> these curved plates could be pressed and riveted together almost immediately. The number of boiler plates was also reduced, from the usual eight to only five. A relatively high working pressure of 250 psi could be used.|$|R
40|$|A PhotocopySteel plate girders are {{generally}} used to span long distances and support heavy loads They consist of {{top and bottom}} flanges connected to a vertical web. The flanges {{are connected to the}} web by fillet welds. I’ late girders could be custom designed to suit client's requirements. They are often used in situations where rolled steel sections of the required sizes are not available. The designer has the option of selecting suitable dimensions for the flanges and web from a vast range of possibilities. Smaller flange areas could be achieved with deep girders. However deep girders could suffer from shear buckling of the web; a problem that could be overcome by providing either a thick web or stiffening the web. Thick webs result in heavy sections while the thin web option though resulting in material savings could result in a more expensive solution due to high fabrication costs. / The objective {{of this study is to}} assist the structural designer achieve a cols effective steel plate girder by providing design guidelines. The study was limited to parallel <b>flanged</b> steel <b>plate</b> girders made of Grade 43 steel and used in buildings. / Optimum dimensions of flanges and webs have been obtained for both stiffened and imp- stiffened steel girders of simply supported spans ranging from 3 m to 25 m, subject to uniformly distributed loads, and point loads of varying magnitudes. The design loads used are those for girders supporting a reinforced concrete slab and subject to office type imposed loads. The girders are designed non-compositely. The design checks for the plate girder were carried out using software developed in-house. The optimum design is selected on ihe basis of total cost (i. e. material and fabrication costs). The variation of steel tonnage and the total cost of steel girders for the different parameters selected are presented in tabular and graphical formal. / From the results obtained optimum span-to-depth ratios were selected under different girder types with their relevant spans. / This is of particular important to Sri Lanka where rolled steel sections need to be imported much in advance of construction and last minute modifications will thus prove to be difficult. This problem could be overcome by having a steel pale girder custom designed, and fabricated locally, which will be well cost effective...|$|R
40|$|This Master thesis {{describes}} an experimental study aimed at determining the {{minimum ignition energy}} (MIE) of premixed propane/air mixtures. Two fundamentally different circuits have been employed for creating the sparks in the experiments: {{a replica of the}} American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) apparatus (ASTM, 2007) and an improved version of the synchronized spark generator described by Randeberg et al. (2006). The explosion vessel was a 0. 20 dm 3 cylindrical plastic tube, equipped with two 1. 6 mm flat-ended tungsten electrodes. In the present work, the electrodes were <b>flanged</b> with glass <b>plates</b> and the spark gap was set to 2. 0 mm. The principle of the capacitive spark circuit of ASTM was to charge an appropriate capacitance connected across the spark gap through a large resistor (1012 Ω) by a high-voltage power supply until the spark occurred. Different spark energies could be obtained mainly by varying the value of the capacitance. Premixed propane/air was used as test gas. About 220 tests were performed with the ASTM circuit to find the boundary between ignition and no-ignition in propane/air mixtures. The investigated propane concentrations were in the range 3. 5 to 8. 0 vol. %. By following the approach of Moorhouse et al. (1974), the MIE in the present work was determined by drawing the highest possible boundary line through all the experimental points that had no ignition points below it. This resulted in a minimum ignition energy of 0. 48 mJ at a propane concentration of 5. 2 vol. %. This is twice the value reported by Lewis and von Elbe (1961), but in very good agreement with the result obtained by Moorhouse et al [...] The quenching effect of the 2. 0 mm spark gap for propane/air mixtures of less than 4. 0 vol. % was confirmed. However, the present results do not indicate that 2. 0 mm is the quenching distance for any specific concentration on the fuel rich side in the investigated concentration range (3. 5 - 8. 0 vol. %). According to the data reported by Lewis and von Elbe, a flanged spark gap of 2. 0 mm should correspond to the quenching distance for a propane/air concentration of about 6. 0 vol. % on the fuel rich side. The probability of ignition for propane/air mixtures of 5. 2 and 5. 5 vol. % were also studied by varying the spark energy levels in the range 0. 40 to 0. 75 mJ for both concentrations. Based on the classical U-shaped curve by Lewis and von Elbe (1961), presenting MIE as function of propane concentration, it was expected that a mixture of 5. 2 vol. % propane in air would be more ignitable than a mixture of 5. 5 vol. %. However, the present results do not show any significant difference in the ignitability for the two concentrations. By applying a statistical model to the data at each of the two concentrations, MIE for 1 % probability of ignition were calculated. They were both significantly higher than the Lewis and von Elbe value of 0. 25 mJ. Randeberg et al. (2006) described a spark generator for producing synchronized capacitive spark discharges of low energy, down to below 0. 1 mJ. However, Eckhoff et al. (2008) re-examined the discharge circuit of Randeberg et al., and concluded that, due to the hidden subtle energy supply, the real spark energies in the experiments were significantly larger than those quoted in the published paper. The additional energy in the discharge was of the order of 1 mJ. With the aim to minimize the additional energy, [...] ...|$|R
