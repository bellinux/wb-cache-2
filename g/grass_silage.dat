40|$|Maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> are {{commonly}} used as major feed materials for dairy cows in Europe and are becoming common parts of dairy cow rations {{in other parts of}} the world. Thenutritive value of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> varies greatly due to variation in chemical composition. A combination of different factors such as the use of various cultivars, fertilization practices, growing conditions, harvesting technology, maturity at harvest and ensiling conditions cause this variation in chemical composition. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ rumen degradation characteristics and in situ mobile nylon bag digestibility of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> Maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> with a broad range in chemical composition and quality parameters were selected from different Dutch commercial farms. The broad range in the chemical composition of the maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> resulted in a large variation in rumen degradable fractions of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and starch. The intestinal digestibility of CP, NDF and/or starch was affected by the concentration of these components in the maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages,</b> by the rumen incubation time and the rumen escape content. Regression equations were developed describing relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> A number of the developed regression equations presented in this thesis can be used for accurate and rapid estimation of the ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages,</b> without conducting time consuming and expensive in situ experiments. The second aim of this thesis was to determine whether three cows are sufficient to cover the variation between individual cows in in situ rumen degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> Significant differences (P 0. 05) between individual cows were found for all the parameters of DM, OM, CP and NDF. The results suggest that using three cows are sufficient for nylon bag incubations of <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and pooling of rumen incubated residues is allowed to obtain a representative sample. The third aim of this thesis was to compare two fractionation methods; the washing machine method and a modified method, for nitrogen (N) and starch fractions of maize silages and N fractions of <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The N and/or starch fractions of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> determined, using the washing machine method (washing with water for 40 min) and the modified method (shaking with buffer solution for 60 min) were compared. The different methodological approaches of both methods resulted in different values for the washout (W), the soluble (S) and the non-washout (D+U) fractions of N of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and for the W, the insoluble washout (W-S) and the D+U fractions of starch of maize silages. The loss of insoluble small particles of starch was less during shaking of nylon bags in buffer solution, compared to washing nylon bags in the washing machine. Therefore, large differences were found between the D+U fractions of starch determined by both methods compared to the D+U fractions of N of maize silages. The developed regression equations for W, S and D+U fractions of N in <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and for D+U fractions of starch in maize silages determined by both methods can be used for rapid estimation of these fractions from chemical characteristics of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The information on nutrient bioavailability of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> presented in this thesis can be used to more accurately formulate dairy ration in terms of maintenance, health and production of dairy cows...|$|R

Legume and grass hays (n = 106) were evaluated for RUP content by in situ techniques in four ruminally cannulated cows. In situ RUP for legume and grass hays averaged 25. 9 % CP and ranged from 14. 6 to 45. 5 % CP, respectively. We developed a near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy RUP calibration equation for the legume and grass hay data set using in situ RUP contents as base data. This procedure resulted in an acceptable (R 2 = 0. 87, SE = 2. 46 % CP) near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy equation to predict RUP content of legume and grass hays. Data suggest that near-infrared spectroscopy predicts RUP contents of legume and grass hays with accuracies similar to legume and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> (Key words: hay, near-infrared, protein degradation) Abbreviation key: NIRS = near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy.

50|$|Forage {{harvesters}} can be implements {{attached to}} a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they have either a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel {{with a number of}} knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. <b>Grass</b> <b>silage</b> is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, disc mowers or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the cutterhead and accelerator. In most forage harvesters, the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for chopping non-cereal crops.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of an in vitro gas production (GP) system {{to predict the}} in vivo enteric methane (CH 4) production for various ryegrass-based silages was evaluated, using adapted rumen fluid from cows. Rumen fluid from 12 lactating rumen-cannulated Holstein-Friesian cows were used for in vitro incubations and compared with in vivo CH 4 production data derived from the same cows fed the same <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The cows consumed a total mixed ration consisting of six different <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and concentrate at an 80 : 20 ratio on a dry matter (DM) basis. The <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> differed in plant maturity at harvest (28, 41 and 62 days of regrowth) and N fertilisation (65 and 150 kg of N/ha). Rumen fluid from cows consuming {{each of the six}} <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> was used to determine the in vitro organic matter (OM) fermentation and in vitro CH 4 synthesis, using an automated GP technique. In vitro GP decreased with increasing maturity of the grass. In vitro CH 4 production, expressed either in ml/g of OM, in ml/g of degraded OM (DOM) or as a% of the total GP, increased with increased N fertilisation (P < 0. 05). Maturity of grass at harvest did not affect the CH 4 synthesis expressed in ml/g of DOM and CH 4 expressed as% of the total gas, whereas N fertilisation increased the in vitro CH 4 synthesis, expressed in any unit. The in vitro data correlated poorly with the in vivo data. Across the six <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> tested, the in vitro CH 4 production, expressed in ml/g of OM after 8, 12, 24, and 72 h of incubation did not correlate with the in vivo enteric CH 4 production, expressed in g/kg of DM intake (R 2 = 0. 01 – 0. 08). Stepwise multiple regression showed a weak, but positive correlation between the observed in vivo CH 4 synthesis, expressed in g/kg FPCM and the predicted CH 4 per kg FPCM, using the amount of in vitro organic matter degraded (R 2 = 0. 40; P = 0. 036).

Lactic acid content of silages treated with FJLB was stable at 14 d of fermentation and constant until 45 d of ensiling. At 45 d of ensiling, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of silage treated with cassava meal were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than the others. In the feeding trial, the intake of silage increased (p< 0. 05) in the cow fed with the treated silage. Among the treatments, dry matter intake was the lowest in the silage treated with cassava meal.

The 4 dietary treatments were PC, 20 h {{of access to}} grazing pasture, supplemented with 6 kg/d of corn-based concentrate mixture (96 % corn; C); PCSB, 20 h of access to grazing pasture, supplemented with 6 kg/d of corn- and SBM-based concentrate mixture (78 % corn and 18 % SBM; CSB); SC, 7 h of access to grazing pasture {{during the day and}} 13 h of ad libitum access to <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> at night, supplemented with 6 kg/d of C concentrate; and SCSB, 7 h of access to grazing pasture during the day and 13 h of ad libitum access to <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> at night, supplemented with 6 kg/d of CSB concentrate. The concentrate mixtures were offered twice each day in the milking parlor and were consumed completely. <b>Grass</b> <b>silage</b> supplementation reduced dietary crude protein and concentration of total sugars, and dietary SBM inclusion increased dietary crude protein concentration and decreased dietary starch concentration. Milk yield and energy-corrected milk were increased by SBM supplementation of cows with access to <b>grass</b> <b>silage.</b> Milk protein concentration was lower in cows offered <b>grass</b> <b>silage,</b> regardless of whether SBM was fed. Dietary SBM inclusion tended to increase milk fat concentration. Plasma urea N was reduced by silage feeding and increased by SBM supplementation. Supplementation with <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> overnight could represent a useful strategy for periods of lower pasture availability. Dietary inclusion of SBM in solely grazing cows had no effects on milk production and composition, exacerbated the inefficient capture of dietary N, and increased diet cost. <b>Grass</b> <b>silage</b> supplementation affected milk FA profiles, increasing both the FA derived from de novo synthesis and those derived from rumen microbial biomass, and decreasing the sum of C 18 FA (mostly derived from diet or from mobilization of adipose tissue reserves). Milk fat concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid cis- 9, trans- 11, vaccenic acid (18 : 1 trans- 11), and linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3) were unaffected by <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> supplementation, suggesting that partial replacement of pasture by unwilted <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> does not compromise the dietary quality of milk fat for humans...|$|E

Partly funded DEFRAThe experiment investigated the digestion of lipids from different forage silages in beef steers. Six Hereford x Friesian steers prepared with rumen and duodenal cannulas were given ad libitum {{access to a}} high-sugar <b>grass</b> <b>silage,</b> control <b>grass</b> <b>silage,</b> red clover silage, or mixtures of the red clover {{and each of the}} grass silages (50 : 50, DM basis). The experiment was conducted as an incomplete 5 x 5 Latin square, with an additional randomly repeated sequence. Total fatty acid and C 18 : 3 n- 3 concentrations were greater (P < 0. 05) for the high-sugar <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> than the control <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> or the red clover silage. Dry matter and total fatty acid intake were less (P < 0. 05) for steers fed the control <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> than for steers fed the other diets. Duodenal flow of C 18 : 3 n- 3 was greater (P < 0. 05), and flows of C 18 : 0 and total C 18 : 1 trans were less (P < 0. 05), for the red clover silage compared with the 2 <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> diets, with the mixtures intermediate. These results were supported by a reduction (P < 0. 05) in biohydrogenation of C 18 : 3 n- 3 for the red clover silage, with the mixtures again being intermediate. Flows of total branched- and odd-chain fatty acids were greater (P < 0. 05) for the high-sugar <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> diet, possibly as a result of greater microbial flow, because these fatty acids are associated with bacterial lipid. Duodenal flows of the chlorophyll metabolite, phytanic acid, were greater (P < 0. 05) for animals fed the high-sugar <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> treatments compared with the other treatments.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to assess whether routine applications of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy could predict the effects of silage proteolysis on ruminal crude protein (CP) degradation of legume and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> A preliminary {{study was conducted to}} assess the effect of laboratory drying method on ruminal CP degradation of silages. Thirty legume and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> were freeze-, oven-, or microwave-dried and incubated in situ in the ventral rumen of three ruminally cannulated cows for 24 h. Freeze-drying was considered least likely to alter ruminal CP degradation of the silages; therefore, oven- and microwavedrying were compared using first-order regression with freeze-drying. Oven-drying for 48 h at 55 °C compared favorably (R 2 = 0. 84) with freeze-drying. Microwave-drying resulted in a large bias (2. 84 g/ 10 – 1 kg of CP) and was poorly related (R 2 = 0. 48) to freeze-drying. In a second study, alfalfa and timothy were cut at three maturities and allowed to wilt for 0, 10, 24, 32, 48, and 54 h. Forages were ensiled in triplicate cylindrical mini silos and allowed to ferment for 120 d. After fermentation, silages were oven-dried, ground, and scanned on a near-infrared reflectance spectrophotometer. Duplicate, dried, 2 -mm ground silage samples were incubated in the ventral rumen of three ruminally cannulated cows for 24 h. Forage species, maturity, and wilting time significantly affected 24 -h ruminal CP degradation of the silages. Nearinfrared reflectance spectroscopy accurately predicted (R 2 = 0. 91) 24 -h ruminal CP degradation of silages.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to explore the use of the tracer 13 C as an {{internal}} marker to assess feed fraction-specific digesta passage kinetics through the digestive tract of dairy cows. Knowledge on feed-specific fractional passage rates is essential to improve estimations on the extent of rumen degradation and microbial protein efficiency; however, this information is largely lacking. An in vivo and in vitro experiment was conducted with <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> (Lolium perenne L.) that were enriched with 13 C by growing the grass under elevated 13 CO 2 conditions. In a crossover design, two dairy cows received pulse doses of two 13 C-enriched <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and chromium-mordanted neutral detergent fibre (Cr-NDF) into the rumen. The two 13 C-enriched <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> used differed in digestibility and were grown under identical field conditions as the bulk silages fed to the animals. Faecal excretion patterns of 13 C-enriched dry matter (13 C-DM), neutral detergent fibre (13 C-NDF) and Cr-NDF were established, and a nonlinear multicompartmental model was used to determine their rumen passage kinetics. In addition, the 13 C-enriched silages were incubated in rumen liquid in an in vitro batch culture system at different time intervals to determine the effect of fermentation on 13 C-enrichment in the residue. The in vitro study showed that the 13 C : 12 C ratios in DM and NDF residues remained stable from 24 h of incubation onwards. In addition, in vitro fractional degradation rates for 12 C in the DM and NDF did not differ from those of 13 C, indicating that fermentative degradation does not affect the 13 C : 12 C ratio in the DM nor in the NDF fraction of the residue. Model fits to the faecal excretion curves showed a significant difference in fractional rumen passage rates between Cr-NDF, 13 C-DM and 13 C-NDF (P = 0. 025). Silage type had no clear effect on rumen passage kinetics (P = 0. 081). Moreover, it showed that peak enrichments for 13 C-DM and 13 C-NDF in faeces were reached at 30. 7 and 41. 7 h post dosing, respectively. This is well after the time (24 h) when the 13 C : 12 C ratios of the in vitro unfermented residues have reached stable enrichment level. Fractional rate constants for particle passage from the rumen are estimated from the descending slope of faecal excretion curves. The present study shows that the decline in 13 C : 12 C ratio after peak enrichment is not affected by fermentative degradation and therefore can be used to assess feed component-specific fractional passage rates...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Ten Holstein-Zebu {{crossbred}} cows distributed {{into two}} simultaneous Latin squares (5 × 5) as a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement formed by chopped sugarcane or elephant <b>grass</b> <b>silage,</b> both with {{high or low}} protein degradability supplements and a corn silage as a control treatment, were compared using orthogonal contrasts. The studied variables were the performance, plasma concentrations of urea-N, glucose, and creatinine, urine-N and milk urea-N, and the nychthemeral variation in NH 3 -N in the rumen fluid of dairy cows. Nutrient intake, milk production, and milk composition were affected by the treatments. The total mixed ration containing elephant <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> combined with rumen undegradable protein (RUP) provided balanced amounts of carbon and nitrogen in the rumen. This effect may explain the 18 % increase in milk yield compared with the other treatments. The diurnal pattern of ruminal NH 3 -N was interpreted with a sinusoid model. In general, cows fed elephant <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> exhibited higher concentrations of blood plasma and milk urea-N than animals fed sugarcane. The cows that consumed elephant <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> with rumen degradable protein concentrate showed a higher milk urea-N compared with animals that consumed elephant <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> with the RUP concentrate.

40|$|Substituting <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> with {{maize silage}} in forage {{mixtures}} {{may result in}} one forage influencing the nutritive value of another in terms of whole tract nutrient digestibility and N utilisation. This experiment investigated effects of four forage combinations being, <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> (G); 67 g/ 100 g <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> + 33 g/ 100 g maize silage (GGM); 67 g/ 100 g maize silage + 33 g/ 100 g <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> (MMG); maize silage (M). All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous (22. 4 g N/kg dry matter [DM]) using a concentrate mixture. Ration digestibility and N balance was determined using 7 Holstein Friesian steers (mean body weight 411. 0 +/- 120. 9 kg) in a cross-over design. Inclusion of maize silage in the diet had a positive linear effect on forage and total DM intake (P = 0. 001), and on apparent DM and organic matter digestibility (both P = 0. 048). Regardless of the silage ratio used, the metabolisable energy concentration of maize silage was calculated {{to be higher than}} that of <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> (P = 0. 058), and linearly related to the relative proportions of the two silages in the forage mixture. Inclusion of maize silage in the diet resulted in a linear decline in the apparent digestibility of starch (P = 0. 022), neutral detergent fibre (P < 0. 001) and acid detergent fibre (P = 0. 003). Nitrogen retention, expressed as amount retained per day or in terms of body weight (g/ 100 kg) increased linearly with maize inclusion (P = 0. 047 and 0. 046, respectively). Replacing <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> with maize silage caused linear responses according to the proportions of each forage in the diet, and that there were no associative effects of combining forages.

40|$|The aim was {{to compare}} the effects of {{additives}} on direct cut silages of pure timothy and timothy mixed with tetraploid red clover. First and second growth cuts were ensiled during three consecutive years, 1994, 1995 and 1996, either without any additive or {{with the addition of}} formic acid, or lactic acid bacteria in combination with molasses. Effects of the additives on the degradation characteristics of the herbage and the silages were analysed using an automatic in vitro gas production (GP) technique. At the end of the in vitro procedures, organic matter and neutral-detergent fibre (NDF) degradabilities were determined. The tetraploid red clover persisted in the leys during the 3 years and was the dominant species at the second growth in the mixed leys. The herbage from the mixed crops had lower dry-matter contents, higher crude protein concentrations and higher buffering capacity compared with the pure timothy at both cuts. In general, the additives reduced pH, and the concentrations of ammonium-N and acetic acid in the silages. The treated silages had a more rapid faster GP in both crops.
