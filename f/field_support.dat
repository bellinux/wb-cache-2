After Republican victories in both of those bellwether races, Howell's administration targeted the Fall 2010 CRNC field program towards specific states, which they believed contained the greatest potential for state-level and congressional gains, in the November elections.|$|E

Prominent warlords of the Retribution include Dawnlord Vyros and Kaelyssa, Night's Whisper.
