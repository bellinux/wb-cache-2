5|$|Efforts {{to better}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. The aim of this research is to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another avenue of early-stage research has <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E

5|$|Gaara has ranked highly in the {{popularity}} polls for the series, continuously placing {{in the top}} ten. The last such poll was in 2011, in which Gaara was in 4th place. Several pieces of Gaara merchandise has been released; including key chains, plush dolls and action figures of his Part I and Part II appearance. AnimeCentral listed him as eighth best villain in anime with comments <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> flashbacks made him a tragic character {{and at the same}} time similar to Naruto Uzumaki. Additionally, his fight against Rock Lee was listed as the second best one in anime for exchanges in moves and its conclusion. In 2014, IGN listed him as the third best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E

5|$|The ethnic Macedonian {{rulers of}} the Ptolemaic and Seleucid {{successor}} states accepted men {{from all over the}} Greek world as their hetairoi companions and did not foster a national identity like the Antigonids. Modern scholarship has <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> these Hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their Macedonian origins than Eastern or southern Greek traditions. While Spartan society remained mostly insular and Athens continued placing strict limitations on acquiring citizenship, the cosmopolitan Hellenistic cities of Asia and northeastern Africa bore a greater resemblance to Macedonian cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives, Greek and Macedonian colonists, and Greek-speaking Hellenized Easterners, many of whom were the product of intermarriage between Greeks and native populations.|$|E

25|$|While these {{previous}} studies <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> emotion affects memory for emotionally arousing stimuli, in their arousal-biased competition theory, Mather and Sutherland (2011) argue that how arousal influences memory for non-emotional stimuli {{depends on the}} priority of those stimuli {{at the time of}} the arousal. Arousal enhances perception and memory of high priority stimuli but impairs perception and memory of low priority stimuli. Priority can be determined by bottom-up salience or by top-down goals.|$|E
25|$|Still other theorists are {{developing}} a resurgence of interest in complexity theory and organizations, and have <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> simple structures {{can be used to}} engender organizational adaptations. For instance, Miner et al. (2000) studied how simple structures could be used to generate improvisational outcomes in product development. Their study makes links to simple structures and improviser learning. Other scholars such as Jan Rivkin and Sigglekow, and Nelson Repenning revive an older interest in how structure and strategy relate in dynamic environments.|$|E
25|$|In August 1990, Power Partners: How Two-Career Couples Can Play to Win, {{written by}} Cuozzo's wife Jane, was published.

The book played on tennis analogies and suggested that couples behave as coordinated doubles teams—for instance, providing their spouses' business card at opportune times to help them acquire new clients or accounts. About two years later, in November 1992, Cuozzo's father-in-law Solomon G. Hershey died.|$|E

25|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} upon this group because {{the years between}} the late teens and the mid-twenties are {{believed}} to be a critical period during which young people form adult identities and move toward independence. The effects of youth disconnection—limited education, social exclusion, lack of work experience, and fewer opportunities to develop mentors and valuable work connections—can have long-term consequences that snowball across the life course, eventually influencing everything from earnings and self-sufficiency to physical and mental health and marital prospects. Much discussion has been <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to reach these young people and connect them with broader social institutions in order to prevent these negative consequences.|$|E
