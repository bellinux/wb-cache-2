40|$|While the {{shortest}} path problem has myriad applications, the computational efficiency of suitable algorithms depends intimately on {{the underlying problem}} domain. In this paper, we focus on domains where evaluating the edge weight function dominates algorithm running time. Inspired by approaches in robotic motion planning, we define and investigate the Lazy Shortest Path class of algorithms which is differentiated by the choice of an <b>edge</b> <b>selector</b> function. We show that several algorithms in the literature are equivalent to this lazy algorithm for appropriate choice of this selector. Further, we propose various novel selectors inspired by sampling and statistical mechanics, and find that these selectors outperform existing algorithms {{on a set of}} example problems.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a generalization {{of the best}} choice problem to upward directed graphs. We describe a strategy for choosing a maximal element (i. e., an element with no outgoing <b>edges)</b> when a <b>selector</b> knows in advance only the number n of vertices of the graph. We show that, {{as long as the}} number of elements dominated directly by the maximal ones is not greater than c 1 n for some positive constant c 1 and the indegree of remaining vertices is bounded by a constant D, the probability pn of the right choice according to our strategy satisfies lim infn→∞pnn≥δ> 0, where δ is a constant depending on c 1 and D...|$|R
