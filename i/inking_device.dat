40|$|We have {{measured}} the electrophoretic mobility of single, optically trapped colloidal particles, while gradually depleting the co-ions and counterions in the liquid around the particle by applying a dc voltage. This is achieved in a nonpolar liquid, where charged reverse micelles act as co-ions and counterions. By increasing the dc voltage, the mobility first increases when {{the concentrations of}} co-ions and counterions near the particle start to decrease. At sufficiently high dc voltage (around 2  V), the mobility reaches a saturation value when the co-ions and counterions are fully separated. The increase in mobility is larger when the equilibrium ionic strength is higher. The dependence of the experimental data on the equilibrium ionic strength and on the applied voltage is in good agreement with the standard theory of electrophoretic retardation, assuming that the bare particle charge remains constant. This method is useful for studying the electrophoretic retardation effect and charging mechanisms for nonpolar colloids, and it sheds light on previously unexplained particle acceleration in electronic <b>ink</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|In most {{practical}} electrophoretic measurements, the bare particle charge cannot be measured directly {{due to the}} retardation force caused by the double layer. Rather, the standard theory for electrophoresis is needed to derive the bare charge and the retardation force from the measured mobility. In this study the retardation force and the bare particle charge are measured directly on single colloidal particles, by removing the charge carriers completely or partially from the particle environment with a dc field (~ 0. 01 V/mm). This is achieved for silica particles in a non-polar liquid with charged inverse micelles acting as large (14 nm diameter) macro-ions. The mobility of a single particle, which is optically trapped in the middle between two planar electrodes, is measured while an increasing dc field is applied. At dc voltages below 1 V the bulk concentration of macro-ions is not influenced and the equilibrium mobility is obtained. At dc voltages above 1 V the macro-ions are increasingly separated and the macro-ion concentration at the particle decreases. As a result the retardation force on the particle decreases and the particle mobility increases. Above 2 V the mobility saturates at the level corresponding to the bare particle charge. The dependency of the particle mobility on the equilibrium macro-ion concentration and dc offset voltage are explained well with the theory for retardation and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory for the macro-ion concentration in the device. Besides being a direct verification {{of the theory of}} retardation, this effect can be used to probe local concentrations of charge carriers and sheds light on previously unexplained particle acceleration in electronic <b>ink</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

Central to this thesis is {{the crucial role}} of QD surface chemistry and leveraging surface modification to prepare QDs suitable for optoelectronic device applications. The work presented here explores the versatility of PbS QDs integrated into two main device architectures, where the primary role of the QD is unique in each case. In p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells, efforts to utilize PbS QDs as a hole transport material {{and the effects of}} size tuning and surface passivation with cadmium on device characteristics are discussed. A combination of QD size reduction and minimal cadmium-to-lead cation exchange is found to improve the open circuit voltage and hole extraction into the PbS QD layer. In ZnO/PbS QD heterojunction solar cells, the feasibility of preparing fully inorganic, halometallate-passivated PbS QD inks for use as the absorber layer is discussed. A modified biphasic ligand exchange strategy is presented and in order to further elucidate electronic passivation in these QD ink systems, optical properties were investigated with steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence. Significantly, PbS QDs exhibit comparable quantum yields in solution before and after ligand exchange and no significant trap state emission was observed in solution and in film. <b>Ink</b> <b>devices</b> were fabricated with one- and two-layer depositions, which significantly reduce fabrication time compared to traditional layer-by-layer deposition, and devices exhibit anomalous efficiency improvement throughout storage in air. by Whitney Rochelle Hess.

In gravure printing processes, color proofing is {{for the purpose of}} checking the color to ensure that it is as desired, before proceeding to cylinder engraving. Recently, the use of inkjet digital proofing gained popularity due to its benefits of high speed, wider color gamut, and affordable prices for a device. Proofing on the actual production stock more closely predicts print outcome. However, paper properties have significant effect on the image reproduction for proofing processes.

Biological synthesis of nanoparticles is nontoxic, eco-friendly, and a low-cost {{technology for the}} large-scale production of well-characterized nanoparticles [14]. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop biological processes for nanoparticle synthesis. Recently, many live organisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants have been used for synthesis of nanoparticles [15 - 17]. The reduction of Ag+ to Ag 0 took place by combinations of biomolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, and flavonoids [18]. Green synthesis of AgNPs has become very important in the recent years. Green AgNPs have the potential for large scale applications in the formulation of dental resin composites, bone cement [19, 20], water and air filters [21, 22], clothing and textiles, medical devices and implants [23], cosmetics [4], and packaging [24].

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} of printed electronics is the large variation in properties of components produced using printing techniques. These variations {{can be caused by}} a number of factors, including (but not limited to) ink formulation, press instability, drying conditions, device design and environmental conditions. Understanding and minimising these variations is a major step in the direction of mass produced printed electronics. In this work we present a detailed analysis of variation in resistors printed on plastic films by flatbed screen printing. The study was performed as part of the production of multiplexed smart blister packs, which inherently required minimal variation in resistor properties.

40|$|Non-aqueous {{colloidal}} dispersions {{form the}} basis of many real-world applications, including electro-rheological fluids in automotive assemblies and <b>inks</b> in printing <b>devices.</b> The dispersion of particles within the non-aqueous liquid is typically stabilised by the use of dispersants, which adsorb to the particle/liquid interface and provide steric and/or electrical forces to prevent their aggregation. Importantly, the selection of the dispersant influences not only the inter-particle forces, but also their summation across many particles then defines the bulk properties of the suspension. Tailoring of these bulk properties is important in an industrial context, as each application will demand different bulk properties. In this study, the adsorption of three dispersants onto a polyester resin surface from a simple alkane is investigated. It is shown that the competition between the rates of adsorption from the bulk relative to that of the internal relocation of the functional groups of already adsorbed material defines the total adsorbed mass and structure of the film. Dispersants that have a slow rate of adsorption and a relatively fast rate of internal reorganisation produce soft visco-elastic layers with less total adsorbed mass. Conversely, dispersants with fast rates of adsorption and relatively low rates of reorganisation produce stiffer more elastic films and a greater total adsorbed mass...|$|R
40|$|Printed {{electronics}} (PE) {{is a novel}} area {{of electronics}} manufacturing where functional inks and suitable <b>ink</b> deposition <b>devices,</b> such as inkjet or roll-to-roll equipment, are used to create electrically functional features. A lion’s share of current applications are {{in the field of}} low-cost, large-area electronics where the printing technologies have a significant advantage over the conventional methods due to faster processing speed and higher process flexibility. Since this has been seen as the holy grail of printed electronics, little research has been done on the field of small-area applications such as microelectronics packaging. However, with recent developments in high resolution printing, this application area should be within the reach of printing technologies as well. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to find out if the production methods developed for printed electronics could be used in the packaging of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Specifically, the aim is to print a high density redistribution layer (RDL) of a MEMS device package with a state of the art electrohydrodynamic (EHD) inkjet printer. By using inkjet technology instead of the current method, electrochemical plating, the costs and environmental impact of the fabrication process could be reduced significantly. This is based on the fact that inkjet printing is an additive and electrochemical plating a subtractive manufacturing method. Subtracting material leads to larger amount of wasted resources and additionally, the chemicals used to etch the copper plating are environmentally unfriendly. Additive nature of the inkjet technology increases the flexibility of production process by making the prototyping easier and enabling shorter exchange-of-die times. Applicability of EHD printing in RDL manufacturing is demonstrated by printing high density interdigital and meander structures. The secondary purpose of the thesis is to gain knowledge about operation of an EHD printer. Since this is a new development in the field of printed electronics, the existing literature is quite limited. Therefore, in addition to short literature study, statistical tools are used to look for significant parameters affecting the printing process. This analysis results in statistical models which relate the printing parameters to conductor width, thickness and sheet resistance...|$|R
40|$|Print {{quality and}} the {{printability}} of paper are very important attributes when modern printing applications are considered. In prints containing images, high print quality is a basic requirement. Tone unevenness and non uniform glossiness of printed products are the most disturbing factors influencing overall print quality. These defects are caused by non ideal interactions of paper, <b>ink</b> and printing <b>devices</b> in high speed printing processes. Since print quality is a perceptive characteristic, the measurement of unevenness according to human vision is a significant problem. In this thesis, the mottling phenomenon is studied. Mottling is a printing defect characterized by a spotty, non uniform appearance in solid printed areas. Print mottle is usually the result of uneven ink lay down or non uniform ink absorption across the paper surface, especially visible in mid tone imagery or areas of uniform color, such as solids and continuous tone screen builds. By using existing knowledge on visual perception and known methods to quantify print tone variation, a new method for print unevenness evaluation is introduced. The method is compared to previous results {{in the field and}} is supported by psychometric experiments. Pilot studies are made to estimate the effect of optical paper characteristics prior to printing, on the unevenness of the printed area after printing. Instrumental methods for print unevenness evaluation have been compared and the results of the comparison indicate that the proposed method produces better results in terms of visual evaluation correspondence. The method has been successfully implemented as ail industrial application and is proved to be a reliable substitute to visual expertise...|$|R
40|$|Stretchable Electronics is an {{emerging}} class of electronics that allow electronics to be bent, conform, ex and stretch while still retaining its full functionality. Other than bending, existing and conforming, adding stretchability to electronic systems can {{open up a}} new frontier for a myriad of applications. Especially in the medical sector, these stretchable devices can increase the scope of monitoring and ease and comfort of the patient. All kinds of wearable devices can be based on these technologies to augment our daily lives. With the kind of state of art technology available to the common man today, the bar has already been set {{for the performance of}} such devices. Hence, its imperative that these stretchable devices perform at this level and should be capable of adapting to the market to serve the mass requirement. Hence, it becomes inevitable to use metal interconnects to provide very low resistance and easy adhesion to commercial electronic components. Another aspect of such devices is an adhesion ability with which we can attach it to various kinds of surfaces. In this thesis, we propose a new multi-layered PDMS structure approach to bring stretchability in the device. For all kinds of adhesion requirements, various ratios of PDMS: Cross-linker have been used. These different ratios of PDMS: Cross-linker changes the mechanical and adhesive properties of the cured PDMS. Hence, the same material can be used as the stretchable substrate as well as to serve various adhesion requirements. A soft adhesion allows us to attach it to the human body/other surfaces. The adhesion can be tailored to be quite conformal and strong, yet its removal is quite gentle to the skin. A higher curing ratio makes the PDMS very sticky and soft. Aluminum/Copper foils can be directly stuck upon it and tracks can be then etched out to get a printed circuit. Since this adhesive layer is quite soft, it acts as a cushion and reduces the amount of stress transferred to the metal interconnects. Hence, stretchable circuits with metal interconnects can be realized. The electronic components can be then attached upon it via normal soldering techniques/using conductive <b>ink.</b> Various <b>devices</b> that can be built with the proposed techniques have been coined the term CAS (Conformal Active Sheets) to allow easy reference to such kind of devices. Since the substrate is soft, physical handling of such devices becomes an issue as one tries to transfer the circuit pattern.

A CNC machine was also designed to try various ways of direct etching of the metal foil in an accurate and repeatable fashion...|$|R
40|$|Scanning Probe Lithography (SPL) is a {{versatile}} nanofabrication platform that leverages microfluidic ?ink? delivery systems with Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) for generating surface-patterned chemical functionality on the sub- 100 nm length scale. One of the prolific SPL techniques is Dip Pen Nanolithography? (DPN?). High resolution, multiplexed registration and parallel direct-write capabilities make DPN (and other SPL techniques) a power tool for applications that are envisioned in micro/nano-electronics, molecular electronics, catalysis, cryptography (brand protection), combinatorial synthesis (nano-materials discovery and characterization), biological recognition, genomics, and proteomics. One {{of the greatest}} challenges for the successful performance of the DPN process is the delivery of multiple inks to the scanning probe tips for nano-patterning. The purpose of the present work is to fabricate a microfluidic <b>ink</b> delivery <b>device</b> (called ?Centiwell?) for DPN (and other SPL) applications. The device described in this study maximizes the number of chemical species (inks) for nanofabrication that can be patterned simultaneously by DPN to conform the industrial standards for fluid handling for biochemical assays (e. g., genomic and proteomic). Alternate applications of Centiwell are also feasible for the various envisioned applications of DPN (and other SPL techniques) that were listed above. The Centiwell consists of a two-dimensional array of 96 microwells that are bulk micromachined on a silicon substrate. A thermoelectric module is attached to {{the back side of the}} silicon substrate and is used to cool the silicon substrate to temperatures below the dew point. By reducing the temperature of the substrate to below the dew point, water droplets are condensed in the microwell array. Microbeads of a hygroscopic material (e. g., poly-ethylene glycol) are dispensed into the microwells to prevent evaporation of the condensed water. Furthermore, since poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) is water soluble, it forms a solution inside the microwells which is subsequently used as the ink for the DPN process. The delivery of the ink to the scanning probe tip is performed by dipping the tip (or multiple tips in an array) into the microwells containing the PEG solution. This thesis describes the various development steps for the Centiwell. These steps include the mask design, the bulk micromachining processes explored for the micro-fabrication of the microwell array, the thermal design calculations performed for the selection of the commercially available thermoelectric coolers, the techniques explored for the synthesis of the PEG microbeads, and the assembly of all the components for integration into a functional Centiwell.

The challenge faced is to find a suitable material system and process that is bio-sourced, degradable, and compatible with novel substrates for electronics, such as flexible paper and plastic, which are often sensitive to processing conditions. We have demonstrated significant first steps towards this goal through development of conductive, aqueous-based inks of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) for low-waste additive deposition via inkjet printing. Aqueous CNC dispersions were tuned for printability through addition of ethanol and ethylene glycol before successful patterning unto amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin-film transistors (TFTs) as proof-of-concept source and drain contacts. Bio-mass-sourced CNC nanoparticles functionalized with conductive polypyrrole polymer (CNC-PVP-PPY) through oxidative polymerization in water were found to withstand temperatures of 150 °C and displayed conductivity as high as 77. 8 S/m, making this ink a viable candidate to replace conventional polymeric conductors such as PEDOT, which are expensive to produce and require organic solvents and strict processing conditions. Two key observations were made: TFTs fabricated with CNC-PVP-PPY successfully showed switching behaviour with typical mobilities on the order of 0. 2 cm^ 2 /Vs, on-off ratio of 10 ^ 6, threshold voltage of 7. 6 V, and subthreshold swing of 264 mV/dec, however, the larger contact resistance for CNC-PVP-PPY {{had an impact on the}} extracted parameters when compared to sputtered metal and printed annealed-silver nanoparticle contact devices.

The TEM {{bright field imaging}} shows that the developed nanophosphors are crystalline in nature with particle size similar to 45 nm. The upconversion (UC) emission spectra upon excitation at 980 nm of the nanophosphors at low pump power (= 900 mW) an intense broad band ranging from 400 - 900 nm along with a UV band has been observed. The enhancement of about similar to 104 times corresponding to the green band in the Ho 3 +-Yb 3 +-Li+ codoped nanophosphors {{compared to that of}} the Ho 3 + singly doped nanophosphors has been observed. This enhancement is caused by the energy transfer from the Yb 3 + to Ho 3 + ions and modified the local crystal field developed around the rare earth ions. A higher value of the slope (i. e., n similar to 6. 38) for broad band emission within the 944 mW- 1200 mW pump power region in the Ho 3 +-Yb 3 +-Li+ codoped nanophosphors is found to be due to the involvement of the photon avalanche population process but it is not related to the black body radiation. The intense peak at similar to 564 nm and similar to 648 nm for the broad band emission is attributed to the charge transfer luminescence of codoped nanophosphors, which is related to the oxygen ion present in the MoO 4 group and Yb 3 + ion.

40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{electrical and}} mechanical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) may offer solutions to realizing high-mobility and high-bendability thin-film transistors (TFTs) for the emerging flexible electronics. This thesis aims to develop low-cost ink-jet printing techniques for high-performance TFTs based on pristine SWCNTs. The main challenge {{of this work}} is to suppress the effects of “metallic SWCNT contamination” and improve the device electrical performance. To this end, this thesis entails a balance between experiments and simulations.   First, TFTs with low-density SWCNTs in the channel region are fabricated by utilizing standard silicon technology. Their electrical performance is investigated in terms of throughput, transfer characteristics, dimensional scaling and dependence on electrode metals. The demonstrated insensitivity of electrical performance to the electrode metals lifts constrains on choosing metal inks for ink-jet printing.   Second, Monte Carlo models {{on the basis of}} percolation theory have been established, and high-efficiency algorithms have been proposed for investigations of large-size stick systems in order to facilitate studies of TFTs with channel length up to 1000 times that of the SWCNTs. The Monte Carlo simulations have led to fundamental understanding on stick percolation, including high-precision percolation threshold, universal finite-size scaling function, and dependence of critical conductivity exponents on assignment of component resistance. They have further generated understanding of practical issues regarding heterogeneous percolation systems and the doping effects in SWCNT TFTs.   Third, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to explore new device structures for performance improvement of SWCNT TFTs. In particular, a novel device structure featuring composite SWCNT networks in the channel is predicted by the simulation and subsequently confirmed experimentally by another research group. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the compatibility of previously-proposed long-strip-channel SWCNT TFTs with ink-jet printing has also been demonstrated.   Finally, relatively sophisticated ink-jet printing techniques have been developed for SWCNT TFTs with long-strip channels. This research spans from SWCNT <b>ink</b> formulation to <b>device</b> design and fabrication. SWCNT TFTs are finally ink-jet printed on both silicon wafers and flexible Kapton substrates with fairly high electrical performance. QC 2010091...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidics is {{the science}} of {{designing}} and manufacturing devices and processes for manipulation of extremely small volumes of fluid, typically micro to nanoliters. The most mature application of microfluidics technology is ink-jet printing, which uses orifices less than 100 μm in diameter to generate drops of <b>ink.</b> The complex <b>devices</b> now being developed for biological applications involving the analysis of DNA (in genetics and genomics) and proteins (in proteomics) and bio-defense typically involve aqueous solutions and channels 30 to 300 μm in diameter. Unlike microelectronics, in which the current emphasis is on reducing the size of transistors, microfluidics is focusing on making more complex systems of channels with more sophisticated fluid-handling capabilities, rather than reducing {{the size of the}} channels. Although micro- and macro-fluidic systems require similar components including pumps, valves, mixers, filters, and separators, the small size of microchannels causes their flow to behave differently. At micron scales, fluid motions are primarily dominated by surface tension and viscous forces. In the problem under consideration, the issue is one of wicking or leaking of the sample from the reaction reservoir to the waste region at elevated temperatures. A mechanism responsible for this phenomenon was thought to be the "wedge effect," which refers to the tendency of liquids to move along a sharp corner by capillary effects if the conditions are right. The analysis performed during the workshop also mainly focused on this effect. While a definitive solution to this challenging problem posed in the workshop was not identified, it was felt that using a manufacturing process that can affect the corner angles in the channels may hold the most promise, allowing the wicking mechanism to be controlled without surface treatments that insert hydrophobic stops in the channel. For instance by "rounding" the side walls to increase the corner angles from 90 toward 180 degrees, the leaking of the sample away from the reaction chamber might be delayed...|$|R
30|$|Heterogeneous {{catalysis}} plays {{a crucial}} role in many areas of chemical and energy industries. Intensive studies have focused on understanding, improving, and designing new catalysts by now. Adsorption of transition metal atoms on noble metal substrate can influence the corresponding catalytic properties, {{which is one of the}} most significant topics in catalysis [1 – 7]. In particular, the adsorption of one monolayer metal on metal surface exhibits significantly different chemical and catalytic properties within various kinds of adsorbed systems [5 – 7]. In general, the catalytic properties of the materials depend on their atomic structures, composition, and the electronic states that near the Fermi level [8 – 12]. The substrate is expected to directly and/or indirectly influence the catalytic properties of metal deposits. As we all know, Cu(111) surface is one of the most thoroughly investigated single crystal metal surfaces in the past few decades [13 – 24]. Especially, in the last decade, Cu(111) surface has been considered as the most primary substrate for the growth of high-quality and large-area graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [22 – 24]. The novel electronic properties of graphene can be well preserved on such a substrate. The adsorption of late 4 d transition metals (such as Rh [25], Pd [26 – 30], Ir [31], and Pt [29, 32, 33]) on the Cu(111) surface have been widely studied both experimentally and theoretically. However, the study of the early 3 d transition metal atoms adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface is relatively lacking [34 – 37]. Here, we focus on the early 3 d transition metal element, vanadium, due to its biochemical relevance and extensive applications in several industrial fields, such as heterogeneous catalysis, molecular networks, nanomaterials, and building of batteries [38]. The vanadium-based polyanion materials are proposed to be the candidates to replace the commercial cathode materials LiCoO 2 and LiMn 2 O 4 due to its flexible valence states [39]. Hence, studying the adsorption characteristics of vanadium atoms can facilitate its applications in reality. The possible applications of the systems studied can be expected as below. (1) The common oxidation states of the vanadium can be +[*] 2, +[*] 3, +[*] 4, and +[*] 5; therefore, it can be used as a powerful and versatile catalyst in nanomaterials industry [38]. (2) Vanadium in the metallic state can be used to catalyze the disproportionation of CO to C and CO 2 [40]. (3) It is also interesting to analyze the TM (i.e., vanadium) atoms adsorbed on surfaces with a weak concentration of free electrons due to the possible increasing of the electrical and thermal conduction [41]. Moreover, there is an extraordinary interest in the magnetic order in two-dimensional surface systems that can be used in recording media, magnetic <b>inks,</b> and spintronic <b>devices.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of magnetic nanoparticles {{has long been}} an area of active research. Magnetic nanoparticles {{can be used in a}} wide variety of applications such as magnetic <b>inks,</b> magnetic memory <b>devices,</b> drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, and pathogen detection in foods. In applications such as MRI, particle uniformity is particularly crucial, as is the magnetic response of the particles. Uniform magnetic particles with good magnetic properties are therefore required. One particularly effective technique for synthesizing nanoparticles involves biomineralization, which is a naturally occurring process that can produce highly complex nanostructures. Also, the technique involves mild conditions (ambient temperature and close to neutral pH) that make this approach suitable for a wide variety of materials. The term 'bioinspired' is important because biomineralization research is inspired by the naturally occurring process, which occurs in certain microorganisms called 'magnetotactic bacteria'. Magnetotactic bacteria use biomineralization proteins to produce magnetite crystals having very good uniformity in size and morphology. The bacteria use these magnetic particles to navigate according to external magnetic fields. Because these bacteria synthesize high quality crystals, research has focused on imitating aspects of this biomineralization in vitro. In particular, a biomineralization iron-binding protein found in a certain species of magnetotactic bacteria, magnetospirillum magneticum, AMB- 1, has been extracted and used for in vitro magnetite synthesis; Pluronic F 127 gel was used to increase the viscosity of the reaction medium to better mimic the conditions in the bacteria. It was shown that the biomineralization protein mms 6 was able to facilitate uniform magnetite synthesis. In addition, a similar biomineralization process using mms 6 and a shorter version of this protein, C 25, has been used to synthesize cobalt ferrite particles. The overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of magnetite particle synthesis in the presence of the biomineralization proteins, mms 6 and C 25. Previous work has hypothesized that the mms 6 protein helps to template magnetite and cobalt ferrite particle synthesis and that the C 25 protein templates cobalt ferrite formation. However, the effect of parameters such as the protein concentration on the particle formation is still unknown. It is expected that the protein concentration significantly affects the nucleation and growth of magnetite. Since the protein provides iron-binding sites, it is expected that magnetite crystals would nucleate at those sites. In addition, in the previous work, the reaction medium after completion of the reaction was in the solution phase, and magnetic particles had a tendency to fall to the bottom of the medium and aggregate. The research presented in this thesis involves solid Pluronic gel phase reactions, which can be studied readily using small-angle x-ray scattering, which is not possible for the solution phase experiments. In addition, the concentration effect of both of the proteins on magnetite crystal formation was studied...|$|R
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) and sensing are two key technologies {{enabling the}} Internet of Things (IoT). Development of RFID tags augmented with sensing capabilities (RFID sensor tags) {{would allow a}} variety of new applications, leading to a new paradigm of the IoT. Chipless RFID sensor technology offers a low-cost solution by eliminating the need of an integrated circuit (IC) chip, and is hence highly desired for many applications. On the other hand, printing technologies have revolutionized the world of electronics, enabling cost-effective manufacturing of large-area and flexible electronics. By means of printing technologies, chipless RFID sensor tags could be made flexible and lightweight at a very low cost, lending themselves to the realization of ubiquitous intelligence in the IoT era. This thesis investigated three construction methods of printable chipless RFID humidity sensor tags, with focus on the incorporation of the sensing function. In the first method, wireless sensing based on backscatter modulation was separately realized by loading an antenna with a humidity-sensing resistor. An RFID sensor tag could then be constructed by combining the wireless sensor with a chipless RFID tag. In the second method, a chipless RFID sensor tag was built up by introducing a delay line between the antenna and the resistor. Based on time-domain reflectometry (TDR), the tag encoded ID in the delay time between its structural-mode and antenna-mode scattering pulse, and performed the sensing function by modulating the amplitude of the antenna-mode pulse. In both of the above methods, a resistive-type humidity-sensing material was required. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) presented themselves as promising candidate due to their outstanding electrical, structural and mechanical properties. MWCNTs functionalized (f-MWCNTs) by acid treatment demonstrated high sensitivity and fast response to relative humidity (RH), owing to the presence of carboxylic acid groups. The f-MWCNTs also exhibited superior mechanical flexibility, as their resistance and sensitivity remained almost stable under either tensile or compressive stress. Moreover, an inkjet printing process was developed for the f-MWCNTs starting from <b>ink</b> formulation to <b>device</b> fabrication. By applying the f-MWCNTs, a flexible humidity sensor based on backscatter modulation was thereby presented. The operating frequency range of the sensor was significantly enhanced by adjusting the parasitic capacitance in the f-MWCNTs resistor. A fully-printed time-coded chipless RFID humidity sensor tag was also demonstrated. In addition, a multi-parameter sensor based on TDR was proposed. The sensor concept was verified by theoretical analysis and circuit simulation. In the third method, frequency-spectrum signature was utilized considering its advantages such as coding capacity, miniaturization, and immunity to noise. As signal collision problem is inherently challenging in chipless RFID sensor systems, short-range identification and sensing applications are believed to embody the core values of the chipless RFID sensor technology. Therefore a chipless RFID humidity sensor tag based on near-field inductive coupling was proposed. The tag was composed of two planar inductor-capacitor (LC) resonators, one for identification, and the other one for sensing. Moreover, paper was proposed to serve as humidity-sensing substrate for the sensor resonator on accounts of its porous and absorptive features. Both inkjet paper and ordinary packaging paper were studied. A commercial UV-coated packaging paper was proven to be a viable and more robust alternative to expensive inkjet paper as substrate for inkjet-printed metal conductors. The LC resonators printed on paper substrates showed excellent sensitivity and reasonable response time to humidity in terms of resonant frequency. Particularly, the resonator printed on the UV-coated packaging paper exhibited the largest sensitivity from 20 % to 70 % RH, demonstrating the possibilities of directly printing the sensor tag on traditional packages to realize intelligent packaging at an ultra-low cost.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was the development of a hybrid manufacturing system that integrates stereolithography (SL) and direct print (DP) technologies to fabricate three dimensional (3 D) structural electronic devices within a single set-up. The capabilities of this new additive manufacturing (AM) technology was explored in the context of fabricating and prototyping complex electronic devices in which conformal shape, rugged and light-weight integration, and a natural resistance to reverse engineering are all of paramount importance. Consequently, electronic components can be tightly integrated together in a rugged, light-weight 3 D structure of arbitrary form. ^ As a result, this dissertation broadly demonstrated what can be achieved by integrating multiple AM technologies together for fabricating unique devices. Specifically, a hybrid SL/DP machine that can produce 3 D monolithic structures with embedded electronics and printed interconnects is demonstrated. Advancements {{in the development of a}} hybrid manufacturing system that integrates SL and DP technologies to fabricate 3 D structural electronic circuits are described. These advancement lead to the development of the state-of-the-art hybrid SL/DP system which included a 3 D Systems SL 250 / 50 machine and an nScrypt micro-dispensing pump integrated within the SL machine through orthogonally-aligned linear translation stages for accurate 3 D material dispensing. The 3 D micro-dispensing DP system provided control over conductive trace deposition and combined with the manufacturing flexibility of the SL machine enabled the fabrication of monolithic 3 D electronic structures. A corresponding manufacturing process was also developed using this system to fabricate 3 D monolithic structures with embedded electronic circuits without removal from the hybrid SL/DP machine during the process. The process required multiple starts and stops of the SL process, removal of uncured resin from the SL substrate, insertion of active and passive electronic components, DP, in situ UV laser curing of the conductive traces. ^ As a key enabler of 3 D structural electronic device fabrication, in situ UV laser ink curing of particulate silver based conductive inks was investigated further. Various laser curing parameters, including laser power, scan speed and time of laser incidence, laser scanning location, and laser wavelength were investigated through a series of experiments. The trace resistances for each experiment were compared to determine the laser conditions that resulted in the most effective ink curing. As part of this research, the laser energy supplied by the 355 nm SL laser was related to an effective steady-state curing temperature as determined by a commercially available thermistor. Scanning the laser on the edge of the ink channel gave the best ink curing, measured in terms of lowest trace resistance, but resulted in charring of the SL substrate. Alternatively, the laser condition at which the substrate did not char provided relatively less effective ink curing. Scanning the laser directly on the ink resulted in some discoloration, although SEM images revealed no structural changes. The effect of laser wavelength on trace resistance during repetitive laser curing was determined. Laser curing at 325 nm wavelength was found to be more effective than at 355 nm wavelength due to reduced reflectance of the silver particles at 325 nm wavelength. This research determined the experimental conditions for successful in situ UV laser curing of particulate silver-based inks in the context of fabricating 3 D structural electronic devices using a hybrid SL/DP machine and advanced the capabilities of AM technologies. Opportunities exist for expanding the laser parameters to generalize the laser curing process for a variety of conductive <b>inks.</b> The electronic <b>devices</b> demonstrated as part of this research were simple 555 timer circuits designed and fabricated in 2 D (single layer of routing) and 3 D (multiple layers of routing and component placement). ^ In summary, a new methodology is presented for manufacturing non-traditional electronic systems in arbitrary form, while achieving miniaturization and enabling rugged structure and advanced applications are demonstrated using a semi-automated approach to SL/DP integration. Although the process does not require removal of the structure from the machine during fabrication, many of the current sub-processes are manual. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
