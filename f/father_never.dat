5|$|Albert Victor's brother, Prince George, Duke of York, now {{second in}} line to the throne, evidently became close to May during their shared period of mourning, and Queen Victoria still favoured May as a {{suitable}} candidate to marry a future king. In May 1893, George proposed, and May accepted. They were soon deeply in love, and their marriage was a success. George wrote to May every day they were apart and, unlike his <b>father,</b> <b>never</b> took a mistress.|$|E
5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her <b>father</b> <b>never</b> could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E

Her many uncles included Byzantine emperors John VIII Palaiologos and Constantine XI Palaiologos. When she was five years old, her mother died.

25|$|Hokusai's date {{of birth}} is unclear, but is often stated as the 23rd day of the 9th month of the 10th year of the Hōreki era (in the old calendar, or October 31, 1760) to an artisan family, in the Katsushika {{district}} of Edo, Japan. His childhood name was Tokitarō. It is believed his father was the mirror-maker Nakajima Ise, who produced mirrors for the shogun. His <b>father</b> <b>never</b> made Hokusai an heir, so {{it is possible that}} his mother was a concubine. Hokusai began painting around the age of six, perhaps learning from his father, whose work on mirrors included painting of designs around mirrors.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his <b>father</b> <b>never</b> introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} Test of the series, Broad reached his maiden Test century at Lord's. Coming to the crease at 102–7, he scored 169 {{and put on}} a 332-run {{partnership}} with fellow centurion Jonathan Trott; a world record for an eight-wicket partnership. It was his first century in all forms of cricket since an under-19's match for Leicestershire and saw his name go on the Lord's batting honours board, a feat that his <b>father</b> <b>never</b> achieved. He also surpassed his father's Test best of 162, and they became the first father and son both to score centuries for England in Test match cricket. His efforts both with the bat and with the ball (he also took three wickets during the match and made a direct-hit run out) earned him the man of the match award.|$|E

25|$|Both of Bill's parents {{abandoned}} him {{soon after he}} and his sister were born—his <b>father</b> <b>never</b> returned from a purported business trip, and his mother left Vermont to study osteopathic medicine. Bill and his sister were raised by their maternal grandparents, Fayette and Ella Griffith. As a teen, Bill showed little interest in his academic studies and was rebellious. During a summer break in high school, he spent months designing and carving a boomerang to throw at birds, raccoons, and other local wildlife. After many difficult years during his early-mid teens, Bill became the captain of his high school's football team, and the principal violinist in its orchestra. Bill also dealt with a serious bout of depression {{at the age of}} seventeen, following the death of his first love, Bertha Bamford. Bertha died of complications from surgery.|$|E
25|$|In 219 BC, Hannibal {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Saguntum, which stood under the special protection of Rome. According to Roman tradition, Hannibal {{had been made to}} swear by his <b>father</b> <b>never</b> to be a friend of Rome, and he certainly did not take a conciliatory attitude when the Romans berated him for crossing the river Iberus (Ebro), which Carthage was bound by treaty not to cross. Hannibal did not cross the Ebro River (Saguntum was near modern Valencia – well south of the river) in arms, and the Saguntines provoked his attack by attacking their neighboring tribes who were Carthaginian protectorates and by massacring pro-Punic factions in their city. Rome had no legal protection pact with any tribe south of the Ebro River. Nonetheless, they asked Carthage to hand Hannibal over, and when the Carthaginian oligarchy refused, Rome declared war on Carthage.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance {{for any kind}} of noise, refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. Apart from one slightly open window Genie did not have any access to auditory stimuli outside the house, and the window was set well away from the street and other houses, so what little she heard from outside almost exclusively consisted of environmental sounds. Her <b>father</b> <b>never</b> allowed other people in the house, forbade any interaction between Genie and her mother, and forced his son to assist with carrying out his abuse while otherwise preventing him from being in Genie's presence. He did not permit them to speak, and especially not to or around Genie, so any conversations they had were out of Genie's earshot, keeping her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.|$|E

25|$|Another {{foil for}} Ralph is Alice's mother, who is even sharper-tongued than her daughter. She despises Ralph {{as a bad}} provider. Alice's father is {{occasionally}} mentioned but never seen. Alice's sister, Agnes, appeared in one episode (Ralph jeopardizes his newlywed sister-in-law's marriage after giving some bad advice to the groom, but all works out in the end). Ralph and Alice lived with her mother for six years after getting married before they got their own apartment. Ralph's mother rarely is mentioned, although she does appear in one episode. Ralph's father is only mentioned in one episode ("Young Man with a Horn") as having given Ralph a cornet he learned to play as a boy, and insists on keeping when Alice suggests it be thrown away. In a 1967 revival, Ralph refers to Alice (played by Sheila MacRae 1966–70 and once more in 1973) as being one of 12 children with her <b>father</b> <b>never</b> working.|$|E
25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my <b>father</b> <b>never</b> beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his drawing}} pupils was Margaret Lindsay, eldest {{daughter}} of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick and Amelia Murray (granddaughter to David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont and sister to the naval officer John Lindsay). He later eloped {{with her and}} on 1 March 1752 they married in the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh; her <b>father</b> <b>never</b> forgave her for marrying an artist. Ramsay already had to maintain a daughter from his previous marriage and his two surviving sisters, but told Sir Alexander that he could provide Margaret with an annual income of £100. He said it would increase ‘as my affairs increase, and I thank God, {{they are in a}} way of increasing’ and that his only motive for the marriage was ‘my love for your Daughter, who, I am sensible, is entitled to much more than ever I shall have to bestow upon her’. Three children survived from their long and happy marriage, Amelia (1755–1813), Charlotte (1758–1818?), and John (1768–1845).|$|E
