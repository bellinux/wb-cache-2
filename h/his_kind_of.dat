25|$|While {{directing}} The Outlaw, Hughes became {{fixated on}} a small flaw in one of Jane Russell's blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. Richard Fleischer, who directed <b>His</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Woman with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty {{of dealing with the}} tycoon. In his book, Just Tell Me When to Cry, Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film would ever be completed.|$|E

500|$|In Albert Camus's The Rebel (1951), Saint-Just is {{discussed}} {{extensively in the}} context of an analysis of rebellion and man's progression towards enlightenment and freedom. Camus identifies Saint-Just's successful argument for the execution of Louis XVI as the moment of death for monarchical divine right, a Nietzschean Twilight of the Idols. Saint-Just's dedication to [...] "the sovereignty of the people and the sacred power of laws" [...] is described as [...] "a source of absolutism" [...] and indeed [...] "the new God". <b>His</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "deification of the political" [...] is examined as the source of the creeping totalitarianism which grew so powerfully in Camus' own lifetime.|$|E

500|$|In November 1948, {{the family}} moved to Memphis, Tennessee. After {{residing}} for nearly a year in rooming houses, they were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Lauderdale Courts. Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School, Presley received only a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher informed him {{that he did not have}} an aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, [...] "Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me", in an effort to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that the teacher [...] "agreed that Elvis was right when he said that she didn't appreciate <b>his</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> singing." [...] He was usually too shy to perform openly, and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a [...] "mama's boy". In 1950, he regularly began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Jesse Lee Denson, a neighbor two-and-a-half years his senior. They and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the Courts. That September, he began ushering at Loew's State Theater. Other jobs followed, including Precision Tool, Loew's again, and MARL Metal Products.|$|E

500|$|Film noir {{has been}} parodied many times, in many manners. In 1945, Deanna Durbin was the singing {{lead in the}} comedic noir Lady on a Train, which makes fun of Woolrich-brand wistful miserablism. Bob Hope inaugurated the private-eye noir parody with My Favorite Brunette (1947), playing a baby-photographer who is mistaken for an ironfisted detective. In 1947 as well, The Bowery Boys {{appeared}} in Hard Boiled Mahoney, which had a similar mistaken-identity plot; they spoofed the genre once more in Private Eyes (1953). Two RKO productions starring Robert Mitchum take film noir over the border into self-parody: The Big Steal (1949), directed by Don Siegel, and <b>His</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Woman (1951). The [...] "Girl Hunt" [...] ballet in Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon (1953) is a ten-minute distillation of—and play on—noir in dance. Alphaville, mentioned earlier, is a deadpan parody of noir, inserting ridiculous names, situations and pseudo femme-fatales who identify themselves as [...] "Seductress, Third Class". The Cheap Detective (1978), starring Peter Falk, is a broad spoof of several films, including the Bogart classics The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. Carl Reiner's black-and-white Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982) appropriates clips of classic noirs for a farcical pastiche, while his Fatal Instinct (1993) sends up noirs both classic (Double Indemnity) and neo (Basic Instinct). Robert Zemeckis's Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) develops a noir plot set in 1940s L.A. around a host of cartoon characters.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the difficulties, Shankly felt {{immediately}} at home in his new club and he believed that he shared an immediate bond with the supporters, the Liverpool history site saying they [...] "were <b>his</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> people". He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty {{to each other and}} to the club. Paisley's influence at Liverpool was [...] "crucial" [...] for, as Kelly puts it, Shankly was [...] "the great motivating force behind Liverpool, but it was Paisley who was the tactician". One aspect of the quartet's legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the [...] "Boot Room", which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots. Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff, the playing staff were not so impressive – indeed, Shankly said of the latter: [...] "After only one match I knew that the team as a whole was not good enough. I made up my mind that we needed strengthening through the middle, a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals, and somebody up front to create goals and score them". To deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad, 24 players were placed on the transfer list and all [...] had left the club within one year.|$|E
500|$|The same year, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network, a drama {{based on}} the founders of Facebook. On his character, Garfield remarked that [...] "No one knows who Eduardo Saverin is, and I don't either. Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to my approach because you feel {{a greater sense of}} responsibility". Initially, the film's director, David Fincher, had met Garfield under the auspices of him playing Mark Zuckerberg, having been referred to him by Mark Romanek. However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's [...] "incredible emotional access to <b>his</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> core humanity" [...] better tailored for the role of Saverin. Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role. Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that [...] "everyone knows he's one of the very best things about the Social Network". Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with [...] "great subtlety and rueful charm". Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered [...] "a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie", and proclaimed: [...] "Keep your eyes on Garfield — he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one." [...] He received similar plaudits of the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and The New Yorker.|$|E

2500|$|Burr {{appeared}} {{in more than}} 50 feature films between 1946 and 1957, creating an array of villains that established him as an icon of film noir. Film historian Alain Silver concluded that Burr's most significant work in the genre is in these ten films: Desperate (1947), Sleep, My Love (1948), Raw Deal (1948), Pitfall (1948), Abandoned (1949), Red Light (1950), M (1951), <b>His</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Woman (1951), The Blue Gardenia (1953) and Crime of Passion (1957). Silver described Burr's private detective in Pitfall as [...] "both reprehensible and pathetic", a characterization also cited by film historian Richard Schickel as a prototype of film noir, {{in contrast with the}} appealing television characters for which Burr later became famous.|$|E
2500|$|Rakovsky {{subsequently}} rejoined {{his wife}} in Saint Petersburg, where he hoped {{to settle down and}} engage in revolutionary activities (he was probably expelled after an initial attempt to enter the country, but was allowed to return). An adversary of Peter Berngardovich Struve after the latter moved towards market liberalism, he became acquainted with, among others, Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, while authoring articles for Nashe Slovo and helping distribute Iskra. His close relationship with Plekhanov led Rakovsky to a position between the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, one he kept from 1903 to 1917; the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was initially hostile to Rakovsky, and at one point wrote to Karl Radek that [...] "we [...] {{do not have the same}} road as <b>his</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> people".|$|E
