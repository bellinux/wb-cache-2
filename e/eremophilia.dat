40|$|Plants {{belonging}} to the Eremophila genus {{are an integral part}} of the traditional medicine of indigenous Australian populations. Extracts of a number of <b>Eremophilia</b> species have demonstrated the presence of bioactivity, including inhibitory effects against Gram positive bacteria. The aim of the present study was to determine the activity of solvent and aqueous extracts of <b>Eremophilia</b> longifolia stem and leaves against Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. A stem ethanol extract (SEE) demonstrated growth inhibition of the two cariogenic bacteria with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0. 5 % (w/v). Time-kill experiments indicated bactericidal activity by SEE within a 2 h period. Furthermore, this study assessed the anticariogenic activity of SEE in terms of its effect on glycolytic pH drop, viability of cells within an artificial biofilm and cell attachment to a membrane. In all experiments, SEE demonstrated significant anticariogenic activity compared with controls (p< 0. 05, Students t-test). SEE also compared favourably with commercial oral healthcare products. Preliminary phytochemical investigations suggested that the active components within SEE were phenolic compounds but unlikely to be flavonoids. Our study advocates SEE as a worthy candidate for further research into alternative chemotherapeutic approaches to dental caries...|$|E
40|$|Winter canola (Brassica napus L.) is {{considered}} the most promising domestically-produced oilseed feed-stock for biodiesel production and for diversifying wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) -based cropping systems in the Inland Pacific Northwest, USA. Winter canola field experiments conducted in east-central Washington were completely destroyed, and commercial fields were damaged or destroyed, over several years by large flocks of horned larks (<b>Eremophilia</b> alperestis L.) that ate the cotyledon leaves of pre-emerged and newly-emerged seedlings. Numerous control methods were attempted in field experiments, including laying bird netting over the entire experiment, placement of a life-size predator decoy in a field experiment, loud propane-powered cannon blasts, and mixing garlic with canola seed before planting followed by spraying garlic water on the soil surface. None of the attempted control methods were successful. This is the first report {{in the literature of}} horned lark damage to pre-emerged and newly-emerged canola seedlings. We discuss questions relevant to our novel account as well as potential abatement using falcons and non-toxic chemical repellents for the protection of industrial canola crops associated with horned lark depredation...|$|E
40|$|Endophytes are {{microorganisms}} {{that live}} within plant tissues that are {{potential sources of}} novel bioactive compounds, including enzymes. We have identified endophytes of the Australian native plant <b>Eremophilia</b> longifolia which were screened {{for the production of}} industrially useful enzymes. Seventeen fungal endophytes were isolated from the leaves of E. longifolia and enzyme production was investigated within a range of pH (3. 5, 5. 5, 7 and 9) and temperatures (9, 25, 37 and 50 °C). Amylase was the most common enzyme encountered with numerous isolates showing production throughout the temperature and pH ranges. Protease production was also seen over the conditions tested but was more dominant at lower pH and temperature. Activity was not observed for other enzymes including ligninase, xylanase and cellobiohydrolase. Enzymes from isolates of Preussia minima, Alternaria sp. and an unclassified fungus, which showed highest activity in screening assays, were investigated further. Enzyme production was verified by zymography and the amylase activity of P. minima was found to be significantly greater than that of Aspergillus oryzae particularly in alkaline conditions and low temperature which are desirable properties for the detergent industry. This work shows that enzymes with potential use in industry can be readily identified in fungal endophytes...|$|E
40|$|Endophytes are {{recognised}} {{as potential}} sources of novel secondary metabolites, including enzymes and drugs, with applications in medicine, agriculture and industry. There is a growing need for new enzymes, including proteases, for use in industry that can function {{under a variety of}} conditions. In this study, three fungal endophytes (Alternaria alternata, Phoma herbarum and an unclassified fungus), were isolated from the Australian native plant, <b>Eremophilia</b> longifolia, and assessed for production of proteases. The lyophilised growth media obtained after fungal fermentation were analysed for protease production using enzyme activity assays. Protease production was optimised by assessing the effects of temperature, pH, carbon source and nitrogen source on activity. A. alternata showed the greatest protease activity {{in a wide range of}} pH (3 – 9). The broadest activity between 9 and 50 C was observed at pH 7, suggesting a neutral protease. Overall, the optimum conditions were 37 C and pH 7 with a maximum specific activity value of 69. 86 BAEE units/mg. The characteristics demonstrated by this fungal endophyte showed that it is a potential source of an enzyme with particular application in the dairy industry. However, further studies of the tolerance to higher temperatures and pH will indicate whether the enzyme is suitable to such applications...|$|E
40|$|In 1963 a joint University of Alaska-Smithsonian Institution crew {{worked at}} [...] five {{locations}} in the Baird and Schwatka mountains in northwestern Alaska, conducting an ecological reconnaissance and faunal and floral inventory. Standard methods of observation and collection were used. Camps in the Kobuk drainage were located in the Redstone River valley and at Walker Lake, both on {{the margin of the}} taiga. The Noatak valley was represented by one camp each in the lower, middle, and upper reaches of the river, all in tundra. A summary of pre- 1963 ornithological work in the region is presented. Significant records of distribution and/or breeding were obtained for the following birds: Podiceps grisegena, [...] Anas platyrhynchos, Aythya valisineria, Histrionicus histrionicus, Melanitta perspicillata, Mergus merganser, Aphrizia virgata, Bartramia longicauda, Actitis macularia, Tringa flavipes, Phalaropus fuficarius, Lobipes lobatus, Larus hyperboreus,Xema sabini, Sayornis saya, Nuttalornis borealis, <b>Eremophilia</b> alpestris, Tachycineta thalassina, Riparia riparia, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, Phylloscopus borealis, Dendroica petechia, Leucosticte tephrocotis, Zonotrichia atricapilla, Calcarius pictus; and the mammal, Spermophilus undulatus. Good series of Cletihrionomys rutilius (350) and Microtus miurus (147) have been deposited in the University of Alaska Museum. Severe doubt has been raised [...] regarding the validity of the standard three-night trap grid for population estimation under wet conditions in arctic areas...|$|E
40|$|Background Environmental {{screening}} {{programs are}} used to find new enzymes that may be utilized in large-scale industrial processes. Among microbial sources of new enzymes, the rationale for screening fungal endophytes as a potential source of such enzymes relates to the hypothesised mutualistic relationship between the endophyte and its host plant. There {{is a need for}} new microbial amylases that are active at low temperature and alkaline conditions as these would find industrial applications as detergents. Results An alpha-amylase produced by Preussia minima, isolated from the Australian native plant, <b>Eremophilia</b> longifolia, was purified to homogeneity through fractional acetone precipitation and Sephadex G- 200 gel filtration, followed by DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. The purified alpha-amylase showed a molecular mass of 70 kDa which was confirmed by zymography. Temperature and pH optima were 25 [degree sign]C and pH 9, respectively. The enzyme was activated and stabilized mainly by the metal ions manganese and calcium. Enzyme activity was also studied using different carbon and nitrogen sources. It was observed that enzyme activity was highest (138 U/mg) with starch as the carbon source and L-asparagine as the nitrogen source. Bioreactor studies showed that enzyme activity was comparable to that obtained in shaker cultures, which encourages scale-up fermentation for enzyme production. Following in-gel digestion of the purified protein by trypsin, a 9 -mer peptide was sequenced and analysed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme presented similarity to alpha-amylase from Magnaporthe oryzae. Conclusions The findings of the present study indicate that the purified alpha-amylase exhibits a number of promising properties that make it a strong candidate for application in the detergent industry. To our knowledge, this is the first amylase isolated from a Preussia minima strain of endophytic origin...|$|E
