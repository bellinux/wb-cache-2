40|$|PurposeSerum {{alkaline}} phosphatase (ALP) level {{is the most}} valid marker of bone formation. Precocious puberty (PP) in girls is characterized by early growth acceleration. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether serum ALP levels differ between <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PP and those with normal puberty, and whether ALP level varies with age or Tanner stage. MethodsThis retrospective study included <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PP (n= 61) and normal puberty (n= 71) who visited the outpatient clinic at Department of Pediatrics, Chungnam National University Hospital from March 2010 to August 2011. We obtained age, height, parental height, weight, bone age, Tanner stage, and concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone, estradiol, ALP, and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) from the participants' medical records. ResultsAge and predicted adult height were significantly lower in <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PP than in those with normal puberty. The height standard deviation score (SDS), weight SDS, body mass index, midparental height, bone age, and IGF- 1 level were higher in <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PP than in those with normal puberty. ALP level was significantly higher in 5 - to 8 -year-old <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PP than in age-matched <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> normal puberty. The mean ALP levels were higher in <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PP than bone age-matched <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> normal puberty (P= 0. 0003) ConclusionSerum ALP level showed the significance differences between <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PP and those with normal puberty. The reasons for and the mechanisms underlying this elevation in serum ALP level in <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PP should be investigated further...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{physical}} fitness of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> Turner syndrome (TS) and to determine the relative contributions of age, body height, and body mass to performance in fitness tests. <b>Girls</b> <b>with</b> TS aged 10 - 18 years (n = 184), and age- and stature-matched healthy controls (n = 280) were studied with the use of the EUROFIT test battery. <b>Girls</b> <b>with</b> TS were significantly inferior to the control group in maintaining balance, standing broad jump, sit-ups, shuttle run, and endurance shuttle run (p <. 001). No significant differences were found for plate tapping, but <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> TS were superior to their healthy mates (p <. 001) in handgrip, sit-and-reach, and bent-arm hang. Unlike controls, body height in <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> TS had significant effects on handgrip strength (positive) and on plate tapping speed (negative), other contributions being relatively similar in both groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Concerns about {{psychological}} distress {{are often used}} to justify treatment of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> precocious puberty, {{but there is little}} evidence to support these concerns. The extent to which psychological problems are associated with central precocious puberty (CPP) compared with other forms of early puberty in girls has likewise not been established. METHODS: <b>Girls</b> presenting <b>with</b> untreated CPP, premature adrenarche (PA) or early normal puberty (ENP) were recruited from our pediatric endocrine clinic along with their mothers. Child psychological adjustment was assessed by child self-report and parent report. Parent self-reported personality, anxiety, and depression were also assessed. Differences between groups were explored using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's T 3 test. RESULTS: Sixty-two subjects (aged 7. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 4 years, range 4. 8 - 10. 5) were enrolled, of whom 19 had CPP, 22 had PA, and 21 had ENP. <b>Girls</b> <b>with</b> ENP were significantly older (8. 9 [*]±[*]. 9 years) than <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> CPP (6. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 1 years, p[*]<[*]. 001) and PA (6. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 0 years, p[*]<[*]. 001). <b>Girls</b> <b>with</b> PA had significantly higher BMI z-scores (1. 7 [*]±[*]. 8) than <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> CPP (1. 1 [*]±[*]. 6, p[*]=[*]. 01) and ENP (1. 2 [*]±[*]. 6, p[*]=[*]. 04). More <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PA and ENP were from racial minorities (47 % and 50 % respectively) than <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> CPP (32 %). No group differences were found for any child measure of psychological adjustment. However, mothers of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PA scored significantly higher than mothers of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> ENP on one measure of depression (p[*]=[*]. 04) and stress (p[*]=[*]. 01). CONCLUSIONS: While mothers of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> PA report increased {{psychological distress}} on some measures, no differences in psychological adjustment were found at baseline amongst the girls themselves. Whether these results will change as puberty progresses in the PA and ENP groups or with treatment of CPP is unknown. Long-term prospective studies are needed in order to further investigate psychological correlates of early puberty in girls...|$|R

Rett syndrome is a severe neurological disorder leading to multiple disabilities and severely impaired communication skills. The {{aim of the}} thesis is to describe the communication skills of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> Rett Syndrome, the role of parents {{in the development of}} communication and the possibilities for communication intervention. This issue is presented on case histories of three <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> Rett Syndrome of various ages, acquired from semi-structured interviews with parents or caregivers of girls and participative observation of girls' behaviors and their interaction with the environment. The research results in the description of motor and communication skills and methods used to develop communication <b>with</b> the three <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> Rett Syndrome. Research shows that even though the communication capabilities of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> Rett Syndrome are very individual, parents {{are looking for ways to}} develop the communication skills of their daughters and they expect the professional advice from special educators, which they, in their opinion gets poorly.

40|$|UNLABELLED: Central {{precocious}} puberty {{may result from}} organic brain lesions, but is most frequently of idiopathic origin. Clinical or biochemical factors which could predict a pathological brain MRI in <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> CPP have been searched for. With the recent decline in age at pubertal onset among US and European girls, {{it has been suggested}} that only <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> CPP below 6 years of age should have brain MRI performed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of brain MRI in <b>girls</b> referred <b>with</b> early signs of puberty in relation to age at presentation as well as clinical and biochemical parameters. METHOD: A single-center study of 229 consecutive <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> early or {{precocious puberty}} who had brain imaging performed. We evaluated medical history, clinical and biochemical factors, and four groups were defined based on the outcome of their MRI. RESULTS: Thirteen out of 208 (6. 3 %) <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> precocious puberty, but no other sign of CNS symptoms, had a pathological brain MRI. Importantly, all 13 girls were above 6 years of age, and 6 girls were even 8 - 9 years old. Twenty girls (9. 6 %) had incidental findings on brain MRI. Furthermore, 21 girls had known CNS pathology at time of evaluation. Basal LH was significantly higher in <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> newly diagnosed CNS pathology compared to <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> a non-pathological MRI (p =  0. 025); no cut of value was found as values overlapped. CONCLUSION: A high frequency of 6 - 8 year old <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> precocious puberty in our study had a pathological brain MRI, which could not be predicted from any clinical nor biochemical parameters. Thus, we believe that <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> precocious pubertal development of central origin before 8 years of age should continue to be examined by a brain MRI...|$|R

40|$|Girls {{experience}} {{a significant number}} of problems related to AD/HD, which are severe enough to affect their academic and social functioning across the lifespan. Unfortunately, our current diagnostic procedures identify few <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> AD/HD, suggesting they are not receiving adequate services. This study used a new rating scale (<b>Girls</b> <b>with</b> AD/HD are Different, GAAD) and an established one (ACTeRS) to assess 262 girls {{from the perspective of the}} girls, their parents, and their teachers. The findings indicated that most factors of the GAAD successfully discriminated between <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> and without AD/HD. From parent and self-ratings, <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> AD/HD were characterized as verbally impulsive, easily bored, and having difficulty waiting. These findings suggested that girls showed hyperactivity verbally, whereas boys are reported to express it motorically. Girls also behave differently from boys with AD/HD by engaging in small motor activities (e. g., doodling, hair twirling) and seek a fast pace in conversations and work, trip and bump into things, and have poor handwriting. New information was that <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> AD/HD broke social rules, stirred up trouble, and associated with friends whom their parents do not approve, and emotionally they lacked regulation, citing greater moodiness, anger, and stubbornness than other girls. Parents identified more girls than did teachers and when teachers did identify <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> AD/HD, there was evidence that they failed to refer these girls for services. The importance of successful social relationships to the self-concepts of these girls was in evidence on the GAAD scale and the ACTeRS. The self-concept of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> AD/HD was significantly correlated with self-ratings of attention, inappropriate behavior, social skills, and social involvement, but not with self-ratings of impulsivity and hyperactivity—in contrast to the literature on boys. On the positive side, <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> AD/HD were actively involved with friends, organizations, and activities, which may serve as a protective factor. The implications of these findings for improving our identification of <b>girls</b> <b>with</b> AD/HD and of their long-term outcome were discussed. ...|$|R
