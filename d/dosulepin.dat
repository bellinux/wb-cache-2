25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (<b>dosulepin),</b> and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, <b>dosulepin)</b> and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Amitriptyline is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include nortriptyline (noramitriptyline, N-desmethylamitriptyline), protriptyline, and butriptyline. Amitriptyline is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nortriptyline being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include imipramine, clomipramine, <b>dosulepin</b> (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine.

The chemical name of clomipramine is 3-(3-chloro-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoazepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H23ClN2 with a molecular weight of 314.857g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 303-49-1 and of the hydrochloride is 17321-77-6.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure.

The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-49-7, of the hydrochloride is 113-52-0, and of the embonate is 10075-24-8.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzoxepin, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. It is the only TCA with a dibenzoxepin ring system to have been marketed. Doxepin is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nordoxepin being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, <b>dosulepin</b> (dothiepin), and trimipramine. Doxepin {{is a mixture of}} (E) and (Z) stereoisomers (the latter being known as cidoxepin or cis-doxepin) and is used commercially in a ratio of approximately 85:15.

The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 1668-19-5 and of the hydrochloride is 1229-29-4.|$|E
25|$|Clomipramine is {{a strong}} SRI. Its {{affinity}} for the SERT was reported in one study using human tissues to be 0.14nM, which is considerably {{higher than that of}} other TCAs. For example, the TCAs with the next highest affinities for the SERT in the study were imipramine, amitriptyline, and <b>dosulepin</b> (dothiepin), with Ki values of 1.4nM, 4.3nM, and 8.3nM, respectively. In addition, clomipramine has a terminal half-life that is around twice as long as that of amitriptyline and imipramine. In spite of these differences however, clomipramine is used clinically at the same usual dosages as other serotonergic TCAs (100–200mg/day). It achieves typical circulating concentrations that are similar in range to those of other TCAs but with an upper limit that is around twice that of amitriptyline and imipramine. For these reasons, clomipramine is the most potent SRI among the TCAs and is far stronger as an SRI than other TCAs at typical clinical dosages. In addition, clomipramine is similarly potent or even more potent as an SRI than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
2500|$|A {{very small}} number of cases {{involving}} non-medical use of antidepressants have been reported over the past 30 years. According to the US government classification of psychiatric medications, TCAs are [...] "non-abusable" [...] and generally have low abuse potential. Nonetheless due to their atypical MOA, amineptine and tianeptine (dopamine reuptake inhibition and μ-opioid receptor agonism, respectively) are the two TCAs with the highest addiction and abuse potential. Several cases of the misuse of amitriptyline alone or together with methadone or in other drug dependent patients and of <b>dosulepin</b> with alcohol or in methadone patients have been reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dosulepin</b> {{has three}} metabolites, northiaden (desmethyldosulepin), <b>dosulepin</b> sulfoxide, and northiaden sulfoxide, which have longer {{terminal}} half-lives {{than that of}} <b>dosulepin</b> itself. However, whereas northiaden has potent activity similarly to <b>dosulepin,</b> the two sulfoxide metabolites have dramatically reduced activity. They {{have been described as}} essentially inactive, and are considered unlikely to contribute to either the therapeutic effects or side effects of <b>dosulepin.</b> Relative to <b>dosulepin,</b> northiaden has reduced activity as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, antihistamine, and anticholinergic and greater potency as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, similarly to other secondary amine TCAs. Unlike the sulfoxide metabolites, northiaden is thought {{to play an important role}} in the effects of <b>dosulepin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dosulepin</b> can potentiate {{the effects}} of alcohol {{and at least one}} death has been {{attributed}} to this combination. TCAs potentiate the sedative effects of barbiturates, tranquilizers and [...] depressants. Guanethidine and other adrenergic neuron blocking drugs can have their antihypertensive effects blocked by <b>dosulepin.</b> Sympathomimetics may potentiate the sympathomimetic effects of <b>dosulepin.</b> Due to the anticholinergic and antihistamine effects of <b>dosulepin</b> anticholinergic and antihistamine medications may have their effects potentiated by <b>dosulepin</b> and hence these combinations are advised against. <b>Dosulepin</b> may have its postural hypotensive effects potentiated by diuretics. Anticonvulsants may have their efficacy reduced by <b>dosulepin</b> due to its ability to reduce the seizure threshold.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dosulepin</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of major depressive disorder. There is clear evidence of the efficacy of <b>dosulepin</b> in psychogenic facial pain, though the drug may be needed for up to a year.|$|E
50|$|Although Heal & Cheetham (1992) {{reported}} {{relatively high}} Ki values of 12 and 15 nM for <b>dosulepin</b> and northiaden at the rat α2-adrenergic receptor {{and suggested that}} antagonism of the receptor could {{be involved in the}} antidepressant effects of <b>dosulepin,</b> Richelson & Nelson (1984) found a low KD of only 2,400 nM for <b>dosulepin</b> at this receptor using human brain tissue. This suggests that it in fact has low potency for this action, similarly to other TCAs.|$|E
5000|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressants}} (TCAs): amitriptyline, butriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, <b>dosulepin,</b> doxepin, imipramine, lofepramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline, trimipramine.|$|E
50|$|By the 1960s it {{was making}} <b>dosulepin,</b> a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA), under the brand name Prothiaden.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dosulepin</b> is the English and German {{generic name}} of the drug and its [...] and , while <b>dosulepin</b> {{hydrochloride}} is its [...] and [...] Dothiepin is the former [...] of the drug while dothiepin hydrochloride is the former [...] and remains the current [...] Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its [...] are dosulepina, in French and its [...] are dosulépine, and in Latin is dosulepinum.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{and the treatment}} of an overdose are largely {{the same as for}} the other TCAs. <b>Dosulepin</b> may be particularly toxic in overdose compared to other TCAs. The onset of toxic effects is around 4-6 hours after <b>dosulepin</b> is ingested. In order to minimise the risk of overdose it is advised that patients only receive a limited number of tablets at a time so as to limit their risk of overdosing. It is also advised that patients are not prescribed any medications that are known to increase the risk of toxicity in those receiving <b>dosulepin</b> due to the potential for mixed overdoses. The medication should also be kept out of reach of children.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dosulepin</b> is a {{transporter}} blocker of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), thereby {{acting as}} an SNRI. It {{is also an}} antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor, α1-adrenergic receptor, serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mACh), {{as well as a}} blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). The antidepressant effects of <b>dosulepin</b> are thought to be due to inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and possibly also of serotonin.|$|E
50|$|Benzothiepines {{have one}} fused benzene group and dibenzothiepines such as <b>dosulepin</b> and {{zotepine}} have two fused benzene groups. Damotepine is another thiepin derivative.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dosulepin,</b> {{also known}} as dothiepin and sold under the brand name Prothiaden among others, is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA) which {{is used in the}} treatment of depression. <b>Dosulepin</b> was once the most frequently prescribed antidepressant in the United Kingdom, but it is no longer widely used due to its relatively high toxicity in overdose without therapeutic advantages over other TCAs.
