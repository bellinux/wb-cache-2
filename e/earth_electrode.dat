Preliminary explayning the methodology, earth buried conductors are studied in their double function of <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes</b> and connection elements between earthing grids, both in absence and in presence of other interfering conductors. Subsequently is analyzed, with a distributed parameters approach, the system constituted by an earth buried conductor and a MV tri-phase cable line.

This paper shows the results of simulations, performed on networks with different extensions and characteristics, organized in easy-to-read graphs and tables. A comparison of these results with the values obtained according to the procedure explained in the IEC-Standard 60909 – 3, and a study on the accuracy of the method has been made.

5000|$|In Australia, New Zealand and Israel the TN-C-S {{system is}} in use; however, the wiring rules {{currently}} state that, in addition, each customer must provide a separate connection to earth via both a water pipe bond (if metallic water pipes enter the consumer's premises) and a dedicated <b>earth</b> <b>electrode.</b> In Australia and New Zealand {{this is called the}} Multiple Earthed Neutral Link or MEN Link. This MEN Link is removable for installation testing purposes, but is connected during use by either a locking system (locknuts for instance) or two or more screws. In the MEN system, the integrity of the Neutral is paramount. In Australia, new installations must also bond the foundation concrete re-enforcing under wet areas to the earth conductor (AS3000), typically increasing the size of the earthing, and provides an equipotential plane in areas such as bathrooms. In older installations, {{it is not uncommon to}} find only the water pipe bond, and it is allowed to remain as such, but the additional <b>earth</b> <b>electrode</b> must be installed if any upgrade work is done. The protective earth and neutral conductors are combined until the consumer's neutral link (located on the customer's side of the electricity meter's neutral connection) - beyond this point, the protective earth and neutral conductors are separate.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, the Zone of Influence was {{historically}} {{measured as}} anywhere within 100m {{of the boundary}} of the high voltage compound at a Hot Site. Since 2007, it is allowable to use the Energy Networks Association (ENA) Recommendation S34 [...] ('A Guide for Assessing the Rise of Earth Potential at Substation Sites') to calculate Hot Zone. This is now defined as a contour line marking where the Rise Of Earth Potential (ROEP) exceeds 430V for normal reliability power lines or 650V for high reliability lines. The Zone extends in a radius from any bonded metalwork such as the site <b>earth</b> <b>electrode</b> system and boundary fence. This may effectively reduce the overall size of the Hot Zone. However, strip earth electrodes, and any non-effectively insulated metallic sheath/ armouring of power cables which extend out of this zone {{would continue to be}} considered as 'hot' for a distance of 100m from the boundary, for a width of two meters either side of the conductor. It {{is the responsibility of the}} owning Electrical Supply Industry (ESI) to calculate the Hot Zone. Openreach (a BT Group company tasked with installing and maintaining the majority of telephone services in the UK) maintains a Hot Site Register, updated every 12 months by voluntarily supplied information from the ESI companies in the UK.

5000|$|In {{single-ended}} single-phase systems {{where the}} Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and {{the part of}} TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), {{if there is a}} contact problem in the PEN conductor, then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced multi-phase system, the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of the most loaded line conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a neutral inversion. Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of concentric cable construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and shore supply to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building sites, and in such cases it is recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate <b>earth</b> <b>electrode.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract- One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} for LPS (Lightning Protection System) earthing system is to provide its reliable long time service. The earthing system components embedded in soil: <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes,</b> <b>earth</b> conductors and clamps are usually exposed to much more severe environmental factors than those installed in open air area. Main phenomenon influencing their reliable performance is the corrosion affecting earthing system components. The extensive list of different requirements for design and dimensioning of earthing system elements of LPS is given in new series of IEC 62305 on lightning protection {{as well in the}} EN standards related to the specific test requirements for lightning protection system <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes</b> and conductors. Some of these requirements are characterized in the paper. In 2003 started in Poland the long-term project of field corrosion tests of earth rods. The aim of these investigations was to compare the corrosion rate of two commonly used protective coating materials of steel earth electrodes: hot-dip zinc coatings and electrodeposited copper coatings. Preliminary results of earth rods field corrosion tests after 2 and 4 years exposure in different soil types are discussed in the paper...|$|R
50|$|Earthing connects exposed {{conductive}} {{parts of}} electrical equipment to earth {{in order to}} complete a circuit {{in the event that}} the insulation on a live conductor should fail. Earthing therefore provides a return path for the current required to blow fuses or trip circuit breakers and RCDs, and ensures that the supply is reliably disconnected {{in the event of a}} fault. Bonding is the connection of the exposed conductive part of electrical equipment or objects like mains water / gas supply pipe to the main Earth terminal (MET) to bring all exposed metalwork into the same electrical potential. This is done to minimise the danger of electric shock due to human contact with live parts which could result from bad insulation and insulation failures. Bonding wires are typically thicker than earthing wires to ensure that they have a sufficiently low resistance that hazardous voltages (as calculated by V=IR) cannot appear even in the presence of large fault currents. In domestic wiring, earthing of equipment is done by bonding together the earth points and metallic parts of the appliances and earthed bodies using green/yellow wire coming from the consumer main earthing terminal. The earth terminal is in turn connected to either consumer’s <b>earth</b> <b>electrode</b> (TT system) or to the earth point given by the supplier (TN system). In pre-1966 buildings, the earthing may be connected only to the plumbing system, which is creating potential earthing problems in buildings where the metal pipes are being replaced by non-conductive plastic pipes.|$|E

From the selected sites, measurements were taken for resistivity using the four point measurement, the pH and the moisture levels were also determined.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes</b> at {{power frequency}} conditions is well known. Several studies {{are going on}} at present, to understand the behaviour of earthing systems at transient impulse and high frequency conditions. The study of impulse measurements in earthing systems was carried out during this project, to understand the soil electromagnetic behaviour towards high frequency and variable AC/DC/impulse current magnitudes. Several measurement techniques and instrumentation used for the measurement of the earthing systems were surveyed. The limitations and the advantages of each approach have been identified, {{and the range of}} application determined. Extensive experiments were performed on the practical <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes</b> at the Cardiff University test site at Llanrumney, and at the Dinorwig power station earthing facilities. These experiments have revealed that there is reduction of impedance of <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes</b> over the frequency range 20 Hz to 120 kHz. Moreover, a pronounced effect of DC current magnitude was observed on the earth resistance of the electrodes over the range of 1 mA to 500 mA. The numerical modelling of the test configurations did not show the reduction in earth impedance over the frequency range 20 Hz to 120 kHz. To understand the different trends shown by the experiments and simulation, and the effect of frequency and current magnitude, a geological literature survey was carried out. This survey revealed that when the soil water electrolyte solution is subjected to high frequency electrical currents, it exhibits conductivity dispersion phenomenon. Conductivity dispersion is a phenomenon where conductivity of the clay water electrolyte solution increases by about 30...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effects of double earth faults in Medium Voltage (MV) networks, in presence of electrical interconnection of the earthing systems of the secondary substations. In urban areas, indeed, the <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes</b> of the secondary substations are interconnected and, in many cases, they are also connected to the <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes</b> of the primary stations, in order to realize quasi-equipotential surfaces, intrinsically safe against electric shocks, named Global Earthing Systems (GES). The concept of GES has been introduced in the technical literature ten years ago in the Document HD 637 S 1 by CENELEC, with the aim of providing a solution to the problems of designing and verifying the effectiveness of the <b>earth</b> <b>electrodes</b> of the secondary substations located inside urban areas. In these areas, usually, fault currents are higher and it is more complicated to execute large earthing systems and to execute earth resistance measurements. Unfortunately, the concept of GES has not been adequately exploited, primarily due to the absence of precise indications on how to recognize a GES among all the interconnected, but not necessarily intrinsically safe, large earthing systems. The study of these systems has been done in the past by using practical methods or touch and step voltages measurements and, first of all, with regards only to single line to earth faults. Nevertheless in very old MV network, expecially in those managed with unearthed neutral points, single line to earth faults can evolve into double earth faults, characterized by very high fault currents (about the 80...|$|R
