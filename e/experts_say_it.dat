40|$|Every year, I meet a {{new group}} of {{postgraduate}} nursing students who come together to study ethics at an advanced level. For some, {{it is the first time}} in their careers that they have been able to express their ethical concerns in such a forum, or in some cases, in any formal setting; for others, it is a confirmation that not all perceived failures relating to moral issues are necessarily of their or their nursing colleagues ’ own making. For all, it is a bitter-sweet confirmation of the difficulties involved in dealing with those sometimes painful moral problems that they have encountered over what is often several years of practice. Indeed, it is as if through the exchange of narratives, each student feels not only marginally unburdened but free to finally state those things that really matter to them in a forum where others actually appreciate their opinions. But then at some point, we come to an examination of what is currently called nursing ‘moral distress’, and slowly but surely, a rising degree of exasperation and annoyance emerges around the room, as one by one the students all focus on the same question, namely, ‘What are we to do about moral distress?’ Moral distress is a phenomenon that is a reality in nursing however it is labelled or packaged, and what-ever the <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is or it is not.

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s {{newspapers}} increasingly {{have been}} used as part of the curriculum for adult learners in literacy programs. The primary reasons for this: (1) newspapers are considered effective at improving adult learning skills; (2) newspaper content is deemed useful for adults; (3) newspapers serve the democratic process. It is also the hope within the newspaper industry that, through the use of newspapers in literacy classes, new adult readers will cultivate the newsreading habit. ^ While {{much has been written about}} the positive affects of newspaper use in adult literacy education, there has not been much attention given to what the adult learner has to say [...] especially in terms of whether the newspaper fulfills the kinds of uses and needs which the <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> should. ^ The purpose of this study was to examine attitudes about newspapers held by adult learners in literacy programs. The researcher performed a principle components factor analysis on data obtained from the Q sorts of 47 subjects from select Adult Basic Education programs in Central Nebraska. Thirty-two subjects loaded significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and independently on the emerging four factor solution. The four factors, which represent four structures of persons sharing similar attitudes about newspapers, were labeled (a) Good Citizens, (b) Gregarians, (c) Pragmatics, and (d) Pragmatic Skeptics. ^ The investigator also sought to determine if the a priori categories of newspapers needs/uses were reflected in attitudes about newspapers among subjects participating in this study. And while most subjects found some dimensions of the Utilitarian needs/uses category as important to them, this category was not strongly represented. Nor did the subjects find the Self-Enhancing or Escapist qualities of newspapers to be of value to them. Two of the factors, however, related strongly to the Socio-Political and Integrative needs/uses categories. ^ Demographic data was used to describe subjects who loaded significantly on each factor. Implications for practical application were also discussed. ...|$|E
