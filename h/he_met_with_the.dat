5|$|After his release, Kenyatta {{set about}} trying to ensure {{that he was the}} only {{realistic}} option as Kenya's future leader. In August <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Governor of Kenya, Patrick Muir Renison, at Kiambu, and he was interviewed by the BBC's Face to Face program. In August he also attended a KANU-KADU meeting, where the two parties disagreed on the question of federalism: KANU wanted a centralised state while KADU feared that this would result in Kikuyu dominance of an independent Kenya.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> BBC {{to discuss}} {{the revival of the}} show and {{producing}} The Second Coming; the BBC were unable to commit to either, and he again declined to work for them. After the BBC rejected The Second Coming, Shindler proposed that the series should be pitched to ITV. Despite the story's controversial message, the critical success of Bob & Rose encouraged the channel to commission the series for broadcast.|$|E
5|$|In April 1917, Pećanac re-emerged {{with his}} guerrillas, attacking a railway station, {{destroying}} a bridge and raiding a Bulgarian {{village on the}} border. Pećanac avoided a further offensive by the occupation forces in July by disappearing into the mountains once again. After emerging for a short time, in September–October 1917 Pećanac again dispersed his guerrillas and infiltrated the Austro-Hungarian occupied zone, where he remained in hiding until mid-1918. During his period in hiding, <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kosovar Albanian leader Azem Galica to discuss joint actions against the occupation forces.|$|E

5|$|Tiring of {{the back}} and forth, fair leaders demanded a meeting with Mint {{officials}} to settle {{the matter of the}} design. The Company was in severe financial straits, and money from the sale of the coins was needed. Leech agreed to send Barber to Chicago, where <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Finance Committee on September 23, 1892. It was agreed that the obverse would be based on the badges, and the reverse on Warner's caravel concept.|$|E
5|$|U.S. flags {{flown by}} the federal {{government}} were displayed at half-staff from January 9, 2011 until sunset on January 15, 2011 in honor of the victims of the Tucson shooting. A national moment of silence was held at 11:00a.m. EST on January 10, 2011 on the South Lawn of the White House as well as the steps of the United States Capitol. President Obama went to Tucson on January 12 where <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> families of the victims and visited Giffords at her bedside in the medical center before attending the evening's televised memorial ceremony where he delivered a memorial speech.|$|E
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Mohave while {{dressed in his}} major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave {{about all the things}} he had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E

5|$|Although Busoni {{met with}} many other artistic personalities who were also basing {{themselves}} in Switzerland during the war (including Stephan Zweig and James Joyce– the former noting Busoni's extensive drinking) he soon found his circumstances limiting. After {{the end of the}} war, he again undertook concert tours in England, Paris and Italy. In London <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> composer Kaikhosru Sorabji who played to him his Second Piano Sonata (which he dedicated to Busoni); Busoni was sufficiently impressed to write for Sorabji a letter of recommendation. When Busoni's former pupil Leo Kestenberg, now an official at the Ministry of Culture in the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany, with the promise of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was very glad to take the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then {{set out to find}} out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. <b>He</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|During this period, neither William nor Robert {{seems to}} have trusted Henry. Waiting until the {{rebellion}} against William Rufus was safely over, Henry returned to England in July 1088. <b>He</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> King {{but was unable to}} persuade him to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he had been away, however, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that Henry was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in Neuilly-la-Forêt, and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin. Henry was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.|$|E

5|$|In 1805 U.S. Lieutenant Zebulon Pike {{was sent}} by General Wilkinson, {{governor}} of the Louisiana Territory, to enforce U.S. sovereignty against British traders {{in the area and}} establish diplomatic and trading relationships with the native tribes. <b>He</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sioux leadership in central Minnesota to secure rights for the U.S. to an area near Saint Anthony Falls, which would later become the city of Saint Paul. Though a treaty was signed by some leaders from the Sioux tribes, its legitimacy (including whether the Sioux understood it) was dubious and ultimately his efforts did little to establish the authority of the U.S. in the area.|$|E
5|$|Lamo {{met with}} FBI and Army {{investigators}} on May 25 in California, {{and showed them}} the chat logs. On or around that date he also passed the story to Kevin Poulsen of Wired, and on May 27 gave him the chat logs and Manning's name under embargo. <b>He</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> FBI again that day, at which point they told him Manning had been arrested in Iraq the day before. Poulsen and Kim Zetter broke {{the news of the}} arrest in Wired on June 6. Wired published around 25 percent of the chat logs on June 6 and 10, and the full logs in July 2011.|$|E
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E

5|$|While {{attending}} {{a memorial service}} at Venray in September 2011, Mayhew was seen by Dutch medal researcher Roel Rijks and Henny Meijer wearing the decoration of the Military William Order. Only seven knights {{were known to be}} alive at the time and held in the highest regard, with the knighting of Marco Kroon in 2009, the first new knight in over half a century, receiving broad national media attention. As such, the discovery of an eighth knight was widely published. The chapter of the order confirmed his membership and informed the Minister of Defence and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, the grandmaster of the order. The Dutch embassy in London sent a representative to Mayhew's home to reestablish contact. In May 2012 Mayhew visited the Netherlands where he was received by Queen Beatrix. <b>He</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other Dutch knights, and was presented with an appreciation medal from the municipality of Venray.|$|E
5|$|Crawford enjoyed foreign travel. In 1928 the OS {{sent him}} to the Middle East to collect aerial {{photographs}} that had been produced during the First World War and which were stored at Baghdad, Amman, and Heliopolis. In mid-1931 he visited Germany and Austria, furthering his interest in photography through the purchase of a Voigtländer. He later visited Italy with the intent of examining the possibility of producing OS maps pinpointing the country's archaeological sites; in November 1932 <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Italian leader Benito Mussolini, who was interested in Crawford's ideas about creating an OS map of archaeological sites in Rome. This was part of a wider project to produce a series of maps covering the entirety of the Roman Empire, for which Crawford visited various parts of Europe during the late 1920s and 1930s. Holiday destinations included Germany, Austria, Romania, Corsica, Malta, Algeria, and Tunisia, and in 1936 he purchased a plot of land in Cyprus on which he had a house built. During these vacations, he visited archaeological sites and met with local archaeologists, encouraging them to contribute articles to Antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{forces in}} Gascony were around 4,400 strong, but the French army, {{commanded}} by Charles of Valois, numbered 7,000. Valois took the Agenais and then advanced further {{and cut off}} the main city of Bordeaux. In response, Edward ordered the arrest of any French persons in England and seized Isabella's lands, {{on the basis that}} she was of French origin. In November 1324 <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> earls and the English Church, who recommended that Edward should lead a force of 11,000 men to Gascony. Edward decided not to go personally, sending instead the Earl of Surrey. Meanwhile, Edward opened up fresh negotiations with the French king. Charles advanced various proposals, the most tempting of which was the suggestion that if Isabella and Prince Edward were to travel to Paris, and the Prince was to give homage to the French King for Gascony, he would terminate the war and return the Agenais. Edward and his advisers had concerns about sending the prince to France, but agreed to send Isabella on her own as an envoy in March 1325.|$|E
