40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> with chloroplasts' photosystem II (PSII) was {{studied in}} isolated thylakoid membranes. Low concentration <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> (mM range) {{was shown to}} affect water oxidation and the advancement of the S-states. Modified kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence rise and thermoluminescence in the presence <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> indicated that the electron transfer was affected at both sides of PSII, {{and in particular the}} electron transfer between YZ and P 680 +. As the concentration <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> was raised above 10  mM, the extrinsic polypeptides associated with the oxygen-evolving complex were lost and energy transfer between PSII antenna complexes and reaction centers was impaired. It was concluded that methylamine is able to affect both extrinsic and intrinsic subunits of PSII even at the lowest concentrations used where the extrinsic polypeptides of the OEC are still associated with the luminal side of the photosystem. As methylamine concentration increases, the extrinsic polypeptides are lost and the interaction with intrinsic domains is amplified resulting in an increased F 0...|$|R

40|$|Allylamine did {{not serve}} as an {{efficient}} substrate for methylamine dehydrogenase (EC 1. 4. 99. 3) in a steady-state assay of activity and appeared {{to act as a}} competitive inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> oxidation by methylamine dehydrogenase. Transient kinetic studies, however, revealed that allylamine rapidly reduced the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) cofactor <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> dehydrogenase. The rate of TTQ reduction by allylamine was 322 s- 1, slightly faster than the rate <b>of</b> reduction by <b>methylamine.</b> These data were explained by a kinetic mechanism in which allylamine and methylamine are alternative substrates for methylamine dehydrogenase.

40|$|The {{regulation}} <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> and formaldehyde metabolism in Arthrobacter P 1 {{was investigated}} in carbon-limited continuous cultures. To avoid toxic effects of higher formaldehyde concentrations, formaldehyde-limited cultures were established in smooth substrate transitions from choline-limitation. Evidence was obtained that the synthesis of enzymes involved in the conversion <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> into formaldehyde and in formaldehyde fixation is induced sequentially in this organism. Compared to growth with methylamine the molar growth yield on formaldehyde was approximately 30 % higher. This difference is mainly due to the expenditure of energy for the uptake <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> from the medium. The addition of a pulse of a "heterotrophic" substrate, glucose or acetate, to C 1 substrate-limited continuous cultures resulted in relief of carbon limitation and transient synthesis of increasing amounts of cell material. Concomitantly, {{a significant decrease in}} the specific activities of hexulose phosphate synthase was observed. However, the total activity of hexulose phosphate synthase in these cultures remained clearly in excess of that required to fix the formaldehyde that became available in time. The observed strong decrease in the specific activities of this RuMP cycle enzyme strongly suggests that its synthesis is controlled via catabolite repression exerted by the metabolism of "heterotrophic" substrates. ...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{addition}} <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> to intact cells, this lysosomotropic {{weak base}} accumulates intracellularly {{as the result}} of at least two different mechanisms: (1) facilitated diffusion across the plasma membrane, i. e. a process which is carrier-mediated and subject to both trans-stimulation (accelerative exchange) and cis-inhibition (competition) by other amines (e. g. ammonia, methylamine and triethylamine); this transport process is furthermore non-concentrative, energy-independent, and (although moderately temperature-sensitive) operative even at 0 degrees C; (2) active uptake, i. e. an energy-dependent concentrative process which is inhibited by anoxia and energy inhibitors. With time, methylamine accumulates in lysosomes and gives rise to a lysosomal swelling which is easily visible by optical microscopy, and which causes the cells to appear coarsely granular. After a 1 h incubation with 10 mM-methylamine, the total cell volume is increased by about 12 %. Under anoxic conditions or in the presence of energy inhibitors, lysosomal swelling is abolished regardless of there being a high concentration <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> intracellularly (taken up by facilitated diffusion). The continuous accumulation <b>of</b> <b>methylamine</b> in lysosomes therefore seems to depend on an energy-requiring process (such as continuous proton pumping), and not only on trapping by Donnan-equilibrium-generated protons...|$|R
