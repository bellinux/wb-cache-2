500|$|Studies {{that have}} looked at hemispheric and global scales {{conclude}} that any urban-related trend is {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than decadal and longer time-scale trends evident in the series (e.g., Jones et al., 1990; Peterson et al., 1999). This result could partly be attributed to the omission from the <b>gridded</b> <b>data</b> set of a small number of sites (<1%) with clear urban-related warming trends. In a worldwide set of about 270 stations, Parker (2004, 2006) noted that warming trends in night minimum temperatures over the period 1950 to 2000 were not enhanced on calm nights, which would be the time most likely to be affected by urban warming. Thus, the global land warming trend discussed is very unlikely to be influenced significantly by increasing urbanisation (Parker, 2006). ... Accordingly, this assessment adds the same level of urban warming uncertainty as in the TAR: 0.006°C per decade since 1900 for land, and 0.002°C per decade since 1900 for blended land with ocean, as ocean UHI is zero.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Data grids, such as {{the ones}} used by the high energy physics community, are used to share vast amounts of data across {{geographic}} locations. However, interactions with <b>grid</b> <b>data</b> are generally limited by the interfaces provided by the corresponding grid’s infrastructure. The standardization of grid interfaces is one way to expand the reach of <b>grid</b> <b>data</b> seamlessly for users as well as to broaden the set of exploitable grid tools. This in turn enables new collaboration possibilities. The Open Grid Forum has created standards related to accessing <b>grid</b> <b>data.</b> In our work, we explore the usability of two OGF standards, RNS and ByteIO, to enable access to data resources residing in EGEE grids. Grids that implement the RNS specification can address named entities in other grids while grids that implement the ByteIO specification can manipulate data associated with named resources in other <b>grids.</b> <b>Data</b> management functionality in EGEE grids was developed before these specifications were created. As such, implementing RNS and ByteIO for EGEE grids is a test of whether these standards can be applied to an existing grid infrastructure. Through the development of the SNARL and SABLE web services, we demonstrate that such an implementation is possible and measure its performance ramifications. These services expand the access to EGEE <b>grid</b> <b>data</b> by enabling interoperability with other standard compliant grid infrastructures. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of Grid computing technologies for distributed data access and query processing {{has been investigated}} {{in a number of}} studies. However, different <b>Grid</b> <b>data</b> sources may have schema conflicts which require fine-grained resolution through the use of data integration technologies that are not supported by the current generation of <b>Grid</b> <b>data</b> access and querying middleware. This is particularly the case with distributed querying and analysis of complex data sources as found in Life Sciences applications. The query {{performance of}} architectures that combine <b>Grid</b> <b>data</b> access and query processing capabilities with data integration technologies has not been investigated to date. In this paper, we investigate architectural, optimisation and performance issues arising from the coupling of <b>Grid</b> <b>data</b> access and distributed querying together with data integration technologies. Specifically, we investigate these issues for the OGSA-DAI and OGSA-DQP open-source Grid access and querying middleware combined with the AutoMed heterogeneous data transformation/integration system. We present an architectural framework we have developed for investigating the combination of these technologies, and the results of a query performance study we have undertaken. The significance of our results for further development of query processing technology over heterogeneous <b>Grid</b> <b>data</b> sources is discussed. Our performance analysis had been carried out using a representative integrated data resource developed as part of the ISPIDER (In Silico Proteome Integrated Data Environment Resource) project.

Gaining meaningful insights from repertory <b>grids</b> <b>data</b> is a challenge because data analysis is timeconsuming and a significant mental effort is needed. Visualizations aim at facilitating data analysis through a visual and interactive approach, which allows users to understand their data, reflect, and make better decisions. This paper presents an interactive visualization tool for teachers and students. The tool visualizes repertory <b>grid</b> <b>data</b> using two dashboards, where teachers and students can investigate constructs and rating elements of students at the individual or group level. Visualizing the repertory <b>grid</b> <b>data</b> is an initial attempt towards teaching analytics. Future work will focus on evaluating the tool in a real setting with teachers and students, and collecting suggestions for improvement. ...|$|R
