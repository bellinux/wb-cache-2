According to the instantaneous screw motion theory, the meshing function of the nutation drive for the kinematic modeling is developed based on the gear meshing theory and the coordinate system transformation between a <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> and an internal or an external spiral bevel gear.

50|$|If one axle loses grip, {{different}} rotational speeds arise {{inside the}} differential which {{result in an}} increase in axial forces that force the clutch plates to close. Once closed, the output shaft is locked resulting in the diversion {{of the majority of the}} torque to the axle achieving better traction. In the <b>Crown</b> <b>Gear</b> <b>differential</b> up to 85% of torque can flow to the rear, and up to 70% of torque can be diverted to the front axle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, amagnetic {{planetary}} gear drive is proposed and its operating principle is introduced. The equationsof the geometrics andkinematics for thedrive are given. The equations {{of the magnetic}} induction intensity for the magnetic gear teeth are deduced. The equations of the torques between the {{planetary gear}}s and sun <b>gear</b> or <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> are developed. The available parameters of the magnetic planetary drive are presented and the magnetic flux density distri-butions of the magnetic gear teeth are investigated. The torques between the planetary gears and sun <b>gear</b> or <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> are analysed. When the relative rotating angle between the gears is increased, the magnetic torque grows, gets to a maximum value, and then drops. The maximum torque represents extreme load-carrying ability of the drive system. The pole pair number, the tooth thickness and the tooth width of the magnetic gears, and the speed ratio of the drive have obvious influence on the output torques. To obtain a large magnetic torque, a large tooth width of the gear, a proper pole pair number, a proper radial thickness of the tooth, a large planetary gear number, and a large speed ratio should be chosen...|$|R

50|$|During the 1960s, {{very few}} {{motorcycles}} were available with shaft final drive. BMW's {{were the most}} common. The driveshaft rode in an enclosed oil bath within the right swingarm, unlike BMW's previous models, and drove the rear wheel through an internally splined cup that meshes with a coupler <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> keyed to the drive pinion. This meant that leaking seals could become {{a problem for the}} owners. Because the clutch was dry, there were seals {{at the rear of the}} crankshaft, at both ends of the transmission, at the rear of the driveshaft, and at the front and rear of the rear drive unit: lots of seals to develop leaks.|$|R

In general, the sidewinder and anglewinder are less common {{arrangements}} than the inline motor, in which the shaft is perpendicular to the driven axle, and drives it with bevel gears or a pinion and <b>crown</b> <b>gear.</b> Historically, they are also less common than the pancake motor, in which the shaft is vertical and power is carried to the axle by a chain of gears to a pinion and crown arrangement. Because they require more space between the drive wheels, the sidewinder and anglewinder arrangements are more common in 1:32, and especially 1:24, than in the smaller scales.|$|R

It was a feature of the highly successful Aurora HO slot cars of the 1960s and 1970s. The motor was not a separate unit; instead, its individual elements - magnets, armature, commutator and brushes - fit into recesses in the blocky chassis. The power was carried by a chain of spur gears {{along the top of the}} chassis, to a pinion which drove a <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> at the axle.

40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a {{torque drive}} mechanism utilizing axially translatable, mutually engageable transmission members having mating <b>crown</b> <b>gears,</b> driven and driving members with a three-element drive train being biased together by resilient means or by a fluid actuator system, the apparatus being operable to transmit a precisely controlled degree of torque to a driven member. The apparatus is applicable {{for use in}} hand tools and {{as a replacement for}} impact torque drivers, torque wrenches, motorized screw drivers, or the like, wherein the applied torque must be precisely controlled or limited. The bevel torque drive includes a drive gear which is axially displaceable and rotatable within cylindrical driver housing, a rotatable intermediate gear, and an output gear. Key rotationally secures displaceable gear with respect to input shaft but permits axial movement therebetween. A thrust bearing is preferably connected to the lower end of shaft for support to reduce play and friction between shaft and a transmission joint disc during rotation of the gear train. Coaxially mounted coiled spring is footed against displaceable gear for biasing the displaceable gear toward and into engagement with the intermediate gear for driving intermediate gear and output gear. Torque control is achieved by the use of straight or spiral beveled gears which are of configurations adapted to withdraw from mutual engagement upon the torque exceeding a predetermined limit. The novel, advantageous features of the invention include the configuration of the mating, <b>crown</b> <b>gear</b> sets and the axially translatable, slidable drive gear. The mechanism is capable of transmitting a high degree of torque within a narrow, compact transmission housing. The compact size and narrow, elongated configuration of the housing is particularly applicable for use in hand tools and in multiple torque driver mechanisms in which it is necessary to drive multiple fasteners which are located in close proximity. Prior torque drivers such as 'click-type' torque wrenches do not actually limit torque application but only provide an audible warning that the limit has been reached...|$|R
40|$|A gear is a {{rotating}} machine part having cut tooth, which mesh with another toothed part {{in order to}} transmit torque. Gears are mainly type like spur gears, helical gears, double helical <b>gears,</b> bevel <b>gears,</b> <b>crown</b> <b>gears,</b> hypoid gears, worm gears, rack and pinion, epicyclic gears etc. The application of these gears fled from tiny wrist watches to huge machinery equipment gears from vital elements of mechanism in many machines such as automobile, aerospace industry, rolling mills, hoisting and transmitting machinery, marine engines, and the like. Parallel and co-planer shaft connected by gears are known as spur gear. Spur gear have straight tooth and are parallel to the axis of the wheel. Spur gears are {{most common type of}} gears. A pair of spur gear tooth in action is generally subjected to two types of cyclic stress: contact stress and bending stress including bending fatigue. Both stress may not attain their maximum values at the same point of contact fatigue.

5000|$|Worm drives {{have been}} used in a few {{automotive}} rear-axle final drives (though not the differential itself). They took advantage of the location of the gear being at either the very top or very bottom of the <b>differential</b> <b>crown</b> wheel. In the 1910s they were common on trucks; to gain the most clearance on muddy roads the worm gear was placed on top. In the 1920s the Stutz firm used them on its cars; to have a lower floor than its competitors, the gear was located on the bottom. An example from around 1960 was the Peugeot 404. The worm gear carries the differential gearing, which protects the vehicle against rollback. This ability has largely fallen from favour due to the higher-than-necessary reduction ratios.|$|R

The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.|$|R

50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the <b>differential</b> <b>crown</b> wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Geared {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for power, not for speed, and were popular with logging companies {{who had to}} move heavy trains up and down grades safely. Four types of logging locomotives were utilized {{in the early twentieth}} century: the common rod engine, the Shay, the Heisler, and the Climax locomotives. The rod configuration has steam pistons which actuate rods attached to the wheels which, in turn, provide locomotion. The Shay configured geared-locomotive had two or more pistons that are mounted perpendicular to the boiler. Instead of actuating rods for locomotion, the pistons turned a crankshaft which ran the length of the engine on one side and engaged each of the wheels with a <b>crown</b> <b>gear.</b> The Heisler configured geared-locomotive always had two pistons cradling the boiler and is mounted to a central axle. This central axle was attached to the locomotive wheels much like a modern truck. The rarest of the logging locomotives is the Climax configured geared-locomotive. Climax locomotives have pistons that flank the boiler at a 45-degree angle. These pistons turn a flywheel which is connected to a central axle, thus providing locomotion. All of these geared locomotives are rare but there are only three Climax engines that can be seen today in working order.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Involute {{straight}} {{bevel gear}} pair often appears the phenomenons of meshing interference, impact and "end contact " {{in the course of}} meshing. Usually, symmetrical crowning is adopted to improve above phenomenons, however, due to the influence of complicated tooth loads and other complicated factors, the symmetrical <b>crowned</b> <b>gear</b> may not reach a good modification effect. In this paper, we adopt target variable curvature crowning according to the specific conditions of bevel gears in order to obtain good modification effect, nevertheless, because of the complexity of the variable curvature crowning, the conventional method of using space spherical involute stretch and sweep standard gear model to remove tooth surface materials has been unable to meet the accurate requirements of the variable curvature crowned model, at the same time, this method can not realize parametric modeling of modification bevel gear. Therefore, this paper puts forward an easy to realize parametric modeling method of accurate variable curvature crowning for involute {{straight bevel gear}} based on ANSYS/LS-DYNA, Imageware, Matlab and Solidworks. This method can realize the accurate modeling for variable curvature crowned involute straight bevel gear and ensure the accuracy of modification gears and follow-up finite element simulation, meanwhile, it provides theoretical basis for parametric modeling of variable curvature crowned involute straight bevel gear. Finally, the superiority of variable curvature crowning is tested through numerical simulation under specific conditions...|$|R
