The City Club of Portland held a {{significant}} meeting in 1992 {{about the fate}} of the Central Park Blocks, also called the Commercial Park Blocks. Moyer and the PDC opposed [...] "the downtown parking magnate" [...] Greg Goodman's plans to turn the block into a 550-space 12-story parking structure in 1995, which was to be called the Park Avenue Plaza. Neil Goldschmidt said the parking structure would be [...] "like putting lipstick on a dead corpse" [...] and Bill Naito said that a [...] "12-story garage won't go away.

"While it's easy to {{complain}} about a stretch of so-so movies," [...] wrote Matt Patches at Hollywood.com as 2012 began, [...] "the twist is we should really be thanking the studios for catering to niche audiences all month." [...] For most viewers, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{catch up on the}} major awards contenders released in December. But studios and the filmgoers who have already seen those two films can benefit from creative risk-taking by filmmakers. He points to Cloverfield as one such gamble that succeeded. Smaller film distributors also take advantage of the dump months to bring little-seen but highly praised films like Kill List to wider audiences via home-media releases.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Gould {{published}} The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002), a long treatise recapitulating {{his version of}} modern evolutionary theory. In episode 13 of the Dutch TV series Of Beauty and Consolation Gould remarked, [...] "In {{a couple of years}} I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very different from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to me because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character you want, and then do the things you want. We would never have a [...] force you to be a certain character or go down a certain path." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

500|$|Mark Shiel {{explains}} the rising popularity of cult films {{as an attempt}} by cinephiles and scholars to escape the oppressive conformity and mainstream appeal of even independent film, {{as well as a}} lack of condescension in both critics and the films; Academic Donna de Ville says it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> subvert the dominance of academics and cinephiles. [...] According to Xavier Mendik, [...] "academics have been really interested in cult movies for quite a while now." [...] Mendik has sought to bring together academic interest and fandom through Cine-Excess, a film festival. I. Q. Hunter states that [...] "it's much easier to be a cultist now, but it is also rather more inconsequential." [...] Citing the mainstream availability of Cannibal Holocaust, Jeffrey Sconce rejects definitions of cult films based on controversy and excess, as they've now become meaningless. [...] Cult films have influenced such diverse industries as cosmetics, music videos, and fashion. [...] Cult films have shown up in less expected places; as a sign of his popularity, a bronze statue of Ed Wood has been proposed in his hometown, and L'Osservatore Romano, the official newspaper of the Holy See, has courted controversy for its endorsement of cult films and pop culture. [...] When cities attempt to renovate neighborhoods, fans have called attempts to demolish iconic settings from cult films [...] "cultural vandalism". [...] Cult films can also drive tourism, even when it is unwanted.|$|E

However, {{in spite of these}} costs, a possible benefit to the females <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> test the stamina of the males, so that only those with [...] "good genes" [...] will father their offspring.

2500|$|... {{has also}} {{developed}} a system of musical notation to blend traditional Chinese singing seamlessly into modern Western scores. Traditional Chinese opera notation is less specific about rhythm than Western opera, giving performers more improvisation space to emote and riff off a single note. But the scale and complexity of a modern opera requires Western-style staff notation. [...] "In Chinese opera, there is more improvisation in singing, and a more nasal, penetrating sound", Huang Ruo explains, pointing to a section in the score, [...] "A long note <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> bring out more emotion".|$|E

Annual on-air fund raisers were initiated in order to underwrite KFJC's basic needs and, more importantly, to fund many much needed technological improvements.

[...] In {{an analysis}} of the protest movement for Spiked, Brendan O'Neill was critical of the concept of [...] "mocking Muhammad," [...] writing, [...] "... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the flag-burning, street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business." ...|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything".

[...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions.
