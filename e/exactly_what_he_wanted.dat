5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Geronimo {{agreed to}} tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain {{permission}} to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.|$|E
25|$|The Cimbri {{conveniently}} {{marched into}} Hispania and the Teutoni milled around in northern Gaul, leaving Marius to prepare his army. One of his legates was his old quaestor, Sulla, {{which shows that}} at this time there was no ill-will between them. In 104 BC, Marius was returned as consul again for 103 BC. Though he could have continued to operate as proconsul, it seems that the position as consul would make his position as commander unassailable and avoid any problems with the consuls if he was only a proconsul. Marius seems {{to have been able to}} get <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> and it even seems that his support determined whom the people would elect as his colleagues (his choice was apparently determined, on several occasions, on the basis of their malleability: only Catulus in 102 BC, and Flaccus in 100 BC, would have been serious candidates in their own right without his support, and even Flaccus was described as more servant than partner in the office.) In 103 BC, the Germans still did not emerge from Hispania, and conveniently Marius's colleague (L. Aurelius Orestes, son of C. Gracchus's commander in Sardinia in 126 BC–124 BC) died, so Marius had to return to Rome to oversee the elections, being re-elected for 102 BC.|$|E

500|$|Screenwriter Ian Watson has speculated, [...] "Worldwide, A.I. {{was very}} {{successful}} (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> filmed faithfully by Spielberg." ...|$|E
500|$|As Chaplin was not {{a trained}} musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of {{professional}} composers, such as David Raksin, Raymond Rasch and Eric James, when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as Alfred Newman for City Lights. Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music {{should be given to}} the composers who worked with him, Raksin – who worked with Chaplin on Modern Times – stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process. This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano. These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin. According to film historian Jeffrey Vance, [...] "although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Frank Lloyd was casting for {{the part}} of high-society flapper Janet Oglethorpe, and more than 50 women, most with {{previous}} screen experience, auditioned. Bow reminisced: [...] "He had not found <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> and finally somebody suggested me to him. When I came into his office a big smile came over his face and he looked just tickled to death." [...] Lloyd told the press, [...] "Bow is the personification of the ideal aristocratic flapper, mischievous, pretty, aggressive, quick-tempered and deeply sentimental." [...] It was released on January 4, 1924.|$|E

[...] "Jim's {{the kind of}} director who knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> As an actor, I {{can find a way}} to get there if I know specifically what I'm going for, and Jim gives me that. The fact that he won't move on until <b>he's</b> got <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and try different things". [...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that".|$|R
2500|$|Nonetheless, White's {{photographs}} were not casually posed; he carefully controlled every detail in his scenes, sometimes even having special costumes created for his models. He {{saw in his}} mind <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> and then made it happen through his camera. It's been said that [...] "White is most significant {{in the history of}} photography because, in his early years, he redefined the nature of picture-making, creating a distinctly modern idiom for his own time…. He reduced his compositions to very simple elements of form, and by experimenting with principles of design derived largely from Whistler and Japanese prints, he created a person style that was unique for photography.|$|E
2500|$|The Dutch and English cavalry rode {{in groups}} of [...] "hit and run" [...] and were chased by the Spanish, until {{they came to the}} bridge, there turned and {{suddenly}} went on the attack as planned. Vere got <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> in a perfect ambush with his five companies of concealed but prepared cavalry and English soldiers ready to strike. The Spanish veterans were caught in the open and were suddenly surrounded and in the fierce fight that followed were thus badly mauled. Only a few Spanish managed to escape and retreated in disorder leaving Parma disheartened with the heavy casualties his tercios had suffered; sixty casualties, another 500 prisoners, 500 horses and also another two banners captured. This included the commander of the force Pedro Nicelli Francisco, along with his ensign carrying a banner of Christ on the Cross which was given to Vere as a prize. Vere's detached force suffered no more than two dead and ten wounded.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Washington fumed at {{the seeming}} procrastination. When Sherman {{proposed}} his March to the Sea, Ulysses S. Grant and Henry Halleck had objected {{to it on}} the grounds that Hood would use the opportunity to invade Tennessee. In response, Sherman airily indicated that this was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> and that if Hood [...] "continues to march North, all the way to Ohio, I will supply him with rations." [...] However, when the ever-confident Sherman disappeared into the heart of Georgia, Grant once again became concerned about an invasion of Kentucky or Ohio. Grant later said of the situation, [...] "If I had been Hood, I would have gone to Louisville and on north until I came to Chicago." [...] His concern doubtless reflected Abraham Lincoln's concern. Lincoln had little patience for slow generals and remarked of the situation, [...] "This seems like the McClellan and Rosecrans strategy of do nothing and let the rebels raid the country." ...|$|E

The official Emmerdale website states, [...] "Declan is a shrewd businessman who knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> and how to get it.

2500|$|Throughout his career, Ewbank {{was seen}} as a humble coach who had {{a good sense of humor}} and tried to stay out of the spotlight. He could also be harsh with his players, however. Before the 1958 {{championship}} game, he gave a speech telling his stars they needed to improve and had barely made the team. Unitas, he said, was obtained [...] "with a seventy-five-cent phone call" [...] and Ameche wasn't liked or wanted. Ewbank was not universally liked by his players. Second-string running back Jack Call later said the team won [...] "in spite of, not because of" [...] Ewbank. Other players saw him as overly easygoing, saying that while he was able to build teams up, he became too relaxed once he reached the top. [...] Hall of Famer Raymond Berry stated in his book All the Moves I Had [...] "What it amounts to is that Ewbank knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> his team to do and how to get them to do it well.. [...] Being under Weeb's system was the number one reason why Unitas and I had the careers we had." ...|$|E

[...] "It was the character I was drawing for and I learned what I needed to from the show and the scripts," [...] she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. [...] "Schwahn always knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches," [...] stated Ward. All of their communication was via e-mail. [...] "I wish I could say something more exciting, like [...] and I would chat about what Peyton would be drawing," [...] stated Ward, [...] "but the only time I ever spoke with her was when they were filming at my house in Wilmington (which oddly enough was Peyton’s house on the show.)" [...] Despite this, Ward said she did not mention to Burton that she was the artist behind Peyton's artwork.|$|E
