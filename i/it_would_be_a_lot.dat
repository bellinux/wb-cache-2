500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun, {{but the most important thing}} is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E
500|$|Usher held {{multiple}} private listening {{sessions for}} Looking 4 Myself. On April 27, 2012 he debuted the album in the off-broadway show Fuerza Bruta: Look Up, in Daryl Roth Theater in New York City. When speaking to MTV, he explained his reasoning for performing {{in the show}} [...] "It's not often that you're able to give somewhat of a visual or an emotional kind of basis of what your songs mean [...] I felt like, yeah, {{it would be a}} physical challenge, yeah <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> for me, but [...] at least try it, there are many times I'd seen the show and I'd only hoped that I would make it happen". Steven Horowitz of Rolling Stone commented that Usher [...] "theatrically sequenced the entirety of the project to strobing lights and choreographed moves". Horowitz also praised the singer's performance, concluding that [...] "the veteran entertainer reasserts himself as a master of rapturous dance fodder, capable of turning a room into a thumping rave with ease". Usher appeared on Saturday Night Live—hosted by Will Ferrell—where he performed the singles [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Climax". He performed both singles again, in the 2012 Today summer concert, being the opening act of the series. Usher performed [...] "Scream" [...] in the 2012 Billboard Music Awards; during the performance he wore a black suit, bowler hat and bow tie while dancing with a masked female, who later disappeared behind a cape and was replaced by a male dancer who mirrored Usher's dance routines.|$|E

You see, it will be fifteen feet wide by six feet, so that it will make a tidy little place. It would not cost more than the other way, not so much perhaps; for <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of trouble to get this bulkhead down, and then, you see, the second hand could have his bunk in here, on the lockers, and be quite separate." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2001, rumours were {{launched}} that Farmer was doing her first compilation.

Eventually, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> best of, preceded by {{the release of the}} new single [...] "Les Mots", the first international duet of Farmer. The best of was also entitled Les Mots and was released throughout Europe on 28 November 2001.|$|R

[...] "I should just do <b>it</b> because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good thing to do, and would {{save the lives of}} some of our grenadiers, who will, likely enough, lead the assault. Besides, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> adventure, like any other." ...|$|R

"'I {{understood}} about that,' said she, 'and {{father and}} I were both perfectly satisfied; for {{he said that}} if we had a good breeze we would not be long in reaching Calcutta; but we seem to have a breeze, and yet we don't go.' 'You'll notice,' said I, 'that the sails are not all set, and for some reason the wind does not serve. When the engines are mended, we shall probably go spinning along.' She looked as if she was trying to appear satisfied. 'Thank you, sir,' she said. 'I hope we may shortly proceed on our way, but in the meantime I shall not say anything to my father about this detention. I think he has not noticed it.' 'That would be very wise,' I replied, and as she turned toward the companionway I was wild to say to her that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better for her to stay on deck, and get some good fresh air, instead of cooping herself up in that close cabin; but I didn't know her well enough for that." ...|$|E

"Because," [...] replied Honker, [...] "Old Mother Nature {{has given}} him very short legs and has placed them so far back on his body that he can't keep his balance to walk, and has to use his wings and bill to help him over the ground. On shore he is about the most {{helpless}} thing you can imagine. But on water he is another fellow altogether. He's just as much at home under water as on top. My, how that fellow can dive! When he sees the flash of a gun he will get under water before the shot can reach him. That's where he {{has the advantage of}} us Geese. You know we can't dive. He could swim clear across this river under water if he wanted to, and he can go so fast under water that he can catch a fish. It is because his legs have been placed so far back that he can swim so fast. You know his feet are nothing but big paddles. Another funny thing is that he can sink right down in the water when he wants to, with nothing but his head out. I envy him that. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> easier for us Geese to escape the dreadful hunters if we could sink down that way." ...|$|E
60|$|Just as I {{got close}} up behind Jone, {{and was about}} to make a rush past him, his man turned into a side street. Of course I turned too, and then I put on steam, and, giving a laugh as I turned around to look at Jone, I charged on, {{intending}} to stop in a minute and have some fun in hearing what Jone had to say about it; but you may believe, ma'am, that I was amazed when I saw only a little way in front of me the bath-chair stand where we had hired our machines! And all the bath-chair men were standing there with their mouths wide open, staring at a woman running along the street, pulling an old bath-chair man in a bath-chair! For a second I felt like dropping the handle I held and making a rush for {{the front door of the}} hotel, which was right ahead of me; and then I thought, as now I was in for it, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better to put a good face on the matter, and not look as if I had done anything I was ashamed of, and so I just slackened speed and came up in fine style at the door of the Old Hall. Four or five of the bath-chair men came running across the street to know if anything had happened to the old party I was pulling, and he got out looking as ashamed as if he had been whipped by his wife.|$|E
