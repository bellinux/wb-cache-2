50|$|In 1972, the Nikon F2 was introduced. It {{had a more}} {{streamlined}} body, {{a better}} mirror-locking system, a top shutter speed of 1/2000 of a second and was introduced with its own proprietary, continually improving Photomic meter prism heads. This camera was constructed mechanically superior to the F, with some models using titanium for {{the top and bottom}} cover plates, and featured slower shutter speeds via the self-timer mechanism. All Nikon F and F2 Photomic prism heads coupled to the shutter speed dial of the respective camera, and also to the aperture ring via a coupling prong on the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>ring</b> of the lens. This design feature was incorporated into most Auto Nikkor lenses of that time. Nikon technicians can still install a coupling prong on D type Auto Nikkor lenses so that these newer lenses will fully couple and operate with the older Nikon camera bodies. This is not possible with the G type Auto Nikkor lenses and lenses with the DX designation.|$|E

50|$|The {{less common}} <b>ring</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is a later {{development}} intended {{to minimize the}} problems related to wave propagation through the diaphragm material. This design requires a radically different shape of phase plug, but radial slots and concentric rings may still play a part.|$|R
50|$|The Ellesmeroceratidae {{constitute}} a family within the cephalopod order Ellesmerocerida. They lived from the Upper Cambrian to the Lower Ordovician. They {{are characterized by}} straight and endogastric shells, often laterally compressed, so the dorso-ventral dimension is slightly greater than the lateral, with close spaced sutures having shallow lateral lobes and a generally large tubular ventro-marginal siphuncle with concave segments and irregularly spaced <b>diaphragms.</b> Connecting <b>rings</b> are thick and layered, externally straight but thickening inwardly with the maximum near {{the middle of the}} segment so as to leave concave depressions on internal siphuncle molds. Septal necks are typically orthochoanitic but vary in length from almost absent (achoanitic) to reaching halfway to the previous septum (hemichoanitic) and may even slope inwardly (loxochoanitic).|$|R
40|$|Anterior megalophthalmos, a rare {{hereditary}} disorder, is macrocornea (horizontal corneal diameter {{more than}} 13 mm) {{in association with}} enlarged lens-iris <b>diaphragm</b> and ciliary <b>ring.</b> One of the major challenging issues in the cataract surgery of these patients is preventing intraocular lens (IOL) malposition, because of probable large capsular bag. Several approaches have been selected by previous surgeons, such as, custom-made anterior chamber IOLs. In this study, we show a normal capsular bag diameter despite ciliary ring enlargement, with application of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UMB). We suggest that in cases of anterior megalophthalmos without phacodonesis, UBM could measure the actual size of the capsular bag and obviate {{the need for further}} procedures...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a fuel cell}} comprising components such as current diverters, solid polymer electrolytes {{in the form of}} <b>diaphragms,</b> gas distribution <b>rings</b> and power distributors as components, whereby all components are manufactured from a parent thermoplastic polymer dissolved in a solvent and that the parent polymer is modified for each of the components such that the current diverters (1) are electrically conductive, the diaphragms (4) are ion-conductive, the current distributors (3) are permeable to gas and electrically conductive and the gas distribution rings (2) are made of non-modifyable and/or electrically conductive parent polymer and that the components are joined without seals by means of a composite process...|$|R
50|$|The digital rectal {{examination}} (DRE; palpatio per anum, PPA) is {{a relatively}} simple procedure. The patient undresses, then is placed {{in a position where}} the anus is accessible (lying on the side, squatting on the examination table, bent over the examination table, or lying down with feet in stirrups).During this procedure, areas which can be palpated are: the bulb of the penis, the urogenital <b>diaphragm,</b> the anorectal <b>ring,</b> and other nearby anatomical landmarks. However, structures like the ureter (the two tubes that run from each kidney to the urinary bladder), and the urethra (which, in a male, is divided into three parts, and is inside the penis) cannot be palpated.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2015 the Obama {{administration}} {{stated that}} under the ACA, at least one form of all 18 FDA-approved methods of birth control for women must be covered without cost-sharing. These 18 methods include: sterilization surgery, surgical sterilization implant, implantable rod, copper intrauterine device, IUDs with progestin (a hormone), shot/injection, oral contraceptives (the pill), with estrogen and progestin, oral contraceptives with progestin only, oral contraceptives, known as extended or continuous use that delay menstruation, the patch, vaginal contraceptive <b>ring,</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> sponge, cervical cap, female condom, spermicide, emergency contraception (Plan B/morning-after pill), and emergency contraception (a different pill called Ella).

40|$|Four Arde conospheroid {{metallic}} diaphragms {{were tested}} at NASA {{to evaluate their}} capability {{for use in the}} orbit adjust propulsion subsystem (OAPS) of the Atmosphere Explorer spacecraft (AE's C, D, and E). The diaphragms will be used for positive propellant expulsion and spacecraft center of mass (c. m.) control. A leak-free cycle life capability of nine reversals was demonstrated. The diaphragms rolled smoothly from ring to ring in a predictable manner on the first reversal. Varying amounts of <b>diaphragm</b> cocking and <b>ring</b> skipping were observed on subsequent reversals. The diaphragm pressure differential did not exceed 10 psid during any reversal. Cycle life capability, reversal mode, and pressure differential were not affected by sudden reversals, environmental tests, or 18, 000 partial reversals. An expulsion efficiency of approximately 97 percent was demonstrated. The results of these tests show that metallic diaphragms can be used as an effective means of positive fuel expulsion; however, to achieve spacecraft c. m. control, the diaphragm must not be reversed prior to flight...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The films {{formed on}} the {{internal}} surface of the T- 10 tokamak vacuum chamber and on the stainless steel mirror-specimens located inside the T- 10 tokamak upper port during 2002 and 2003 experimental campaigns have been studied using X-ray diffraction analysis, Rutherford backscattering, scanning electron microscopy and elastic recoil detection method. Before the 2003 experimental campaign the graphite <b>ring</b> <b>diaphragm</b> {{was removed from the}} tokamak and a new movable limiter made of RGT- 91 graphite was installed. Mirror surfaces could be screened during chamber conditioning and exposed to plasma only during working discharges. The films formed on the chamber walls in both campaigns were “soft”, reddish-brown and had a multilayer structure. Few hundreds of thin (< 100 nm) layers were detected in cross sections of such films. X-ray diffraction analysis suggests that these films have amorphous structure and contain up to 10 % C- 60 (fullerens) with lattice constant of 12, 086 - 14, 055. D/C atomic ratio in the films increased from 0. 66 in 2002 to 1. 7 in 2003. The “soft ” film formation was caused by the plasma–wall interaction during the vacuum chamber conditioning. The films on mirrors were thinner than those on the vacuum chamber walls and, as a rule, semitransparent. They consisted of 10 - 12 layers formed during a campaign. Layer thickness depended on the total film thickness (on the exposition site). The surface structure of these films was homogeneous and smooth, without any signs of physical sputtering. The films deposited on the mirror surface exposed to plasma only during working discharge...|$|R
