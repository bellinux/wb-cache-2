5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> a key {{difference}} between the 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks {{is that in the}} thirties some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, which tend to be much more disruptive to international trade.|$|E

5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis was triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E

But individual matrix elements are frequently computed, especially for the Lie algebra (below).|$|E
5|$|All royal {{charters}} issued {{during the}} first six months of Mary's reign <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> she had lawfully inherited her father's crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch. They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples, Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Storm Jose formed {{so close}} to shore there was a lead time of less than 9hours on the {{tropical}} storm warning for the Veracruz coastline.

The advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> rainfall from Jose was the primary threat.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his four}} {{consecutive}} championships with Simeon, Parker (and Chicago's Simeon) {{were compared to}} McClain (and Peoria's Manual). Peoria's Journal Star <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> McClain was 32–0 as a starter in IHSA play because in the 1994–97 time period the IHSA was only divided into two classes. Thus, Manual had to wade through an 8-round tournament instead of the 7-round modern 4-class format. However, Simeon won 6 of its 7 games in its final championship by more than 10 points, while Manual only won 3 of its 8 by such a margin. In the postgame press conference, Simeon Coach Smith <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> his team had to endure the pressure of playing a national schedule that included games against elite teams in distant venues. Note, that with the 4-class system rather than the 2-class system of the past, the 2013 Class 3A IHSA champion was CPL runner-up Morgan Park, who split 2 neutral court 2013 games with Simeon. As noted above, Rose-era Simeon teams only won 2 championships in the 2-class era. Adding Parker's 55-11 start to a 33–1 junior year and a 30–3 senior season gives him a 118–15 legacy compared to Rose's 120–12.|$|E

He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations Peoples to continue to move forward with renewed hope.|$|E
5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, {{a leading}} Protestant Reformer in Switzerland, taught three {{distinct}} baptisms: water baptism, teaching baptism (having been educated about the Christian religion) and Spirit baptism. While full baptism included all three, Zwingli <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> the external baptisms {{of water and}} teaching could not provide salvation. The inner baptism of the Spirit alone could save because it conferred faith. According to Zwingli, the three baptisms could be given separately; Spirit baptism could occur first or last in the sequence.|$|E

MC 48 <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{conducted}} between late December 2012 to mid-January 2013 by Civic Science {{found that}} a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points. The polling firm, however, <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> the poll {{was not intended to}} provide two-way race numbers and that the polling (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who had entered the race the next day. According to the poll, blue-collar primary voters were more apt to support Ravenstahl while white-collar primary voters were more apt to support Peduto.|$|E

5|$|Second, Asch <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> {{independent}} {{thought and}} disagreement among group members is {{a cornerstone of}} group functioning. He believed that only by settling our differences with other group members can we actually understand the shortcomings of our own beliefs (Levine, 1999). This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale {{as the basis for}} his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.|$|E
