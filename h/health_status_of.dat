5|$|The {{worst of}} Linda's impact was in Vietnam, where 3,111 people were killed, and damage totaled $385 million (USD). Heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding, which {{damaged or destroyed}} about 200,000 houses and left about 383,000 people homeless. Widespread crop and transportation damage also occurred, the latter which impeded relief efforts. Several {{countries around the world}} sent relief aid, including medical teams, food, and clothing. However, the food supply and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. Linda later struck Thailand, causing flash flooding and at least 164 deaths. The storm also affected Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia to a lesser degree.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} identified basic {{supplies that}} it needed {{in response to the}} storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment. The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction. Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs ($360,000 USD) for immediate relief assistance. Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan. Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities, due to the poor state of the roads. After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 medical kits, and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, the food supply and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to a slowdown in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.|$|E

The results show that when social support is high the relationship between length of stay in exile and all three health outcomes is substantially reduced.

25|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2000, Iran ranks 58 in {{healthcare}} and 93 in health-system performance. In 2016, Bloomberg News ranked Iran 30th most efficient healthcare system ahead of United States and Brazil. The report shows life expectancy in Iran is 73 years and per capita spending on healthcare is $346. The <b>health</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> Iranians has improved {{over the last}} two decades. Iran has been able to extend public health preventive services through the establishment of an extensive Primary Health Care Network. As a result, child and maternal mortality rates have fallen significantly, and life expectancy at birth has risen remarkably. Infant (IMR) and under-five (U5MR) mortality have decreased to 28.6 and 35.6 per 1,000 live births respectively in 2000, compared to an IMR of 122 per 1,000 and a U5MR of 191 per 1,000 in 1970.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the {{national}} health ministries of the listed countries reviewed the pertinent studies for causal links among silicone-gel breast implants and systemic and auto-immune diseases. The collective conclusion {{is that there is}} no evidence establishing a causal connection between the implantation of silicone breast implants and either type of disease. The affected women complained of systemic disease manifested as fungal, neurologic, and rheumatologic ailments. The Danish study Long-term <b>Health</b> <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants (2004) reported that women who had breast implants for an average of 19 years were no more likely to report an excessive number of rheumatic disease symptoms than would the women of the control group. The follow-up study Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update (2006) reported a decreased standardized mortality ratio and an increased risk of lung cancer death among breast implant patients, than among patients for other types of plastic surgery; the mortality rate differences were attributed to tobacco smoking. The study Mortality Among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants (2006), about some 25,000 women with breast implants, reported a 43 per cent lower rate of breast cancer among them than among the general populace, and a lower-than-average risk of cancer.|$|E

The study examined different factors that might influence night shift nurses towards obesity, incorporating other research on obesity, nurses, night shift hazards, etc. Physical and biological factors that attributed to nurses working night shifts were also discussed. Research was conducted at a hospital in Southern California and included 17 day shift nurses and 51 night shift nurses as respondents. A self-report survey was used to collect quantitative data related to the <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> <b>of</b> night and day shift nurses including their Body Mass Index (BMI), eating habits and food intakes, medical history, and supplement usage. SPSS was used for the analyses, and t-tests and chi-square measures compared day and night shift nurses on factors related to health. The study did not reveal significant differences between night shift nurses and day shift nurses based on BMI, exercise levels, food intakes, etc., presumably due to the limited sample size. However, night shift nurses reported a higher percentage of hemorrhoids, and day shift nurses reported a higher occurrence of hypertension.

For instance, an NIH-funded program called the Vermedx Diabetes Information System maintained a registry of laboratory values of diabetic adults in Vermont and northern New York State in the US with several years of laboratory results on thousands of patients. The data included measures of blood sugar control (glycosolated hemoglobin A1C), cholesterol, and kidney function (serum creatinine and urine protein), and were used to monitor the quality of care at the patient, practice, and population levels. [...] Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. Out of control test results generated a letter to the patient suggesting they take action with their medical provider. Tests that were overdue generated reminders to have testing performed. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the <b>health</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the population. Clinical and economic evaluations of the system, including a large randomized clinical trial, demonstrated improvements in adherence to practice guidelines and reductions in the need for emergency room and hospital services as well as total costs per patient. The system has been commercialized and distributed to physicians, insurers, employers and others responsible for the care of chronically ill patients. It is now being expanded to other conditions such as chronic kidney disease.|$|E
