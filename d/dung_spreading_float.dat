50|$|The {{pressures}} {{associated with}} diffuse pollution are important throughout the basin {{due to the}} high density of both agricultural lands and livestock farming occurring in certain areas in the basin. Livestock farming includes pig farms and poultry, with the <b>dung</b> <b>spread</b> directly to the land. Another main issue concerning diffuse pollution is the existence of several mines throughout the basin. Although {{some of them have}} direct discharges in water courses, the metals contained in the soils extracted can also reach surface waters through runoff. Finally, the disposal of solid wastes and wastes from agricultural activity in the river banks is another pressure that significantly contributes to the organic pollution of the water.|$|R

25|$|The {{sweet potato}} was grown in Polynesia before western exploration. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD, and current {{thinking}} {{is that it was}} brought to central Polynesia around 700 AD, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, and spread across Polynesia to Hawaii and New Zealand from there. It is possible, however, that South Americans brought it to the Pacific, although this is unlikely as it was the Polynesians who had a strong maritime tradition and not the native South Americans. The theory that the plant could <b>spread</b> by <b>floating</b> seeds across the ocean is not supported by evidence. Another point is that the sweet potato in Polynesia is the cultivated Ipomoea batatas, which is generally spread by vine cuttings and not by seeds.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{contact between}} the two {{cultures}} is proved by the dispersion of the sweet potato: this staple of the pre-contact Polynesian diet is of South American origin, {{and there is no}} evidence that its seed could <b>spread</b> by <b>floating</b> across the ocean. Either Polynesians traveled to South America and back, or South American balsa rafts drifted to Polynesia, possibly unable to make a return trip because of their less developed navigational skills and more fragile boats.

The Polynesian name for the small islet of Sala y Gómez (Manu Motu Motiro Hiva, [...] "Bird's islet on the way to a far away land") east of [...] Easter Island has also been seen as a hint that South America was known before European contacts. Further complicating the situation is that the word Hiva ("far away land") was also the name of the islanders' legendary home country. Inexplicable insistence on an eastern origin for the first inhabitants was unanimous among the islanders in all early accounts.|$|R

60|$|It is not {{probable}} that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise {{time of his}} bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails <b>spread,</b> <b>floated</b> across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.|$|R

40|$|Over a 9 -year period (1993 – 2001), the land-water {{width of}} a papyrus fringe on the {{southern}} shore of Lake Naivasha, Kenya, varied between 40 and 60 m. Increases in width via rhizome spreading into open water followed the 1997 / 1998 El Niño flood when water depths rose by about 2 m. Germination of papyrus seeds also responded to water depth with a mean ± S. E. rate in experiments of 23 ± 6 % after 21 days when water level was 5 cm below the sediment surface. No germination occurred when sediment was flooded or allowed to desiccate. Rhizome <b>spreading</b> from <b>floating</b> mats appeared to be favoured by deep water with seedling spread favoured on newly inundated, low-gradient slopes in shallow water. Although natural regenerative capacity was influenced by water depth, the height, density, biomass and chemical content of papyrus were not. Total average biomass along a land-water transect was 6950 ± 860 g m− 2 which was large in relation to nutrient and mineral contents. Culms contained 0. 47 ± 0. 14 % N and 0. 06 ± 0. 05 % P and rhizomes 0. 71 ± 0. 21 % and 0. 10 ± 0. 06 %.

40|$|ObjectiveAfter {{complete}} pulmonary metastasectomy of colorectal lung metastases, {{tumor recurrence}} {{at the site}} of former resection develops in some patients. Well-described risk factors for local recurrence in the lung include incomplete resection and aerogenous <b>spread</b> of <b>floating</b> cancer cell clusters. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the distribution and frequency of satellite cancer cells or clusters in resected tissue to deduce recommendations for safety margins in the future. MethodsSeventeen colorectal metastases from 10 patients were processed. Evaluation for pattern of growth, satellite cancer cells, and inflammatory reaction at the surface of the metastases was performed on 102 sections with CDX 2 and cytokeratin 20 stains. The distance between the surface of the nodule and the satellite cancer cell was measured for each satellite and statistically evaluated. ResultsAs a pattern of growth, interstitial spread, inflammatory reaction, and lymphangitic spread were observed in 41. 2 %, 35. 3 %, and 23. 5 %, respectively. A total of 205 satellite cancer cells were identified in 16 of 17 metastases with a mean distance to the nodule of 0. 99 ± 0. 85 mm (range, 0. 06 – 6. 43 mm). The percentages of satellite tumor cells that are likely to be found within 1. 59 mm, 3. 43 mm, and 7. 4 mm around the nodule are 68. 27 %, 95. 5 %, and 99. 73 %, respectively. ConclusionsSatellite tumor cells, a potential source for local recurrence, are found in a high number around colorectal lung metastases.

For dry application no obvious difference was observed. Lapied et al.[8] also compared the effect of earthworm exposure via spiked food and via soil, and attributed the absence of effects in the tests with spiked food to avoidance behavior. We did not observe avoidance of spiked food in our experiments, even though the substance concentrations in the spiked food were higher (1272 mg/kg dm for wet application compared to 100 mg/kg dm in the study discussed above[8]). Feeding was implemented by <b>spreading</b> <b>dung</b> on the soil surface as recommended in the test guideline[21], thus the removal of dung by feeding was easy to verify. The biomass increase in adult worms was also a useful indicator of food uptake, and this was comparable for our spiked food and spiked soil experiments.

Apparently the Mid-Atlantic ridge remains a barrier even at that shallow depth, since only one float from either side drifted across the ridge. After a few years, floats have circulated through most of the western basin (west of the Mid-Atlantic ridge), between 30 ° and 45 °N; while east of the ridge and south of the Azores Plateau, floats advected east of the Great Meteor et al.

40|$|Malaysian {{authorities}} implemented {{controls on}} international capital flows {{late in the}} Asian crisis, {{when most of the}} portfolio outflows had already occurred. The exchange rate had depreciated sharply and was fixed at an undervalued level, making further capital flight unlikely. The turnaround in the stock market, the return of positive GDP growth, the building of reserves, and the relaxation of interest rates all coincided with the imposition of controls. But the same changes took place in other crisis countries that did not follow the same control policies. However, the controls provided insurance against the consequences of possible further disturbances. They created a breathing space for making needed reforms, and the authorities made good use of this time, stabilizing the financial system and pushing ahead with regulatory and supervisory reform for the financial sector and capital markets - a prerequisite for fully liberalizing the capital account. Malaysia incurred a cost: an additional 300 basis point <b>spread</b> paid on <b>floating</b> rate debt for a period after the controls were instituted. But the exit strategy has so far not resulted in lasting flight of portfolio capital.

40|$|Parameters of {{ecosystem}} structure and functioning were analyzed in three hypereutrophic lagoons of Ca'Pisani {{during the season}} of 2001. Lagoons are situated at wetlands of the NW Adriatic {{in the vicinity of}} the Porto Viro, Po River delta. They are associated with intensive fish culture enterprise and accept its wastewater. In June, the lagoons were found overloaded with the biomass of nitrophylic algae. At the end of July, a bloom of potentially toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense occurred. Soon, it was supplanted by the picocyanobacterial assemblage, which arrived into the lagoons from the coastal Adriatic via the Marine channel. Wet biomass of this new picocyanobacterial bloom arrived in September attained 30 - 60 g m- 3. Decrease of white disk water transparency down to 30 - 40 cm resulted in a gross mortality of macrophytes accompanied by <b>spreading</b> of <b>floating</b> saprobic alga Enteromorpha. Phytoplankton was dominated in June to July by small mixotrophic phytoflagellates with a wet biomass of 200 - 1300 mg m- 3. Number of bacterioplankton ranged between 4 and 7 × 10 + 6 ml- 1 and its wet biomass between 1. 4 and 2. 1 g m- 1. Its maximum of 18 × 10 + 6 ml- 1 was observed in late August, when the mortality of macrophytes had occurred. Zooplankton and zoobenthos were found depleted in the lagoons especially during the blooms. Diel fluctuations of dissolved oxygen in the lagoons in June to July reached 150 - 200 % of saturation. Photosynthetic oxygen production ranged between 15 and 30 g O 2 m - 2 d- 1. Water column deoxygenation rate was 1 - 1. 5 mg O 2 l- 1 h- 1. Total photosynthesis production reached 3 - 8 g C m- 2 d- 1 by the share of phytoplankton 5 - 15 %. Hyper-accumulation of total phosphorus in the water column and of toxic labile sulfides in the bottom sediments was documented. Content of inorganic phosphorus in water remained unusually high even by its intensive uptake by microplankton. The PO 4 P uptake rate measured with 32 P-label ranged during the bloom of picocyanobacteria between 10 and 50 nM l- 1 min- 1, and the residence time of PO 4 P between 15 and 50 min.

5000|$|A {{constant}} maturity {{credit default swap}} (CMCDS) {{is a type of}} credit derivative product, similar to a standard credit default swap (CDS). Addressing CMCDS typically requires prior understanding of credit default swaps. In a CMCDS the protection buyer makes periodic payments to the protection seller (these payments constitute the premium leg), and in return receives a payoff (protection or default leg) if an underlying financial instrument defaults. Differently from a standard CDS, the premium leg of a CMCDS does not pay a fixed and pre-agreed amount but a <b>floating</b> <b>spread,</b> using a traded CDS as a reference index. More precisely, given a pre-assigned time-to-maturity, at any payment instant of the premium leg the rate that is offered is indexed at a traded CDS spread on the same reference credit existing in that moment for the pre-assigned time-to-maturity (hence the name [...] "{{constant maturity}}" [...] CDS). The default or protection leg is mostly the same as the leg of a standard CDS. Often CMCDS are expressed in terms of participation rate. The participation rate may be defined as the ratio between the present value of the premium leg of a standard CDS with the same final maturity and the present value of the premium leg of the constant maturity CDS. CMCDS may be combined with CDS on the same entity to take only spread risk and not default risk on an entity. Indeed, as the default leg is the same, buying a CDS and selling a CMCDS or vice versa will offset the default legs and leave only the difference in the premium legs, that are driven by spread risk. Valuation of CMCDS has been explored by Damiano Brigo (2004) and Anlong Li (2006) ...|$|R
40|$|South Africa has a {{long history}} battling the {{establishment}} and <b>spread</b> of invasive <b>floating</b> macrophytes. The negative consequences of these are costly both economically and ecologically. They form dense mats on the water's surface that deplete resources such as light and oxygen to the submerged community, which creates anoxic conditions, reduces biodiversity and limits access to freshwater. The past thirty years of South African invasive plant research and the implementation of nationwide biological control programmes has led to widespread control of these species in many degraded systems. Such initiatives are aimed at restoring access to potable freshwater and increasing native biodiversity. However, in recent years, where there has been a decline in floating invasive plant populations, an increase in the establishment and spread of submerged invasive plant species has been observed. Species such as Brazilian waterweed (Egeria densa (Planch.) (Hydrocharitaceae)) and Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum (L.) (Haloragaceae)) have been recorded in South African freshwater systems, posing significant threats to aquatic ecosystems. This thesis proposes that the biological control of floating invasive plants, which occurs in numerous dams and rivers nationwide, is the catalyst of a regime shift from floating invasive to submerged invasive plant dominance. Regime shifts are large and often sudden changes in the key structure and functioning of ecosystems, and studies into their occurrence and driving mechanisms broadens understanding of community structures and can guide effective resource management. In order to explore the existence of this new regime shift, a multi-platform approach using controlled experiments and ecological modelling techniques was employed. A model system was created consisting of a floating invasive (Pistia stratiotes L. (Araceae)), a submerged invasive (E. densa) and an ecologically analogous submerged native plant species (Lagarosiphon major (Ridl.) Moss (Hydrocharitaceae)). A suite of experiments was conducted to explore the interactions between the floating and submerged plants under varying regimes of floating plant biological control and levels of nutrient loading. These experiments revealed a competitive advantage of the invasive E. densa over the native L. major that increased by 86 % under heavy nutrient loading. The relative growth rate and accumulated biomass of E. densa was significantly higher for plants grown in the presence of biologically controlled P. stratiotes (compared to insect free plants). This demonstrates a high capacity for the invasive E. densa to capitalise on resources made newly available through the biological control of the floating plants. In contrast, the native L. major fared poorly when grown {{in the presence of the}} floating P. stratiotes, regardless of applied biological control measures. The experimental observations were then used to parameterise a mathematical model, built to provide a holistic understanding of the individually assessed interactions which work together as the driving mechanisms underpinning the newly identified regime shift. This thesis utilised a multi-platform approach to build the first body of evidence in support of a newly recognised regime shift between floating invasive and submerged invasive plant dominance, as driven by biological control. The results indicate that a reduction in the nutrient loading of South Africa's freshwater systems will reduce negative impacts of submerged invasive macrophytes, whilst increasing system resilience against future invasion. The evidence presented has the potential to better inform management of South Africa's freshwater systems and highlights the importance of integrating multi-trophic interactions when considering future invasive plant management. This research also opens up a multitude of possibilities for studies into submerged plant invasion mechanisms and resilience of native macrophyte communities in South Africa, and further afield...|$|R
