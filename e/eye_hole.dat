He retired at age 34, an age considered to be [...] "still in athletic prime" [...] for goaltenders. This incident, as well as the ending of Gerry Desjardins' career when a puck struck his eye in 1977, led many NHL goalies to switch from fibreglass facemasks toward the cage and helmet style, and resulted in many amateur and junior leagues banning fibreglass masks altogether, mandating the helmet/cage combo.|$|E
5000|$|The {{versions}} of the game suffer from a fatal flaw in which the scoring mechanism is easily exploited. A [...] "hit" [...] in a particular scoring hole may be registered simply by inserting a finger (or any other appropriately sized object) into said hole. It is thus possible to repeatedly insert one's finger into the bulls <b>eye</b> <b>hole</b> during a game session and achieve an unrealistically high score. Though this could be (partially) remedied by forcing the scores to register only after the ball has traversed a certain length of chute specific to each hole, Hasbro (or their successors) have yet to implement this change to the game. Concluding, any high scores you may encounter if playing a used version of the game {{should be treated as}} suspect.|$|E

50|$|In 1909, Nathan Shigon of New York City {{invented a}} monocular optometer {{with a range}} of +0.25 to +6.00 diopters, {{consisting}} of a mechanism where a disc of low-powered lenses advanced a second disc of higher power lenses automatically with each rotation, as in a modern phoropter. There is no evidence this was ever manufactured, but in 1915 he filed for a patent for a binocular version of this same optometer, and called it the Ski-Optometer, so named for its usefulness in doing skiascopy. This was manufactured by Wm. F. Reimold of Philadelphia. It included a Stevens Phorometer for measuring phorias, and a disc of auxiliary spherical lenses on the back, giving it a range of -12.00 to +12.00. To extend the range, there were clips on the front of each <b>eye</b> <b>hole</b> for the insertion of hand held sphere or cylinder trial lenses, with a mechanism to rotate the axis with the thumb. It weighed 2 lb. 3 oz. Around 1916 Michael Woolf, also of New York City, bought him out and added his own invention, an innovative battery of cylinder lenses, ranging from -0.25 to -2.00, to the device, as well as Risley prisms for each eye. Maddox rods were optional. It weighed 3 lb. 13 oz. Around 1924 the patents and rights were transferred to General Optical Company of Mount Vernon, NY, which had been making a much larger, heavier and more solidly encased instrument, called the Genothalmic Refractor, since around 1920, using Woolf's 1917 patent number, and with a user's manual dated 1921. This instrument had a range of +17.75 to - 22.50, and up to -3.75 cylinder, Maddox rods, Risley prisms, and a Steven's phorometer. It weighed 7 pounds 5 ounces, and unlike all earlier devices of this kind, it hung from a horizontal mounting bar instead of being supported from the bottom. Like the Woolf, it had no Jackson cross-cylinders at first, so a separate hand-held one was required. Late models of the Genothalmic were fitted with JCC's. General Optical sold out to Shuron Optical of Geneva, NY in 1927, which sold the refractor until the late 1930s. A refined and improved version of the Genothalmic Refrator was manufactured in London starting around 1932, and sold in the UK by S. R. Stearman, S. Pulzer & Son Ltd., and others, as the British Refracting Unit (B.R.U.).|$|E
50|$|Also in 1909, Henry DeZeng got {{a patent}} for what looks remarkably like a modern phoropter, but the patent {{illustrations}} look {{nothing like the}} manufactured product, which was introduced around 1915--the DeZeng Phoro-Optometer model 570. This was a device produced in Camden, New Jersey, which contained a battery of convex lenses for each eye, a battery of concave lenses for each eye, and auxiliary lenses which gave it a total power range of +15.75 to -19.75, {{as well as a}} Maddox rod and Risley prism for each eye, and a Steven's phorometer. There were no cylindrical lenses, so testing for astigmatism required the use of manual trial-lenses, for which there were rotating holders on the front of each <b>eye</b> <b>hole,</b> and there were stationary ones on the backs as well. Cross-cylinders were optional, but they did not flip like a Jackson cross cylinder, they rotated in the same plane, so they were probably meant for the near point cross-cylinder test for reading. It weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. Around 1920 an improved model, No. 574, was introduced, reduced in size but with the same range (lenses reduced from 1 inch to ¾ inch). The forehead rest was removed, and the rear trial lens clips were replaced with rubber eye guards. It weighed 2 lbs. 12 oz. In 1922, DeZeng replaced No. 574 with No. 584, and shortened the name to Phoroptor. This device became so popular that its name became genericized, though often spelled phoropter. The Phoroptor was smaller (lenses reduced again, to 9/16 inch diameter) and more precisely made than the 574, but with a similar power range, and the front clips for hand-held trial lenses were removed and replaced with batteries of cylinder lenses ranging from -0.25 to -4.75. The Steven's phorometer was dropped, and there were no Jackson cross cylinders. It weighed 2 lb. 8 oz. In 1925, American Optical Co. bought DeZeng, and in 1927 introduced No. 588, the AO Wellsworth DeZeng Phoroptor, which was slightly larger; the lenses were increased to 11/16 inch and it weighed 3 lb. 2 oz. This was the first in the DeZeng/AO line to hang from a horizontal mounting bar, the earlier ones were supported from a bar below it. This phoroptor was unique in that it was calibrated in 1/8 diopter steps throughout its whole range. In 1934, AO introduced No. 589, the Additive Effective Power Phoroptor, once again enlarged and improved. The lenses were increased to ¾ inch diameter, the permanent size, and the unit was much more massive, with a weight of 7 lb. 9 oz., and with a range of +16.87 to -19.12 and -6.00 cylinder, with auxiliary lenses to increase these to +18.87/-21.12/-8.00. All these models resembled the original DeZeng model in design, but No. 590 of 1948 was a completely re-designed device, much larger and heavier, and more modern. It weighed 10 lbs. 7 oz. This was followed by another complete re-design in 1956, the RxMaster, which became the prototype of all modern phoropters, and was updated to the Ultramatic RxMaster in 1967, which is the current model. AO sold their phoroptor division to Reichert in 1982, who still makes the Ultramatic.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} {{for the detection of}} the iris center. Starting from a learning base that only contains people in frontal view and looking in front of them, our model (based on 2 : 5 D Active Appearance Models (AAM)) is capable of capturing the iris movements for both people in frontal view and with different head poses. We merge an iris model and a local eye model where holes are put in the place of the white-iris region. The iris texture slides under the <b>eye</b> <b>hole</b> permitting to synthesize and thus analyze any gaze direction. We propose a multi-objective optimization technique to deal with large head poses. We compared our method to a 2 : 5 D AAM trained on faces with different gaze directions and showed that our proposition outperforms it in robustness and accuracy of detection specifically when head pose varies and with subjects wearing eyeglasses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe propose 3 D Multi-Texture Active Appearance Model (3 D MT-AAM) {{where the}} skin and the eyeball are {{considered}} as two decorrelated objects contrary to classical AAM where the eye region is a continuous part of the face mesh.

We compare the model with previous work that models the iris as a simple 2 D texture and with a classical method and we obtain better results. In addition we propose a method for back-projecting the search result of our model from the model frame to the real image frame using barycentric coordinates. On the other hand, we explore different optimizations namely: Gradient descent (GD), Simplex, and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize our model and we compare {{the performance of the}} system. We obtain the best performance using GA. However with Simplex we improve the computation time, with a slightly lower performance...|$|E

40|$|Indwelling {{urethral}} catheters {{are both}} important and convenient biomedical devices for many people. They provide incontinent and/or paraplegic patients an involuntary method of emptying their bladder. The catheters are inserted through the patient’s urethra to the posterior {{portion of the}} bladder. A balloon is inflated with water to keep it secure and in place. The tip of the catheter has an <b>eye</b> <b>hole</b> exposing the lumen of the catheter. The urine in the bladder drains through the lumen {{and out of the}} body into a collection bag. Catheters can potentially have 2 problems. First, they are prone to calcium/magnesium phosphate buildup on the surface and lumen of the catheter. This could obstruct the flow of urine making emptying the bladder difficult or impossible. Buildup {{on the surface of the}} catheter could also make removal of the catheter painful or even impossible without surgery. Secondly, catheters provide bacteria a route to travel to the kidneys to cause urinary tract infections. This could lead to long term problems such as chronic kidney disease. The primary culprit for these infections is the bacterium Proteus mirabilis. This bacteria has the ability to swarm on the catheter surface and travel to the bladder. It then secretes an enzyme called urease. This enzyme catalyzes a hydrolysis reaction converting urea into ammonia which eventually leads to nucleation of calcium and magnesium phosphate which can adhere to the catheter. The bacteria then differentiates into a swarmer bacteria and travels along the catheter surface to the kidneys where it causes urinary tract infections. The bacteria can easily adhere to hydrophilic surfaces and express factors to adhere to hydrophobic surfaces. This research will aim to prevent these problems through the use of antibacterial coatings on the surface and lumen of the catheters. Different techniques were tested such as disrupting the bacterial membrane as well as inhibiting bacterial attachment altogether. These coatings should extend the indwelling time of catheters significantly. By inhibiting the bacteria, urinary tract infections and catheter encrustation will be significantly reduced compared to the current catheter designs. Surface characterization techniques and antibacterial assays were run to test the efficacy of the coatings. Of six coatings that were tested, two were able to inhibit biofilm formation significantly better than the current commercially used method of silicone according to a crystal violet assay. One of the coatings, 11 -mercapto-trimethylamine (11 -MTA) was able to permeabalize very well killing over 90 % of all bacteria on the surface. These results showed that amphiphillic cationic molecules are lethal to the membranes of gram-negative bacteria. During this research, a long term, and effective method was developed for preventing urinary tract infections and catheters encrustations for patients who use long term urethral catheters...|$|E
