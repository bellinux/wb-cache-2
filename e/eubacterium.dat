5|$|Complicating {{factors include}} {{claims that the}} {{relationship}} between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and <b>eubacterium,</b> which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E

40|$|The halobacteria and the {{photosynthetic}} {{members of}} the <b>eubacteria</b> have previously been classified in two separate urkingdoms [...] the archaebacteria and the <b>eubacteria,</b> respectively. They {{were thought to be}} no more closely related to each other than they each were to the eukaryotes. In accord with this earlier classification, photosynthesis was thought to have originated twice by independent events [...] once within the <b>eubacteria</b> and once within the archaebacteria. In this paper, however, using three-dimensional ribosome structure as a probe of evolutionary divergences, we show that the <b>eubacteria</b> and the halobacteria are more closely related to each other than they are to any other known organisms. The simplest interpretation of our data is that all extant photosynthetic cells are descended from a single common ancestor that possessed a primeval photosynthetic mechanism. Numerous data on the occurrence of related biochemical processes in halobacteria and <b>eubacteria</b> support this theory. Essential components of the photosynthetic apparatus, such as carotenoids, are present in both halobacteria and in <b>eubacteria,</b> including the nonphotosynthetic <b>eubacteria,</b> suggesting that photosynthesis could be a primitive property of both groups. Our data indicate that together the <b>eubacteria</b> and the halobacteria form a monophyletic group for which we propose the name "photocytes. " If other techniques of phylogenetic analysis confirm this evolutionary tree, we propose that the photocytes be given urkingdom status...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} microorganisms, {{including}} gram-negative and gram-positive <b>eubacteria,</b> actinomycetes, yeasts, and filamentous fungi, were tested for their sensitivity to cadmium (Cd).

40|$|ABSTRACT Compositional {{analyses}} of nucleic acids and proteins have {{shed light on}} possible origins of living cells. In this work, rigorous compositional {{analyses of}} ∼ 5000 plasma mem-brane lipid constituents of 273 species in the three life domains (archaea, <b>eubacteria,</b> and eukaryotes) revealed a remarkable statistical paradox, indicating symbiotic origins of eukary-otic cells involving <b>eubacteria.</b> For lipids common to plasma membranes of the three do-mains, the number of carbon atoms in <b>eubacteria</b> {{was found to be}} similar to that in eukary-otes. However, mutually exclusive subsets of same data show exactly the opposite—the number of carbon atoms in lipids of eukaryotes was higher than in <b>eubacteria.</b> This statistical paradox, called Simpson’s paradox, was absent for lipids in archaea and for lipids not com-mon to plasma membranes of the three domains. This indicates the presence of interaction(s) and/or association(s) in lipids forming plasma membranes of <b>eubacteria</b> and eukaryotes but not for those in archaea. Further inspection of membrane lipid structures affecting physico-chemical properties of plasma membranes provides the first evidence (to our knowledge) on the symbiotic origins of eukaryotic cells based on the “third front ” (i. e., lipids) in addition to the growing compositional data from nucleic acids and proteins...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{alkalinity}} and hypertonicity on the motile behaviour of Leptospira interrogans (bzflexa) B I 6 were observed, quantified, {{and compared}} with effects previously shown by similar factors on the motility of <b>eubacteria.</b> Leptospira interrogans tolerated relatively {{high concentrations of}} hydroxide ions. Motility {{similar to that in}} controls was observed at pH values up to 9 - 8; but at pH 10. 0 motility declined sharply with time of exposure, and there was structural altera-tion, visible as a blebbing of the cell envelope. Unlike the behaviour of <b>eubacteria,</b> immobilization of L. interrogans induced by hydroxide ions could not be reversed by lowering the pH. It is suggested that by restricting entry of hydroxide ions, the cell envelope protects its motility apparatus from adverse effects. Leptospira interrogans was completely immobilized in 0. 5 M and I so M-sucrose solutions. Unlike the <b>eubacteria,</b> leptospires were incapable of spontaneous re-version to motile forms and resumption of motility was dependent on both concentration and time of exposure to sucrose. Deuterium oxide did not affect movement, suggesting that even though leptospire endoflagella and the exoflagella of <b>eubacteria</b> are analogous, the motile behaviour of L. interrogans is significantly different from that of <b>eubacteria...</b>|$|R
