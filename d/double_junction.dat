5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing loops and sidings removed, except the marshalling yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train could be on the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The <b>double</b> <b>junction</b> at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E

As the <b>double</b> Holliday <b>junction</b> model was the first posited in order to explain this phenomenon, various versions of the SDSA model were later proposed to explain heteroduplex DNA configurations that did not match predictions of the <b>double</b> Holliday <b>junction</b> model. Studies in S. cerevisiae found that non-crossover products appear earlier than <b>double</b> Holliday <b>junctions</b> or crossover products, which challenged the previous notion that both crossover and non-crossover products are produced by <b>double</b> Holliday <b>junctions.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>double</b> <b>{{junction}}</b> is {{a railway}} junction where a double track railway splits into two double track lines.

500|$|A short passing loop {{was built}} at Llangefni station in 1877 for engines to run round, but at only [...] long {{it was not}} of much use for {{allowing}} passenger trains to pass each other. A refuge siding was built for freight trains at Llanerchymedd in 1878, along with an engine shed in Amlwch. In 1882, new station buildings replaced the basic wooden sheds at Holland Arms, Llangwyllog and Rhosgoch, as well as development of the junction at Gaerwen into a full <b>double</b> <b>junction,</b> and a second signal cabin built there. An extended Amlwch station received a canopy by 1884. The staff and ticket system was supplemented with block working in 1886, and was replaced with the electric staff system in 1894.|$|E

40|$|Bloom's {{syndrome}} is a hereditary cancer-predisposition disorder resulting from mutations in the BLM gene. In humans, BLM encodes {{one of five}} members of the RecQ helicase family. One function of BLM is to act in concert with topoisomerase IIIalpha (TOPO IIIalpha) to resolve recombination intermediates containing <b>double</b> Holliday <b>junctions</b> by a process called <b>double</b> Holliday <b>junction</b> dissolution, herein termed dissolution. Here, we show that dissolution is highly specific for BLM among human RecQ helicases and critically depends upon a functional HRDC domain in BLM. We show that the HRDC domain confers DNA structure specificity, and is required for the efficient binding to and unwinding of <b>double</b> Holliday <b>junctions,</b> but not for the unwinding of a simple partial duplex substrate. Furthermore, we show that lysine- 1270 of BLM, which resides in the HRDC domain and is predicted {{to play a role in}} mediating interactions with DNA, is required for efficient dissolution...|$|R

Two different relaxation processes are found in the correlations between spin polarized tunneling currents; low frequency spin fluctuations and high frequency charge fluctuations. Spin accumulation in strongly asymmetric junctions is shown to lead to a negative differential resistance. We also show that large spin noise activated in the range of negative differential resistance gives rise to a significant enhancement of the current noise.

30|$|In conclusion, {{we built}} up a <b>double</b> PN <b>junction</b> {{equivalent}} circuit to fit J–V curves of P–I–N planar structure heterojunction PSCs. The new method focuses {{on the relationship between}} the diode ideal factor and the carrier recombination from the interface defects. By varying Cl− content in the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite film, we found that the value of m drastically diminished (decreased) with the perovskite film quality improvement. In order to quantitatively analyze the correlation mechanism of dark current under different bias voltages, a new equation based on the <b>double</b> PN <b>junction</b> equivalent circuit has been proposed to analyze the dark current–voltage curve. Consequently, carrier recombination and loss reduction could be reflected in R sh and J r. The carrier transmission could be reflected on the parameter J d. Based on the <b>double</b> PN <b>junction</b> equivalent circuit, the J–V curve in light and in dark could be fitted, respectively, helping us analyze the working mechanism and improve the efficiency of planar PSCs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The SAIL (self-aligned in-line) {{technique}} {{has been applied}} to the preparation of ul-trasmall metallic tunnel junctions.
