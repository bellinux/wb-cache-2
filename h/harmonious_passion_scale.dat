40|$|Passion is {{a strong}} {{inclination}} toward an activity that people like and find important, characterized by <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and obsessive passion. This study aims to provide a psychometric evaluation of the Italian version of the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> developed by Vallerand and colleagues, applied to work. To assess the factorial validity of the Italian scale, an exploratory factor analysis (N= 101) and a confirmatory factor analysis (N= 234), along with correlations to assess the validity, were performed. The exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure, {{in line with the}} original study, and one item from the <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> dimension was deleted. The confirmatory factor analysis that was conducted confirmed the two-factor structure. Results suggest that the Italian version of the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> applied to work can be used in research, allowing to detect an important individual factor influencing well-being and the quality of working life...|$|R

40|$|The Dualistic Model of Passion (Vallerand, 2010) regards passion as {{a strong}} {{inclination}} toward a self-defining activity that one loves, values, and in which one invests {{a substantial amount of}} time and energy. The model proposes two distinct types of <b>passion,</b> <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive, that predict adaptive and less adaptive outcomes, respectively. We hypothesized that individuals relatively high on explicit self-esteem would experience higher levels of <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion,</b> given their implementation of relatively adaptive self-regulatory strategies. Individuals relatively low on implicit self-esteem, on the other hand, would experience higher levels of obsessive passion, given their ego fragility and defensiveness. Participants completed the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale,</b> the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and the self-esteem Implicit Association Task.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{relationship}} between forms of <b>passion</b> (<b>harmonious</b> and obsessive; Vallerand et al., 2003) and athlete burnout, and whether these relationships are mediated by self-determined motivation. The proposed model posited that because <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> originates from an authentic self, it will be positively associated with self-determined regulation. Conversely, because obsessive passion originates from ego-invested structures within the self, it will be negatively associated with self-determined regulation. In turn, consistent with research examining the relationship between motivation regulation and athlete burnout, self-determined regulation was expected to be negatively associated with athlete burnout. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Method: This model was tested in 149 (M age¼ 16. 2, s ¼ 2. 0, range¼ 12 e 21) male junior athletes who attended soccer academies in the UK. Participants completed the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> (Vallerand et al., 2003), the Sport Motivation Scale (Pelletier et al., 1995), and the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (Raedeke & Smith, 2001). Results: <b>Harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was negatively related to a latent athlete burnout factor, whereas obsessive passion was unrelated to a latent athlete burnout factor. The relationship between <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and burnout was fully mediated by self-determined regulation. Conclusions: The results suggest that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> may offer some protection from burnout for athletes due to higher levels of self-determined motivatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to look at the correlates of passion toward screen-based activities. In two studies, we aimed to test the role of impulsivity as a predictor of obsessive (but not <b>harmonious)</b> <b>passion</b> for Facebook use and series watching. We also aimed to distinguish between problematic and non-problematic correlates as pertains to Facebook use and TV series watching. Based on the Dualistic Model of Passion, it was hypothesized that <b>Harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> would be positively associated with adaptive correlates and Obsessive passion to less positive and even negative ones in both types of activities. In two studies, young adults (Study 1 = 256; Study 2 = 420) completed the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> with respect to Facebook use and series watching, respectively, the UPPS Impulsivity Scale, and scales measuring problematic and non-problematic correlates associated with engaging in such activities. The results provided support for the proposed model: Impulsivity predicted obsessive (but not <b>harmonious)</b> <b>passion.</b> Obsessive passion was positively associated with negative correlates such as Facebook overuse whereas <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was positively associated with adaptive correlates such as self-development through series watching.

30|$|Passion for one’s {{studies was}} {{measured}} using the refined <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> (Marsh et al. 2013) in Chinese. The Chinese version of the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> was developed as indicated below in the procedures. In the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale,</b> two six-item subscales assess <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and obsessive passion. Because the activity pertained to one’s studies, the scale was adapted accordingly (e.g. “My studies are in harmony with other activities in my life”).

30|$|The Dualistic Model of Passion posits the {{existence}} of two types of <b>passion,</b> namely <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion.</b> These two types of passion have been assessed through the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale.</b> This scale has been validated in French and English and translated in several languages. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to translate and validate it in Chinese. To this end, 286 Chinese university students completed an online questionnaire in Chinese that contained the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale,</b> the <b>passion</b> criteria, as well as measures of flow and positive and negative affect. Results provided support for the two-factor structure of the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> in Chinese and for the high reliability for both subscales (α_HP = 0. 8 6; α_OP = 0. 8 2).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to test the applicability of the Dualistic Model of Passion (Vallerand et al., 2003) to being a sport (football) fan. The model posits that passion is a strong inclination toward an activity that individuals like (or even love), that they value, and in which they invest time and energy. Furthermore, two types of <b>passion</b> are proposed: <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion.</b> While obsessive passion entails an uncontrollable urge to engage in the passionate activity, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> entails a sense of volition while engaging in the activity. Finally, the model posits that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> leads to more adaptive outcomes than obsessive passion. Three studies provided support for this dualistic conceptualization of passion. Study 1 showed that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was positively associated with adaptive behaviours (e. g., celebrate the team’s victory), while obsessive passion was rather positively associated with maladaptive behaviours (e. g., to risk losing one’s employment to go to the team’s game). Study 2 used a short <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> and showed that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was positively related to the positive affective life of fans during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, psychological health (self-esteem and life satisfaction), and public displays of adaptive behaviours (e. g., celebrating one’s team victory in the streets), while obsessive passion was predictive of maladaptive affective life (e. g., hating opposing team’s fans) and behaviours (e. g., mocking the opposing team’s fans). Finally, Study 3 examined the role of obsessive passion as a predictor of partner’s conflict that in turn undermined partner’s relationship satisfaction. Overall, the present results provided support for the Dualistic Model of Passion. The conceptual and applied implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R

3000|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} (Carbonneau et al. 2010, Studies 1 and 2). In the first study, participants from the [...] "normal population" [...] (ranging {{in age from}} 19 to 60 years) who had been engaging in Yoga for several years completed the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> for Yoga as well as scales assessing positive and negative affect and state anxiety experienced during Yoga classes. Results revealed that only <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was positively associated with positive affect and negatively with negative affect and state anxiety. Obsessive passion was only positively associated (but non significantly so) with state anxiety. Study 2 went further and looked at changes in outcomes that took place over a 3 -month period for regular Yoga participants once more from the normal population. Results basically replicated those of Study 1. Specifically, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> predicted decreases in negative emotions, state anxiety, and general (negative) physical symptoms, but increases in positive emotions that took place over time during Yoga classes. Obsessive passion only predicted {{a significant increase in}} negative emotions experienced during Yoga classes. These findings were obtained even while controlling for the number of weekly hours and years of involvement in Yoga.|$|R
3000|$|In the {{research}} discussed above, {{the focus was}} on people who were all passionate for a given activity and how such passion relates to psychological well-being (and ill-being). Such research, however, only compared passionate people between them and did not include non passionate people. Thus, {{it is not clear whether}} <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> actually gives people a psychological boost and obsessive passion a drop in well-being relative to non passionate people. In a first study (Philippe, Vallerand, & Lavigne, 2009, Study 1), over 750 men and women aged between 18 and 90 years completed a questionnaire containing the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> as well as assessing the passion criteria (i.e., loving and valuing the activity, spending regular time on the activity, and the activity being perceived as a [...] "passion") with respect to an activity that was dear to their heart. Participants also completed scales assessing hedonic (life satisfaction; Diener et al. 1985) and eudaimonic (self-realization; Ryff & Keyes 1995) well-being. Using the passion criteria discussed previously, we distinguished those individuals who were highly passionate (a mean of 5 and more on a 7 -pt scale on the 4 passion criteria) from those who were not (below a mean of 5 on the passion criteria). Furthermore, in line with Vallerand and Houlfort (2003), among the passionate individuals, we distinguished those who were [...] "harmoniously-passionate" [...] (those with a higher z-score on the <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> than on the obsessive passion subscale) from those who were [...] "obsessively-passionate" [...] (those with a higher z-score on the obsessive than on the <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> subscale). We then compared the three groups on the two types of psychological well-being indices.|$|R
30|$|The above {{findings}} suggest that harmonious (but not obsessive) passion may protect psychological well-being following an important failure related to the passionate activity. However, this first study had one important limitation: it relied on participants' recollection of their life satisfaction. Thus, {{it is possible that}} memory biases explain the results (Sedikides & Green 2000). A second study (Lafrenière et al. in press, Study 2) was thus conducted with 77 passionate hockey fans using a diary study during the 2009 National Hockey League (NHL) playoffs. Passionate fans of various hockey teams first completed the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Life Satisfaction Scale through a web survey before the start of a playoffs series involving their favorite team. They then completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale each morning following their team's game which was played the night before (whether it was a loss or a win). Hierarchical linear modeling analyses were conducted on the life satisfaction data. The results replicated those of Study 1. Specifically, whereas obsessive passion accentuated the negative impact of a loss on their life satisfaction, such was not the case for <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion.</b> These findings reveal that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> does seem to play a protective function against negative events and potential drops in psychological well-being while obsessive passion seems to exacerbate such effects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{activity}} {{has been linked}} to well-being among women. One psychological perspective that can offer insights regarding this relationship is the Dualistic Model of Passion. The model posits that individuals can internalize a valued activity in an autonomous fashion, facilitating a <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion,</b> or in a controlled way, resulting in an obsessive passion. The overall purpose of this experience sampling study with physically active working mothers was to examine the influence of passion towards physical activity on daily positive and negative affect as well as more generally in terms of vitality. Method Sixty-three healthy and active middle-aged women participated in this study. The women attended a baseline session to complete a series of self-report questionnaires including The <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale.</b> Then, using the experience sampling method, the women responded to electronic questionnaires pertaining to their daily affect and physical activity engagement over a 14 -day period. Subsequently they attended a second session during which levels of vitality were assessed. The data were analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling and Analyses of Covariance. Results Sixty of the participants (95 %) were passionate towards physical activity. Daily positive affect was higher and negative affect lower on days when the women engaged in their passion (i. e., physical activity). On these active days, associations between overall positive and negative affect and levels of <b>harmonious</b> or obsessive <b>passion</b> were in the expected directions, albeit not significant. Levels of <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> moderated the relationship between activity engagement and positive affect such that obsessively passionate women felt significantly worse on days when they were not active. Vitality was negatively associated with obsessive passion and positively with <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion.</b> Conclusions The findings were consistent with the Dualistic Model of Passion and they suggest avenues of future enquiry. In considering physical activity as a strategy to optimize women’s well-being, the internalization process of this activity (autonomous versus controlled) should be considered. Potential application of these results should involve facilitating more <b>harmonious</b> <b>passions</b> towards physical activity by emphasizing flexible and volitional participation that is well balanced among other activities...|$|R
30|$|To {{address the}} above issues, Philippe et al. (2009, Study 2) had {{different}} participants from Study 1 (again across the lifespan) complete the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> and {{a scale of}} eudaimonic well-being (subjective vitality; Ryan & Frederick 1997) at Time 1 and the same well-being measure one year later. Then, creating the same three groups as in Study 1, the authors sought to determine whether <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> would lead to predictable changes in well-being in each group over the one-year period. The results revealed that people who were harmoniously passionate for a given activity experienced {{a significant increase in}} psychological well-being over the period, thereby replicating past findings. However, of great interest regarding the question posed above, both obsessively-passionate and non-passionate individuals experienced a slight, but significant, decrease in psychological well-being over time. Thus, overall, it would appear that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> promotes, while obsessive passion and being non passionate, seem to undermine psychological well-being.|$|R
3000|$|The above {{research}} provides {{support for}} the role of <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> in leading to positive affect {{and the role of the}} latter in promoting increases in psychological well-being. However, such research does not address the second role of <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion,</b> namely the protective role these mediating processes may play in psychological ill-being. If <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> protects ones from experiencing psychological ill-being, then are positive emotions the mediating processes involved in the process? Furthermore, the above research also showed that although obsessive passion was negatively related to psychological well-being, neither situational positive nor situational negative affect mediated the obsessive passion-psychological well-being relationship. So, what are those processes mediating the negative effects of obsessive passion on psychological ill-being? [...]...|$|R
30|$|Consequently, {{people with}} a <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> {{should be able to}} fully focus on the task at hand and {{experience}} positive outcomes both during (e.g., flow, positive affect, concentration) and after task engagement (e.g., satisfaction, general positive affect). Thus, there should be little or no conflict between the person's passionate activity and his/her other life activities. Furthermore, when prevented from engaging in their passionate activity, {{people with a}} <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> should be able to adapt well to the situation and focus their attention and energy on other tasks that need to be done. Finally, with <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion,</b> the person is in control of the activity and can decide when to and when not to engage in the activity. People with a <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> are able to decide not to engage in the activity on a given day if needed or even to eventually terminate the relationship with the activity if they decide it has become a permanent negative factor in their life. Thus, behavioral engagement in the passionate activity can be seen as flexible.|$|R
30|$|In sum, {{the take}} home message from {{this paper is}} that being passionate toward a given {{activity}} will lead the person {{to engage in the}} activity frequently, often over several years and sometimes a lifetime. <b>Harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> for a given activity will generally lead to the experience of positive emotions during activity engagement. Such emotions, in turn, will foster increases in psychological well-being. Thus, over time, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> is expected to facilitate sustainable increases in psychological well-being and prevent against ill-being. Obsessive passion, while ensuring regular activity engagement, does not produce such psychological gains and may even facilitate some deleterious effects. Clearly, not all intentional activities produce positive effects on psychological well-being. In this light, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> would deserve much attention as a major contributor of sustainable psychological well-being. Future research on some of the issues raised above would therefore appear rather promising.|$|R
3000|$|Our initial {{research}} {{sought to}} determine if there was a link between passion for an activity and psychological well-being. It involved senior citizens (Rousseau & Vallerand 2003). We included measures of both psychological well-being such as life satisfaction (Diener et al. 1985), meaning in life (Steger et al. 2006), and vitality (Ryan & Frederick 1997), as well as psychological ill-being ([...] scales of anxiety and depression from the General Health Questionnaire of Goldberg & Hillier 1979). In line with the above hypotheses, having a <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> for an activity was expected to promote psychological well-being, while being obsessively passionate or non passionate was not. Furthermore, it was also hypothesized that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> should protect against ill-being because of the positive affective states it facilitates. Research supported these hypotheses. For instance, in this particular study, we found that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> toward one's favorite activity (e.g., playing cards, playing a musical instrument) positively predicted positive indices of psychological well-being but negatively predicted indices of ill-being. Conversely, obsessive passion positively predicted anxiety and depression, was negatively related to life satisfaction, and was unrelated to vitality and meaning in life. Thus, the promoting and protective functions of <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> were supported while the less than optimal role of obsessive passion was demonstrated.|$|R
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that obsessive and <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> can explain variability in burnout through various mediating processes (e. g., Vallerand, Paquet, Phillippe, & Charest, 2010). The current study extended previous research (Curran, Appleton, Hill, & Hall, 2011; Gustafsson, Hassmén, & Hassmén, 2011) by testing {{a model in}} which the effects of passion for sport on athlete burnout were mediated by psychological need satisfaction. One hundred and seventy-three academy soccer players completed self-report measures of passion for sport, psychological need satisfaction, and athlete burnout. Results indicated that psychological need satisfaction mediated the relationship between <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and athlete burnout but not obsessive passion and athlete burnout. The findings indicate that the inverse relationship between <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and burnout {{can be explained by}} higher levels of psychological need satisfaction. However, {{this was not the case}} for obsessive passion, which was not associated with psychological need satisfaction or most symptoms of athlete burnout...|$|R

40|$|Athletes {{that are}} happy in their sport {{participate}} more often, and for longer. Therefore, understanding {{the processes that}} give rise to positive emotions in recreational sport is important. Grounded in the dualistic model of passion, the present study tested a structural model in which <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> predict positive emotions in recreational sport through the mediating influence of belongingness. It was hypothesized that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> would positively predict positive emotions via higher belongingness. By contrast, we expected that obsessive passion would negatively predict positive emotions via lower belongingness. A multi-section questionnaire containing the study variables was administered to 402 adult recreational sports participants. Structural equation modeling revealed that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> positively predicted belongingness that, in turn, positively predicted positive emotions. Obsessive passion and belongingness shared no relationship and hence belongingness did not mediate the obsessive passion-positive emotion link. These findings suggest that social influences within recreational sport should be particularly cognizant of emphasizing harmonious tendencies. This is because athletes with <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> are more likely to feel socially-connected in sport and, therefore, exhibit higher levels of positive emotion...|$|R
40|$|Quality of goal {{engagement}} and alternative goal suppression were investigated in this research. Integrating the dualistic model of passion (Vallerand et al., 2003) with goal-systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002), {{we hypothesized that}} obsessive passion—associated with recurrent goal-conflicts—would predict greater alternative goal suppression (i. e., goal-shielding) than would <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> — characterized by effective synthesis of the passionate activity with other life domains. Results from 5 laboratory studies supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, participants’ dispositional measures of <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> were correlated with an implicit measure of goal-shielding. Obsessive (but not <b>harmonious)</b> <b>passion</b> predicted the suppression of alternative goals and the progressive inhibition of unfamiliar goals. In Study 2, we extended these findings by demonstrating the interrelation between quality of goal {{engagement and}} goal-commitment such that goal-shielding effects were enhanced, but only for goals in conflict with other life domains (vs. well-integrated goals). In Study 3, the causal influence of passion on goal-shielding was supported via an experimental manipulation of passion. In Study 4, we replicated and extended Studies 1 and 3 by experimentally demonstrating that obsessive (but not <b>harmonious)</b> <b>passion</b> is a mindset conducive {{to the development of}} inhibitory links with alternative goals. Study 5 explored the psychological costs associated with repeated unconscious goal suppression by examining its effects on the depletion of self-regulatory resources. Collectively, the present results suggest that the qualitative distinction between obsessive and <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> has implications for the goal-shielding effect and for subsequent self-regulatory behavior...|$|R
3000|$|A {{final point}} as {{pertains}} {{to the role of}} the activity in the psychological outcomes experienced relates to what may be called [...] "negative" [...] activities. Specifically, if <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> promotes the quality of one's affective experiences during engagement in a [...] "positive" [...] activity, can it also protect the person when engaging in a more [...] "negative" [...] type of activity? While it is difficult to identify a clearly negative activity, gambling may come close to it. Indeed, much research reveals that gambling (and certain types of gambling activities in particular such as video poker machines) may be particularly negative for the person, leading to pathological gambling, social isolation, depression, and even suicide (Bergh & Kühlhorn 1994). As such, if <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> serves protective functions, then engaging in gambling out of <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> should protect one from experiencing negative affect and developing pathological gambling. However, this should not be the case for obsessive passion. In fact, obsessive passion would be expected to even contribute to both.|$|R
40|$|Game {{research}} {{suffers from}} {{using a variety}} of concepts to predict the (often negative) effects of playing games. These concepts often overlap (e. g., addiction or pathological gaming), include negative consequences in their definition, or are very game-specific (e. g., collective play). We argue that the field would benefit from using concepts that are well-established in other domains. Extending earlier work to the interpersonal domain, we examined the effects of obsessive and <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> for massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) on the number and quality of online and offline friendships. Obsessive passion describes an irrepressible urge to engage in an activity, whereas <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> describes the voluntary engagement in an activity. In an online survey of 406 MMORPG players, we found differential relationships between obsessive and <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and the number and quality of online and offline friendships.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Recently, {{empirical}} research has linked obsessive passion to {{the etiology of}} exercise addiction, and the conceptual reason behind {{the fact that the}} latter is more prevalent in athletes than leisure exercisers has been challenged. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the link between exercise addiction and <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion,</b> obsessive passion, and dedication to sports, in the context of athletic levels. A sample comprised of low- and high-level competitive athletes and non-competitive leisure exercisers (n[*]=[*] 313) was examined, in a cross-sectional design, in which participants completed the Spanish validated versions of the Exercise Addiction Inventory (Sicilia, Alías-García, Ferriz, & Moreno-Murcia, 2013) and <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> (Chamarro et al., 2015). Results Obsessive passion and dedication to sports emerged as strong predictors of exercise addiction. Competitive athletes scored higher than leisure exercisers on all measures. Athletes competing at low and high levels only differed in dedication to their sports from each other. Team-sports athletes reported greater <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passions,</b> and dedication to sports, but not different exercise addictions, than people taking part in individual sports. Conclusions The concept of exercise addiction is not a plain and independent construct and may not reflect a psychological dysfunction in the athletic population. Athletes could interpret exercise addiction screening-items differently from non-athletes. Athletes in team sports report greater passion and dedication than those practicing individual sports...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to determine the prevalence rate of gambling problems in senior citizens (55 years and older). A community-dwelling sample composed of 810 old adults living in the greater Montreal area in the Province of Quebec completed the Revised South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS-R). Results revealed that the 12 -month prevalence rate was 1. 2 % for pathological gambling and 1. 6 % for at-risk gambling. Although, these rates are comparable to those reported elsewhere in Canada and in the US for senior citizens, the at-risk gambling rate was significantly higher than the current one for the general popula-tion of the overall Province of Quebec. Finally, a smaller portion of participants also completed two key items from the Gambling <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> (GPS). Results revealed that obsessive passion was higher for pathological gamblers than for at-risk and non-problematic gamblers, while <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was lower for pathological gam-blers than for at-risk and non-problematic gamblers...|$|R
30|$|Because with obsessive passion one {{experiences}} an uncontrollable urge {{to engage}} in the passionate activity, it becomes very difficult for the person to fully disengage from thoughts about the activity (or from engaging in the activity altogether), leading to conflict with other activities in the person's life. Such conflict can prevent the person from engaging in other life pursuits. The person thus remains mentally stale which may contribute to burnout (Garland et al. 2010). In addition, because obsessive passion is typically unrelated to positive affective experiences both during task engagement in the passionate activity (work) and in other life pursuits outside of it, obsessive passion does not trigger the protective function against ill-being like <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> does. Conversely, with <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion,</b> the person can let go of the passionate activity after task engagement and fully immerse in other life pursuits without experiencing conflict between the two. Thus, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> should allow the person to experience affective rewards both during task engagement in the passionate activity as well as in other life pursuits, thereby protecting the person against burnout.|$|R
30|$|In sum, {{taking into}} {{consideration}} the fact that <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> leads to regular engagement in the passionate activity that translates into positive affect during activity engagement (e.g., Mageau et al. 2005; Vallerand et al. 2003, Study 1; Vallerand et al. 2006, Studies 2 and 3), that such positive affect seems to endure for a substantial period of time (Mageau & Vallerand 2007; Vallerand et al. 2003, Study 2), and that positive affect positively predicts psychological well-being (Fredrickson 2001; Fredrickson et al. 2008), {{it would appear that}} having a <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> can lead people to experience cumulative experiences of positive affect that should facilitate and sustain psychological well-being as well as protect against psychological ill-being. Thus, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> is expected to play a dual role of leading people to engage in the passionate activity on a regular basis and to do so in a way as to derive important emotional benefits from one's engagement that foster psychological well-being. However, such should not be the case for obsessive passion as it mainly promotes negative affect and psychological ill-being.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{research}} on passion has systematically found that regularly {{engaging in a}} meaningful activity out of <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> leads {{to the experience of}} positive affect and the protection against negative affect, while obsessive passion leads to negative affect and is either unrelated or weakly related to positive affect during task engagement (e.g., Philippe et al. 2010; Vallerand et al. 2003, Study 1; Vallerand et al. 2006, Studies 2 and 3). In addition, a 2 week-diary study (Mageau & Vallerand 2007) revealed that the positive affect that is experienced during task engagement energized by <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> is still experienced {{at the end of the}} day. Conversely, when engagement in the passionate activity is fueled by obsessive passion, not being able to engage in the passionate activity on a given day leads to feeling less positive at the end of that day. Finally, Vallerand et al. (2003, Study 2) even found that football players with a <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> experienced increases in general positive affect over the course of the season while those who had an obsessive passion experienced an increase in negative affect over time.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of passion for work in the health impairment and motivational processes proposed by the job demands-resources model. Based on the dualistic model of passion, we proposed that <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> intervene simultaneously {{in the relationship between}} (1) job demands and burnout/engagement, and (2) job resources and burnout/engagement. This model was tested in two occupational samples: nurses (n = 1, 179) and teachers (n = 745). Results from structural equation modeling support the proposed model in both samples. That is, both types of passion partially mediated the relationship between job demands and burnout, while <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> partially mediated the relationship between job demands and engagement. Moreover, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> partially mediated the relationship between job resources and burnout/work engagement. Implications for burnout research and management practices are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{mediating}} role {{of types}} of passion in the relationships between motivational climates and subjective vitality was examined among 283 experienced young Norwegian grassroots football players (aged 12 - 16 years). A Structural Equation Model (SEM) based path model revealed that mastery climate predicted subjective vitality directly as well as mediated by <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> and through a chain in which <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> fuelled obsessive passion, in turn facilitating vitality. The former was the stronger mediation path of the two. A performance climate was unrelated to obsessive passion. The pattern of results generally supports the proposed motivational climate–passion–vitality link. However, the observed mediation chain involving also a positive mastery climate–obsessive passion–vitality link invites further examinations to better understand both young football players’ subjective meaning making of <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{investigate}} the discriminant and predictive validity of the dualistic model of <b>passion</b> for work. <b>Harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> was compared to work engagement and workaholism in two studies. Study 1 was cross-sectional and supported convergent and discriminant validity of the dualistic model using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) and confirmatory factor analysis. Study 2 was cross-lagged and applied confirmatory factor analyses, as well as hierarchical linear modeling to test discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity of <b>harmonious</b> and obsessive <b>passion</b> for work. Predictive validity was supported for obsessive and <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> with respect to wellbeing, but not with respect to performance. When controlling for work engagement and workaholism, <b>harmonious</b> <b>passion</b> was negatively related to burnout and positively related to life satisfaction. In contrast, obsessive passion related positively to burnout and negatively to life satisfaction. Only workaholism predicted variance in supervisor rated organizational citizenship behaviors (negatively related), and none of the included variables were associated with supervisor rated in-role performance...|$|R
3000|$|There {{were three}} major {{purposes}} {{to the initial}} work on passion (Vallerand et al. 2003): to determine the prevalence of passion for an activity in one's life, to develop the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale,</b> and to test the validity {{of some of the}} elements of the passion constructs. Thus, Vallerand et al. (2003, Study 1) had over 500 university students complete the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> with respect to an activity that they loved, that they valued, and in which they invested time and energy (i.e., the passion definition), as well as other scales to test predictions derived from the DMP. A large variety of passionate activities were reported ranging from physical activity and sports to watching movies, playing a musical instrument, and reading. Participants reported engaging in their passionate activity for an average of 8.5 hours per week and had been engaging in that activity for almost six years. Thus, clearly passionate activities are meaningful to people and are long-lasting in nature. Furthermore, 84 % of participants indicated that they had at least a moderate level of passion for a given activity in their lives (they scored at least four out of seven on a question asking them if their favorite activity was a « passion » for them). Second, as pertains {{to the development of the}} <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale,</b> results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the presence of two factors corresponding to the two types of passion. These findings on the factor validity of the <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> have been replicated in a number of studies in a variety of activities (e.g., Carbonneau et al. 2008; Castelda et al. 2007; Rousseau et al. 2002; Vallerand & Houlfort 2003; Vallerand et al. 2006, Studies 1, 2, and 3). The <b>Passion</b> <b>Scale</b> consists of two subscales of six items each reflecting Obsessive (e.g., [...] "I almost have an obsessive feeling toward this activity") and <b>Harmonious</b> <b>Passion</b> (e.g., [...] "This activity is in harmony with other activities in my life"). Furthermore, internal consistency analyses have shown that both subscales are reliable (typically [...]. 75 and above). Finally, test-retest correlations over periods ranging from four to six weeks revealed moderately high stability values (in the [...]. 80 s, Rousseau et al. 2002), thereby supporting the factorial validity and reliability of the scale.|$|R
