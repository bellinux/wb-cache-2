40|$|Tread braked railway {{wheels are}} {{subjected}} to complex loading due to combined rolling contact stresses and thermally induced stresses. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to find the limits for tread braking with respect to temperature impact on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of the wheel tread. A wheel with an S-shaped web is studied for some different stop <b>braking</b> <b>loads.</b> Using 3 D FE simulations, the effects of simultaneous thermal <b>loading</b> from <b>braking</b> and mechanical <b>loading,</b> with traversing wheel-rail rolling contact, are studied. In order to account for the elevated temperatures, the simulations utilise a temperature-dependent elastoplastic material model. The mechanical loads account for frictional rolling contact stress distributions induced by braking, using a novel method that is based on elastoplastic contact simulations. Partial slip is considered and interfacial shear stresses are introduced in the wheel-rail contact area. Evolution of damage {{in the vicinity of the}} wheel tread is studied for various <b>brake</b> <b>loading</b> cases. In order to assess limits for the tread braking, the calculated damage is compared to previously developed critical damage levels which were based on full-scale brake rig testing. Results are presented for a parametric study with thermomechanical loading based on different load cases. The influence from operational parameters such as axle loads, initial speeds, decelerations and block material is studied. The results show that the temperature has a strong influence on the rolling contact fatigue of the wheel treads and, hence, also on the thermal capacity of the wheels. The study gives preliminary limits for revenue traffic, described as combinations of tread temperatures and wheel-rail rolling contact loading, which should be respected to avoid thermal cracking of the wheel treads...|$|R
50|$|Brake fade {{failures}} can cascade. For example, {{a typical}} 5-axle truck/trailer combination has 10 brakes. If one <b>brake</b> fades, <b>brake</b> <b>load</b> {{is transferred to}} the remaining 9 brakes, causing them to work harder, get hotter, and thus fade more. Where fade is non-uniform, fade may cause a vehicle to swerve. Because of this, heavy vehicles often use disproportionately weak brakes on steered wheels, which hurts the stopping distance and causes brakes on non-steered wheels to work harder, worsening fade. An advantage of low-fade brakes such as disc brakes is steered wheels can do more braking without causing brake steer.|$|R

2500|$|Rotors come in many {{different}} sizes, such as 160mm, 185mm, and 203mm diameter. Other sizes are available as manufacturers make discs specific to their calipers [...] the dimensions often vary by a few millimeters. Larger rotors provide greater braking force for a given pad pressure, by virtue of a longer moment arm for the caliper to act on. Smaller rotors provide less stopping power but also less weight and better protection from knocks. Larger rotors dissipate heat more quickly and have a larger amount of mass to absorb heat, reducing brake fade or failure. Downhill bikes usually have larger brakes to handle greater <b>braking</b> <b>loads.</b> Cross country bicycles usually use smaller rotors which handle smaller loads but offer considerable weight savings.|$|R
