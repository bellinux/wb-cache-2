40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{cyclization}} of trans-δ-hydroxy enones to cyclic mixed <b>ketals</b> routinely requires superstoichiometric strong acid. By {{operating under}} a photoisomerization regime, the cyclization of trans-δ-hydroxy enones proceeds under catalytic Brønsted acid to provide cyclic <b>ketals</b> or unsaturated spiroketals {{in a highly}} diastereoselective fashion. A one-pot, two-step protocol was thus developed to provide cyclic methoxy <b>ketals</b> with a free β-hydroxy group for future functionalization. Cyclic and spirocyclic <b>ketals</b> comprise ubiquitous structuralmotifs in polyketide natural products (Figure 1). 1 Often decorated with substituents and a rich array of stereochemistry, the synthesis of such <b>ketals</b> within a natural product framework demands high functional group tolerance and diastereoselectiv-ity. Dihydroxy ketones are commonly employed as precursors to cyclic <b>ketals</b> (Scheme 1 a). 2 Such aldol products typically undergo cyclization upon exposure to catalytic acid in alcoholic o...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFour {{recently}} launched cyclic glycerol acetals or <b>ketals</b> are evaluated as bio-based solvents.
