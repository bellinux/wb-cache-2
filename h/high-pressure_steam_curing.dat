40|$|Abstract. Nano-silica porous thermal {{insulating}} composites {{belong to}} super thermal insulations, which are prepared by dry molding technology. They have many advantages {{in comparison with}} aerogel such as easy preparation and good mechanical property. However, springback phenomenon {{is found in the}} process of molding. The springback is easy to lead to cracking of the samples, which directly affects applications of the composites. In order to solve this problem, <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> method is introduced and the effects of <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> medium and <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> time on springback ratio are investigated. The results show that the springback ratio of composites is only 6. 45 % when water is selected as <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> medium and the optimum <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> time is 30 min...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> to {{high-speed}} railway’s simply-supported box girder, there are some problems must be faced such as the difficulty to determine <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> system and to achieve automatic temperature control. With the construction site conditions of simple-supported box girder in Longwang beam field which is located on Shijiazhuang-Wuhan (Shi-Wu) section of Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed railway, the paper proposes the appropriate steam system for simply-supported box girders, determines the appropriate equipments, explores the temperature control system in {{the process of}} <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> to the simply-supported box girder's concrete, and takes the temperature test of <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> in the field. Results show that, the <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> technology in this paper can increase the production efficiency of beam in production site, and effectively guarantee the prefabricated quality of simply-supported box girder...|$|R

40|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>curing</b> is an {{effective}} method to increase the hydration degree of binder containing phosphorus slag. The role of phosphorus slag in steam-cured concrete was investigated by determining the hydration heat, hydration products, nonevaporable water content, pore structure of paste, and the compressive strength and chloride ion permeability of concrete. The results show that elevated <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> temperature {{does not lead to}} new crystalline hydration products of the composite binder containing phosphorus slag. Elevating <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> temperature enhances the early hydration heat and nonevaporable water content of the binder containing phosphorus slag more significantly than increasing <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> time, and it also results in higher late-age hydration degree and finer pore structure. For steam-cured concrete containing phosphorus slag, elevating curing temperature from 60 °C to 80 °C tends to decrease the late-age strength and increase the chloride permeability. However, at constant curing temperature of 60 °C, the steam-cured concrete containing phosphorus slag can achieve satisfied demoulding strength and late-age strength and chloride permeability by extending the <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> duration...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> on the {{hardened}} properties of recycled aggregate concrete were investigated. In this study, two series of concrete mixtures with water/cement ratios of 0 - 55 and 0 - 45 were prepared. Recycled aggregates {{were used as}} 0, 20, 50 and 100 % by volume replacements of natural coarse aggregate in the concrete mixtures. The concrete specimens underwent standard water-curing and steam-curing regimes. The test {{results showed that the}} strength of concrete decreased as the recycled aggregate content increased. An initial steam-curing regime increased the one-day strength of the concrete, but the corresponding 28 - and 90 -day strengths decreased. Furthermore, <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> reduced the static modulus of elasticity of concrete compared with that of the water cured concrete. However, the negative effect of <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> diminished as the recycled aggregate content increased. Moreover, <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> decreased the drying shrinkage and increased the resistance against chloride ion penetration of the recycled aggregate concrete. The results demonstrate that one of the practical ways to utilise a higher percentage of recycled aggregates in concrete is 'precasting' "with an initial <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> stage immediately after casting.

30|$|Experiments were {{performed}} in the following order: the <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> chamber was assembled, the confinement steel cage {{was placed in the}} mold and the strand was positioned, concrete was casted into the pull-out molds, steam was emitted into the chamber according to the given <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> regime, and pull-out tests {{were performed}} at various equivalent ages.|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that bond stress–slip relationships are greatly influenced by the surrounding concrete strength (Choi 1988; Eurocode 2 2004; Campione et al. 2005; Missouri University of Science and Technology 2012). In <b>steam</b> <b>curing,</b> the development of concrete strength is affected by both the temperature and the curing duration. Accordingly, due consideration must be paid to concrete maturity in the modeling of bond stress–slip relationships of a strand embedded in concrete during the <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> process. A comprehensive literature search indicated that no information was available regarding the bond stress–slip behavior of strands in concrete at elevated temperature during <b>steam</b> <b>curing.</b> Accordingly, in the present study pull-out tests were performed of specimens subjected to various <b>steam</b> <b>curing</b> conditions, and a model of bond stress–slip relationships for strands was developed to serve as a tool in determining the bonding time. This model was based upon the concept of an equivalent age.|$|R
