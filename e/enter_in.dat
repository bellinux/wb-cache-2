5|$|Originally the {{competition}} was open to {{children between the ages}} of 8 and 15, however in 2007 the age range was narrowed so that only children aged 10 to 15 on the day of the contest were allowed to <b>enter.</b> <b>In</b> 2016 the age range was changed again. From now on children aged 9 to 14 on the day of the contest are allowed to enter.|$|E
5|$|Some countries, such as Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, {{have entered}} on {{all but a}} handful of occasions; Morocco, on the other hand, has only entered once. Two countries, Tunisia and Lebanon, have {{attempted}} to enter the contest but withdrew before making a début. Liechtenstein, a country without an eligible television service, tried unsuccessfully to <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> 1976.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{previous}} album, 1989's Mother's Milk {{would become}} the band's second album to <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> the Billboard 200, peaking at number 52 {{and at the time}} the biggest of their career. Although the record was mildly successful, production was weighed down by producer Michael Beinhorn. He convinced Frusciante to play with an overall heavier tone, and instructed Kiedis to write lyrics that would be more radio viable, thus causing the band to feel restricted creatively.|$|E

5|$|The {{country was}} bombed by the Allies on 27 June 1944, {{killing at least}} 35. The Sammarinese {{government}} declared {{the same day that}} no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to <b>enter.</b> <b>In</b> early July, it announced that prominent signs had been put up at the border crossings by the German command, to instruct German units not to enter the territory, and again reiterated its complete neutrality.|$|E
5|$|After {{the artistic}} {{portion of the}} ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is {{traditionally}} the first nation to <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> order to honour {{the origins of the}} Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's chosen language, with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. During the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Athens, Greece, the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier, often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation, who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weak}} {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> the neutral current interaction.|$|E

5|$|In the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, both Spanish and Catalan were {{official}} {{languages of}} the games, {{but due to}} the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in French alphabetical order. For unknown reasons, all three games taking place in Japan had the nations <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> English alphabetical order instead of Japanese characters. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, teams were ordered {{by the number of}} strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name. In the 2010 Winter Olympics, teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of the Olympics are also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of the two in Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia. In the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2014 Winter Olympics, the countries entered in the Cyrillic alphabetical order, which is the Russian language's official script.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 2014, {{the club}} reached its first FA Cup Final after {{defeating}} Sheffield United 5–3 in the semi-final at Wembley Stadium. Their {{place in the}} 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, {{regardless of whether they}} won the 2013–14 FA Cup, was confirmed on 3 May as Everton's failure to win meant that Hull's FA Cup Final opponents Arsenal would compete in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Hull City will <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> the third qualifying round, in their first ever European campaign. The FA Cup final on 17 May saw Hull go 2–0 up within the first ten minutes, before losing 3–2 after extra time.|$|E
5|$|QPR's {{victory was}} the first {{occasion}} a team from the Third Division had won a major trophy in England. Both teams received £18,000 as {{their share of the}} gate receipts. QPR's victory created a problem for the Football League management committee. On previous occasions, one of the three nominations for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was the winner of the League Cup. However, the Fairs Cup committee required that only teams from the highest tier of a nation's league system could <b>enter.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Liverpool qualified for the following season's competition.|$|E

5|$|The initial Tour de France of 1903 {{had been}} a large success, and it was quickly decided to {{organize}} it again in 1904. The route was identical, with the same six stages. The rules {{were the same as}} in 1903, with one exception: cyclists could not <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> just one stage, but had to join for the entire race. The favourites for the victory were Garin, Pothier and Aucouturier, who had performed well in the 1903 Tour de France. Among the competitors was Henri Paret who, at 50 years old, still holds the record of oldest Tour de France cyclist.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{movement}} has aspects {{of both a}} fugue and a ritornello movement. In the first fugal section, the voices <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> the sequence tenor, alto, soprano I, soprano II, bass, expanding from middle range to the extreme parts, just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards. In the second fugal section, the instruments begin in low registers, and the voices build, with every part first in extremely low range, from bass to soprano I. In both sections, the instruments open the fugue, but play with the voices once they enter.|$|E
5|$|The {{electoral law}} {{provides}} that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors {{are allowed to}} present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors are required to secure at least the signature of 1 per 100 of the electors entered in electoral register of the constituency {{for which they are}} seeking election—0.1 per 100 and, at least, the signature of 500 electors, until 1985—. Also since 2011, parties, federations or coalitions who have not obtained a mandate in either House of Parliament at the preceding election are required to secure at least the signature of 0.1 per 100 of the electors entered in electoral register of the constituency for which they are seeking election. Electors are barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> coalition to take part jointly at an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days from the election call.|$|E

5|$|The tour opener was {{followed}} by a game against Leicestershire; Miller was promoted to No. 3. At the fall of the first wicket, the crowd surged towards the players' gate, expecting Bradman to <b>enter</b> <b>in</b> his customary batting position. Miller emerged instead, and scored an unbeaten 202 in five and a half hours, although he was dropped three times. He featured in a 111-run second wicket partnership with Sid Barnes, before putting on 159 with Bradman for the third wicket. After a late-order collapse, in which no other batsman passed 12, it was left to last man Bill Johnston to partner Miller from 180 onwards. The pair put on 37 for the tenth wicket before Johnston was out for 12, allowing Miller to complete a double century. One of his sixes concussed a spectator. After his long innings, Miller did not bowl in the first innings, but was used late in the second innings and took 2/10. Australia completed another innings triumph.|$|E
