25|$|As Shadow Chancellor in 1967 Iain Macleod {{helped to}} found the {{homeless}} charity Crisis. In 1968 Macleod defied a {{decision of the}} Shadow Cabinet by voting against the Labour Government’s Commonwealth Immigration Bill, believing {{it to be a}} breach of promises made by the Conservative Government to the Kenyan Asians. He fell out with his former friend Enoch Powell over the latter's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech, after which Macleod refused to speak to Powell again. Macleod's subsequent dealings with him were, Powell said, as if he was a pariah though Macleod 'knew what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> not motivated by what is crudely called racialism, but he behaved as if he did not know'. Powell's speech generated huge public support and Macleod was horrified at the open racism of many {{of the members of the}} public who wrote to him on the topic, likening them to the disgusting creatures which are revealed when one overturns a stone.|$|E
500|$|Weeks after {{accepting}} the appointment, Emanuel participated {{on a panel}} of corporate chief executive officers sponsored by the Wall Street Journal and said, [...] "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste." [...] The quote {{was taken out of}} context by some commentators as evidence [...] "...that the left supposedly wants to exploit circumstances to ram its agenda through." [...] Emanuel explained later, [...] "...what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was,</b> never allow a good crisis to go to waste when it's an opportunity to do things that you had never considered, or that you didn't think were possible." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{announcing the}} tour, Bowie {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} promotional press shows covering 9 countries in 2 weeks, including Canada, the US and seven countries in Europe. The press tour shows were typically delivered in smaller venues seating around 300 people, and local fans were often allowed into the events. He used the opportunity to educate the press on his album and the tour, and the multiple dates allowed him to correct misinformation. At the London Glass Spider Press Conference, he clarified that [...] "I didn't say 'lights, costumes and sex,' what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> 'lights, costumes and theatrical sets {{in response to a question}} about what the audience could expect when seeing his new live show. Press tour shows included live performances of some of the songs from the album Never Let Me Down.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E
500|$|On his approach, Cohen {{said that}} he refused to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The first thing <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was,</b> 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't {{want to deal with}} sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You know what, we put all four million dollars in front of the camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That {{was the first time we}} did that, but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me realize I can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film when I was the most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Ron Paul again {{clashed with}} Bachmann and Rick Santorum over {{foreign policy and}} Rick Perry {{expressed}} a desire to be [...] "the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses". Bachmann claimed that after the previous debate, PolitiFact.com [...] "came out and said that everything that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> true", which prompted the fact-checking website to label her claim as [...] "pants on fire", saying [...] "that’s simply not the case".|$|E
2500|$|Regaling {{the press}} after Pittsburghs safe arrival in port, Gingrich declared, [...] "I'm sorry I can't {{give you an}} immortal phrase to hand down to posterity.

It couldn't possibly have held any longer. She's a fine staunch ship. We'll get the bow fixed and go right back out again." [...] Pittsburgh remained under repair at Puget Sound when the war ended in August.|$|E
2500|$|Bode {{therefore}} {{realized the}} first wireless data feedback loop {{in the history}} of automatic control systems by combining wireless data communications, electrical computers, statistics principles and feedback control systems theory. He showed his dry sense of humour by calling this multidisciplinary linkage a shotgun marriage, referring to the antiaircraft artillery origins of his historic invention saying: [...] "This, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> a sort of shotgun marriage forced upon us by the pressures of military problems in World War II." [...] He also described it further as [...] "a sort of 'shotgun marriage' between two incompatible personalities." [...] and characterised the product of that linkage as a “son of shotgun marriage".|$|E

2500|$|King is {{a public}} critic of Paul LePage, the Republican Governor of Maine, and has {{referred}} to LePage {{as one of the}} Three Stooges, along with Florida Governor Rick Scott and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. [...] He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued. [...] King said LePage was [...] "full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green" [...] and demanded that LePage [...] "man up and apologize". [...] LePage declined to apologize to King, stating [...] "I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was,</b> Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said." [...] LePage further told King that he should [...] "make me the villain of your next book and I won’t charge you royalties".|$|E
2500|$|At {{a private}} dinner in November 2014, Emil Michael, senior vice {{president}} of Uber, suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to dig into the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber. Specifically, he targeted Sarah Lacy, editor of the technology website PandoDaily, who has accused Uber of sexism and misogyny. The controversy made national news and stirred criticism against Uber. [...] "The comments, reportedly made by {{senior vice president}} for business Emil Michael at a New York dinner attended by BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith," [...] wrote a Washington Post columnist, [...] "ignited a powder keg of criticism about a company already perceived as cut-throat – landing Uber on the front pages of The Washington Post, USA Today and The New York Times." [...] Michael issued a public apology. Later, he sent an email to Lacy: [...] "I was at an event and was venting, but what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> never intended to describe actions that would ever be undertaken by me or my company toward you or anyone else. I was definitively wrong and I feel terrible about any distress I have caused you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013 in Manassas, Jackson held a {{press conference}} in which he sought to clear the air about his past and counter what he called distortions of his past words and {{statements}} by his opponents. Jackson addressed a number of claims about his theology, which he says has been [...] "twisted and distorted," [...] and said, [...] "I'm not going to spend the campaign talking about these issues, so let's {{get it out of the}} way now." [...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and your colleagues some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> that Christian meditation does not involve emptying oneself but filling oneself ... with the spirit of God. That is classic Biblical Christianity." ...|$|E
