The effects of <b>drug</b> loading method {{as well as}} the <b>drug</b> loading factors (i. e., <b>drug</b> concentration, soaking time in <b>drug</b> solution, type of solvent) on <b>drug</b> content and <b>drug</b> release were investigated. The amount of <b>drug</b> uptake (i. e., <b>drug</b> content) into CaPG beads increased as the initial <b>drug</b> concentration increased and varied depending on the loading method. The in vitro release studies in 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pH 6. 8 buffer indicated that the <b>drug</b> loading method affected <b>drug</b> release and release parameter, time for 50 % of <b>drug</b> release (T 50). The mixing method provided a faster <b>drug</b> release and lower T 50 than the absorption method and swelling method, respectively. This is probably due to higher <b>drug</b> content in CaPG beads. The increased concentration of <b>drug</b> in soaking solution and soaking time resulted in higher <b>drug</b> content and thus faster <b>drug</b> release (lower in T 50 values). When using 0. 1 N HCl as solvent for soaking instead of water, the <b>drug</b> release was slower owing to the increase in molecular tortuosity of CaPG beads. The <b>drug</b> release was also affected by pH of the release medium in which <b>drug</b> release in 0. 1 N HCl was faster than in pH 6. 8 buffer.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{rationality}} of <b>drug</b> policy. It proposes a cybernetic relationship between actual <b>drug</b> severity, public salience of the <b>drug</b> problem, and anti-drug funding. The study hypothesizes that {{increases in the}} severity of the <b>drug</b> problem will cause an increase in the salience of the <b>drug</b> issue. Increased salience in turn leads to political pressure and increased <b>drug</b> funding. As funding increases, anti-drug programs become more robust and effective and <b>drug</b> severity decreases. When severity decreases, salience should in turn decrease. And so on. To test the cybernetic model, the study correlates trends of <b>drug</b> data from 1970 through 1996. It finds significant correlation between <b>drug</b> severity, measured by hospital emergency room <b>drug</b> episodes, and <b>drug</b> salience, measured by media coverage of <b>drug</b> events. The study finds correlations of <b>drug</b> funding and severity to be ambiguous, and finds no correlation between <b>drug</b> funding and <b>drug</b> salience.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{biodegradable}} polymer such as poly(L-lactic acid) {{is promising}} in <b>drug</b> delivery applications {{because it allows}} for <b>drug</b> release in a controlled manner. In a polymer-based <b>drug</b> delivery system, <b>drug</b> release is controlled by polymer degradation and <b>drug</b> loading concentration. In this study, effect of <b>drug</b> concentration on <b>drug</b> release profile is investigated through polymer crystal-linity, chain mobility, and polymer degradation, as characterized by the wide-angle X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and gel permeation chromatography, respectively. The addition of <b>drug</b> {{has been shown to}} accelerate polymer degradation and <b>drug</b> release rate. With a low <b>drug</b> concentration, the slow polymer degradation kinetics results in an induction period of <b>drug</b> release, dur-ing which a limited amount of <b>drug</b> is released. The induction period is undesirable because it delays <b>drug</b> release and effectiveness. Since <b>drug</b> release is controlled by polymer degradation, which is a function of polymer crystallinity, laser surface melting is con-ducted to reduce polymer surface crystallinity and modify its degradation. The effect of laser crystallinity modification on <b>drug</b> release is investigated. A numerical model is also implemented based on hydrolysis and diffusion mechanisms to investigate the effects of <b>drug</b> loading and laser surface melting on polymer degradation and <b>drug</b> release process. It has been demonstrated that laser treat-ment shortens the induction period of <b>drug</b> release while keeps the release rate unmodified, as desired in <b>drug</b> delivery applications...|$|R
