5000|$|Heel blocks—Provides a gap for the <b>ejector</b> <b>assembly,</b> so {{that the}} {{finished}} component ejects from the core. Usually made of mild steel.|$|E
5000|$|Ejector {{guide pillar}} and guide bush—These {{components}} ensure the {{alignment of the}} <b>ejector</b> <b>assembly</b> so that the ejector pins are not damaged. They are usually made of CHMCS. The guide pillar typically has higher hardness than the guide bush.|$|E
40|$|A {{photographic}} {{study of}} a simulated tank fragmentation test was made. Sixteen disks and four spheres were ejected from a test article mounted in a vertical orientation 110 ft above a target installed on the test chamber floor. The test was performed at a chamber pressure of 25 microns. Velocities at impingement on the target ranged from 88 to 120 ft/sec; corresponding ejection velocities at the exit plane of the <b>ejector</b> <b>assembly</b> ranged from 29 to 87 ft/sec. Tumble axes of the disks {{were expected to be}} all in the north-south direction; the majority of those measured were, while some were skewed from this direction, the maximum observed being 90 deg. A typical measured tumble rate was 2. 4 turns/sec. The dispersion pattern measured on the target was reasonably regular, and measured approximately 16 ft east-to-west by 11 ft north-to-south...|$|E
40|$|The present NASA GRC-funded three-year {{research}} project {{is focused on}} studying PDE driven ejectors applicable to a hybrid Pulse Detonation/Turbofan Engine. The objective {{of the study is}} to characterize the PDE-ejector thrust augmentation. A PDE-ejector system has been designed to provide critical experimental data for assessing the performance enhancements possible with this technology. Completed tasks include demonstration of a thrust stand for measuring average thrust for detonation tube multi-cycle operation, and design of a 72 -in. -long, 2. 25 -in. -diameter (ID) detonation tube and modular <b>ejector</b> <b>assembly.</b> This assembly will allow testing of both straight and contoured ejector geometries. Initial ejectors that have been fabricated are 72 -in. -long-constant-diameter tubes (4 -, 5 -, and 6 -in. -diameter) instrumented with high-frequency pressure transducers. The assembly has been designed such that the detonation tube exit can be positioned at various locations within the ejector tube. PDE-ejector system experiments with gaseous ethylene/ nitrogen/oxygen propellants will commence in the very near future. The program benefits from collaborations with Prof. Merkle of University of Tennessee whose PDE-ejector analysis helps guide the experiments. The present research effort will increase the TRL of PDE-ejectors from its current level of 2 to a level of 3...|$|E
