Our findings confirmed positive associations between IQ and the facets of Competence and Dutifulness (ranging 0. 11 - 0. 27), with academic achievement showing correlations of 0. 27 and 0. 15 with these same facets and 0. 15 with Deliberation.

40|$|International audienceIn Xenopus, the Spemann {{organiser}} {{is defined}} as a dorsal territory in the early gastrula that initiates development of the embryonic axis. It has been shown that the early zygotic transcription factor Siamois is essential for Spemann's organiser formation. By the onset of gastrulation, the organiser is patterned into a vegetal head organiser, which induces anterior structures upon transplantation, and a more animal trunk organiser, which induces a posterior neuraxis. However, it is unclear when these distinct organiser domains are initially specified. To shed light on this question, we analysed the temporal activity of Siamois, as this factor induces both head and trunk development, when ectopically expressed via mRNA injection. In this study, we expressed Siamois ectopically at different time points and analysed the extent of axial development. Using a hormone- inducible version of Siamois, we found evidence for a tight window of competence during which ventral cells can respond to Siamois by commencing both the head and the trunk <b>genetic</b> programmes. The <b>competence</b> to form Spemann's organiser was lost 2 h before gastrulation, although partial axis formation could still occur following delayed activation of Siamois. We demonstrate that this late response to Siamois involves a new role for this gene, which can indirectly repress ventral gene expression, in the absence of known organiser genes.

40|$|Background: Aedes aegypti is {{the main}} {{mosquito}} vector of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). Previous population <b>genetic</b> and vector <b>competence</b> studies have demonstrated substantial genetic structure and major differences {{in the ability to}} transmit dengue viruses in Ae. aegypti populations in Mexico. Methodology/Principal Findings: Population genetic studies revealed that the intersection of the Neovolcanic axis (NVA) with the Gulf of Mexico coast in the state of Veracruz acts as a discrete barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypti populations north and south of the NVA. The mosquito populations north and south of the NVA also differed in their vector competence (VC) for dengue serotype 2 virus (DENV 2). The average VC rate for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from populations from north of the NVA was 0. 55; in contrast the average VC rate for mosquitoes from populations from south of the NVA was 0. 20. Most of this variation was attributable to a midgut infection and escape barriers. In Ae. aegypti north of the NVA 21. 5 % failed to develop midgut infections and 30. 3 % of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection. In contrast, south of the NVA 45. 2 % failed to develop midgut infections and 62. 8 % of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection.

40|$|Bacteria are small, single-cell {{organisms that}} need to survive in rapidly {{changing}} environmental conditions. The alterations in temperature, osmolarity, pH, salinity {{and the availability of}} nutrients, has driven bacteria to develop different strategies that help them to survive in the environment. The ability of a bacterium to occupy various niches and cope with stress conditions strongly depends on its genetic content. Strikingly, it often occurs that only part of the bacterial population develops survival strategies such as spore or biofilm formation or <b>genetic</b> <b>competence.</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>competence</b> is the ability to undergo genetic transformation: a process that involves the acquisition of naked DNA from the extracellular environment. At least 40 different bacterial species are known to be naturally transformable, among which Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (10). In most of these species competence development is a physiological state controlled by a specific regulon, involving quorum sensing and responses to nutrition limitations (1, 11). Therefore, it is possible that many more bacterial species {{will turn out to be}} competent for transformation.

40|$|Streptococcus suis is Gram-positive {{bacterium}} and {{its natural}} habitat is the {{upper respiratory tract}} of pigs, {{and in particular the}} tonsils and nasal cavity. Although it {{is considered to be a}} normal member of the adult pig microbiome, it can cause serious diseases in pigs and humans. S. suis is in fact one of the most important swine pathogens world-wide, causing a wide variety of diseases in pigs including septicemia, arthritis, endocarditis, and meningitis that leads often to a rapid death within 1 - 2 days. Although most human infections are considered the consequence of occupational exposure, in the last years the number of human cases has increased and isolates with multi-resistance genes have been isolated. Human infection caused by S. suis are characterized by a similar symptomatology  as in pigs. Despite the economic loss in the pork industry due to S. suis infection and its importance as emerging zoonotic agent, experimental studies of S. suis virulence and pathology have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for genetic transformation and the lack of a simple, cost-effective model to investigate S. suis virulence. In some streptococcal species, genetic transformation can be carried out very efficiently as these species can be experimentally induced to take-up and recombine homologous extracellular DNA. The discovery of natural competence in some streptococci and the potential of opening up new avenues for genetic analysis of S. suis, was the motivation for investigating natural competence in this important pathogen. In Chapter 2 we showed that a peptide pheromone induces competence in S. suis. The induction was dependent on ComX, a sigma factor that controls the streptococcal late competence regulon; the  SigX-inducing peptide (XIP); and ComR, a regulator of comX. XIP was identified as an N-terminally truncated variant of ComS. This has resulted in the development of a novel methodology that will enable diverse research groups to accelerate discovery of novel features of S. suis ecology and pathology, especially with respect to virulence. In Chapter 3 we investigated the <b>genetic</b> regulation of <b>competence</b> in S. suis and we provided a hypothetical model of the S. suis transformasome. We verified the essential role of the S. suis major pilin, and CinA for efficient competence development, supporting the notion that our predicted multi-protein transformasome indeed appears to function as described for other streptococci. We have also characterised the differential metabolic states that enable competence, and the metabolic state associated with competence exit (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5 we investigated for the first time the use a zebrafish larvae model to assess the relative virulence of S. suis strains in porcine infections. Because of its convenience and cost-effectiveness, this model may be used to assay virulence of environmental S. suis strains, in particularly those of clinical relevance to infection of pigs and humans. Furthermore, a large number of bacterial mutants and strains can be screened for their virulence and in vivo pathogenicity, opening up new avenues to investigate the so far undiscovered pathways mediating successful host infection by S. suis. In Chapter 6 we applied these two innovative methods (the competence system and the zebrafish larval model) to characterize two different two-component systems (TCS) of S. suis. TCS are important players in the regulation of bacterial adaptation to changes in environmental conditions, including those encountered in the host during infection. In this study, we studied the role of the two TCS of S. suis 2 strain S 10 in virulence and in the survival of the bacteria in the bloodstream and host tissue.

40|$|The type IV {{secretion}} {{system can}} be classified as a large family of macromolecule transporters divided in three recognized sub-families involved in different bacterial functions. The major sub-family of T 4 SS is the conjugation system, which allows transfer of genetic material as a nucleoprotein via cell contact among bacteria. Analogously to bacterial conjugation, the T 4 SS can transfer genetic material from bacteria to eukaryotic cells; {{such is the case}} of T-DNA transfer of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to host plant cells. The system of effector proteins transport constitutes the second sub-family, being indispensable for infection processes of several mammalian and plants pathogens. The third sub-family corresponds to the DNA uptake/release system involved in <b>genetic</b> transformation <b>competence,</b> independently of cell contact, as it was described to the systems VirB/D 4 from Campylobacter jejuni and ComB form Helicobacter pylori. Several essential features of T 4 SS are well known, but the knowledge in support of an uncomplicated classification or proper protein annotation of system subunits remains confusing, which in same cases can avoid making inferences about evolution of the system in bacterial species. The purpose of this work was to organize, classify and integrate the knowledge about T 4 SS through building a database devoted to this bacterial secretion system. The T 4 SS database was created using the SGBD MySQL and Perl programming language and with a web interface (HTML/CGI) that gives access to the database. Currently, this database hold genomic data from 43 bacteria and 10 plasmids acquired from the GenBank NCBI, these organisms comprise groups from Actionobacteria to Gram-negative Proteobacteria including symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. By applying Bidirectional Best-Hits method was possible to get a core set of 75 clusters with 974 proteins involved in the T 4 SS. Also, during this procedure BlastP, Muscle e ClustalW algorithms were applied. The database was manually annotated supported by cross references built-in the T 4 SS annotation pages, such as the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, COG, InterPro and TCDB {{as well as by the}} methods for signal peptide and transmembrane regions prediction. All T 4 SS protein records scattered into 75 ortholog clusters were organized into five different classes of type IV secretion system proteins: (i) Type IVA Mpf/T 4 CP; (ii) Type IVA Dtr; (iii) F-type plasmid; (iv) IncP- 1 -type plasmid; (v) Type IVB Icm/Dot. All 974 proteins were annotated into 68 well-known families, which can be involved in conjugation, effector translocator, DNA uptake/release or even can be bifunctional proteins. Also, by using the Maximum Likelihood method were built 70 unrooted phylogenetic trees that represents just 70 clusters instead of 75, this is due to five clusters had only two protein sequences, five unrooted phylogenetic trees were built for each group of first hierarchical classification, one unrooted phylogenetic trees including proteins from archetype systems of all groups, one unrooted phylogenetic trees from 16 S sequence of each organism and one rooted tree including a sequence from a Gram-positive bacteria as an external group. The phylogenetic analyses show that some proteins of T 4 SS are more divergent than others, which indicate that for a particular function few sequence mutations were needed, but other proteins required many sequence mutations to get another functions. Thus, these results proved that proteins belong to the same cluster show different functions: conjugation, DNA uptake/release or effector translocator. Consequently, it was possible verify that similar functions were grouped together within phylogenetic tree, which allowed to annotate a probable function of some uncharacterized proteins, that is possibly due to the sequence similarity may reveal a similar evolution to get the same function. Thus, the phylogenetic trees allowed confirming the protein annotation as well as inferring whether uncharacterized proteins would encompass a known function. The T 4 SS database will be an open access, given to the users searching and submission sequence tools, which will permit to get insights about classification and phylogeny of T 4 SS sequence of interest.

A última subfamília corresponde ao sistema DNA-uptake/release" que funciona independente de contato com uma célula alvo, representado pelos sistemas VirB/D 4 de Campylobacter jejuni e ComB de Helicobacter pylori. Muitas características básicas do T 4 SS são bem conhecidas, entretanto o conhecimento para a classificação simples e intuitiva ou a anotação apropriada das proteínas ainda não está claro, impedindo em alguns casos estabelecer correlações evolutivas deste sistema em bactérias. O objetivo deste trabalho foi o de organizar, classificar e integrar o conhecimento do T 4 SS através da construção de um banco de dados especializado para este sistema secretório bacteriano. O banco de dados T 4 SS foi criado utilizando o SGBD MySQL e a linguagem de programação Perl e com uma interface web (HTML/CGI) que fornece acesso ao banco. Este banco consta atualmente com 43 genomas bacterianos e 10 plasmídeos obtidos do GenBank NCBI, estes organismos vão desde Actinobactérias até Proteobactérias Gram-negativas, incluindo simbiontes e patogênicos. Foi utilizada a metodologia do Bidirectional Best-Hits", com a qual foi possível obter um conjunto mínimo de 75 clusters" com 974 proteínas envolvidas no T 4 SS. Também, durante este procedimento foram utilizados os algoritmos BlastP, Muscle e ClustalW. O banco foi anotado manualmente utilizando referências cruzadas incluídas nas páginas de anotação do T 4 SS, tais como UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, COG, InterPro e TCDB e métodos para predição de regiões de peptídeos sinal e transmembrana. As análises do banco T 4 SS permitiram criar uma classificação hierárquica e funcional para as proteínas do T 4 SS, consistindo em cinco grupos: (i) Type IVA Mpf/T 4 CP; (ii) Type IVA Dtr; (iii) F-type plasmid; (iv) IncP- 1 -type plasmid; (v) Type IVB Icm/Dot). As 974 proteínas foram anotadas em 68 famílias conhecidas, as quais podem estar envolvidas em conjugação, transferência de T-DNA, transferência de proteínas efetoras, DNA-uptake/release" ou bem serem proteínas bifuncionais. Também, através do método de máxima verossimilhança foram geradas 70 árvores filogenéticas não enraizadas (NR) representando apenas 70 clusters, já que cinco clusters apresentaram apenas duas seqüências de proteínas, cinco árvores filogenéticas NR foram criadas para cada grupo da primeira categoria hierárquica, uma árvore NR com representantes de todos os grupos, uma árvore NR gerada a partir das seqüências 16 S de cada organismo e uma árvore de um cluster incluindo uma seqüência de bactéria Gram-positiva como grupo externo. As análises filogenéticas mostram que determinadas proteínas do sistema são mais divergentes que outras, indicando que para uma determinada função poucas mutações de seqüências foram necessárias, já outras proteínas precisaram de maiores mutações para adquirir outras funções. Por isso, verifica-se que proteínas de um mesmo cluster apresentam diferentes funções: conjugação, DNA-uptake/release", traslocadores de proteínas efetoras. Conseqüentemente, foi possível verificar que funções semelhantes se agruparam juntas nas árvores filogenéticas, permitindo anotar uma função provável das proteínas ainda não caracterizadas (unknown"), isto possivelmente devido a que em virtude de sua semelhança de seqüências, possivelmente evoluíram para realizar a mesma função. Assim, as arvores possuíram a finalidade de confirmar a anotação e contribuíram permitindo inferir se os unknown" ou probable" podem ser de uma determinada classificação funcional. O banco T 4 SS será de uso público, oferecendo ao usuário ferramentas de buscas e submissão de seqüências, as quais permitirão inferir respostas sobre a classificação e filogenia da seqüência T 4 SS de interesse. O banco de dados T 4 SS pode ser acessado na URL: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>competence</b> is a {{phenotypic}} {{state of}} a bacterial cell {{in which it}} is capable of importing DNA, presumably to hasten its exploration of alternate genes in its quest for survival under stress. Recently, it was proposed that this transition is uncorrelated among different cells in the colony. Motivated by several discovered signaling mechanisms which create colony-level responses, we present a model for the influence of quorum-sensing signals on a colony of B. Subtilis cells during the transition to <b>genetic</b> <b>competence.</b> Coupling to the external signal creates an effective inhibitory mechanism, which results in anti-correlation between the cycles of adjacent cells. We show that this scenario is consistent with the specific experimental measurement, which fails to detect some underlying collective signaling mechanisms. Rather, we suggest other parameters that should be used to verify the role of a quorum-sensing signal. We also study the conditions under which phenotypic spatial patterns may emerge...|$|E

Roughly one-half of the pBS 32 located genes encode for phagelike proteins, but the phage-like particles {{have been shown to}} be defective and did not kill B. subtilis (Myagmarjav et al. 2016). ComI 3610, together with RapP and possibly further, hitherto undetected proteins encoded by pBS 32 might promote the intracellular persistence of the plasmid as they, through diminution of <b>genetic</b> <b>competence,</b> prevent the uptake of other, possibly competing plasmids into the cell. The task of plasmid persistence might therefore require a much more drastic way of competence inhibition for ComI 3610 than is required for the competence-regulating, but not competence-thwarting ComIDSM 13.|$|E
40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>competence</b> is {{the natural}} ability of a cell to bind and take up {{exogenous}} DNA. In B. subtilis, a Gram-positive soil bacterium, <b>genetic</b> <b>competence</b> develops when the cells are at high density. The cells determine {{the density of the}} culture by cell-cell signaling. Cells monitor two peptide factors, competence stimulatory factor (CSF) and ComX pheromone, whose accumulation signals the initiation of competence. I purified the competence stimulatory factor (CSF) from culture supernatants, and identified it as an unmodified pentapeptide: ERGMT. Synthetic ERGMT peptide has the same effects on competence gene expression as did the purified material and is maximally active at concentrations of 5 - 10 nM. The five amino acid peptide (CSF) is encoded by the C-terminal five codons of a 40 amino acid open reading frame, phrC. ComX pheromone had been previously characterized and is a ten amino acid peptide with a hydrophobic modification on a tryptophan residue. I determined that CSF and ComX pheromone are sensed by two differen...|$|E
40|$|Development of <b>genetic</b> <b>competence</b> in Bacillus subtilis is {{regulated}} by ComP^ComA, a two-component signal transduction system. The response regulator ComA is primarily activated by ComP, a histidine kinase that mediates response to nutrient conditions and cell density, and the activated ComA {{is required for}} transcription of the srf operon, which {{is essential for the}} development of <b>genetic</b> <b>competence</b> and surfactin production. In this study we suggested that the ComA could also be activated by a small molecule phospho-donor, acetyl phosphate. Examination of srfA-lacZ expression indicated that a significant amount of srfA expression still occurs in the comP mutant during growth in a sporulation medium containing excess glucose. Analysis of a comP and pta mutant suggests that srfA activation seen in the comP mutant is dependent on the expression of pta, which encodes phosphotransacetylase (Pta). As Pta is responsible for the catalysis for conversion of acetyl coenzyme A to acetyl phosphate, we conclude that the expression of srfA seen in the comP mutant is mainly due t...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus sanguinis is an {{important}} component of the dental plaque biofilm and is believed to play a beneficial role in the oral cavity. S. sanguinis is also a leading cause of infective endocarditis (IE), a potentially lethal infection of the cardiac valves. S. sanguinis possesses <b>genetic</b> <b>competence,</b> the ability to acquire exogenous DNA into its genome. In the well characterized system of S. pneumoniae, <b>genetic</b> <b>competence</b> requires a quorum sensing system encoded by the early comCDE genes, as well as late genes controlled by the alternate sigma factor, ComX. Previous studies in other streptococcal species have suggested functions for the com regulon apart from DNA uptake. Here we characterized functions of the S. sanguinis com regulon genes in <b>genetic</b> <b>competence,</b> IE virulence, and biofilm formation. Our findings indicated that the early regulatory genes and those under the control of ComX in S. sanguinis play similar roles in <b>genetic</b> <b>competence</b> as their orthologs in other competent streptococci; however the sequence and mechanism of processing of the quorum sensing signal, competence-stimulating peptide, CSP, were determined to be unique. Using a rabbit endocarditis model, we determined that the comCDE and comX genes were not required for virulence, bacteremia, or pathology under a variety of infection conditions. In contrast, examination of biofilms by microscopy and crystal violet staining indicated that S. sanguinis CSP enhanced biofilm formation in a comDE-dependent manner. Deletion of the early com gene SSA_ 0195 eliminated this effect, while expression of the gene from an inducible promoter increased biofilm formation in the absence of CSP. Deletion of the comX gene resulted in biofilms with increased staining, cell death, and profoundly altered structure. Treatment with DNase I reduced biofilm formation in a com-independent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that expression of SSA_ 0195 is both necessary and sufficient for CSP-dependent biofilm enhancement, and that the late gene activator, ComX, is required to maintain normal biofilm architecture. Our findings suggest the com regulon of S. sanguinis may be {{an important}} determinant of competitiveness in the mouth, where native CSP production may occur at levels sufficient to influence biofilm formation...|$|E
40|$|Streptococcus mutans secretes and {{utilizes}} a 21 -amino-acid signaling peptide pheromone {{to initiate}} quorum sensing for <b>genetic</b> <b>competence,</b> biofilm formation, stress responses, and bacteriocin production. In this study, we {{designed and synthesized}} a series of truncated peptides and peptides with amino acid substitutions to investigate their structure-activity relationships based on the three-dimensional structures of S. mutans wild-type signaling peptide UA 159 sp and C-terminally truncated peptide TPC 3 from mutant JH 1005 defective in <b>genetic</b> <b>competence.</b> By analyzing these peptides, we demonstrated that the signaling peptide of S. mutans has at least two functional domains. The C-terminal structural motif consisting of a sequence of polar hydrophobic charged residues is crucial for activation of the signal transduction pathway, while the core α-helical structure extending from residue 5 {{to the end of}} the peptide is required for receptor binding. Peptides in which three or more residues were deleted from the C terminus did not induce <b>genetic</b> <b>competence</b> but competitively inhibited quorum sensing activated by UA 159 sp. Disruption of the amphipathic α-helix by replacing the Phe- 7, Phe- 11, or Phe- 15 residue with a hydrophilic residue resulted in a significant reduction in or complete loss of the activity of the peptide. In contrast to the C-terminally truncated peptides, these peptides with amino acid substitutions did not compete with UA 159 sp to activate quorum sensing, suggesting that disruption of the hydrophobic face of the α-helical structure results in a peptide that is not able to bind to the receptor. This study is the first study to recognize the importance of the signaling peptide C-terminal residues in streptococcal quorum sensing...|$|E

Antitoxins neutralize the toxic effect of cognate Toxins by protein-protein interactions and sequestering the active residues of the Toxin. Toxins target essential bacterial processes, mostly translation and replication. However, one class apart is constituted by the PezAT pair because the PezT toxin target cell wall biosynthesis. Here we {{have examined the}} role of the pezAT toxin-antitoxin genes in its natural host, the pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pezAT operon on Pneumococcal Pathogenicity Island 1 was deleted from strain R 6 and its phenotypic traits were compared with those of the wild type. The mutant cells formed shorter chains during exponential phase, leading to increased colony-forming units. At stationary phase, the mutant was more resilient to lysis. Importantly, the mutant exhibited higher resistance to antibiotics targeting cell walls (β-lactams), but not to antibiotics acting at other levels. In addition, the mutants also showed enhanced <b>genetic</b> <b>competence.</b> We suggest that PezAT participates in a subtle equilibrium between loss of functions (resistance to β-lactams and <b>genetic</b> <b>competence)</b> and gain of other traits (virulence) ...|$|E
