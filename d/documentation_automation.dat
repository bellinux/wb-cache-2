40|$|My thesis investigates using a {{graphical}} representation of user interfaces - screenshots - {{as a direct}} visual reference to support various kinds of applications. We have built several systems to demonstrate and validate this idea in domains like searching <b>documentation,</b> GUI <b>automation</b> and testing, and cross-device information migration. In particular, Sikuli Search enables users to search documentation using screenshots of GUI elements instead of keywords. Sikuli Script enables users to programmatically control GUIs without support from the underlying applications. Sikuli Test lets GUI developers and testers create test scripts without coding. Deep Shot introduces a framework and interaction techniques to migrate work states across heterogeneous devices in one action, taking a picture. We also discuss challenges inherent in screenshot-based interactions and propose potential solutions and directions of future research. by Tsung-Hsiang Chang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Evolving the {{database}} {{that is at}} the core of an Information System represents a difficult maintenance problem that has only been studied in the framework of traditional information systems. However, the problem is likely to be even more severe in web information systems, where open-source software is often developed through the contributions and collaboration of many groups and individuals. Therefore, in this paper, we present an indepth analysis of the evolution history of the Wikipedia database and its schema; Wikipedia is the best-known example of a large family of web information systems built using the open-source software MediaWiki. Our study is based on: (i) a set of Schema Modification Operators that provide a simple conceptual representation for complex schema changes, and (ii) simple software tools to automate the analysis. This framework allowed us to dissect and analyze the 4. 5 years of Wikipedia history, which was short in time, but intense in terms of growth and evolution. Beyond confirming the initial hunch about the severity of the problem, our analysis suggests the need for developing better methods and tools to support graceful schema evolution. Therefore, we briefly discuss <b>documentation</b> and <b>automation</b> support systems for database evolution, and suggest that the Wikipedia case study can provide the kernel of a benchmark for testing and improving such systems. ...|$|R

Whereas large generation units and large controllable loads might in general be controllable in a manual way, this is no option for small distributed generators and loads. With flexibility control in multiple owner scenarios, <b>documentation,</b> transparency and <b>automation</b> are of crucial importance. In this work, we present a fully automated congestion management approach based {{on a combination of}} distributed ledger technology and distributed algorithms in an agent-based architectural approach. We present a case study focused on the visualization of the concept and discuss the advantages and possible challenges for this approach. Whereas distributed ledger technology has been introduced for peer-to-peer energy trading within the last years, no similar approach has been presented yet for stable distribution grid management.|$|R

Review of current business methods uncovered several areas of improvement including; operating efficiency, document routing, accountability, reporting, records management, format standardization, and control system interaction. A new Defense Programs (DP) facility at the Savannah River Site (SRS) is implementing an electronic procedure environment {{to overcome these}} challenges. Electronic procedures merge disciplines of design engineering, procedure writing, controls engineering, and operations into a central development platform for creating optimal plant processes. Users develop procedures {{through a combination of}} logical flowcharts, customizable properties, and Distributed Control System (DCS) functions resulting in the generation of static and dynamic operating procedures, software <b>documentation,</b> and <b>automation</b> code. Execution of developed procedures occurs in a single, uniform, procedure-oriented interface designed specifically for the operator in order to reduce process mistakes, present online information, list approved procedures, organize systems, launch audible alerts, and strengthen communications with automation. Creation of executed documents upon procedure completion and custom reports containing detailed shift turnover information are additional managerial benefits incorporated into the interface. Initial and continuing application improvements from an evaluation of developer feedback, process configurations, and facility integration are reviewed. Incorporation of manual and automated electronic procedures into the Novatech D/ 3 Distributed Control System (DCS) and other sub-systems is also discussed with specific examples. A final analysis is performed on the results of meeting facility challenges and potential areas for new application expansion and growth...|$|R
40|$|When using {{emulation}} {{to render}} digital objects, a dedicated system environment is required. This environment typically {{consists of a}} set of software, i. e. an emulator, replicating the original hardware, operating system, hardware drivers, application as well as tools and utilities. Typically such technical meta-data is modelled using a view-path. Configuration and operating knowledge, however, is also required and needs to be described and preserved to secure deterministic future environment and workflow replication. One possible solution is to capture and replay human-machine interaction in an abstract way. A model for recording and capturing interactions between human users and an emulated machine has already been proposed. With the integration of such a system in an Emulation-as-a-Service service model, usability has been improved significantly by integration the capturing and replay into EaaS workflows. This demo’s purpose is to demonstrate the system’s usability and utility for digital preservation tasks like <b>automation,</b> <b>documentation</b> and replication of interactive tasks...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), which strives to integrate all manufacturing functions into a unified platform of informational and computational resources, the function of process planning (or the process planner) is prominent. It has been stated that CIM, to a large extent, {{is the result of}} automating process planning going from computer aided design (CAD) to computer aided manufacturing (CAM). Certain variables of the complex task of process planning are viewed as mapping functions between design features and related machining strategies. Once a machining feature is identified, decision variables are defined in terms of a set of most relevant input variables pertaining to part description and related to the equipment capabilities. For the machinist (or process planner), this is a decision making process. For automation this is a mapping process reducing to an implicit relationship between process variables providing the decision processor the capability to capture vagueness in a real world situation. For the human this is a result of situational experience that results in the domain expertise or knowledge set. For automation this requires solicitation, <b>documentation</b> and <b>automation</b> of machining knowledge, and a knowledge processor that yields a useful result. The useful result would be a manufacturing assistant capable of providing the automated process planning with equivalent to human decisions regarding a particular manufacturing strategy and being relatively vendor independent. This paper submits a framework approach and verified results of interrogating a CAD drawing for information useful in determining manufacturing strategies required for CAM, utilizing a data collectionknowledge acquisition strategy and s ubsequent artificial [...] ...|$|R
