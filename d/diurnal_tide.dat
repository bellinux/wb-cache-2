The morning observation before 10 or 11 a.m. always gives a higher result than at noon, though the sun's declination is so considerably less, and in the hottest {{part of the day}} it is lower still (3.30 p.m. 109 degrees), an effect no doubt due to the vapours raised by the sun, and which equally interfere with the photometer observations. The N.W. winds invariably rise at about 9 a.m. and blow with increasing strength till sunset; they are due to the rarefaction of the air over the heated ground, and being loaded with dust, the temperature of the atmosphere is hence raised by the heated particles. The increased temperature of the afternoon is therefore not so much due to the accumulation of caloric from the sun's rays, as to the passage of a heated current of air derived from the much hotter regions to the westward.

5000|$|Since {{the time}} of Laplace (1799), {{scientists}} had been puzzled as to why pressure variations measured at the Earth's surface associated with the semi-diurnal solar tide dominate those of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> in amplitude, when intuitively one would expect the diurnal (daily) passage of the sun to dominate. Lord Kelvin (1882) had proposed the so-called [...] "resonance" [...] theory, wherein the semi-diurnal tide would be [...] "selected" [...] over the diurnal oscillation if the atmosphere was somehow able to oscillate freely at a period of very close to 12 hours, {{in the same way}} that overtones are selected on a vibrating string. By the second half of the twentieth century, however, observations had failed to confirm this hypothesis, and an alternative hypothesis was proposed that something must instead suppress the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide.</b> In 1961, Manfred Siebert suggested that absorption of solar insolation by tropospheric water vapour might account for the reduction of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide.</b> However, he failed to include a role for stratospheric ozone. This was rectified in 1963 by the Australian physicist Stuart Thomas Butler and his student K.A. Small who showed that stratospheric ozone absorbs an even greater part of the solar insolation.|$|E
50|$|A third {{influence}} {{occurs because}} the moon orbits {{at an angle}} to the equator.

For example, there is a <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> in the Ross Sea near Antarctica every 24.84 hours. The height of this tide dwindles to almost zero in a cycle which takes 13.66 days.

McKenzie, Lindzen extended the theory to include a term for Newtonian cooling due to emission of infrared radiation by carbon dioxide in the stratosphere along with ozone photochemical processes, and then in 1968 he showed that the theory also predicted that the semi-diurnal oscillation would be insensitive to variations in the temperature profile, which is why it is observed so much more strongly and regularly at the surface.|$|E

50|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{large-scale}} atmospheric waves within the lower atmosphere exist: internal waves with finite vertical wavelengths which can transport wave energy upward; and external waves with infinitely large wavelengths which cannot transport wave energy. Atmospheric gravity waves {{and most of}} the atmospheric tides generated within the troposphere belong to the internal waves. Their density amplitudes increase exponentially with height, so that at the mesopause these waves become turbulent and their energy is dissipated (similar to breaking of ocean waves at the coast), thus contributing to the heating of the thermosphere by about 250 K in eq.(2). On the other hand, the fundamental <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> labelled (1, −2) which is most efficiently excited by solar irradiance is an external wave and plays only a marginal role within lower and middle atmosphere. However, at thermospheric altitudes, it becomes the predominant wave. It drives the electric Sq-current within the ionospheric dynamo region between about 100 and 200 km height.|$|E
50|$|The {{classical}} {{theory of}} Earth tides first became established in 1909,primarily to explain nutations, {{but are also}} used in Earth rotation predictions. The semi-diurnal tide (one maximum every 12 or so hours) is primarily lunar (only S2 is purely solar) and gives rise to sectorial deformations which rise and fall {{at the same time}} along the same longitude.Sectorial variations of vertical and east-west displacements are maximum at the equator and vanish at the poles. There are two cycles along each latitude, the bulges opposite one another, and the depressions similarly opposed.The <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> is lunisolar, and gives rise to tesseral deformations. The vertical and east-west movement is maximum at 45° latitude and is zero on the equator and at the poles.Tesseral variation have one cycle per latitude, one bulge and one depression; the bulges are opposed (antipodal), that is to say {{the western part of the}} northern hemisphere and the eastern part of the southern hemisphere, for example, and similarly the depressions are opposed, the eastern part of the northern hemisphere and the western part of the southern hemisphere, in this case.Finally, fortnightly and semi-annual tides have zonal deformations (constant along a circle of latitude), as the Moon or Sun gravitation is directed alternately away from the northern and southern hemispheres due to tilt. There is zero vertical displacement at 35°16' latitude.|$|E
5000|$|Long-Period tides are {{gravitational}} tides, typically with amplitudes {{of a few}} centimeters or {{less and}} periods longer than one day, generated by changes in the Earth's orientation relative to the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. The distance between a reference point {{on the surface of}} the Earth relative to these objects can be expressed as an infinite combination of periods and, as the distance changes, so does the tidal forcing. An analysis of the changing distance by Pierre-Simon de Laplace in the 18th century shows that these periods at which gravity varies cluster into three species, the semi-diurnal and <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> constituents which have periods of a day or less, and the long period tidal constituents (see also tide). Long period tidal constituents with relatively strong forcing include the lunar fortnightly (Mf) and monthly (Ms) as well as the solar semiannual (Ssa) and annual (Sa) constituents. In addition to having periods longer than a day-long period tidal forcing is distinguished from that of the first and second species by being zonally symmetric. The long period tides are also distinguished by the way in which the oceans respond. In contrast to the first and second species, the long period tidal forcings occur sufficiently slowly that they do not excite surface gravity waves. This property of exciting surface gravity waves is responsible for the high amplitude semi-diurnal tides in the Bay of Fundy, for example. In contrast, the ocean responds to long period tidal forcing with a combination of an equilibrium tidal response along with a possible excitation of barotropic Rossby wave normal modes ...|$|E

An obvious 16 -day wave can be observed from raw wind data.

Sum and difference interactions between the 16 -day wave and the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> are observed to have rather different intensities.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> and planetary waves (PWs) in the troposphere and lower stratosphere (TLS) over Yichang (111 ° 18 ' E, 30 ° 42 ' N) were studied {{by using the}} data from intensive radiosonde observations in August 2006 (summer month) and January 2007 (winter month) on an eight-times-daily basis. The radiosonde observations of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> and PWs in the TLS in the mid-latitudes have seldom been reported. We find that there exists dominant diurnal oscillations in the TLS over Yichang. The observed <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> consists of significant nonmigrating components, which may be owning to the local latent heat release. Since the nonmigrating tides are usually composed of high order modes with smaller vertical wavelengths, which are prone to dissipation {{in comparison with the}} low order modes, the observational tidal amplitudes decrease sharply at several heights. Some evident discrepancies between the observations and the GSWM- 02 are found, which may result mainly from the inaccurate prediction of the nonmigrating tidal components by the GSWM- 02. And, due to the evident seasonal differences of the water vapor mixing ratio disturbance and the tropospheric jet induced turbulence in winter, the diurnal tides in the summer and winter months have some different characteristics. Besides the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide,</b> obvious quasi 7 -day PW (QSDPW) and quasi 10 -day PW (QTDPW) are also recognized from our observations in both the summer and winter months. The QSDPWs in the troposphere in both the summer and winter months show a standing wave structure, while the QTDPWs generally exhibit traveling wave characteristics. Spectral analyses reveal that some waves with periods around that of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> are generated due to the interactions of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> and PWs and the tidal amplitudes are modulated by the PWs, indicating the extensive coupling between the <b>diurnal</b> <b>tide</b> and PWs.
