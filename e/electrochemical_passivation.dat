40|$|Cold rolled SS is also fruitfully used in {{deep drawing}} however the {{presence}} of scales or oxides on the surface reduces {{the life of the}} tools and emphasises creep phenomena of the material. Then a cleaning of the SS surface from these impurities is necessary. Oxides can be formed during the hot rolling preceding the cold one, or during the annealing performed between the several steps of thickness reduction. The annealing helps to decrease the work hardening occurring during the process.

40|$|AbstractElectro-osmosis is {{considered}} promising in effectively strengthening silts. This {{has been an}} urgent issue for engineers as large volumes of silts are being generated each year {{and need to be}} properly disposed. Electrode material {{is one of the key}} elements for the electro-osmosis technique. Inconsistent results have been reported in the existing literature on common electrode materials. To clarify these discrepancies and to optimize the electrode material, laboratory tests were performed with four common materials, namely, iron, graphite, copper and aluminum, under three levels of voltage gradient. Observations were performed from the perspectives of the electro-osmotic effect and the ionic strength. As for the former perspective, the electro-osmotic effect was denoted by the drainage, the water content and the effective potential. The graphite electrode was found to perform better at high potentials than iron or copper. The copper electrode exhibited a rapid decrease in the effective potential and current. As for the latter perspective, contents of Fe, Cu and Al were detected in the drainage and soils. Aluminum ions were demonstrated to have higher migration capacities than iron or cupric ions. Further analysis determined that electro-osmosis relies on ions in the original soils instead of those generated by electrode reactions. In conclusion, iron is recommended as the preferable electrode material for electro-osmosis. The performance of different electrode materials is directly reflected by the voltage loss rather than by the ion migration process. The voltage loss can be attributed to various factors, such as corrosion, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>passivation,</b> gas evolution, decomposition and electrochemical potential.

Gallium phosphide however has been studied insufficiently. As regards anodic etching of gallium phosphide there are almost no literature data, and it is not known whether gallium phosphide can be subjected to anodic etching. The passage of current through the electrochemical cell is accompanied by cathodic and anodic electrode reactions on the electrode. The following processes can take place on the anode: dissolution, formation of the phase film, anodic dissolution through the film, total passivation. Anodic dissolution can take place if the products of the anodic reaction are simple ions easily transferred into the electrolyte. The dissolution of the anode is inhibited and then interrupted, if the products of the anodic reaction are low-solubility oxides. The process of anodic dissolution of gallium phosphide is thermodynamically possible, because the electrode potentials of gallium and phosphorus are lower than the potentials of the molecules of water and OH - ions present in the electrolyte. The possibility of this dissolution could be predicted by the handbook diagrams published in Ref. 4, the diagrams of the Me-H_ 2 _O state at different pH values of the medium and the anode potential. However they are not available for gallium phosphide and, consequently, the possibility of anodic dissolution of the gallium phosphide can be evaluated only by experiments, by examining the polarisation characteristics, i. e. the relationship between the potential of the electrode and the intensity of anodic current-from the presence of areas on the polarisation curves with the logarithmic (Tafel) dependence, corresponding to the region of active dissolution of the electrode.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{cathodic}} protection is the most useful method for stopping corrosion when the deterioration process has started, but the most important issue that is still missing in the cathodic protection studies is how to check its efficiency in a reliable way. This paper presents results of the protection efficiency obtained in different cathodic-protected structures. This efficiency has been measured by traditional methods, which check the proper function of the cathodic protection by switching off the current and either measuring the polarized potential or by recording the evolution of the potential decay. These methods, although based on much experience, do not provide information directly {{about the state of the}} metal, and interpretation of the results is not always evident. On the other hand, a new <b>electrochemical</b> technique called <b>passivation</b> verification technique (PVT) have been used for the cathodic protection efficiency measurements.

The passive film on the corrosion-resistant steel presents a bilayer structure: an outer layer enriched in Fe oxides and hydroxides, and an inner layer, rich in Cr species. The film composition varies with pH values and chloride contents. As the pH drops, more Cr oxides are enriched in the film while Fe oxides gradually decompose.

In case of the latter, electrochemistry provides many powerful methods and can be applied {{on a scale from}} submerged shipwrecks to the smallest metal artefacts. In general, all of these electrochemical approaches require evaluation. A powerful way to implement the evaluation is to use synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and other X-ray methods to monitor, for example, an electrochemical process in real time, and an alternative technique to examine the reactivity of the resulting surface. Ultra-low energy dynamic SIMS (uleSIMS) is a new technique in this application, with the virtue that exceptionally small amounts of corrosion can be detected (e. g. incomplete nm-scale layers), so that the surface chemistry of a metal can be studied after treatment and brief exposure to the museum environment, without the need for accelerated corrosion.

40|$|The {{active process}} in a short length of steel wire {{passivated}} by 65 per cent nitric acid has been observed {{under the influence of}} a polarizing current, and the form of the potential recorded by the cathode ray oscillograph. In the passive wire, 80 per cent of the total potential drop takes place at the anode, 20 per cent at the cathode. The change from active to passive states, as measured by the potential change, is very abrupt compared to the duration of activity and the potential curve at a point on the wire is probably almost rectangular. The duration of the refractory state is decreased at the anode and increased at the cathode, as in nerve. This fact is against the idea that reactivity after passivation results from a partial reduction of an oxide layer. Soft iron wire passivated by anodal polarization repassivates after activation in acid of a dilution that fails to passivate it initially. It soon becomes rhythmic with a very short refractory phase, and then reacts continuously. Such a wire exhibits a very sharp alternation between a dark brown oxide coat during activity, and a bright clean surface during passivation. A passive steel wire in nitric acid shows many of the characteristics of an inert electrode such as platinum, and it may be inferred that, superposed upon the primary passivation potential, there exists an electrode or oxidation-reduction potential equilibrium between the effects of the various constituents of the solution. It is suggested that the phenomena of nerve-like reactivity in this system may involve an alternation between two protective coatings of the steel wire. During activity, the surface becomes mechanically coated with a brown oxide. If this coating does not adhere, due to gas convection or to rapid solution of the oxide, passivation does not result. Under sufficiently intense oxidizing conditions, a second oxide coat may form in the interstices of the first, and cover the surface as the first coating dissolves off.

Both {{the behavior of the}} pure elements and the steel were studied and the work focused on the interaction between the pure elements of the steel, which is the least understood area. Upon completion of this work, several aspects are now much clearer. The main results from this work can be summarized as follows: The presence of low concentrations (around 0. 1 mM) of thiocyanate or tetrathionate in dilute sulfuric acid greatly accelerates the anodic dissolution of chromium and nickel, but has an even stronger effect on stainless steels (iron-chromium-nickel alloys). Electrochemical measurements and surface analyses are in agreement with the suggestion that accelerated dissolution really results from suppressed passivation. Even well below the <b>passivation</b> potential, the <b>electrochemical</b> signature of <b>passivation</b> is evident in the electrode impedance; the electrode impedance shows clearly that this pre-passivation is suppressed in the presence of thiocyanate. For the stainless steels, remarkable changes in the morphology of the corroded metal surface and in the surface concentration of chromium support the suggestion that pre-passivation of stainless steels is suppressed because dissolution of chromium is accelerated. Surface analysis confirmed that adsorbed sulfur / sulfide forms on the metal surfaces upon exposure to solutions containing thiocyanate or thiosulfate. For pure nickel, and steels containing nickel (and residual copper), bulk sulfide (visible as a black corrosion product) forms during anodic dissolution. The sulfide is electronically conductive, and gives an increase of several orders of magnitude in the electrode capacitance; the sulfide also causes anodic activation to persist after the pure metals and steels were removed from the thiocyanate-containing electrolyte and transferred to a thiocyanate-free electrolyte. The main practical implications of this work are that low concentrations of reduced sulfur compounds strongly affect anodic dissolution of stainless steels, and that selecting steels with elevated concentrations of chromium, nickel or molybdenum would serve to limit the anodic dissolution rate in the presence of reduced sulfur compounds...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the anisotropy in the surface chemistry of silicon in aqueous KOH solutions. Two main reactions are considered: chemical etching, and <b>electrochemical</b> oxidation and <b>passivation.</b> Anisotropic etching of masked (100) surfaces was used to form V-grooves exposing well-defined (111) facets. With this geometry it was possible to study both the chemical and electrochemical reactions at the (100) and (111) surfaces of the same material, simultaneously (chapter 2). The most striking result is perhaps the very strong anisotropy observed in electrochemical oxidation. The general features of these results could be accounted for by a previously proposed two-step mechanism, in which Si - H surface bonds are converted to Si - OH by an OH- catalyzed reaction and the polarized Si - Si back-bonds are subsequently attacked by water. Anodic current is due to injection of electrons into the conduction band from activated intermediates of the two chemical reactions. This concerted chemical-electrochemical mechanism accounts for the remarkably slow kinetics of anodic oxidation of n-type (111) surfaces. In chapter 3 it is shown that FTIR spectroscopy can be used very effectively to follow in situ the surface chemistry of silicon during anisotropic etching, anodic oxidation and passivation, and etch-back of the passivating oxide. While the first of the two chemical steps described above is generally considered to be rate determining for the chemical and electrochemical processes, the IR measurements show that oxide formation on ideally flat n-type (111) surfaces at room temperature is slow even though there is a considerable Si - OH coverage of the surface. The combination of potential-step and FTIR measurements is particularly effective for such studies. Anodic current transients measured after a potential step on well-defined n-type (111) electrodes can be used to obtain information about the chemical reactivity of the surface. In chapter 4 the effect of additives (hydrogen peroxide and isopropyl alcohol) on the kinetics of surface reactions is described. An electrochemical flow cell in combination with an optical microscope was designed to study in situ changes in morphology of silicon during chemical etching and electrochemical oxidation (chapter 5). The power of this approach was demonstrated by a study in real time of the evolution of the typical roof-tile morphology on Si(110) surfaces. A simple image-processing procedure was developed to quantify the changes in morphological structures. This approach, in combination with ex situ microscopic observation, gives a wealth of information about the relation between etch morphology and parameters such as KOH concentration, applied electrochemical potential and the presence of additives (H 2 O 2). Chapter 6 shows how the V-groove geometry can be employed to measure in situ chemical etch rates, using either electrochemical measurements or in situ optical microscopy. These approaches applied to a test wafer could be used for process control in the batch fabrication of devices. Another very interesting extension of the electrochemical approach is the possibility of following in situ the change in geometry of anisotropically etched deep trenches and buried structures in wafers...|$|R
