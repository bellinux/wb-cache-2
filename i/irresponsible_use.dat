By February 2017, the electrification project had secured $1.3billion in state, local, and regional funding, with the remaining funding gap to be closed by a $647million grant from the FTA's Core Capacity program. The grant had undergone a two-year review process starting in November 2015 under the Obama Administration and received a [...] "medium-high" [...] rating from the FTA in August 2016, and was waiting for a signature from the newly-appointed Trump Administration Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao after a 30-day review period to secure a grant approval. However, during the review period, the fourteen Republican party U.S. House representatives from California {{sent a letter to}} Secretary Chao, urging her to deny funding due to the project's ties with high-speed rail, which they opposed. The letter went on to call the project [...] "an <b>irresponsible</b> <b>use</b> of taxpayer dollars".|$|E
2500|$|The {{field of}} machine ethics is {{concerned}} with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making. The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: [...] "Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and <b>irresponsible</b> <b>use</b> of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The {{time has come for}} adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics {{is concerned with}} the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension {{is at the root of}} all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics." [...] Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition [...] "Machine Ethics" [...] that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.|$|E

40|$|First, {{what is a}} “subtherapeutic”? The Food and Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA/CVM) has {{a variety}} of {{approval}} classifications for antimicrobials in food animals. These include… 1. Improvement in rate of gain 2. Improvement in feed efficiency 3. Control of disease 4. Prevention of disease 5. Treatment of disease The first 2 would fall into the “subtherapeutic” category by all of the definitions I am aware of. This is regardless of whether these applications have an effect on disease or not. Control and prevention of disease are considered therapeutic uses by the FDA/CVM and the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, anti-food animal activist groups attempt to cast control and prevention uses into the “subtherapeutic” categories in an attempt to sway public opinion that these are <b>irresponsible</b> <b>uses.</b> Actually, I don’t know as I have ever heard the FDA/CVM use the term “subtherapeutic”, probably because it is a term designed more to incite public indignation than describe an activity of a drug. It is also typically used to imply that somehow these uses cause more of a problem with selection for resistant bacteria than uses for control, prevention, or treatment. Antimicrobials don’t cause mutations for resistance in bacteria. Antimicrobials select for bacteria in populations which have developed mutations, or have acquired genes for characteristics which allow them to resist the activity of antimicrobials at concentrations above that at which the general population of bacteria would be either growth-inhibited or killed...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{pressing}} environmental issues in Mongolia that are detrimental to {{both human and}} biophysical wellness. These problems have arisen {{in part due to}} natural factors, but increasingly because of human actions. One of these issues is climate change, which will be responsible for an increase in desertification, natural disasters, and land degradation. Another is deforestation, which is expanding due to human recklessness, pests, disease, and fire. Mongolian lands are becoming more arid through desertification, a process that is being exacerbated due to <b>irresponsible</b> land <b>use.</b> Additionally, more and more species are disappearing and at risk for extinction. And, especially in population centers, Mongolians deal with air and water pollution caused by human industrialization.|$|R
50|$|The key water-dependent {{or related}} sectors with the {{potential}} for meeting part of the current and projected demand for jobs in Africa are social services, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, retail and hospitality, manufacturing, construction, natural resources exploitation (including mining) and energy production (including hydro, geothermal and expected fracking for oil and natural gas). All these sectors depend to a varying extent on the availability of, access to, and reliability of water resources. <b>Irresponsible</b> water <b>use</b> by some sectors can create short-term employment, but result in negative impacts on the availability of water resources and jeopardize future jobs in other water-dependant sectors. Climate change, water scarcity and variability have direct impact on the major sector outputs and thus ultimately on the overall economy of most African countries.|$|R
40|$|The MIT {{community}} and the City of Cambridge embarked on initiatives to reduce energy consumption and Greenhouse Gas emissions {{in accordance with the}} Kyoto Protocol which calls for a 20 % reduction in 1990 levels of GHG emissions by 2010. This thesis seeks to expand our understanding of how the MIT campus consumes energy and with that knowledge recommend methods of reducing energy consumption by eliminating <b>irresponsible</b> energy <b>use.</b> Based on the GHG emission map created by Tiffany Groode in her 2004 thesis A Methodology for Assessing MIT's Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the second largest energy consuming building per square foot, Building 18, was selected and analyzed in detail. This thesis proves the high hood density, lack of an exhaust heat recovery system, and <b>irresponsible</b> fume hood <b>use</b> necessitate Building 18 's wasteful consumption of energy. Research revealed that, on average, 67 hoods were left open at night, and 88 were open during daytime use. Of those open hoods, only 5 were in use during the night, and 48 were in use during the day. If the unused hoods were closed the consumption of electricity, steam, and chilled water could be decreased by approximately 17 % and save the Institute $ 350, 000 a year in utility costs. by Steven Thomas Amanti.

50|$|A firearm emits hot gases, powder, {{and other}} debris when discharged. Some weapons, such as {{semi-automatic}} and fully automatic firearms, typically eject spent cartridge casings at high speed. Casings are also dangerously hot when ejected.

40|$|The {{responsibility}} {{is a key}} concept {{in the twentieth century}} because it establishes a connection between the individual and society. Recent studies analyze the responsibility as a relational concept that connects the individual to an event and its outcomes. In that sense, the responsibility may be linked to Markova perspective on dialogicality and social representations because it activates the Ego-Alter-Object dynamic: being responsible for something (Ego) toward someone (Alter), and in relation to an instance (object).

Our results for the period before the 2007 financial crisis suggest that CEO risk-taking incentives are positively related to socially irresponsible activities. In addition, we find that a firm's socially responsible actions may act as a moderator, strengthening the aforementioned relationship. The results after the 2007 financial crisis show no evidence of a significant relationship between CEO risk-taking incentives and socially irresponsible activities. This could be due to the increased scrutiny regarding compensation packages and the increased role of reputational issues {{in the aftermath of the}} financial crisis. Our results suggest that risk-taking incentives embedded in the CEO compensation scheme have implications for corporate policies toward socially irresponsible activities...|$|R
