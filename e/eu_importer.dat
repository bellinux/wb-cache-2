The Hellenic Ministry of National Defense is in charge through the department of General Armaments Directorate (GAD), and the Division of Offsets (DO). The threshold for offset request is EUR10 million. The minimum offset requirement is between 80 and 120%. Multipliers are from 1 to 10. Greece does not accept indirect offsets, since it {{is focused on the}} strengthening of its military capabilities. According to SIPRI data for 2006-2010, Greece is the 5th weapons importer of the world, with a global quota of 4%, about half of India (9%), and two third of Chinas import (6%). It is worth noting that Chinese GDP is about 20 times bigger than Greeces nominal GDP. Greece is the major <b>EU</b> <b>importer</b> of weapons and the first U.S. defense client in the European Union.http://www.mod.mil.gr According to K.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer an {{exploratory}} case study comparing one Brazilian beef processor's relationships supplying two different distribution channels, an <b>EU</b> <b>importer</b> and an EU retail chain operating in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a short review of global value chains and the recent literature on trust. It gives the background to the Brazilian beef chain and presents data obtained through in-depth interviews, annual reports and direct observation with the Brazilian beef processor, the <b>EU</b> <b>importer</b> and the retailer. The interviews were conducted with individual firms, but the analysis places them in a chain context, identifying the links and relationships between the agents of the chains and aiming to describe each distribution channel. Findings - Executive chain governance exercised by the domestic retailer stimulates technical upgrading and transferring of best practices to local. suppliers. Consequently, this kind of relationship results in more trust within the global value chain. Practical implications - There are difficulties and challenges facing this Brazilian beef processor that are party related to the need to comply with increasingly complex and demanding food safety and food quality standards. There is still a gap between practices adopted for the export market and practices adopted locally. The strategies of transnational retailers in offering differentiated beef should be taken in account. Originality/value - The research outlines an interdisciplinary framework able to explain chain relationships and the kind of trust that emerges in relationships between EU importer/retail and a developing country supplier...|$|E
40|$|As of January 1 st 2005, {{a system}} of reduced checks for {{phytosanitary}} inspections of certain plants and plant products imported into the European Union (EU) is in place. Under this system, plants and plant products satisfying special criteria may be inspected with a reduced frequency. These criteria are based on EU-wide data on historical volumes of import and interceptions of harmful organisms in particular products. The objective {{of this paper is}} two-fold. Firstly, the paper analyses whether proportions of interceptions of harmful organisms associated with cut flowers imported into the Netherlands ¿ the largest <b>EU</b> <b>importer</b> of cut flowers ¿ support the application of reduced checks for certain genera and trades (commodity-exporting country combinations) of cut flowers. Secondly, the paper analyses how effective the reduced checks system is in minimizing the expected costs of introduction of harmful organisms in the EU. For that, a theoretically optimal system for allocating inspection effort to commodities is described. Using an illustrative example and stochastic simulations, the expected costs of introduction of harmful organisms under the theoretically optimal system and the current system of reduced checks are compared. Examination of interceptions of harmful organisms supports application of reduced checks for most genera and trades of cut flowers in the Netherlands. The results of stochastic simulations show that reduced checks may not minimize the expected costs of introduction of harmful organisms into the EU. Accounting for possible economic impacts of harmful organisms in determining the frequencies of reduced checks may help optimize the current syste...|$|E

40|$|Implemented in March 2013, the EU Timber Regulation is {{affecting}} hardwood exporters and importers. The EUTR requires proof of timber’s origin and legality {{to ensure that}} no illegal timber is imported into the EU. The EUTR is part of the EU’s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, with its specific goal to end illegal logging, thereby improving sustainability of forest resources. To this end the EU intends to block imports of any wood or wood product which comes from unknown sources. Certification of SFM will help <b>EU</b> <b>importers</b> minimize risk, which {{is an essential part of}} their required due diligence system. Monitoring organizations are established to assist trade associations and businesses to construct comprehensive due diligence systems. National competent authorities are designated to follow the trade of the new FLEGT-licensed timber and timber products. In 2013, the first year of the EUTR, there are positive impacts, of which the most important is awareness of the disastrous situation with illegal logging, driven by exports of illegal timber. Another positive development is tropical timber exporters documenting the legality of their wood exports. Yet another positive feature is establishment of due diligence systems by <b>EU</b> <b>importers.</b> However, there are considerable problems to ensuring legal trade. For example, China exports primary- and secondary-processed hardwood products to Europe, based on imported logs which most often do not have comprehensive documentation of their origin and legality.

40|$|The {{trade of}} illegal timber, often from illegal logging, has severe environmental, social and {{economic}} consequences. The EU’s response to this problem came with the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, with its specific goal to end illegal logging, thereby improving sustainability of forest resources. In March 2013, an additional step was taken by implementing the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR). The EUTR requires proof of timber’s origin and legality {{to ensure that no}} illegal timber is imported into the EU.

40|$|Since the 1960 ’s, the EU {{has offered}} trade {{preferences}} {{to developing countries}} in {{a complex set of}} systems. Broadly these systems can be divided into preferences for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, Mediterranean preferences and the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). We construct a detailed database over these trade preferences and use it to assess whether they have had an effect on developing countries’ exports and whether the systems have had different impact on exports. To achieve this we also estimate the effect of the successive EU enlargements on exports from developing countries. A gravity model taking into account the evolution of developing countries’ exports is estimated on a large sample of <b>EU</b> <b>importers</b> and developing country exporters over the period 1960 - 2002. The main findings are that certain preference systems have had large effects—the largest are found for the ACP countries, where the preferences increase exports by about 30 %, followed by Mediterranean countries—and that, countries joining the EU, ceteris paribus, import less from developing countries as they become members.

40|$|The present {{paper has}} as main {{objective}} {{the analysis of}} the opportunities and development perspectives of the trade relationship between Romania and the Russian Federation, linked to the latest evolutions of the European and global economic context. Keeping in mind this objective, our paper is structured around three main sections, as follows. The first part, “Economic Context of Romania-Russian Federation Trade Development” is centered upon the global crisis and its effects on the EU, Romania and Russia as well as the EU-Russia increasing bilateral merchandise trade flows. We examine how the global economic crisis interrupted increasing merchandise trade between EU- 27 and the Russian Federation and present the main exporter countries from the EU- 27 to Russia and the major <b>EU</b> <b>importers</b> from Russia and analyze in a comparative manner the very concentrated trade pattern between EU- 27 and Russia. In the next section, “Romania-Russia Trade Development”, we underline that the Russian Federation is the second extra-EU trading partner of our country. We explore Romania’s trade relationship with Russia during pre and post accession to the European Union and also the actual trends of the bilateral trade, which pattern is extremely concentrated. In the last section, “Opportunities and Prospects for the Trade Development between Romania and Russian Federation”, we conclude, {{on the basis of the}} comparative and prospective analysis, that: Romania could be well positioned on Russian markets; there are many similarities in competitiveness characteristics of our countries; Romania and Russia have some problematic factors in doing business; strong points of the Romanian manufacturing industry could lead to the diversification of trade pattern and, finally, Romania has the possibility to develop a strong economic partnership with the Russian Federation under the framework of the EU-Russia relationship. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: During the {{negotiating}} {{stages of the}} TOCA, the EU and South Africa could not reach an agreement {{on the use of}} certain EU geographical indications related to wine products. The geographical indication issue threatened the signing of the entire TOCA. At the request of the EU, South Africa agreed to negotiate a separate Wine and Spirits Agreement, in order to finalise the TOCA. The EU-SA Wine and Spirits Agreement was eventually negotiated and came into effect on 1 January 2002. The initial issue relating to the geographical indications remained controversial throughout the negotiations and matters were made worst when the initial contentious denominations of Port and Sherry were expanded by the EU to include Grappa, Ouzo, Korn, Kornbrand, Jagertee, Jaqertee, Jagatee and Pacharan. South Africa eventually agreed to phase out the use of these denominations over specified time periods. The current wording of the agreement will also result in South Africa having to yield a variety of well known trade marks such as Nederburg and Roodeberg. Article 7 (8) of the Wine Agreement implies {{that in the case of}} conflict between a South African wine trade mark and an EU geographical indication for wine, the South African trade mark will always have to yield to the EU geographical indication. The entire geographical indication matter is being contested by South Africa and is still under negotiation. South Africa and the EU agreed to allocate reciprocal duty free tariff quotas to wine products. These tariff quotas will remain effective until the FTA has been established, following the transitional periods as agreed upon in the TOGA. The duty free funds will however not have such a direct impact on the wine industry as have been envisaged initially, because the funds are in the hands of the <b>EU</b> <b>importers.</b> Various business plans are being implemented to allow the South African wine industry to benefit from these and any future funds. The EU offered financial assistance to the value of € 15 million for the restructuring of the South African wine industry as well as for the marketing of the South African wine and spirits products. To date none of these funds have been allocated and various proposals have been made to the South African government in order to obtain these funds from the EU. The EU-SA Wine and Spirits Agreement is a continuous evolving agreement, where both parties are allowed to modify the existing agreement with the consent of the other party. Such modifications are allowed with the premise that it would contribute to the facilitation and promotion of trade in wine and spirits products between South Africa and the EU. South Africa must take cognisance of the implications of the EU-SA Wine and Spirits Agreement and ensure that they do not end up losing more than what they are gaining.

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} potential for foreign trade {{in five of the}} ten Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) {{with the help of a}} foreign trade model. The main exogenous variables in this model are the size of the countries (sum of GDP of a pair of trading partners as well as the GDP ratio) and each country's factor endowment (population, capital), a geographical component (distance between the economic centers of two trading partners as an approximation to transportation costs in foreign trade), and various other variables which reflect trade preferences between the countries (common language and common border). The approach which was chosen for the specification of the model allows the identification of country-specific deviations from the average export relations in intra-EU trade and in trade between the EU and the five Central and Eastern European countries. The question is raised in this article whether the structural backwardness (small degree of openness toward the EU) of the five Central and East European countries (qua exporters to the <b>EU</b> and <b>importers</b> from the <b>EU)</b> will be gradually reduced by the process of accession itself. In order to evaluate the effects of a ceteris paribus reduction in these deviations, the simulations were based on the assumptions that the structural divergences of the CEECs would be completely eliminated by the hypothetical time of accession (2004 for Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia, and 2010 for Slovakia). The average annual growth rates predicted by the model for bilateral trade flows between Austria and the five CEECs are very high (between 14. 4 and 13. 2 percent), but they do not deviate in a striking way from the growth rates of Austria's nominal exports to these countries actually observed during the 1990 s: Poland 15 percent (1993 - 1997), Hungary 19 percent (1989 - 1997), the Czech Republic 17 percent (1993 - 1997), Slovakia 24 percent (1993 - 1997), and Slovenia 18 percent (1992 - 1997). Even though the structural weaknesses of the CEECs will probably be eliminated over a long time period, it should be emphasized that the growth rates recorded for trade with the CEECs indicate that structural change is already under way; this process is likely to continue and is being facilitated by the so-called Europe agreements (reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade, support for infrastructure investment, inflow of direct foreign investment, concomitant transfer of know-how, etc.) and the current accession negotiations.

40|$|Abstract only. The European Union ranks third {{worldwide}} {{in terms of}} fishing power, with 5. 7 million tonnes landed in 2006 and a fishing fleet active in every ocean. It is also the leading importer of fish (worth some ¬ 20 billion in 2006). That is why the European Commission considers that the European Union has a major responsibility that obliges it {{to take the lead}} in combating illegal fishing. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is thriving throughout the world. According to estimates, this global commerce is worth 3 to 10 billion euros per year. As a comparison, legal landings by the EU fleet reached 6. 7 billion euros in 2006. The scope of marine poaching and its environmental, economic and social impact make it a political priority. Illegal fishing depletes world stocks and compromises the protective measures implemented to ensure their sustainability. It affects signifactly the economic performance of legal fishing fleets by reducing catch volumes and depressing prices. Furthermore, by targeting the national waters of developing countries which do not have the means to patrol them effectively, illegal fishing robs these underprivileged populations of an essential food source. The European Commission proposed in 2007 a strategy aimed at depriving illegal fishing of its commercial outlets in the European Union. This strategy would involve, in particular, widespread State-based port control, which forces each State to ensure that the fishing products they import are legal. In other words, all fish, molluscs and crustaceans (including processed products) entering the European Union will have to be certified by the flag State of the vessel which caught them. Vessels whose flag State does not certify the products on board will not be able to access European ports. In order to develop such measures, the new strategy takes an overarching approach to the problem, taking account of the activities through which illegal fishing finds outlets: transhipment of catches, processing, landings in port and marketing. A package of measures including certification requirements, commercial and other sanctions, stegthened control standards, and increased international cooperation should deprive illegal fishing of commercial outlets in the EU and thus to strike fraudsters where the impact will be the greatest: their profits. Implementing measures are now actively being discussed with EU Member States, stakeholders and the international community. Issues such as pursing EU nationals engaged in IUU fishing beyond EU waters are being tackled. Sensitive areas such as increased administrative burdens for <b>EU</b> border controls, <b>importers</b> and retailers and the cost of implementing certification systems by developing countries are also being examined...|$|R
