Success of the latter indicated need for a larger pan-Nordic facility, with storage resources being of high priority.

During this phase, NDGF committed to provide a Nordic Tier1 (regional computing center) for the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid project at CERN.

40|$|Municipal {{amalgamation}} {{has been}} done in many countries in recent years {{as the result of a}} push to enlarge the size and coverage of local government units, which in turn is driven mainly by the prospect of economies of scale. However, while municipality amalgamation or boundary reform raises population size, it introduces organizational changes in the local government that might in-crease administrative inefficiency. The choice for the method of integration of administrative functions before amalgamation might affect to public expenditure after amalgamation. This study uses Japanese municipal-level data and argues for a relation between the choice for the method of integration of administrative functions and cost inefficiency after amalgamation. The results show that the fully <b>distributed</b> <b>facility</b> method is more likely to be adopted in a larger administrative ju-risdiction and in one with large differences in finances or political structures between amalga-mated sub-regions. Moreover, the results of stochastic frontier regression show that new munici-pality adopting fully <b>distributed</b> <b>facility</b> method can possibly increase inefficiency by expanding organizational slack because the new administration system will be insufficient integration of administrative functions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many self-configuration {{problems}} {{that occur in}} sensor networks, such as clustering or operator placement for in-network data aggregation, can be modeled as facility location problems. Unfortunately, existing <b>distributed</b> <b>facility</b> location algorithms are hardly applicable to multi-hop sensor networks. Based on an existing centralized algorithm, we therefore devise equivalent distributed versions which, to our knowledge, represent the first distributed approximations of the facility location problem that can be practicably implemented in multihop sensor networks with local communication. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that, for typical instances derived from sensor-network configuration problems, the algorithms terminate in only few communication rounds, the runtime does not increase with the network size, and, finally, that our implementation requires only local communication confined to small network neighborhoods. In addition, we propose simple extensions to our algorithms to support dynamic networks with varying link qualities and node additions and deletions. Using link quality traces collected from a real sensor network deployment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in realistic multi-hop sensor networks. ...|$|E

40|$|The LCG (Worldwide LHC Computing Grid) is a grid-based {{hierarchical}} computing <b>distributed</b> <b>facility,</b> {{composed of}} more than 140 computing centers, organized in 4 tiers, by size and offer of services. Every site, although indipendent for many technical choices, has to provide services with a well-defined set of interfaces. For this reason, different LCG sites need frequently to manage very similar situations, like jobs behaviour on the batch system, dataset transfers between sites, operating system and experiment software installation and configuration, monitoring of services. In this context we created WHALE (WHALE Handles Administration in an LCG Environment), a software actually used at the T 2 _IT_Rome site, an LCG Tier- 2 for the CMS experiment. WHALE is a generic, site indipendent tool written in python: it allows administrator to interact in a uniform and coherent way with several subsystems using a high level syntax which hides specific commands. The architecture of WHALE {{is based on the}} plugin concept and on the possibility of connecting the output of a plugin to the input of the next one, in a pipe-like system, giving the administrator the possibility of making complex functions by combining the simpler ones. The core of WHALE just handles the plugin orchestrations, while even the basic functions (eg. the WHALE activity logging) are performed by plugins, giving the capability to tune and possibly modify every component of the system. WHALE already provides many plugins useful for a LCG site and some more for a Tier- 2 of the CMS experiment, expecially in the field of job management, dataset transfer and analysis of performance results and availability tests (eg. Nagios tests, SAM tests). Thanks to its architecture and the provided plugins WHALE makes easy to perform tasks that, even if logically simple, are technically complex or tedious, like eg. closing all the worker nodes with a job-failure rate greater than a given threshold. Finally, thanks to the centralization of the activities on a single point and to its logging functionalities, WHALES acts as a knowledge-base of the site and a handful tool {{to keep track of the}} activities at a given site. For this reason it also provides a tailored plugin to perform advanced searches in the activity log...|$|E
