2500|$|In {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} London, the night watchman was indeed an old controversial figure (established {{for the first}} time in the 1285 Statute of Winchester), deeply-rooted in the belief that the individual citizen had to perform his social and moral duty for the well-being of the society. Hence, every London parish requested its householders to perform by rotation the watch-duty on an unpaid and amateur basis, from dusk until dawn, and with only a stick or an halberd as a weapon. Each watchman was assigned with a short length of street to patrol every hour, and he had to examine all suspicious characters from his assigned watch box (a sentry box with half-door). The performance of such duty took away a great amount of money and energy, so by the late seventeenth-century it grew up the practice to pay a substitute (often another parishioner) to take up your watch duty. The fact that this service had to be arranged locally by parish officers rose a great number of issues. Firstly, the only men willing to take on this job for a very small wage were those who had little prospect of some other employment, usually old men hired as an alternative to the poor law grant. Secondly, Moreton suggests that [...] "parochial misapplication" [...] were commonplace around constables and beadles, appointed to collect the <b>individual</b> <b>fee</b> for the night-watch. They were often accused to spend as little as possible on hiring watchmen and pocket the difference as a recompense for the unpaid service they had performed.|$|E

50|$|Historically, when {{a couple}} desired a child, natural {{conception}} and adoption were the primary methods. Through modernization of reproductive technology, the options for having a child have expanded to include artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, and surrogacy as possible solutions when faced with infertility. A woman may essentially offer to rent her womb for the gestation {{of a child who}} will be given to another person following the birth of the child. Surrogacy has been a practice throughout history. In the Bible, Rachel asked her handmaid Bilhah to conceive a child with her husband Jacob. Furthermore, Ishmael was conceived not of Abraham and Sarah, but rather Abraham and Sarah's handmaid Hagar. From the Middle Ages to modern times, other reproductive services have also been supplied for a fee. For example, a wet nurse would feed and care for another woman’s child, in exchange for payment. These reproductive services often share a common thread of a woman of lesser economic means supplying either gestation or care of another woman’s child for an <b>individual</b> <b>fee</b> or as part of her employment.|$|E

Additionally, behind the Palisade Park music stage was the park's worst-kept secret: {{a hole in the}} fence used by local children to sneak into the park without paying admission.

The Alliance for Sweden electoral coalition who won the 2006 elections endorsed the idea that each section of the labour market should carry its own costs of unemployment benefits paid out to put pressure on the wage level and make the demand for labour to rise again and unemployment diminish. They claimed that a substantially larger part of the costs for the insurance should be financed by <b>individual</b> <b>fees</b> of the involved workers, conceiving to stop the intra-fund solidarity mechanisms. Consequently, from January 2007 fees to unemployment funds were raised significantly, most in funds with a high unemployment rate among the members.

From 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2008 Swedish unions lost in all 245 000 members (8% of active members) and union unemployment funds almost 400 000 members (11% of members).
