25|$|The Danish krone is {{currently}} used by both of its dependent territories, Greenland and Faroe Islands, with their monetary policy {{controlled by the}} Danish Central Bank. If Denmark does adopt the euro, separate referendums would be required in both territories {{to decide whether they}} should follow suit. Both territories have voted not {{to be a part of}} the EU in the past, and their populations will not participate in the Danish euro referendum. The Faroe Islands use a special version of the Danish krone notes that have been printed with text in the Faroese language. It is regarded as a foreign currency, but can be exchanged 1:1 with the <b>Danish</b> <b>version.</b> On 5 November 2009 the Faroese Parliament approved a proposal to investigate the possibility for euro adoption, including an evaluation of the legal and economic impact of adopting the euro ahead of Denmark.|$|E

[...] Jonatan Allin of the <b>Danish</b> <b>version</b> of Eurogamer, who had not enjoyed any Sonic games since the Genesis era, concurred with Khan.

500|$|In 1879, J. C. Williamson {{acquired}} the exclusive performing rights to Pinafore in Australia and New Zealand. His first production earned public and critical acclaim. Williamson played Sir Joseph, and his wife, Maggie Moore played Josephine. Praising {{the production and}} all the performers, the Sydney Morning Herald noted that the production though [...] "abounding in fun" [...] was dignified and precise, that many numbers were encored and that laughter and applause from the [...] "immense audience... was liberally bestowed". Williamson's company continued to produce Pinafore in Australia, New Zealand and on tour into the 1960s with much success. As Williamson said, [...] "If you need money, then put on G". Meanwhile, Pinafore continued to garner praise outside Britain.

Translations into German, Yiddish and many other languages, and professional productions in places as remote as Samarkand in Uzbekistan have been successful.|$|E

NCC later collapsed, and no information about Chandralekha Japanese release survives.
