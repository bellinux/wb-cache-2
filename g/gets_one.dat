5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E

50|$|Buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free {{promotions}} {{received some}} negative publicity in the UK, in 2014, and many retailers {{were told to}} scrap their ‘Buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free’ promotions. The rationale: {{it has been reported}} that every year 15 million tonnes of food are wasted in the UK alone, and supermarkets and retailers are being blamed for this because they are convincing customers to purchase buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free products. They lure customers in by offering them something they don't necessarily need, and as a result of this food is wasted. Because many buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free foods have short shelf lives, customers do not get around to consuming the products before their ‘consume by date’.|$|R

25|$|A jump-off is {{a sudden}} death {{competition}} {{in which the}} tied vaulters attempt the same height, starting with the last attempted height.

Each vaulter <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> attempt at each height until one makes and one misses.|$|E

25|$|The central {{portion of}} the pitch (5 feet from each popping crease, and 1 foot {{either side of the}} line joining the centres of the two middle stumps) is {{designated}} a protected area (this is the area the ball will most often bounce in). The bowlers from the fielding side should not enter this area during the follow-through of their bowling action, nor should the batsman take guard within it or so close that they would frequently move into it. A bowler will get two warnings should they run into the protected area; should they encroach again, they will be suspended from bowling {{for the remainder of the}} innings. A batsman <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> warning and on subsequent transgressions incurs a 5 run penalty.|$|E

Once again, Niels and Merkus leave the jungle empty handed.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{generate}} more attention for the rivalry in sports other than football, in 2004 the two schools started the Lone Star Showdown, which began as a two-year trial program and has continued ever since. Essentially, each time the two schools meet in a sport, {{the winner of the}} matchup gets a point. In sports wherein the teams meet twice one half point is awarded for a victory. If more contests than two occur, such as in baseball, the series winner <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> point. At the end of the year, the school with the most points wins the series and receives a trophy. In the event of a tie the current holder retains the trophy as did A after the '08–'09 season. Texas leads the series 6–2.|$|E

University of East Anglia's Norwich Business School conducted research into products used in buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free deals. The results show a trend: buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free promotions are aimed towards unhealthy products, such as chocolate, sweets, soft drinks, etc. Supermarkets might have to start using some of their marketing budget to specifically promote healthy products, and so would spend less money promoting unhealthy and fattening products. This is because The Department of Health has decided to step in and take action.|$|R
