William <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> three important principles before Llywelyn would release him. Firstly, William was to pay a ransom of £2,000, “a sum corresponding so precisely to that which Llywelyn <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay the king that it is reasonable to conjecture that the prince meant the one liability to discharge the other," [...] according to J.E. Lloyd. William de Braose then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> never take up arms against Llywelyn ever again. [...] Lastly, William <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> arrange the marriage between his eldest daughter and co-heiress Isabella, with the lordship and castle of Builth as her marriage dowry, to Dafydd, Llywelyn’s heir. With these terms <b>agreed</b> <b>to,</b> William was released in 1229.|$|R

25|$|The {{roots of}} Burmese verbs {{are almost always}} suffixed {{with at least one}} {{particle}} which conveys such information as tense, intention, politeness, mood, etc. Many of these particles also have formal/literary and colloquial equivalents. In fact, the only time in which no particle is attached to a verb is in imperative commands.

25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church {{does not}} {{consider}} the age of Church Fathers to be over and includes later influential writers {{up to the present}} day. The Orthodox view is that men do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> on every detail, much less be infallible, to be considered Church Fathers. Rather, Orthodox doctrine is determined by the consensus of the Holy Fathers—those points on which they do agree. This consensus guides the church in questions of dogma, the correct interpretation of scripture, and to distinguish the authentic sacred tradition of the Church from false teachings.|$|E
25|$|After the 1985 season, the White Sox {{came close}} to trading Fisk to the New York Yankees for {{designated}} hitter Don Baylor. Baylor was unhappy with the Yankees since he did not play every day as he wanted (despite being the team's regular DH) and asked to be traded. The potential deal was complicated in that the White Sox would have to re-sign Fisk, a free agent, and that both players would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to the trade. Negotiations between the two teams ended when {{they were unable to}} reach an agreement. The White Sox re-signed Fisk, who remained with the club until the end of his career. During spring training in 1986, the Yankees traded Baylor to the Boston Red Sox for designated hitter Mike Easler.|$|E

25|$|The CAP {{has always}} been a {{difficult}} area of EU policy to reform; it is a problem that began in the 1960s and one that has continued to the present, albeit less severely. Changes to the CAP are proposed by the European Commission, after a public consultation, which then sends its proposals to the Council and to the European Parliament. Both the Council and the European Parliament <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to any changes. The Parliament was involved in the process of change {{for the first time in}} 2013. The involvement of the Parliament, which represents the citizens, increases the democratic legitimacy of the CAP.

25|$|Equitable {{sold the}} {{building}} in 1946 to the Flatiron Associates, an investor group headed by Harry Helmsley, whose firm, Dwight-Helmsley (which would later become Helmsley-Spear) managed the property. The new owners made some superficial changes, such as adding a dropped ceiling to the lobby, and, later, replacing the original mahogony-panelled entrances with revolving doors. Because the ownership structure was a tenancy-in-common, in which all partners <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> on any action, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward partnership, it was difficult to get permission for necessary repairs and improvements to be done, and the building declined during the Helmsley/Flatiron Associates era. Helmsley-Spear stopped managing {{the building in}} 1997, when some of the investors sold their 52% of the building to Newmark Knight-Frank, a large real estate firm, which took over management of the property. Shortly afterwards, Helmsley's widow, Leona Helmsley, sold her share as well. Newmark made significant improvements to the property, including installing new electric elevators, replacing the antiquated hydraulic ones.|$|E
25|$|The Munich Agreement of 1938 did {{not last}} for long. In March 1939 the German {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia began with the invasion of Bohemia and Moravia, leaving Slovakia as a German puppet state. Lithuania was forced {{to give up its}} Klaipėda Region (Memelland). Formal demands were made for the return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany, even though its status was guaranteed by the League of Nations. In early 1939 Hitler proposed Poland an alliance on German terms, with an expectation of compliance. The Polish government would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to Danzig's incorporation by the Reich and to an extraterritorial highway passage connecting East Prussia with the rest of Germany through the so-called Polish Corridor (an area linking the Polish mainland with the Baltic Sea). Poland would join an anti-Soviet alliance and coordinate its foreign policy with Germany, thus becoming a client state. The independence-minded Polish government was alarmed and a British guarantee of Poland's independence was issued on 31 March 1939. Reacting to this act and to Poland's effective rejection of the German demands, Hitler renounced the existing German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact on April 28.|$|E

Ernest K. Lindley deemed Borah the [...] "most effectively liberal voice in the Republican Party". Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' paper, Der Angriff, asserted, [...] "American life loses a personality valued by friend or foe on account of his courage, honesty, and decent method of fighting." [...] Borah's old classmate, Kansas editor William Allen White, called him [...] "a righteous man who was wise and unafraid, who followed his star, never lowered his flag, and never lost his self-respect... an honest man who dedicated his talents to his country's good". Columnist Raymond Clapper mourned, [...] "there are no fighters on the progressive side —no men like T.R.... Borah was the last".|$|E

After Watson rejected a contract buyout proposal of $30 million, the Rockets filed a legal challenge against their lease, stating the [...] "need {{to be able to}} buy out" [...] of the lease. However, the city of Houston filed a counterclaim to force the Rockets to stay at the Summit, saying that if the Rockets did not honor their contract, then they might [...] "have no incentive to honor any new agreement with the city of Houston to play in a new downtown sports arena". The validity of the lease was eventually upheld, and in April 1997, Lanier announced that the Rockets and Watson would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to share control of the new arena equally, or lose access to it altogether. After both parties agreed to the terms, a bill that authorized increased taxes to pay for a new arena was signed into law in July, by then-Governor George W. Bush.|$|E

500|$|After Jackson's {{acquisition}} of ATV Music Publishing, his record label's owner, CBS, was negotiating {{the sale of}} its record division in an unrelated deal. The record company was renamed Sony Music Entertainment in 1991. Following hurriedly arranged meetings and disagreements over the selling price, a deal was sealed by Jackson during a concert in Tokyo. Upon seeing {{the success of this}} sale, Japanese corporation Sony sought to break away from its core business of hardware manufacturing and diversify into music, films and games. Looking for further opportunities, the company aimed to expand its music publishing interests. The Japanese corporation, since it wanted to diversify in the media, offered Jackson $90million for a 50% stake in the ATV catalogue via a merger with Sony Music. Through the agreement, Jackson would {{become one of the most}} important shareholders in Sony. Jackson gladly accepted; he had essentially acquired half ownership of the Beatles' songs for a large profit. Jackson's own songs were not included in the deal. Sony and ATV having merged, the new company was named Sony/ATV Music Publishing and became the second largest music publisher in the world. Michael P. Schulhof, President and CEO of Sony Corporation of America, welcomed the merger and praised Jackson for his efforts in the venture. [...] "Michael Jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history; he is also an astute businessman. Michael understands the importance of copyrights and the role they play in the introduction to new technologies." [...] He added that Jackson recognises Sony's [...] "leadership in developing and realizing new technologies that serve to expand the creative horizon of artists such as himself". Administrative expertise was provided by Sony, who installed Paul Russell as chairman. Jackson was a company director and attended board meetings regularly. As each party in the arrangement held the power of veto, both sides would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> on a decision before it could be made.
