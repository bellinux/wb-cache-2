5|$|C.mutica closely {{resemble}} Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native of}} East Asian waters. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish the two species, particularly since Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), {{as well as the}} elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic-like {{psoriasis}} is {{a common}} form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine {{does not need to be}} unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

25|$|Various reasons impelled Lucien Biva {{to emigrate}} to the United States. His {{father was a}} {{well-known}} painter, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> for Lucien Biva {{to make a name}} for himself without being linked to the work of his father.|$|R
50|$|Flat-stalked {{pondweed}} is not presently in cultivation. Although {{its wide}} ecological tolerance suggests <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to grow, {{it would probably}} require a deeper substrate than is usual in most ornamental ponds. It {{is also likely to}} compete poorly with other pond plants.|$|R
30|$|Arteries <b>may</b> {{compress}} and <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to distinguish}} from veins, resulting in arterial cannulation. This is especially common in younger children. The operator {{should look for}} arterial pulsations or Doppler color flow to further distinguish arteries from veins. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> particularly <b>difficult</b> to distinguish an artery from a vein in a patient in shock.|$|R
25|$|In some {{circumstances}} <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When {{the evaluation of}} complete response depends on this determination, {{it is recommended that}} the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{determine}} S for some distributions. This is usually because a closed {{form for the}} median is not known: examples of such distributions include the gamma distribution, inverse-chi-squared distribution, the inverse-gamma distribution and the scaled inverse chi-squared distribution.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> or {{impossible}} {{to ascertain whether}} a situation meets criteria for failure or success due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria.

25|$|The dialect groups differ {{mostly in}} phonology, vocabulary, and tonal inflection. Syntactic {{differences}} are minor. Central Slovak {{forms the basis}} of the present-day standard language.

50|$|For typical {{multimedia}} application {{making use of}} high compression technologies, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> quite <b>difficult,</b> impractical or inconvenient to run such applications with a fixed reservation on the CPU.
