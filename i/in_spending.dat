The model is used to examine international transmission of government spending and its welfare implications. It is shown that an increase <b>in</b> government <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> North (South) can increase (decrease) the number of differentiated goods produced, thereby decreasing (increasing) the degree of monopoly power in North. Furthermore an increase <b>in</b> government <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> South can decrease the welfare North, but the impact of an increase <b>in</b> government <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> North the welfare of South cannot be unambiguously determined.

5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases <b>in</b> <b>spending,</b> especially in education. Treasury officials had advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost of}} posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.|$|E
5|$|During {{this same}} time, Dunderdale {{was named the}} best fiscal {{performer}} of Canada's premiers by the Fraser Institute. The institute measured the performance of all premiers for their time in office, which was the 2011-2012 fiscal year for Dunderdale, and looked at their performance on three core components of fiscal policy: government spending, taxes, and debt and deficits. Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to government spending was in part due to the province’s significant economic growth and not her ability to restrain growth <b>in</b> <b>spending.</b>|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from the}} outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall was a result of unsustainable increases <b>in</b> <b>spending,</b> and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E

50|$|Thus, with {{vertical}} LM curve, {{an increase}} <b>in</b> government <b>spending</b> cannot change the equilibrium income and only raises the equilibrium interest rates. But if government spending is higher and the output is unchanged, {{there must be}} an offsetting reduction <b>in</b> private <b>spending.</b> <b>In</b> this case, the increase in interest rates crowds out an amount of private spending equal to increase <b>in</b> government <b>spending.</b> Thus, there is full crowding out if LM is vertical.|$|R
40|$|Arguments {{based on}} labour market theory {{suggest that there}} may be CEO {{behavioural}} issues related to pay deviations from the labour market rate for CEO pay; however, few studies examine this phenomenon. This study attempts to address such behavioural issues by examining the influence of relative CEO underpayment on reductions <b>in</b> R&D <b>spending,</b> the differences <b>in</b> this relationship between firms in high R&D intensive versus low R&D intensive industries, and the moderating affect of ownership structure on the CEO underpayment and R&D spending relationship. Results suggest that relative CEO underpayment is associated with reductions <b>in</b> R&D <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> low R&D intensive industries and increases <b>in</b> R&D <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> high R&D intensive industries. Also, greater relative CEO underpayment leads to greater reductions <b>in</b> R&D <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> manager-controlled organizations as compared to owner-controlled organizations. This study provides evidence that pay deviations may, in fact, affect certain CEO behaviours, specifically relating to innovation. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009. ...|$|R
5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result <b>in</b> <b>spending</b> cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E

The 2016 Defence White Paper included a commitment to further increases <b>in</b> <b>spending</b> beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, Voorhis's first {{legislative}} initiative was {{to propose a}} dramatic increase <b>in</b> <b>spending</b> for the Works Progress Administration {{in order to increase}} employment. While this effort was unsuccessful, Congress, faced with an economic downturn the following year, increased WPA spending beyond the level which Voorhis had sought. While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives. Voorhis advocated the purchase by the Federal Government of the stock in the Federal Reserve Banks, which was held by the member banks, as a way of financing government expenditures and briefly got President Roosevelt to support the measure until the President's advisers caused Roosevelt to change his mind. Voorhis later allied with future House Banking Committee chairman Wright Patman to force Federal Reserve Banks to pay most of the interest they earned on federal securities to the U.S. Government, rather than to the bank stockholders.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US$59 per lb of uranium, while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction). Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007. This has caused a big increase <b>in</b> <b>spending</b> on exploration, with US$200 million being spent worldwide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year. This trend continued through 2006, when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $774 million, an increase of over 250% compared to 2004. The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency said exploration figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Labor Party Governments led by Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard between 2007 and 2013 {{commissioned}} two defence white papers, {{which were}} published in 2009 and 2013. The 2009 document, , had a focus on responding to China's rapidly growing influence. It included commitments to expand the RAN, including acquiring twelve submarines, and increasing defence spending by three percent per year in real terms. This increase <b>in</b> <b>spending</b> did not occur, however. The Defence White Paper 2013 had similar strategic themes, but set out a more modest program of defence spending which reflected the government's constrained finances. As part of an election commitment, the Liberal-National Party Abbott Government commissioned a further defence white paper that was published in 2016. This document also included a commitment to expand the ADF's size and capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly {{approved}} $250 million <b>in</b> <b>spending</b> {{cuts and}} Daniels renegotiated 30 different state contracts for {{a savings of}} $190 million, resulting in a budget of $23 billion. Annual spending growth for future budgets was cut to 2.8% from the 5.9% that had been standard for many years. Increase in revenues, coupled with the spending reductions, led to a $300 million budget surplus. Indiana is not permitted to take loans, as borrowing was prohibited in its constitution following the 1837 state bankruptcy. The state, therefore, had financed its deficit spending by reallocating $760 million in revenue that belonged to local government and school districts {{over the course of}} many years. The funds were gradually and fully restored to the municipal governments using the surplus money, and the state reserve fund was grown to $1.3 billion.|$|E

5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value {{will depend on the}} eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of his}} death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase <b>in</b> <b>spending</b> from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.|$|E

40|$|The {{causes of}} the {{dramatic}} rise <b>in</b> military <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> the post-war era {{have been the subject}} of much political and academic controversy. No extant formulation seems to provide a compelling explanation of the dynamics involved in the levels of, and rates of change <b>in,</b> such <b>spending.</b> <b>In</b> light of this, the authors develop a new model, based mainly on a political-business cycle argument, to account for these dynamics. The basic proposition in this model is that variations <b>in</b> national defense <b>spending</b> arise from political considerations which are related to real and desired conditions within the national economy. Applying this model to the experience of the United States 1948 - 1976, the authors show that it has a large measure of empirical validity. If one removes the effects of war-time mobilization, it is clear that for the United States the principal driving forces <b>in</b> military <b>spending</b> dynamics were (1) the perceived utility of such <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> stabilizing aggregate demand, (2) the political or electoral value of the perceived economic effects arising out of such spending, and (3) the pressures of institutional-constituency demands...|$|R
