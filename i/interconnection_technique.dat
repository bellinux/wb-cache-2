40|$|A new <b>interconnection</b> <b>technique</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} that allows versatile multiple strand connections between microsensors, sensor arrays, and chips designed for wire bonding. The new technique has been termed "Microflex interconnection" technique (MFI). Conventional wire bonding technique is commonly-restricted to planar interconnects with a limited degree of freedom for placing microsystem components in hybrid assemblies. The MFI technique has overcome this limitation by interconnecting microsystem components through custom designed flexible substrates with embedded metallized conductors, pad arrays for integrated circuits assembly and substrate integrated electrodes. Standard CMOS components without additional pad metallization can be used. The integration density of the MFI technique corresponds to flip-chip technology. Special advantages of the MFI technique are three-dimensional interconnects, the flexibility in design and shape, and easy visual inspection of alignment qualities. The method is especially suitable for small volumes of customer specified devices and biomedical implants because all materials used are biocompatible.
