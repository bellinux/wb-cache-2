5|$|An {{expedition}} {{was immediately}} {{prepared to take}} punitive action against the Ghassanids. Muhammad appointed Zayd ibn Harithah as {{the commander of the}} force. In the event of Zayd's death, the command was to be taken over by Ja`far ibn Abī Tālib, and if Jafar were to be killed, the command would {{be in the hands of}} `Abd Allah ibn Rawahah. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> all three were killed, the men of the expedition were to select a commander from amongst themselves.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:00am CST, {{the crew}} {{received}} a go from ground flight controllers to ungrapple the robot arm from the docking module. Shortly after that, crew members raised the orbiter's cabin pressure from 10.2 {{pounds per square}} inch to 14.7 psi. The cabin's pressure was lowered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> a problem during the mating process necessitated an emergency spacewalk.|$|E
5|$|Dive {{computers}} {{also provide}} a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. If the diver exceeds a no-decompression limit, decompression additional to the ascent rate will be necessary. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> the no-decompression limits are exceeded.|$|E

5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. The devices are intended to be kept in a below-ground pool, to absorb the shock of earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E
5|$|Presently, grid {{systems with}} large wind {{penetration}} require a small {{increase in the}} frequency of usage of natural gas spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electric power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> there is no wind. At low wind power penetration, this is less of an issue.|$|E
5|$|Progress M-43, {{which had}} been {{launched}} in 2000, undocked from Mir the day after Progress M1-5 launched, and was kept in orbit until Progress M1-5 docked. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> Progress M1-5 {{had been unable to}} dock, Progress M-43 would have returned to the station and provide supplies of food and oxygen for the Soyuz crew.

5|$|The NZ ETS {{contains}} special {{transitional provisions}} from 1 July 2010 (when fossil emissions enter the scheme) until 31 December 2012 (transition period).

5|$|The Premier League {{maintains}} two trophies – {{the genuine}} trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica.

5|$|The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at Johnson Space Center was {{predicting}} {{less than}} favorable weather for Friday's landing, so managers asked {{the crew to}} power down some non-critical systems to help conserve power, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> the orbiter {{is not able to}} land until Saturday.|$|E

5|$|The team {{conducted}} intense preparations {{during the}} spring and fall practices before the 1940 season. On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily complained that the maintenance department had left on the practice field lights, only to be told that the team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> the T formation failed.|$|E
5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> the debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, {{and returned to the}} creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

50|$|The argument, {{fight and}} {{subsequent}} shooting {{took place in}} a bar at Sagrada Familia. Negrete had been drinking alcohol that night as he celebrated with his friends, and alcohol may have played a part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> happened later that night.|$|R
5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat {{for the failure of}} Market Garden. Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> Richard O'Connor, the GOC, were transferred to another theatre.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} for {{the provision of}} subsidies on services to Oslo and Bergen was not reached with the Ministry of Transport until 1990. The state agreed to provide NOK 4.5 million, with the municipalities providing another NOK 2.6 million, and Oppland County Municipality NOK 2 million. The county and municipalities were allowed to reduce their subsidies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> passenger numbers increased. Although initially planned to be introduced in January 1990, Widerøe later dropped out, and the contract was awarded to Coast Air, who began operating on 3September 1990, using a de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The deal was the most expensive subsidy for regional aviation in the country; while the national average was NOK 156, the Fagernes route cost the authorities NOK 2,000 per passenger.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>that</b> they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E
