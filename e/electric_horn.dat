6000|$|... 'Huckley,' {{said the}} policeman. 'H-u-c-k-l-e-y,' and wrote {{something}} in his note-book at which young Ollyett protested. A large red man on a grey horse who had been watching us {{from the other side}} of the hedge shouted an order we could not catch. The policeman laid his hand on the rim of the right driving-door (Woodhouse carries his spare tyres aft), and it closed on the button of the <b>electric</b> <b>horn.</b> The grey horse at once bolted, and we could hear the rider swearing all across the landscape.|$|E

[...] And thus admonished, Dave {{put his finger}} on the button of the <b>electric</b> <b>horn</b> and held it down for some time. Looking backward, those in the Wadsworth car soon saw the Basswood machine come into sight and then slow down. The heavy clap of thunder was now {{followed}} by another fierce downfall of rain, while the sky grew blacker than ever. In the midst of this outburst the second touring-car came slowly forward.|$|E

50|$|For 1929 bumpers were {{standardised}} on all Morris cars as were dipping headlights, <b>electric</b> <b>horns</b> and vibrationless engine mountings. The {{same issue}} reported {{a drop in}} the price of the Morris Six from £410 to £390. Morris Cowley prices went up but this was for improved coachwork.|$|R

50|$|The Hummer was {{as basic}} {{as it could}} have been. It had magneto {{ignition}} and was sold without battery, <b>electric</b> <b>horn,</b> turn signals, or brake light.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} was ample for the period, {{consisting of a}} speedometer with recording odometer, an ammeter, and the dashboard incorporating lighting. The horn initially was a classical trumpet with rubber bulb; this was replaced by an <b>electric</b> <b>horn</b> beginning in 1925.|$|E
50|$|Two {{models were}} offered; the Standard and the Deluxe, the latter model also {{featuring}} a wraparound Plexiglas windshield in then-contemporary fashion, an <b>electric</b> <b>horn,</b> head and tail lamps and a lightning-bolt trim design on the flanks. Bumpers and a trailer hitch were standard on all models.|$|E

50|$|Carmassi has {{performed}} many different jobs in music: multi-instrumentalist, singer, film composer, arranger, producer, and engineer. He has recorded {{on the following}} instruments: bass guitar, bells, cello, clarinet, cornet, drums, flugelhorn, flute, french horn, glockenspiel, guitar (<b>electric),</b> <b>horn,</b> keyboards, melodica, organ, piano, recorder, saxophone (alto), synthesizer, trombone, trumpet, vibraphone, vocals, whistle, and the Wurlitzer organ.|$|E
50|$|Early cars did {{not have}} batteries, as their {{electrical}} systems were limited. A bell was used instead of an <b>electric</b> <b>horn,</b> headlights were gas-powered, and the engine was started with a crank. Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with electric starters. The sealed battery, which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971.|$|E

50|$|Equipment in the Paris body included: leather upholstery, five lamps, two <b>electric</b> <b>horns,</b> eight-day clock, {{automatic}} screen wiper, {{roof ventilator}} and lamp, companions, rear blind controllable from the driver’s seat, folding luggage grid etc. The Riviera model {{had the same}} fittings but in addition the roof was flexible. It folded back like an ordinary hood over about two-thirds of its length.|$|R

50|$|The chassis {{was very}} {{conventional}} with semi-elliptic leaf springs on all wheels and rigid axles front and rear. The transmission brake has been discontinued {{in favour of}} brakes on the road wheels. Steering is by worm and wheel. At {{the top of the}} steering wheel there is an <b>electric</b> <b>horn</b> button and the headlamp control lever for the dip and switch mechanism. The electrical system for both lighting and starting is 12-volt.|$|E
50|$|The company {{responded to}} the {{increasing}} number of low-priced cars—including the $700 Ford Model N, the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout at $650, the $485 Brush Runabout, the Black at $375, the $500 Western Gale Model A, and the bargain-basement Success an amazingly low $250—by introducing the Model 25, their cheapest four yet. At $695, this five-seat tourer had high-tension magneto ignition, <b>electric</b> <b>horn</b> and (optional) electric starter and headlights, and an innovative shock absorber to protect the radiator.|$|E
50|$|The first button {{added to}} the {{steering}} wheel was a switch to activate the car's <b>electric</b> <b>horn.</b> Traditionally located {{on the steering wheel}} hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow steering wheel, integrated the horn switch into the steering wheel rim.|$|E

50|$|When the CLRVs and ALRVs were {{delivered}} in the 1970s and 1980s respectively, they were equipped with gongs as the sole audible warning signal. Most cars were retrofitted with horns in the late 1990s when the 510 Spadina line opened. Initially, the horns were salvaged from retired H1 and M1 subway cars which were replaced by the T1 subway cars. However, during the CLRV/ALRV streetcar fleet overhaul project between 2011 and 2012 the TTC reconfigured the streetcar horns with new air <b>horns</b> or automobile-type <b>electric</b> <b>horns.</b>|$|R

5000|$|While Keil's six genres {{cover the}} {{majority}} of polka performers, other polka bands combine these genres or exist outside of them altogether. Brave Combo is one important modern group that plays {{a combination of these}} three genres with a very modern edge. Started in 1979 by Carl Finch, this band is the ultimate in appealing to a wider, younger audience. In addition to accordion, tuba, woodwinds, drum, and trumpet, the instrumentation of the band includes guitar, <b>electric</b> <b>horn,</b> and harmonica. According to Finch, the genre of the band has [...] "no restrictions." [...] They play everything from Polish-style to rancheras to Greek music.|$|E
50|$|When {{production}} {{began in}} 1919 an electric starter would be supplied {{for an extra}} £50 though it was standard on Vauxhall's 25 hp car. But Vauxhall did make no separate charge for: electric lighting, a clock, speedometer, spare wheel and tyre, full tool kit and number plates. Customers could choose between a bonnet of plain polished aluminium or have it painted to match {{the rest of the}} car. Advertisements for the OE when introduced in 1922 noted the electric lighting now included six lamps, an instrument board lamp and gauges together with both an <b>electric</b> <b>horn</b> and a bulb horn. By 1927 the advertised equipment was limited to: bucket-shaped front seats adjustable for leg room; wire wheels and Dunlop cord tyres, two spare wheels and tyres; spring gaiters; luggage grid and windscreen wiper (singular).|$|E
50|$|For 1914, Scripps-Booth {{offered a}} three-passenger torpedo roadster, {{powered by a}} 103in3 (1702 cc) (2⅞×4-inch, 3½×102 mm) 18 hp (13 kW) {{water-cooled}} four-cylinder of valve-in-head design with Zenith carburetor and Atwater-Kent automatic spark advance. It featured a 110 in (2794 mm) wheelbase and 30×3½-inch (76×8.8-cm) Houk detachable wire wheels, with three speeds and (still a rarity then) shaft drive. With complete electrical equipment, from Bijur starter to ignition (on a separate switch from starter) to headlights to Klaxet <b>electric</b> <b>horn</b> (with a button in the steering hub, rather than a bulb) to pushbutton door locks, it sold for US$775, compared to US$700 for the Ford Model S (new in 1909), US$650 for the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout, Ford's Model T at $550, Western's Gale Model A at US$500, the Black starting as low as $375, and the Success at an amazingly low US$250.|$|E

50|$|In May 2005, {{interest}} in custom air horn installations was booming. While auto manufacturers were equipping cars with less powerful horns, the latest customization fad of high powered air horns was rapidly gaining popularity. Most older cars were equipped with robust multi-tone air horns, but in modern production automobiles these were {{being replaced by}} smaller single tone <b>electric</b> <b>horns.</b> In Florida, the home state of HornBlasters, Inc., actual railway-use air horns were being installed on vehicles. These custom air horns are so loud that people standing near the horn can feel the blast of air as its honked.|$|R
