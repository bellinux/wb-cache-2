40|$|One {{possible}} {{model for}} libraries that {{are investigating the}} introduction of <b>eBooks,</b> is the digital distribution of <b>eBooks</b> through library and library users computers, via Internet connection. This paper explores the various models that can be adopted to implement the on-line distribution of <b>eBooks.</b> Issues discussed include content availability, content suitability and benefits to library users of on-line <b>eBooks.</b> Models considered include the established netLibrary and the emerging ebrary. A brief comment on the likely time frame to introduce on-line <b>eBooks</b> models is also included. Background For sometime libraries have been providing information and content on-line, e. g., journals and databases. Only recently have they been able to include longer texts such as, <b>eBooks,</b> into their collections. The enthusiasm for <b>eBooks</b> is great, with seminars and discussion lists arguing the pros and cons. In 2000, Forrester forecasted slow growth for <b>eBooks</b> however claimed that <b>eBooks</b> would offer more consumers more choice in presentation and delivery. This paper argues that online <b>eBooks</b> {{should be included in}} library collections because of those very reasons. <b>Ebooks</b> enable libraries to provide 24 X 7 access to information with enhanced content features. As the title of this paper states, <b>eBooks</b> can be delivered via the internet to library users anytime...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} rate of <b>eBooks</b> has multiplied exponentially in University libraries. Libraries prefer buying <b>eBooks</b> {{rather than}} in-print books, {{mainly because of}} their low cost-structure and also because <b>eBooks</b> are easier to store. However, many library users still prefer to read in-print books, as compared to reading <b>eBooks.</b> This therefore leads to a potential mismatch between {{the expectations of the}} library and its users. This study aims to investigate the usage of <b>eBooks</b> in Universities in Hong Kong. The focus of this research is to analyze the behaviors of students using <b>eBooks</b> at Universities in Hong Kong. Their usage experience would be observed and examined in order to identify and discover a more sustainable system for the future development of <b>eBooks</b> in Universities in Hong Kong. In this study, a questionnaire has been utilized for collecting the experiences of students using <b>eBooks.</b> The results very clearly demonstrated that printed books are the preferential choice for most students, although they were willing to accept <b>eBooks</b> as a substitute for printed books. The concerns of students corresponding to acceptance of <b>eBooks</b> have been examined in this study. This study would be beneficial for academic libraries in Hong Kong, as it would provide valuable assistance in enhancing and refining their services and developing their collection of <b>eBooks,</b> through understanding and appreciating the behaviors of students who use <b>eBooks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Completed for Dr. Megan Saylor's PSY-PC 2990 "Honors Research" class, {{this thesis}} investigates {{different}} types of games embedded in children's interactive <b>eBooks</b> and how the quality of these games (i. e., how much the games relate to and enhance the story content) affects how much a kindergarten child {{can learn from the}} story. Word document is accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation. The current literature on <b>eBooks</b> contains conflicting results for enhanced <b>eBooks</b> containing games and hot spots as effective reading tools for children. This study investigated {{different types of}} interactivity within enhanced <b>eBooks</b> to understand how the relation of the games embedded in <b>eBooks</b> to the story line may affect how much the child learns from the story. The study also involved observation of the different co-reading styles of parents and children as an exploratory analysis. The results indicate that interactivity within the enhanced <b>eBooks</b> neither helped nor hurt children’s ability to learn new words from the story and to remember the story content. It was also found that all of the <b>eBooks</b> elicited content-related co-reading, but enhanced <b>eBooks</b> elicited more non-content-related co-reading.
