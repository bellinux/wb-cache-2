In this area, biomass-degrading enzymes are attracting significant research interest for their potential in the production of chemicals and biofuels from renewable feedstock. Gluthatione-dependent β-etherases are emerging enzymes for the biocatalytic depolymerization of lignin, a heterogeneous aromatic polymer abundant in Nature. They selectively catalyze the reductive cleavage of β-O- 4 aryl-ether bonds which account for 45 - 60 % of linkages present in lignin. Hence, application of β-etherases in lignin depolymerization would enable a specific lignin breakdown, selectively yielding (valuable) low-molecular-mass aromatics.

The pre-screening of clone libraries by naive screens followed by the pyrosequencing of the inserts allowed for a 106 -fold increase in the success rate of identifying genes encoding enzymes of interest.

Automatically identifying enzyme facilitates a more cost effective solution than biological experimental methods. The major challenge of "in silicon" methods is the multi-functional nature of enzyme sequences. To address this problem, a 2 -layer predictor has been developed in this paper. The 1 st layer prediction engine is to identify a query protein as enzyme or non-enzyme; if it is an enzyme protein, the process will automatically continue to the 2 nd layer prediction engine for predicting enzyme function classes. In this layer, multi-functional enzymes which belong to two or more function classes can be detected by the Multi-Label classifier. Two feature extraction methods are adopted in our work. One extracts 20 -D features with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and the other extracts 188 -D features based on composition and physical chemical property of protein.

The enzymes showed distinct behaviour on Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography. The BBM-associated PCMT did not bind to the column, being eluted in the flow-through, whereas the BLM enzyme bound to the column and was eluted at 0. 15 M NaCl. Moreover, the two enzymes had different molecular masses under both denaturing and nondenaturing conditions, the BLM PCMT migrating at an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa, compared with 27 kDa for the BBM enzyme. Taken together, these results show the presence of two distinct L-isoaspartyl PCMTs in the plasma membranes of the kidney cortex...|$|E
40|$|Permanently cold environments are {{populated}} by {{a diversity of}} microorganisms that possess cold-adapted enzymes with potential biotechnological applications. Advances in molecular techniques have enabled bioprospecting of novel enzymes from extreme environments without tedious cultivation efforts. Cloning and sequencing of the metagenomic DNA from the water column of the meromictic Antarctic lake, Ace Lake, enabled <b>enzyme</b> <b>identification</b> by sequence-based searches and functional screening for enzyme activity. The sequence-based search for hydrolases using profile Hidden Markov Models indicated the presence of uncharacterized subtilases, lipases and glycoside hydrolases in the metagenomic dataset. Information from the bioinformatic analysis was utilized to perform targeted functional screening of clones containing the candidate hydrolase genes. Alongside this targeted approach, ~ 20000 clones from the Ace Lake metagenomic library were randomly screened via agar-based assay. As both functional screening approaches yielded very low positive identifications, {{the capacity of the}} sequence-based screening to detect bona fide hydrolases was further tested by cloning selected subtilase genes and overexpressing them in Escherichia coli. One of the overexpressed subtilase genes showed proteolytic activity when tested with N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-ρ-nitroanilide. Finally, {{in order to get a}} bigger picture of the abundance of subtilase and other peptidase genes in Ace Lake, taxonomic affiliation and relative abundance of all candidate peptidases were assessed. The Ace Lake peptidases composition was also compared to peptidases in Organic Lake and Southern Ocean metagenomic datasets. The analysis indicated an abundance of diverse metallopeptidases and serine peptidases in all three datasets. Peptidases related to protein and membrane regulatory control and chaperones with peptidase activity were the most abundant groups, which are linked to microbial survival as a response to environmental stress. In conclusion, this study revealed the advantage of cultivation-independent methods for bioprospecting enzymes from cold environments, and established a foundation for future functional studies of other enzymes...|$|E
40|$|To {{alter the}} amine donor/acceptor {{spectrum}} of an (S) -selective amine transaminase (ATA), a library {{based on the}} Vibrio fluvialis ATA targeting four residues close to the active site (L 56, W 57, R 415 and L 417) was created. A 3 DM-derived alignment comprising fold class I pyridoxal- 5 ′-phosphate (PLP) -dependent <b>enzymes</b> allowed <b>identification</b> of positions, which were assumed to determine substrate specificity. These positions were targeted for mutagenesis with a focused alphabet of hydrophobic amino acids to convert an amine:α-keto acid transferase into an amine:aldehyde transferase. Screening of 1200 variants revealed three hits, which showed a shifted amine donor/acceptor spectrum towards aliphatic aldehydes (mainly pentanal), {{as well as an}} altered pH profile. Interestingly, all three hits, although found independently, contained the same mutation R 415 L and additional W 57 F and L 417 V substitutions...|$|R
30|$|The natural {{diversity}} of enzymes {{could provide a}} large reservoir that can be further improved by engineering enzymes and strains for increased performance [43]. A number of designer enzymes called glycosynthases, including cellulases and hemicellulases, have been engineered by replacing nucleophilic residues resulting in higher yields of different oligosaccharides [16]. In protein engineering, the three-dimensional structure of an <b>enzyme</b> guides the <b>identification</b> and modification of amino acid residues, through rational design and directed evolution, which affect some property such as specific activity or thermal stability [27, 44].|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen sulfide is an {{essential}} catabolite that intervenes in the pathophysiol. of several diseases from hypertension to stroke, diabetes and pancreatitis. It is endogenously synthesized mainly by two pyridoxal-​ 5 '-​phosphate-​dependent enzymes involved in L-​cysteine metab. : cystathionine-​ss-​synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-​γ-​lyase (CSE) ​. Research in this field is currently impaired {{by the lack of}} pharmacol. tools such as selective enzymic inhibitors that could target specifically only one of these pathways. We used a novel approach based on a hybrid method that includes drug design, synthetic biol., metabolomics and pharmacol. assays to rationally design a new inhibitor selective for the CSE <b>enzyme.</b> The <b>identification</b> of this compd. opens new frontiers towards {{a better understanding of the}} role of CSE over CBS in the pathophysiol. of diseases where a role for the H 2 S pathway has been proposed and the development of new lead compds. that could target the CSE enzyme...|$|R
