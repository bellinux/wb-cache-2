2500|$|In {{a review}} of the case, the Washington University Law Quarterly remarked, [...] "The Ninth Circuit's {{extension}} of the free exercise clause to include a privilege against tort liability is incorrect. First, by distinguishing emotional harms from physical harms, the court downplayed the significance of an <b>emotional</b> <b>injury,</b> which is often times as great as physical harm. ... In most of the free exercise cases decided by the Supreme Court the government has acted against the religious group, either by imposing criminal sanctions for religious conduct or denying members some benefit because of their religious beliefs. In Paul, however, the religious group acted as the aggressor, violating the plaintiff's right to emotional well-being. By granting defendants an absolute privilege against tort liability, the court has allowed the Church to use the shield of the first amendment as a sword. ... The Paul decision is an unfortunate expansion of a doctrine intended to protect individual rights. To turn the doctrine on its head {{and use it as a}} means to thwart another person's rights is an ironic twist that would undoubtedly displease the drafters of the first amendment. ... At best, Paul can be viewed as a slight detour from the correct interpretation of the free exercise clause and the proper balancing of interests performed by the Supreme Court and numerous lower courts." ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 63 - 74) Many {{children grow}} up in a dysfunctional family and ninety-five percent of the population received inadequate parenting. Adults who come from a dysfunctional family and have <b>emotional</b> <b>injuries</b> are called adult children of dysfunctional families (ACoDFs). ACoDFs cany common characteristics into adulthood as the result of their upbringing and have serious psychological, social, and physical effects. ACoDFs deal with unrecognized losses including the loss of childhood, the loss of boundaries, the loss of attachments, the loss of a sense of self, the loss of emotional expression, and the loss of fantasy parents. Many of them are not able to communicate their feelings of grief and may journey through their entire life in a state of subterranean grief. Grief work gives a chance to mourn and express their emotions, which was not possible for ACoDFs to get as a child. Facilitating grief work helps ACoDFs heal from the <b>emotional</b> <b>injuries.</b> The painful grief work will be a turning point for ACoDFs to develop their personal growth. This project provides the workbook for therapists, which addresses the guideline of treating ACoDFs, dilemma of confrontation, and breaking through their defense mechanisms while presenting their core issues in different stages of grief treatment...|$|R

50|$|In 2001, Canadian Forces Lieutenant Colonel Stéphane Grenier {{coined the}} term 'Operational stress injury' to {{describe}} a mental or <b>emotional</b> <b>injury</b> suffered by soldiers {{in the course of}} their service. The term was designed to expand the understanding of mental health disorders related to service beyond just PTSD, and to include other clinical diagnoses linked to trauma. The word 'injury' was chosen to help shift the view of these disorders in order to extend to them the same legitimacy in discourse as physical injuries, and to help reduce the stigma surrounding mental health. Not a disagnosis itself, operational stress injury was described by the Canadian Forces as a “grouping of diagnoses that are related to injuries that occur as part of operations", most commonly PTSD, major depression, and generalized anxiety.|$|E

40|$|The courts {{historically}} have viewed mental and <b>emotional</b> <b>injuries</b> with suspicion. In attempting {{to ensure that}} claims of mental/emotional injuries brought to trial are genuine, most courts require that plaintiffs meet special standards unique to {{this area of the}} law. Some standards are artificial, however, in that they refer to factors not directly related to the injury claimed. Further, like tort law in general, the development of these legal standards has occurred in the absence of empirical data. In this initial study 111 Arizona trials litigating claims of mental/emotional injuries were examined. General characteristics describing the litigants, the claimed injuries, the use of expert witnesses, and resulting verdicts are reported. Data was not found to indicate that the artificial standards are warranted. The effects that the artificial standards had upon claims pursued at the trial court level are presented. Factors that influenced trial outcomes are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) further complicates inmates’ {{ability to}} claim that solitary confinement’s {{psychological}} damage constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

50|$|According to John H.

Because Section 502(a)(2) of ERISA ran to the benefit of the employee benefit plan (rather than the employee) and because the Ninth Circuit gave the plaintiff victory based on that section instead of Section 502(a)(3) which ran to the employee, the case was presented to the High Court in an awkward procedural posture. This mistake in choosing which section of ERISA to base the claim would lead to an error by Justice Scalia later in Mertens.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To outline how a {{psychiatric}} expert can do an impartial assessment and medicolegal report {{and then give}} an effective presentation in court that can sustain cross-examination.

40|$|Clinicians face {{formidable}} {{challenges in}} working with male perpetrators of domestic violence. Many treatment programs use a confrontational approach that emphasizes male entitlement and patriarchal societal attitudes, without honoring the genuine psychological pain of the abusive male. Although some men with strong psychopathic tendencies are almost impossible to treat, the majority of spouse-abusing males respond best to an empathic, client-centered, self psychological approach that also includes education about sociocultural issues and specific skill building. Understanding the deprivations in mirroring selfobject functions from which these men typically suffer facilitates clinical treatment response. While insisting that men take full responsibility for their abusive behavior, treatment approaches can still be most effective by addressing inherent psychological issues. Group leaders who can offer respect for perpetrators' history, their experience of powerlessness, and their <b>emotional</b> <b>injuries</b> in primary relationships {{are more likely to}} make an impact.

5000|$|As both Fiebert and Archer point out, {{although}} the mathematical tally of physical acts {{in these studies}} has found similar rates of IPV amongst men and women, and high rates of bidirectionality, there is general agreement amongst researchers that male violence is a more serious phenomenon, primarily, but not exclusively, because male violence tends to inflict more damage than female violence. Male violence produces injury at roughly six {{times the rate of}} female violence. Women {{are also more likely to}} be killed by their male partners than the reverse (according to the US Department of Justice, 84% of spousal murder victims are female), and women in general are more likely to be killed by their spouses than all other types of assailants combined. In relation to this, Murray A.
