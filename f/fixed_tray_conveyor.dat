30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} and reliability of the mechanized transplanting, a vegetable seedling automatic conveying system was designed. The functional execution component of the system consists of a tank-wheel storage seedling mechanism, a seedling <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor,</b> and a hanging cup circulating conveying mechanism. Combined with the communication technology between host computer and programmable logic controller (PLC), the user interface software of automatic conveying system for potted vegetable was developed by using Visual Studio to control and monitor the transmission progress. The PVDF pressure sensor was used to detect the pressure change of the seedling storage disk to obtain the information of the loading seedling tray. The limit switch and stroke switch were combined to obtain the information of the push rod and feed plate. The timing of each component {{is controlled by the}} PLC controller combined with the feedback information of each sensor. The test results show the effect of taking an individual seedling is excellent, the error rate of the pushing mechanism is about 2.08 %, and the success rate was 97.91 %.|$|R
30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to drive the sprocket wheel of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling <b>tray</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling <b>tray</b> enters the <b>conveyor</b> belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable seedling is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable seedling in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|R

40|$|Ripple {{formation}} beneath sea waves is analyzed both by {{experimental and}} analytical means when {{the bottom is}} made up of a mixture of sands. An oscillatory flow is obtained in a closed duct by the oscillations of two rigidly connected pistons located at the ends of the duct. The amplitude and period of the oscillations can be continuously varied. A <b>fixed</b> <b>tray,</b> located {{at the bottom of the}} duct and filled with different types of sediments, allows ripple formation to be observed. The presence of graded sediments is found to have a stabilizing effect and causes longer ripples to appear. Moreover a selective sediment transport is observed and quantified which tends to pile up the coarse grains at ripple crests leaving the fine ones in the troughs. As in the companion paper, the theory is based on a linear stability analysis of a flat sandy bottom subject to an oscillatory flow. Because of the presence of a mixture, a modified version of Exner equation is used and an “hiding” factor should be inserted in the sediment transport rate formula. The flow regime in the bottom boundary layer is assumed to be turbulent. The conditions for ripple appearance are determined along with their wavelengths as they form. Good agreement is found between experimental data and theoretical findings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the design of}} novel two-phase fingers to passively reorient objects while picking them up. Two-phase refers {{to a change in}} the finger-object contact geometry, from a free spinning point contact to a firm multipoint contact, as the gripping force increases. We exploit the two phases to passively reorient prismatic objects from a horizontal resting pose to an upright secure grasp. This problem is particularly relevant to industrial assembly applications where parts often are presented lying on <b>trays</b> or <b>conveyor</b> belts and need to be assembled vertically. Each two-phase finger is composed of a small hard contact point attached to an elastic strip mounted over a V-groove cavity. When grasped between two parallel fingers with low gripping force, the object pivots about the axis between the contact points on the strips, and aligns upright with gravity. A subsequent increase in the gripping force makes the elastic strips recede into the cavities letting the part seat in the V-grooves to secure the grasp. The design is compatible with any type of parallel-jaw gripper, and can be reconfigured to specific objects by changing the geometry of the cavity. The two-phase gripper provides robots with the capability to accurately position and manipulate parts, reducing the need for dedicated part feeders or time-demanding regrasp procedures.

40|$|Tibial {{rotation}} is {{an important}} aspect of knee function and can be altered after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). These alterations include decreased internal rotation with knee flexion as compared to the normal state and paradoxical external rotation with flexion. Mobile bearing total knee prostheses may allow greater unconstrained tibial rotation. I compared tibial rotation after fixed bearing or mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty in 82 patients who underwent TKA with the tibia cut first technique to ascertain any differences. Using intraoperative imageless computer navigation, measurements included the determination of tibial rotation from extension to 90 ° flexion before and after prosthetic implantation with non-weight-bearing range of motion. I found that tibial rotation was significantly reduced after fixed bearing total knee replacement as compared to mobile bearing. In addition, the tibial position compared to the distal femur in extension was more external in fixed bearings compared to mobile bearings. Placing the <b>fixed</b> tibial <b>tray</b> with increased internal rotation could explain this difference...|$|R

The {{first step in}} such a processor is to locate each individual item {{and place it in}} a separate file for input to a classifier to determine the quality of each nut. This paper considers new techniques to: detect each item (each nut can be in any orientation, we employ new rotation-invariant filters to locate each item independent of its orientation), produce separate image files for each item (a new blob coloring algorithm provides this for isolated (non-touching) input items), segmentation to provide separate image files for touching or overlapping input items (we use a morphological watershed transform to achieve this), and morphological processing to remove the shell and produce an image of only the nutmeat. Each of these operations and algorithms are detailed and quantitative data for each are presented for the X-ray image nut inspection problem noted.

30|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} detection system mainly detects the position change of the seedling plate from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling plate conveyor belt and obtains the position signal as the action control signal of {{loading and unloading}}. The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, travel switch, limit sensor, and a single lamp. The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} the slot wheel-type seedling storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether the seedling storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the single lamp and instructs the start of the sprocket drive motor.

40|$|Introduction: Radiolucent lines (RLL) are {{commonly}} {{seen at the}} cement–bone interface of knee replacements, yet are poorly understood. Although thin RLL are not associated with implant loosening or poor patient outcome there is still concern that they indicate sub-optimal fixation. The primary study aim is to characterise the histology at the cement–tibia interface in Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR). The second aim is to assess whether a correlation exists between {{the presence of a}} RLL and the type of tissue that predominates at the interface. Methods: The radiology and histology of retrieved specimens of the interface from around firmly <b>fixed</b> tibial <b>trays</b> in ten patients undergoing revision between 1 and 19 years after Oxford UKR were studied. Results: Pre-revision radiographs showed the presence of both full and partial RLL. On contact radiographs of 5 mm thick sections of the interface the total percentage of radiolucency ranged from 0 to 90 % between patients. There was no consistent pattern for the distribution of radiolucency. Histological assessment demonstrated that under every tibial component there were areas where there was direct contact and interdigitation between bone and cement. The amount of direct bone–cement contact was between 19 % and 95 % of the tibial tray surface area. The remaining tissue was mainly fibrocartilage but there was also fibrous tissue. The presence of radiolucency was strongly inversely correlated with the percentage of cement–bone contact. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that even with partial or complete RLL seen on radiographs there is still cement–bone contact, thus indicating that there is stable fixation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{are responsible for}} significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Multi-drug resistance emergence has rendered many therapies ineffective. New therapies are urgently required to widen treatment options. SASPject technology delivers small acid-soluble spore protein (SASP) genes to target bacteria using modified bacteriophage vectors, resulting in rapid killing. SASP is a unique antibacterial protein that non-specifically binds bacterial DNA and halts DNA replication and gene expression. In this study we present the first data for a Gram-negative targeted SASPject vector (PT 3. 1) which shows in vitro activity against Escherichia coli (EC) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Methods: We evaluated efficacy of SASPject PT 3. 1 vs. EC (N= 5) & PA (N= 5) using a microtitre <b>tray</b> <b>fixed</b> duration (3 h) kill method. Log-phase cultures (1 x 105 cfu/mL) were prepared in supplemented (MgSO 4 & CaCl 2, 5 mM; glucose, 0. 1 % w/v) LB broth (LBC) & exposed to 2 x 108 plaque forming units (pfu) /mL of PT 3. 1. PT 3. 1 antimicrobial activity was determined using agar-based culture following incubation (37 oC). Additionally, rate of PT 3. 1 kill was determined using a kill-curve technique; a selection of EC & PA strains from the fixed duration kill study were evaluated & bacterial viable counts determined over 3 h on LBC agar. Results: SASPject PT 3. 1 elicited good antimicrobial activity vs. EC & PA evaluated in this study; the median reduction in viable counts for PT 3. 1 -treated cultures in the fixed 3 h kill was 99. 1 %. Kill curve data suggested rapid EC & PA killing; viable counts (log 10 cfu/mL range) of PT 3. 1 -treated cultures were 2. 36 -> 4. 01, 3. 04 - 4. 06, and 3. 40 - 4. 16 lower than corresponding controls after 1, 2, and 3 h respectively.
