40|$|New test {{procedure}} evaluates quality {{and accuracy of}} energy analysis tools for the residential building retrofit market. Reducing the energy use of existing homes in the United States offers significant energy-saving opportunities, which can be identified through building simulation software tools that calculate optimal packages of efficiency measures. To improve the accuracy of energy analysis for residential buildings, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Buildings Research team developed the Building Energy Simulation Test for Existing Homes (BESTEST-EX), a method for diagnosing and correcting errors in building energy audit software and calibration procedures. BESTEST-EX consists of building physics <b>and</b> <b>utility</b> <b>bill</b> calibration test cases, which software developers can use to compare their tools simulation findings to reference results generated with state-of-the-art simulation tools. Overall, the BESTEST-EX methodology: (1) Tests software predictions of retrofit energy savings in existing homes; (2) Ensures building physics calculations <b>and</b> <b>utility</b> <b>bill</b> calibration procedures perform to a minimum standard; and (3) Quantifies impacts of uncertainties in input audit data and occupant behavior.

Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed a new test procedure to increase the quality and accuracy of energy analysis tools for the building retrofit market. The Building Energy Simulation Test for Existing Homes (BESTEST-EX) is a test procedure that enables software developers to evaluate {{the performance of their}} audit tools in modeling energy use and savings in existing homes when <b>utility</b> <b>bills</b> are available for model calibration. Similar to NREL's previous energy analysis tests, such as HERS BESTEST and other BESTEST suites included in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140, BESTEST-EX compares software simulation findings to reference results generated with state-of-the-art simulation tools such as EnergyPlus, SUNREL, and DOE- 2. 1 E. The BESTEST-EX methodology: (1) Tests software predictions of retrofit energy savings in existing homes; (2) Ensures building physics calculations <b>and</b> <b>utility</b> <b>bill</b> calibration procedures perform to a minimum standard; and (3) Quantifies impacts of uncertainties in input audit data and occupant behavior. BESTEST-EX includes building physics <b>and</b> <b>utility</b> <b>bill</b> calibration test cases. The diagram illustrates the <b>utility</b> <b>bill</b> calibration test cases. Participants are given input ranges <b>and</b> synthetic <b>utility</b> <b>bills.</b> Software tools use the <b>utility</b> <b>bills</b> to calibrate key model inputs and predict energy savings for the retrofit cases.
