40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife, 1998 <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owls</b> (Strix occidentalis) appear heat intolerant. One of the {{hypotheses}} {{to explain the}} close association of <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owls</b> with old-growth coniferous forests is that the multilayered and complex structure of these forests provides a cooler microclimate for roosting owls than early seral-stage forests. Therefore, I compared temperatures at summer roosts of 22 Northern <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owls</b> (S. o. caurina) with temperatures at random sites within stands where owls roosted and at random sites within adjacent younger forests on the Willow Creek Study Area (WCSA) {{in the interior of}} northwestern California. Temperatures at actual roost sites within mature/old-growth forests were significantly lower than those at random sites within adjacent younger stands. Temperatures at random sites within owl roost stands were intermediate between roost site temperatures and those at random sites within younger <b>forests.</b> <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owls</b> selected cooler microclimates each time they changed their roost when ambient temperatures were above their upper critical temperature of 25. 2 ??C. In an effort to explain the use of second-growth <b>forests</b> by <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owls</b> in the coastal redwood zone of northwestern California, I also examined temperature differences and temperature profiles between microsites in mature/old-growth and younger forests at both WCSA and Redwood National Park (RNP). Forests, including mature/old-growth and younger forests, at RNP were much cooler than those at WCSA. Due to the marine influence on summer climate, there was little variation in temperature profiles between mature/old-growth and younger forests at RNP. In addition, mature/old-growth forests at WCSA had a cooler microclimate and a less variable temperature profile than younger forests at WCSA. My study demonstrated microclimate selection in <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owls,</b> and the importance of multilayered stand structure in creating cool microclimates and stable thermal environments from the forest floor to canopy level. Finally, in comparison with the interior, the much cooler summer climate at the coast may account for the relaxed <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owl</b> roost selection in early successional stage forests...|$|R
50|$|Northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix occidentalis caurina) is an old-growth {{dependent}} species and {{is listed as}} threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The majority of <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> on the Olympic peninsula, along with the largest preserve of temperate old-growth forest, live in the national park. <b>Spotted</b> <b>owls</b> prey on flying squirrels and snowshoe hares, and are themselves preyed on by great horned owls Bubo virginianus.

50|$|The {{history of}} the Forest Service has been fraught with controversy, as various {{interests}} and national values have grappled with the appropriate management of the many resources within the forests. These values and resources include grazing, timber, mining, recreation, wildlife habitat, and wilderness.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This study {{examined}} the differences, at various scales, between northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix occidentalis caurina) nest sites and non-nest sites, i. e., sites where no nests were found during surveys, in the Coast Ranges of Oregon. I compared land cover around 41 owl nest sites (ONS) and 41 non-nest sites (NNS) at 5 different landscape scales (0. 6 -, 1. 2 -, 1. 8 -, 24 -, and 3. 0 -km-radius circles). I also compared characteristics of 29 old-growth (overstory trees > 86 -cm diameter-at-breast-height [dbh]) patches where owl nest were found (ONP) with characteristics of 29 old-growth patches where no nest were found (NNP). All sites were in the Eugene District, Bureau of Land Management. Land cover was classified into 8 categories and typed from aerial photographs. I quantified land-cover indices using a geographic information system and used logistic regression for binary responses to make statistical inferences. At the 0. 6 -km-radius circle, percentages of old-growth and old-remnant (young conifer stands with some large-diameter trees) forests were the best predictors of difference between ONS and NNS, being greater at ONS. The even distribution of forest cover types, as calculated using Simpson's Evenness Index, was also a good predictor of this difference, being more even at ONS. At the 1. 2 -km-radius circle, GlSfrag, i. e., the mean distance among old-growth patches, was {{the best predictor of}} difference between ONS and NNS, being greater at NNS. At 1. 8 -, 2. 4 -, and 3. 0 -km-radius circles, the percentage of pole-young ("even-aged" conifer stands; trees 13 - 53 -cm dbh) forests was the best predictor of difference between ONS and NNS, being greater at NNS. However, differences in all of these landscape indices between ONS and NNS, including GlSfrag and percentage of pole-young forests, were greatest at the smallest circle size, and differences decreased as circle size increased. At the old-growth patch scale, the ratio of core area (interior patch area > 100 m from the outer patch edge) to patch size and complexity of patch shape were the best predictors of difference between ONP and NNP, being greater at ONP. Furthermore, <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> tend to nest in old-growth patches, particularly those [greater than or equal to] 40 - 50 ha in size and with a ratio of core area to patch size [greater than or equal to] 0. 20 - 0. 30.

40|$|Although the {{dependence}} of <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix occidentalis) on older forests has been well documented, the specific attributes of comparatively younger forests used by owls have not been described in some regions. We collected habitat data at locations used by <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> tracked in an intensive radio-telemetry study to develop descriptions of these forests on the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington. After addressing the effects of triangulation error on the placement of our vegetation sampling plots, we collected data at all 16 telemetry locations that could be clearly associated with non-old-growth habitat, as well as 16 random locations. Owl locations were divided into 2 groups to reflect single-use (only one radio location within the error polygon) and multiple-use sites (gtoreq 2 radio locations within the error polygon) within home ranges. Vegetation data collected in three arrays of variably-sized plots included measures of stem and snag density (by diameter class), canopy cover, and cover of downed wood and shrubs. Our analyses indicated that single-visit and random locations did not differ {{with respect to the}} variables we recorded. However, both differed from multiple-use locations in abundance of larger snags, and amount of canopy closure. A logistic regression model indicated that multiple-use sites could be reliably distinguished from single-use and random locations based on the greater number of snags gtoreq 51 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) and gtoreq 70 % canopy closure. Younger <b>forests</b> managed for <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> foraging habitat in this region should be in the understory reinitiation stage of stand development, have gtoreq 70 % canopy closure, and contain gtoreq 4 snags/ 0. 4 -ha that are gtoreq 51 cm dbh.

40|$|Abstract: Forty-one California <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) nest {{sites were}} {{examined}} in foothill riparian and oak woodlands at 1, 140 to 4, 200 feet in elevation in the Sierra National Forest and Sequoia National Park, California. Nest sites were generally located on the lower 1 / 3 of the slope where dense canopy cover (averaging 86 percent) and multiple layers of vegetation were present. Aspects at nest sites were either west, north, or east; southern aspects were not used. Slopes ranged from nearly flat to more than 100 percent, but preference for a particular range of slopes was not detected. We found 24 platform nests, 13 side cavity nests and four top cavity nests. Nests were located in California sycamore (Platanus racemosa), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and five species of oaks (Quercus spp.). Nest trees averaged 24 inches in diameter (range 7 to 54 inches) with a mean tree height of 62 feet and nest height of 39 feet.

40|$|The {{northern}} <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix occidentalis caurina) is {{a controversial}} {{species in the}} Pacific Northwest that is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The barred owl (Strix varia), a species historically restricted to eastern North America, has recently expanded its range to completely overlap that of the northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl.</b> Recent evidence suggests that barred owls may compete with northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> and may be one cause for recent declines in some northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> populations. Our focus was to examine whether barred owls {{have the potential to}} competitively exclude northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> from their territories through interference competition. We used a playback experiment to quantify aggressive vocal and physical behavior of barred and northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> during territorial defense. Experimental trials consisted of displaying northern <b>spotted</b> or barred <b>owl</b> taxidermy mounts, and broadcasting recorded vocalizations of the corresponding species, in both barred and northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> territories. The frequency of interspecific interactions was lower compared to intraspecific interactions between northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> alone. However, barred owls responded with higher levels of vocal and physical aggression than did northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> when agonistic interspecific interactions occurred. Our results suggest that barred owls are likely to assume the dominant role during interspecific interactions with northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls.</b> Thus, interference competition is a plausible mechanism by which barred owls could contribute to observed population declines of northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> in areas where the species co-occur...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2013 Competitive {{interactions}} with barred owls (Strix varia) {{are an important}} factor contributing to the observed decline in the northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix occidentallis caurina) population in Washington. My goal was to {{develop an understanding of}} barred owl habitat associations at spatial scales corresponding to home ranges and larger landscapes, and to apply that understanding to evaluate potential patterns of population interaction between <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> and barred owls in the eastern Cascade Range, Washington. I found that during the breeding season, barred owls used portions of their home ranges characterized as complex-structure mixed grand fir (Abies grandis) forest more than open ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or simple-structure Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). At a landscape scale, barred owls were associated with a broader range of forest structure and species composition conditions than <b>spotted</b> <b>owls,</b> but barred owls were more strongly associated with gentle slopes in lower topographic positions. Seventy-two percent of the areas used by <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> were located on slopes > 16 degrees, and 72 % of the areas used by barred owls were located on slopes < 16 degrees. Overlap between barred <b>owl</b> and <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> habitat had a substantial effect on <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> pair site occupancy dynamics from 1989 to 2011. Site occupancy probability declined for all of the <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> pair sites, but it declined much less for sites with more good <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> habitat that overlapped with poor barred owl habitat within 500 ha of the <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> activity centers. Despite differences in space use and landscape associations displayed by the two species, displacement by barred owls had substantial detrimental impacts on <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> population performance in individual-based population modeling scenarios. The most plausible estimates of barred owl vital rates produced <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> population declines of approximately 60 % to 80 % relative to the <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> population estimate without barred owl displacement. Population simulations suggested that this landscape was capable of supporting at least twice as many barred <b>owls</b> as <b>spotted</b> <b>owls,</b> without considering the effects of inter-specific competition.

To be effective into the future, conservation efforts {{need to consider}} potential global change impacts {{and the ability of}} plants and animals to adapt. In northern California’s Klamath-Cascade region projected changes are heterogeneous across the complex landscape. Understanding future conditions can guide climate adaptation actions. The objective of this project is to support climate-smart conservation in the Klamath-Cascade through a spatially explicit analysis. The analysis searches for areas which have the highest likelihood of successful forest conservation in the uncertain future. In particular, the project looks at climate variability, tree species composition, and northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> habitat. It uses existing climate data and species envelope models to understand the long-term durability of the Klamath-Cascade. Within the region, it is likely that areas with smaller magnitudes of change will have future climatic conditions more favorable to species persistence. These areas are desirable for long-term conservation and protection of the plants and animals in the Klamath-Cascade. To identify areas desirable for species persistence, I used likelihood data from ten tree species climate envelope models to assess the similarity of current and future tree species composition. I also assessed the similarity of current precipitation and temperature variables to projected conditions. I found that many areas of the Klamath-Cascade will experience novel climate conditions by 2060. Some areas will experience considerably more warming and loss of precipitation than others. However, there are also significant portions of the region that have an overlap of current and future species climate envelopes, indicating similar current and future vegetation communities.

This high level of sequence diversity is significant because only one Leucocytozoon species (L. danilewskyi) has been accepted as valid among all owls, suggesting that L. danilewskyi is a cryptic species.

40|$|State {{and federal}} actions to {{conserve}} northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix occidentalis caurina) habitat are largely initiated by establishing habitat occupancy. Northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> occupancy is typically assessed by eliciting {{their response to}} simulated conspecific vocalizations. However, proximity of barred owls (Strix varia) –a significant threat to northern spotted owls–can suppress northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> responsiveness to vocalization surveys and hence their probability of detection. We developed a survey method to simultaneously detect both species that does not require vocalization. Detection dogs (Canis familiaris) located owl pellets accumulated under roost sites, within search areas selected using habitat association maps. We compared success of detection dog surveys to vocalization surveys slightly modified from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Draft 2010 Survey Protocol.

5000|$|Barred owls {{are partly}} {{responsible}} for the recent decline of the northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl,</b> native to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owl</b> (p. vi) states “Based on the best available scientific information, competition from the barred owl (S. varia) poses a significant and complex threat to the spotted owl.” Since the 1960s, barred owls have been expanding their range westward from the eastern US and Canada (see “Distribution and habitat” section above). When <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> and barred owls share the same area, the barred owls generally are more aggressive and out-compete the <b>spotted</b> <b>owls,</b> leading to decreased populations of the native owls. Barred owls may even kill <b>spotted</b> <b>owls.</b> Barred <b>owls</b> and <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> occasionally interbreed, creating hybrids ("sparred owl" [...] or [...] "botted owl"). Only 47 hybrids with barred owls were found in an analysis of more than 9000 banded spotted owls; consequently, hybridization between these two species is considered by the authors of that analysis to be “an interesting biological phenomenon that is probably inconsequential compared with the real threat—direct competition between the two species for food and space” (p. 808).|$|R

30|$|Some of the {{variation}} among studies may reflect differences among geographic regions and forest types covered. All three subspecies of <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> inhabit <b>forest</b> types ranging from wet to fairly dry. For example, forests inhabited by northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> range from very mesic {{in places such as}} the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, to drier forest types on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains (Anthony et al. 2006). Similarly, California <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> inhabit relatively mesic conifer-dominated forests at higher elevations in the Sierra Nevada, but also inhabit oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands in the foothills and conifer-hardwood mixtures in the Peninsular Mountains of southern California (Verner et al. 1992). And Mexican <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> inhabit both rocky canyonlands and a range of forest types from wet mixed-conifer forests to drier pine-oak forest types (USDI FWS 2012). There is little reason to expect fire behavior to be similar across the range of occupied forest types, and therefore may be little reason to expect owl response to be similar among subspecies, geographic areas, and forest types. In this context, note that most of the available studies are on California <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> (Table 1). Far less information is available from the range of the northern and, especially, the Mexican <b>spotted</b> <b>owl,</b> and the responses of these subspecies may not be well described by studies of California <b>spotted</b> <b>owls.</b>|$|R

This plan currently maintains an average 62 % (+/- 15 % SD, n = 101) suitable habitat for <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owls</b> within 101 Long-term Activity Centres distributed among 21 Special Resource Management Zones (SRMZs) totaling 363, 000 ha in the Chilliwack and Squamish Forest Districts. The long-term goal of the <b>Spotted</b> <b>Owl</b> Management Plan is to maintain eventually a minimum of 67 % suitable habitat within these Long-term Activity Centres and thus stabilize the owl population.

However, SOPET cautioned that this action must work in concert with improved habitat protection and, if owls were to remain in the wild, a strategy to manage problem Barred Owls. In May 2007, the Minster of Environment and Minister of Agriculture and Lands approved a modified version of SOPET’s Option B.

By restricting the search to US Forest Service lands, we focused on areas most likely to harbor <b>spotted</b> <b>owls.</b> We did not include fires in Utah and Colorado, {{within the range of}} the Mexican <b>spotted</b> <b>owl,</b> because many owls in these areas occur in rocky can-yonland habitat that may be less directly affected by fire (Willey and van Riper 2007, USDI FWS 2012).

30|$|Considerable {{uncertainty}} remains {{about the}} responses of <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> to wildfire, especially responses to high-severity fire over longer time frames and across subspecies. Relatively few studies have evaluated the effects of wildfires on <b>spotted</b> <b>owls,</b> especially for the Mexican and northern subspecies, and results of existing studies are short-term and sometimes contradictory. To be clear, we do not assume that all wildfires are detrimental to <b>spotted</b> <b>owls,</b> and in fact surmise that low-severity and moderate-severity wildfires pose little threat to <b>spotted</b> <b>owls.</b> Available evidence suggests that high-severity wildfire can be detrimental, however, depending on spatial pattern and extent. The considerable recent extent of high-severity wildfire within the ranges of these subspecies (Table 3; see also Stephens et al. 2016), coupled with the trend toward increasing extent and severity of megafires (Miller et al. 2009, Stephens et al. 2016), suggests that the cumulative effects of these fires could be significant throughout the range of all three subspecies of the <b>spotted</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
