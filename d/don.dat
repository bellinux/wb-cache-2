5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and <b>Don</b> {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. <b>Don</b> tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on <b>Don,</b> the model will not show <b>Don</b> at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, <b>Don,</b> Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After <b>Don</b> kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E
