5|$|Born in Philadelphia to {{a family}} active in Whig {{politics}}, Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council {{and then to the}} Pennsylvania State Senate. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of federal power.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces {{carried out}} a winter test for {{potential}} military vehicles in March 1958. 35candidate vehicles from the two <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> and various importers were driven around Finland. VAT sent four vehicles to the test, three of which were 4×4s and one was an ordinary, rear-wheel driven vehicle. During the five days' testing period, all vehicles were continuously fully loaded. For part of the journey, the vehicles had to tow an eight-ton field cannon. The vehicles were tested for off-road capabilities in even, -deep snow. One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident. The domestic vehicles performed well in the test; {{in some cases the}} rear-wheel driven Sisus and Vanajas outperformed the 4×4-driven foreign competitors. None of the vehicles were clearly better than the others but the result convinced the Defence Forces of the capabilities of the domestic vehicles and led to several deals for SAT and VAT.|$|E

25|$|Advocates of neo-liberal {{economics}} {{argue that}} while import substitution policies might create {{jobs in the}} short run, as <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> replace foreign producers, neoliberal theory believes {{that in the long}} run output and growth will be lower than it would otherwise have been. This is because import substitution denies the country the benefits to be gained from specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of comparative advantage shows how countries will gain from trade. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency: <b>Domestic</b> <b>producers</b> have no incentive from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.|$|E

25|$|In February 1832 Henry Clay, {{back in the}} Senate after a {{two decades}} absence, made a three-day-long speech calling for a new tariff {{schedule}} and an expansion of his American System. In an effort {{to reach out to}} John Calhoun and other southerners, Clay’s proposal provided for a ten million dollar revenue reduction based on the amount of budget surplus he anticipated for the coming year. Significant protection was still part of the plan as the reduction primarily came on those imports not in competition with <b>domestic</b> <b>producers.</b> Jackson proposed an alternative that reduced overall tariffs to 28%. John Quincy Adams, now in the House of Representatives, used his Committee of Manufacturers to produce a compromise bill that, in its final form, reduced revenues by five million dollars, lowered duties on non-competitive products, and retained high tariffs on woolens, iron, and cotton products. In the course of the political maneuvering, George McDuffie’s Ways and Means Committee, the normal originator of such bills, prepared a bill with drastic reduction across the board. McDuffie’s bill went nowhere. Jackson signed the Tariff of 1832 on July 14, 1832, a few days after he vetoed the Bank of the United States re-charter bill. Congress adjourned after it failed to override Jackson’s veto.|$|E

[...] On his return to Alberta, he participated in a rally to encourage farmers to sign on with the pool; the effort enticed several new farmers, including the manager of the Prince of Wales' ranch, to join. [...] On a July 1927 trip to Europe, he investigated the possibility of marketing Alberta wheat directly to European millers, rather than passing it through multiple grain buyers, exporters, shippers, and importers, but found that European millers feared that buying directly from foreign sources would alienate <b>domestic</b> <b>producers.</b>|$|E

60|$|Such are the {{extremely}} various effects which may result to ourselves, {{and to our}} customers, from the imposition of taxes on our exports [3]: and the determining circumstances are of a nature so imperfectly ascertainable, {{that it must be}} almost impossible to decide with any certainty, even after the tax has been imposed, whether we have been gainers by it or losers. It is certain, however, that whatever we gain, is lost by somebody else, and there is the expense of the collection besides: if international morality, therefore, were rightly understood and acted upon, such taxes, as being contrary to the universal weal, would not exist. Moreover, the imposition of such a tax frequently will, and always may, expose a country to lose this branch of its trade altogether, or to carry it on with diminished advantage, in consequence of the competition of untaxed exporters from other countries, or of the <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> in the country to which it exports. Even on the most selfish principles, therefore, the benefit of such a tax is always extremely precarious.|$|E
60|$|When an {{occupation}} {{is carried on}} chiefly by persons who derive the main portion of their subsistence from other sources, its remuneration may be lower almost to any extent than the wages of equally severe labor in other employments. The principal example of the kind is domestic manufactures. When spinning and knitting were carried on in every cottage, by families deriving their principal support from agriculture, the price at which their produce was sold (which constituted the remuneration of their labor) was often so low that {{there would have been}} required great perfection of machinery to undersell it. The amount of the remuneration in such a case depends chiefly upon whether the quantity of the commodity produced by this description of labor suffices to supply the whole of the demand. If it does not, and there is consequently a necessity for some laborers who devote themselves entirely to the employment, the price of the article must be sufficient to pay those laborers at the ordinary rate, and to reward, therefore, very handsomely the <b>domestic</b> <b>producers.</b> But if the demand is so limited that the domestic manufacture can do more than satisfy it, the price is naturally kept down to the lowest rate at which peasant families think it worth while to continue the production. Thus far, as to the remuneration of the subsidiary employment; but the effect to the laborers of having this additional resource is almost certain to be (unless peculiar counteracting causes intervene) a proportional diminution of the wages of their main occupation.|$|E
60|$|The only case in which, on mere {{principles}} of political economy, protecting duties can be defensible, {{is when they}} are imposed temporarily (especially in a young and rising nation) in hopes of naturalizing a foreign industry, in itself perfectly suitable to {{the circumstances of the}} country. The superiority of one country over another in a branch of production often arises only from having begun it sooner. There may be no inherent advantage on one part, or disadvantage on the other, but only a present superiority of acquired skill and experience. A country which has this skill and experience yet to acquire may in other respects be better adapted to the production than those which were earlier in the field; and, besides, it is a just remark of Mr. Rae that nothing has a greater tendency to promote improvements in any branch of production than its trial under a new set of conditions. But it can not be expected that individuals should, at their own risk, or rather to their certain loss, introduce a new manufacture, and bear the burden of carrying it on, until the producers have been educated up to the level of those with whom the processes are traditional. A protecting duty, continued for a reasonable time, will sometimes be the least inconvenient mode in which the nation can tax itself for the support of such an experiment. But the protection should be confined to cases in which there is good ground of assurance that the industry which it fosters will after a time be able to dispense with it; nor should the <b>domestic</b> <b>producers</b> ever be allowed to expect that it will be continued to them beyond the time necessary for a fair trial of what they are capable of accomplishing.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} heterogeneous consumer preferences to analyze the market potential of a second-generation, genetically modified, high-oleic soybean developed at the University of Nebraska. The paper identifies the factors that will determine {{the effectiveness of the}} new technology and the implications for <b>domestic</b> <b>producer</b> welfare if the new technology were licensed exclusively to producers in the United States. Analytical results show that the market and welfare effects of the introduction of high-oleic soybeans are determined by the relative prices of products utilizing the new soybeans as an input in their production process, the distribution of consumer preferences, and the benefits consumers perceive from the new product. The lower the prices of products using the new soybeans and/or the greater the value consumers place on the new product attribute, the greater the market acceptance of the new high-oleic soybeans, the market share of the United States in the world market for soybeans, and the <b>domestic</b> <b>producer</b> welfare gains from the introduction of the new technology. When the value consumers place on the new product attribute is sufficiently high, the introduction of high-oleic soybeans is shown to drive the conventional soybeans out of the market, attract consumers of substitute products, and confer considerable benefits to all <b>domestic</b> soybean <b>producers.</b> This research was funded in part through a research grant from the United Soybean Board...|$|R
