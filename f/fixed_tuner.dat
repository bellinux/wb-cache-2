40|$|The higher-order mode (HOM) coupler with a rod-shape antenna {{has been}} {{designed}} to reduce Q-values of the trapped HOM’s. The antenna is inserted in the cavity from a small opening on the <b>fixed</b> <b>tuner</b> block and strongly couples some of HOM’s. Two model couplers have been fabricated and tested in low-power levels. It was found that they can reduce Q-values of the six trapped HOM’s without influence on the accelerating mode...|$|E
40|$|We {{designed}} a higher order mode (HOM) coupler with a rod-type antenna to reduce HOM’s impedances of trapped modes in a damped cavity. The antenna {{is followed by}} a standard coaxial line. A tapered silicon-carbide (SiC) load is fixed {{at the end of the}} coaxial line. The HOM coupler is attached to an opening for the <b>fixed</b> <b>tuner</b> which is used to detune the resonance frequencies of trapped modes to avoid the coupled-bunch instabilities. The shape of the SiC load and the insulator for the inner conductor of the coaxial line is optimized so that an input SWR is as small as possible by using the computer code HFSS [1]. The input SWR was obtained to be less than 1. 7 over the wide frequency range between 0. 7 to 1. 4 GHz. The low power measurement showed this type of HOM coupler sufficiently damped the HOM’s in the cavity. The fabrication of the high power model based on this design is in progress. ...|$|E

40|$|The Drift Tube Linac (DTL) {{for the new}} linear {{accelerator}} Linac 4 at CERN will accelerate H–beams of up to 40 mA average pulse current from 3 to 50 MeV. The structure consists of three cavities. The first cavity (Tank 1) is a 3. 9 m long tank containing 38 drift tubes, 10 <b>fixed</b> <b>tuners,</b> 2 movable tuners and 12 post-couplers, operating at a frequency of 352. 2 MHz and an average accelerating field of 3. 1 MV/m. This paper reports on the results and procedures used for the low–power tuning, stabilization and power coupler tuning carried out on the first Linac 4 DTL tank. The upgrade of the bead pull measurement system and twists to the well-known tilt sensitivity technique are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The 2. 5 MeV {{injector}} for the Spallation Neutron Source {{is currently}} under construction at LBNL, {{which includes a}} 2. 5 MeV high power, high duty factor four vane RFQ made of four modules. Transverse mode stabilization is obtained {{through a series of}} cross coupling rods. Each of the four RFQ modules is equipped with twenty <b>fixed</b> <b>tuners,</b> two active power and two vacuum ports. Fine frequency tuning is accomplished by adjusting the temperature differential in two separate cooling circuits, one on the RFQ body and the other near the vane tips. The RF drive is provided via 3 - 1 / 8 inch rigid coaxial lines and a coaxial RF vacuum barrier window. The first module has been built, confirming all fabrication, assembly and brazing techniques. This paper will cover the mechanical fabrication details as well as the early results from commissioning tests underway at LBNL...|$|R
50|$|The band's {{first stop}} on the tour, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, goes horribly when Kent shows up at their hotel drunk. In Porto Alegre, Melvin's guitar broke half way through the band's set. Instead of fixing his guitar, however, he spends 10 minutes <b>fixing</b> his <b>tuner,</b> and the crowd turns on the band. The next stop, Medellín, Colombia, goes even worse. The venue the band was set to perform at {{had no idea of}} the show, so the show was canceled. In response, their Colombian promoter, Santiago, began {{receiving}} death threats, forcing the band to leave the country as soon as possible.|$|R
5000|$|Models {{produced}} {{prior to}} 2002 used 4-bolt neck fixing, 5-in-line headstocks, {{black or white}} dot markers, Schaller die-cast tuners, 9V power supply and a new design of stacked [...] "single-pole" [...] Jazz Bass pickups (designed by John Suhr). Vintage Noiseless pickups, a dark aluminum Fender [...] "spaghetti" [...] logo and abalone inlaid fingerboards were added in 1998; 5-bolt neck <b>fixing,</b> 4+1 <b>tuners,</b> 18V power supply and Schaller Lite Bass tuning machines followed 4 years later (replaced by Hipshot UltraLite tuners as of 2006). As of March 23, 2010, all American Deluxe basses came with an active/passive switch, a Fender High-Mass Vintage (HMV) bridge, Hipshot lightweight vintage tuners, a recessed string retainer bar on the A string, tinted necks with 21-fret compound radiused fretboards and 1970s-era styling.|$|R
40|$|A high-yield {{neutron source}} to screen sea-land cargo {{containers}} for shielded Special Nuclear Materials (SNM) {{has been designed}} at LBNL [1, 2]. The Accelerator-Driven Neutron Source (ADNS) uses the D(d,n) 3 He reaction to create a forward directed neutron beam. Key components are a high-current radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator and a high-power target capable of producing a neutron flux of > 107 n/(cm 2 cdot s) {{at a distance of}} 2. 5 m. The mechanical design and analysis of the four-module, bolt-together RFQ will be presented here. Operating at 200 MHz, the 5. 1 m long RFQ will accelerate a 40 mA deuteron beam to 6 MeV. At a 5 percent duty factor, the time-average d+ beam current on target is 1. 5 mA. Each of the 1. 27 m long RFQ modules will consist of four solid OFHC copper vanes. A specially designed 3 -D O-ring will provide vacuum sealing between both the vanes and the modules. RF connections are made with canted coil spring contacts. A series of 60 water-cooled pi-mode rods provides quadrupole mode stabilization. A set of 80 evenly spaced <b>fixed</b> slug <b>tuners</b> is used for final frequency adjustment and local field perturbation correction...|$|R
