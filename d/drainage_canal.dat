Two passengers sustained minor injuries, and the aircraft, G-ALYZ, was a total loss. On 3 March 1953, a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A, registered CF-CUN and named Empress of Hawaii, failed to become airborne while attempting a night takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan, on a delivery flight to Australia. The aircraft plunged into a dry <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> and collided with an embankment, killing all five crew and six passengers on board. The accident was the first fatal jetliner crash, as well as the Comet's first accident to result in fatalities. In response, Canadian Pacific cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A and never operated the type in commercial service.|$|E

25|$|The 17th Street Canal is {{the largest}} and most {{important}} <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> in the city of New Orleans. Operating with Pump Station 6, It moves water into Lake Pontchartrain. The canal, along with the Orleans Canal and the London Avenue Canal, form the New Orleans Outfall Canals. The 17th Street Canal forms {{a significant portion of the}} boundary between the city of New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana. The canal has also been known as the Metairie Outlet Canal and the Upperline Canal.|$|E
25|$|In August 1604 {{there was}} another major {{inundation}} of Mexico City. Damage was extensive. The viceroy initially suggested moving the capital to the nearby hills of Tacubaya, but this was deemed too expensive. Then he decided to finish the <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> of Huehuetoca, {{but this was a}} project requiring many years and the labor of 15,000 Indians to complete. In the meantime he repaired the dikes constructed under Viceroy Luis de Velasco, at the same time paving the streets of San Antonio Abad, Chapultepec, San Cristóbal and Guadalupe. Nevertheless, parts of the city remained submerged for a year.|$|E
25|$|During early colonial times, the Plaza was bordered to {{the north}} by the new church, and to the east by Cortés's new palace, built over and with the ruins of Moctezuma's palace. On {{the west side of}} the plaza, the Portales de Mercaderes (Merchants’ Portals) were built, south of Cortés’ other palace, the Palace of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca. On the south side, was the Portal of the Flowers (Flores), named so after its owner, Maria Gutierrez Flores de Caballerias. Next to this portal was the House of the Ayuntamiento, a {{government}} building for the city. Both of these were behind a small <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> that ran east-west.|$|E

50|$|These early primary <b>drainage</b> <b>canals</b> {{included}} (from west to east): 17th Street, Orleans Avenue and London Avenue. As {{the population}} expanded northward toward the lake, low-lying swamps were reclaimed by constructing shallow drainage ditches that {{fed into the}} newly created system of <b>drainage</b> <b>canals.</b> However, {{the reduction in the}} groundwater table, {{as a result of the}} drainage and reclamation of swamps and marshland, produced significant land subsidence in the drained area. That land subsidence continues today.|$|R
25|$|In Livy's {{history of}} Rome, the first Etruscan king of Rome built raised, wooden {{perimeter}} seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the equites and patricians), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning {{against the sun}} and rain. His grandson, Tarquinius Superbus, added the first seating for citizen-commoners (plebs, or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track. Otherwise, the Circus was probably still {{little more than a}} trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (metae), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.|$|E
25|$|Levittown {{is divided}} into eight {{sections}} called secciones (the eighth section was renamed Urb. Fronteras) and several sub-divisions called urbanizaciones.

Levittown is known for its large, light blue painted water tower (now converted into a public library) {{that was one of the}} first water towers in Puerto Rico used to provide potable water to residences. To the west sits Levittown Lakes or Los Lagos de Levittown, a small man-made lake formed by draining the marshland over which Levittown was built. The <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> that feeds the lake is called Caño El Hato, which extends into the center of Levittown.

25|$|The North Branch {{continues}} southwards through Niles, {{entering the}} city of Chicago near the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue and Devon Avenue, from where it serves as the boundary of the Forest Glen community area with Norwood Park and Jefferson Park. This stretch of the river meanders in a south-easterly direction, passing through golf courses and forest preserves until it reaches Foster Avenue, where it passes through residential neighborhoods {{on the north side}} of the Albany Park community area. In River Park the river meets the North Shore Channel, a <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> built between 1907 and 1910 to increase the flow of the North Branch and help flush pollution into the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. From the confluence with the North Shore Channel south to Belmont Avenue the North Branch flows through mostly residential neighborhoods in a man-made channel that was dug to straighten and deepen the river, helping it to carry the additional flow from the North Shore Channel.|$|E
50|$|With {{drainage}} and rainfall-related {{flood protection}} a huge concern, man-made canals were {{constructed by the}} mid-19th century. Drainage machines and pumps were built to lift the drained water over the high ridges and into the outfall canals. By 1878, there were approximately 36 mi of <b>drainage</b> <b>canals</b> feeding into Lake Pontchartrain to remove rainwater from populated areas. Today there are 90 mi of covered <b>drainage</b> <b>canals,</b> 82 mi of open channel canals and several thousand miles of storm sewer lines that feed into the system.|$|R

25|$|Planning for the West Valley Highway {{began in}} the 1960s as a local federal-aid project. The {{proposed}} alignment began at the curve in SR-68 near 15300 South and proceeded north-northwesterly and northerly, following a path much like the present alignment to I-80. It continued north along {{what was then the}} west boundary of the then Salt Lake City Municipal Airport No. 1 (now Salt Lake City International Airport) into 4000 West, curving east onto 2200 North and ending at I-215. A <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> was moved to make room for a loop from 2200 North onto northbound I-215, but when the Interstate was finished south of 2200 North (where it had ended for many years) in the mid-1980s, a diamond interchange was built instead. Later the north segment was rerouted to continue north-northeasterly from the airport into Davis County; parts of this are now the Legacy Parkway. Salt Lake County was able to build the highway between SR-201 (2100 South) and I-80 with federal funding, but it took the state to finish it.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a <b>drainage</b> <b>canal.</b> All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E
25|$|The British prevailed at the Battle of Krabbendam near Alkmaar on 10 September, {{where the}} Batavians and French were routed. This defeat was {{partly due to}} sloppy staffwork that {{allocated}} one narrow road to the columns of both Batavian divisions {{that were supposed to}} converge on the hamlet of Krabbendam. This hamlet sat astride one of the few entry roads to the Zijpe polder in which Abercromby had set up an armed camp. The polder formed a natural redoubt with its dike acting as a rampart and its circular <b>drainage</b> <b>canal</b> as a moat. The straight and narrow road through Krabbendam formed one of the few easy entries, but it was easily defensible also. The original plan had this entry point attacked by both Batavian divisions, but because Daendels' division was forced to take a more easterly route, only the division of Dumonceau was brought to bear. This division could not be fully deployed {{due to the nature of}} the terrain and the Batavian forces were therefore again fed piecemeal into the battle. They were unable to prevail over the valiant defence of the British 20th Foot. Elsewhere, the French division of General Vandamme was likewise unable to overcome the obstacles of the canal and the dike behind it, that protected the British troops. Vandamme therefore failed to turn Abercromby's right flank as planned.|$|E
40|$|Drainage problems, {{especially}} in the cities of Indonesia has become important with the frequent occurrence of flooding or water logging in the rainy season at urban areas that disrupt people life and obstruct transportations fluency and cause property losses in large enough quantities. The main cause of flooding or water logging is a change from the natural landscape into the development environment, hence, increasing impermeable surfaces, such as roads, parking areas, sidewalks, and residential areas. This change reduces, disrupts, or eliminates the natural vegetation, land surface, basin, and natural drainage pattern that prevents, vaporizes, stores, issues slowly and absorbs the rainwater. The impact {{of changes in the}} landscape of OASIS Area of PT. Djarum Kudus is the increasing direct runoff (run off) while reducing water seep into the ground so that it can make the puddle of water. In its planning, the hydrologic analysis using the 15 years of rainfall data in Sta. Kedung Gupit is performed. In hydrologic analysis of this planning is applied the probability distributions of Log Pearson type 3 and is used EPA SWMM program with 10 -years return period of flooding, thus, it is obtained the maximum flood discharge before construction in the amount of 9. 05 m 3 /second and the maximum flood discharge after development in the amount of 16. 69 m 3 /second. Based on the results of that analysis, the planning of <b>drainage</b> <b>canals</b> is carried out. In the planning, the used <b>drainage</b> <b>canals</b> are new <b>drainage</b> <b>canals</b> which are constructed at the OASIS area of PT. Djarum Kudus. The dimensions of the <b>drainage</b> <b>canals</b> that are used vary from the largest with the dimension of 2. 5 m x 3 m and the smallest with the dimension of 0. 6 m x 0. 6 m.

25|$|The third column, with Generals Pulteney, Don and Coote, {{likewise}} {{found the}} terrain difficult. This column {{was forced to}} use the road on a dike, called the Langedijk (long dike) that divides several polders. This dike was flanked on the right hand by a deep <b>drainage</b> <b>canal,</b> {{and on the other}} side the many ditches in the land also hindered easy deployment. The road led to the village of Oudkarspel where the 1st Batavian division of General Daendels had built some fieldworks (the Dutch complained that Brune had prohibited the full development of fortifications, which made the defence more difficult). The first attack on this strongpoint by Pulteney ended in disaster with the British fleeing in panic until they could be rallied behind another dike that gave some cover against the Dutch artillery fire. Several other British frontal attacks were also repulsed with great loss, and an encircling movement proved impracticable due to the canal. General Daendels made the mistake of ordering an under-strength sally from his redoubt by 100 grenadiers. Not only was this easily repulsed, but the rout of the grenadiers enabled the pursuing British, following hot on their heels, to penetrate the Dutch entrenchments and rout the entire group of defenders. This rout could only be stopped at the end of the Langedijk. The retreating troops suffered very heavy losses due to British artillery fire. Daendels finally personally led a counter-attack with only one battalion of grenadiers, but by then the debacle on the British right wing had been communicated to Pulteney, who therefore was already withdrawing to his starting position. The British therefore made no net territorial gains, but they had dealt the Batavians heavy losses in casualties and prisoners.|$|E
