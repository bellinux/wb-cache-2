50|$|The Matilija Sandstone {{produces}} little soil when it weathers, {{and generally}} supports only <b>hard</b> <b>chaparral</b> on slopes {{that are not}} bare rock. North-facing slopes have some stands of pine and fir in the higher elevations.|$|E
25|$|Mission Peak {{is home to}} California oak {{woodland}} and chaparral. Typical of {{the interior}} coast ranges, the woodland contains coast live oak, California bay, California buckeye, blue oak, and western sycamores. Black oak is rare, because most stands have been logged. Bigleaf maples and gray pines are less common, though the old-growth oak forest in the Hidden Valley (see Hiking) known as A.A. Moore Memorial Grove contains all the tree species. Many oaks are 100 to 600 years old, with few younger than 50. Oak saplings have been eaten by cattle and choked by invasives for centuries. The steepest slopes are home to <b>hard,</b> evergreen <b>chaparral,</b> primarily California sagebrush, chamise, and scrub oak.|$|R
