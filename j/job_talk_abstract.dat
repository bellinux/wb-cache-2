40|$|In {{the heavily}} {{competitive}} law school teaching job market, the so-called “job talk” has assumed increasing {{importance in the}} ultimate hiring decision. Nevertheless, there is little published information to assist a law school faculty in structuring or evaluating the <b>job</b> <b>talk</b> and a similar paucity of information for candidates to guide them in creating and preparing for the presentation of their talk. This article is intended to fill that void. The article guides the preparation of faculty and candidates for both the <b>job</b> <b>talk</b> itself and for the crucial Q 2 ̆ 6 A period that follows the talk. The article represents the authors’ collective 87 years of experience seeing both successful and unsuccessful <b>job</b> <b>talks,</b> {{as well as the}} experience of 15 colleagues around the country who reviewed our initial draft and commented on it from the perspective of their various law schools...|$|R
40|$|A {{law school}} <b>job</b> <b>talk</b> for an {{entry-level}} candidate {{is an opportunity}} for the presenter to put his or her ideas before a faculty in the best possible light. A bit of give-and-take is part of the drill, but the candidate can usually expect the talk to stay more or less on course. My own first <b>job</b> <b>talk,</b> though, given at George Mason University more years ago than I 2 ̆ 7 d like to admit, was attended by the thoroughly exceptional Larry Ribstein and so did not unfold in the usual way...|$|R

These sessions have two parts: 20 minutes are devoted to a simulated <b>job</b> <b>talk,</b> including questions from the audience, and 45 minutes are allocated for discussion and questions. We encourage all workshop participants to attend one of these breakout sessions to support and aid those who are currently on the job market...|$|R

40|$|We use a {{case study}} of <b>job</b> <b>talks</b> in five {{engineering}} departments to analyze the under-studied area of gendered barriers to finalists for faculty positions. We focus on one segment of the interview day of short-listed candidates invited to campus: the “job talk”, when candidates present their original research to the academic department. We analyze video recordings of 119 <b>job</b> <b>talks</b> across five engineering departments at two Research 1 universities. Specifically, we analyze whether there are differences by gender or by years of post-Ph. D. experience in the number of interruptions, follow-up questions, and total questions that job candidates receive. We find that, compared to men, women receive more follow-up questions and more total questions. Moreover, a higher proportion of women’s talk time is taken up by the audience asking questions. Further, the number of questions is correlated with the job candidate’s statements and actions that reveal he or she is rushing to present their slides and complete the talk. We argue that women candidates face more interruptions and often have less time to bring their talk to a compelling conclusion, which is connected to the phenomenon of “stricter standards” of competence demanded by evaluators of short-listed women applying for a masculine-typed job. We conclude with policy recommendations...|$|R

50|$|The game is {{presented}} as a series of terms at a school. Each term is made up of several weeks, typically starting and ending with an event, ultimately leading to a key battle to be won. In between, the player is generally required to complete two or three courses, earning a grade depending on how well the course was completed. This is then followed by two or three days of free time. If the player should fail to make a decent cumulative grade by the end of courses, they will need to spend one day of free time in detention, doing required tasks. Once in free time, the player is free to take odd <b>jobs,</b> <b>talk</b> with characters, and perform side quests related to {{the other members of the}} party.|$|R
500|$|Nancy's bottom-half finish {{proved a}} false {{down as the}} club {{finished}} 18th in the 1985–86 season, which meant they had to win a play-off match to avoid relegation. They retained their league status with a 3–2 aggregate win against Mulhouse. [...] The club however sold several of their best players to avoid financial predicament and provided Wenger with little funds to work with. In Wenger's final season in charge, Nancy finished 19th and were relegated to Ligue 2. Despite the setbacks, he was contacted by AS Monaco over their vacant managerial <b>job.</b> <b>Talks</b> had begun {{during the summer of}} 1986, but Nancy chairman Gérard Rousselot refused to release Wenger from his contract, and Monaco were not prepared to offer compensation. Once Nancy's relegation was confirmed, Wenger was permitted to leave the club by mutual consent and was confirmed as Monaco manager in 1987.|$|R

VxLab {{has been used for}} industry projects in industrial automation, experimental research in cloud deployment, workshops and remote capability demonstrations, teaching advanced-level courses in games development, and student software engineering projects. Our goal is for resources to become a "catalyst" for IT-driven research results both within the university and with external industry partners. Use cases include: multi-disciplinary collaboration, prototyping and troubleshooting requiring multiple viewpoints and architectures, dashboards and decision support for global remote planning and operations.
