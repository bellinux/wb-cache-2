2500|$|Ethylene is {{produced}} in the petrochemical industry by steam cracking. In this process, gaseous or light liquid hydrocarbons are heated to 750–950°C, inducing numerous free radical reactions followed by immediate quench to stop these reactions. This process converts large hydrocarbons into smaller ones and introduces unsaturation. Ethylene is separated from the resulting mixture by repeated compression and distillation. In a related process used in oil refineries, high molecular weight hydrocarbons are cracked over zeolite catalysts. Heavier feedstocks, such as naphtha and <b>gas</b> <b>oils</b> require at least two [...] "quench towers" [...] downstream of the cracking furnaces to recirculate pyrolysis-derived gasoline and process water. When cracking a mixture of ethane and propane, only one water quench tower is required.|$|E
