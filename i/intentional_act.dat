5|$|The general {{principle}} {{is that a}} trespass to the person must be a direct and <b>intentional</b> <b>act,</b> while if it was indirect or unintentional the tort of negligence is more appropriate, as established in Letang v Cooper.

5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an <b>intentional</b> <b>act</b> of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an <b>intentional</b> <b>act.</b> One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about random acts of {{kindness}} – acts performed spontaneously and often to strangers. The topic of kindness and the benefits arising from performing kind acts holds both empirical and applied interest in the fields of education and psychology. Encouraging students to reflect upon and perform <b>intentional</b> <b>acts</b> of kindness develops perspective-taking, increased social membership, and a structured way of encouraging kindness within the school context.

500|$|Trespass to {{the person}} comes in three variants: assault, which is [...] "to act {{in such a way}} that the {{claimant}} believes he is about to be attacked"; battery, [...] "the intentional and direct application of force to another person"; and false imprisonment, [...] "depriving the claimant of freedom of movement, without a lawful justification for doing so". All three require that the act be a direct and <b>intentional</b> <b>act,</b> with indirect or unintentional acts falling under the tort of negligence. Battery and assault require the claimant to establish that the defendant intended to act, while false imprisonment is a tort of strict liability. The guiding principle behind all three is based on the statement of Goff, LJ, who stated in Collins v Wilcock that [...] "any person's body is inviolate", excepting normal, day-to-day physical contact.|$|E
500|$|Intent is a {{function}} of kaṣāya, which refers to negative emotions and negative qualities of mental (or deliberative) action. The presence of intent acts as an aggravating factor, increasing the vibrations of the soul, which results in the soul absorbing more karma. This is explained by Tattvārthasūtra 6.7: [...] " [...] <b>intentional</b> <b>act</b> produces a strong karmic bondage and [...] unintentional produces weak, shortlived karmic bondage." [...] Similarly, the physical act is also not a necessary condition for karma to bind to the soul: the existence of intent alone is sufficient. This is explained by Kundakunda (1st Century CE) in Samayasāra 262–263: [...] "The intent to kill, to steal, to be unchaste and to acquire property, whether these offences are actually carried or not, leads to bondage of evil karmas." [...] Jainism thus places an equal emphasis on the physical act as well as intent for binding of karmas.|$|E

500|$|Crowley taught skeptical {{examination}} of all results obtained through meditation or magick, {{at least for}} the student. He tied this to the necessity of keeping a magical record or diary, that attempts to list all conditions of the event. [...] Remarking on the similarity of statements made by spiritually advanced people of their experiences, he said that fifty years from his time they would have a scientific name based on [...] "an understanding of the phenomenon" [...] to replace such terms as [...] "spiritual" [...] or [...] "supernatural". Crowley stated that his work and that of his followers used [...] "the method of science; the aim of religion", and that the genuine powers of the magician could in some way be objectively tested. This idea has been taken on by later practitioners of Thelema, chaos magic and magick in general. [...] They may consider that they are testing hypotheses with each magical experiment. The difficulty lies in the broadness of their definition of success, in which they may see as evidence of success things which a non-magician would not define as such, leading to confirmation bias. Crowley believed he could demonstrate, by his own example, the effectiveness of magick in producing certain subjective experiences that do not ordinarily result from taking hashish, enjoying oneself in Paris, or walking through the Sahara desert. It is not strictly necessary to practice ritual techniques to be a Thelemite, as due to the focus of Thelemic magick on the True Will, Crowley stated [...] "every <b>intentional</b> <b>act</b> is a magickal act".|$|E
500|$|After {{the fact}} pattern, Cardozo began his {{discussion}} of the law with [...] "the conduct of the defendant's guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relative to her it was not negligence at all." [...] Cardozo quoted Pollock on Torts and cited several cases for the proposition that [...] "proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do." [...] Only if there is a duty to the injured plaintiff, the breach of which causes injury, can there be liability. He defended his decision, [...] "a different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions." [...] Cardozo posed hypothetical situations: if a railway guard stumbles over a bundle of newspapers, and there are explosives within, will there be liability to an injured passenger {{at the other end of}} the platform? Will the result be different if the object containing the explosives is a valise instead? If there was negligence that day, Cardozo argued, it was only negligence that resulted in the fall and destruction of the package, and there was no wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf for personal injury, [...] "the diversity of incidents emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff's right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else." [...] The chief judge instructed, [...] "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed". Cardozo did not absolve the defendant who knowingly unleashes a destructive force, such as by shooting a gun, just because the bullet takes an unexpected path. This is not such a case, Cardozo held: even if the railway guard had thrown down the package intentionally, without knowing the contents he could not knowingly risk harm to Palsgraf, and would not be liable. Negligence cannot impose liability where an <b>intentional</b> <b>act</b> would not.|$|E
500|$|The NATO attack {{received}} considerable {{criticism and}} caused widespread outrage among the country's {{civil society and}} media, with some perceiving it as an <b>intentional</b> <b>act</b> of war {{that may have been}} pre-planned. Numerous protests were organised in several cities for a number of consecutive days after the attack occurred. Members of the public demanded an end to the US alliance and pressurised the government to consider pulling out from the War on Terror, permanently halt all NATO supplies, expel American citizens in Pakistan and plan a tit-for-tat military retaliation. Some locals in the tribal agencies demanded those who carried out the attack to be handed over to Pakistan. Hundreds of people organised a gathering outside the American consulate in Karachi to lodge a protest. Various lawyers' associations throughout the country boycotted their usual court proceedings and observed a strike to mark the day. Many university students also boycotted their classes to protest. Students in Peshawar blocked a main road where they chanted [...] "Quit the war on terror" [...] and other anti-American slogans. Schoolteachers and students in Azad Kashmir expressed their outrage during a protest in the capital Muzaffarabad. Protests were also organised in the northern towns of Skardu in Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral. Some faculty members of the University of the Punjab, the country's oldest university, passed a [...] "resolution" [...] in which they backed the Pakistan Army, stating that [...] "Pakistan does not want war, but war is being imposed on it" [...] and said the War on Terror was a [...] "drama" [...] staged by the [...] "US elite" [...] and a certain group of rich international bankers referred to as the [...] "high cabal" [...] by Winston Churchill who wanted to establish a [...] "world government". The Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce & Industry condemned the attack as well. Local television cable operators pulled out western channels such as BBC World News to deter what they called [...] "anti-Pakistan bias" [...] in the media. Leaders of Pakistani Christian communities also condemned the attack and pledged their support for the armed forces along with calling for a UN inquiry; speaking on the occasion, the president of the Pakistan Catholic Bishops' Conference said: [...] "Our soldiers lost their lives in the line of duty. They died fighting terrorism". [...] Religious leaders and scholars of the Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Christian and Baha'i communities also condemned the incident during an inter-faith meeting.|$|E

2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} does not rest on knowledge or {{intent of the}} defendant.

Fraudulent intent is not an element of conversion.

2500|$|The first {{smallpox}} epidemic to hit {{the region}} was in the 1680s, with the disease travelling overland from Mexico by intertribal transmission. Among losses due to diseases, {{and a series of}} earlier epidemics that had wiped out many peoples entirely, e.g. the Snokomish in 1850, a smallpox epidemic broke out among the Northwest tribes in 1862, killing roughly half the affected native populations, in some cases up to 90% or more. The smallpox [...] epidemic of 1862 started when an infected miner from San Francisco stopped in Victoria {{on his way to the}} Cariboo Gold Rush. [...] As the epidemic spread, police, supported by gunboats, forced thousands of First Nations people living in encampments around Victoria to leave and many returned to their home villages which spread the epidemic.

2500|$|Strict {{liability}} can {{be described}} as criminal or civil liability notwithstanding the lack mens rea or intent by the defendant.

For example, it might be sufficient to show that a defendant acted negligently, rather than intentionally or recklessly. In offenses of absolute liability, other than the prohibited act, it may not be necessary to show the act was intentional. Generally, crimes must include an <b>intentional</b> <b>act,</b> and [...] "intent" [...] is an element that must be proved in order to find a crime occurred.
