5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> some members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids have been <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> the genus, {{about a third of}} all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria is {{a country}} in southeastern Europe {{situated}} entirely in the Balkan peninsula. Bulgaria is inhabited by 20 amphibian species, which makes the amphibians the least diverse class of vertebrates in the country. They include seven species of newts and salamanders from a single family, Salamandridae, as well as 13 frog and toad species from five familiesâ€”Bombinatoridae, Bufonidae, Hylidae, Pelobatidae and Ranidae. The most recently classified species are the northern crested newt, <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> 2005, and the Macedonian crested newt, <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> 2007.|$|E

5|$|EEHV1A (originally just {{known as}} EEHV1) {{was the first}} species/type identified, which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high {{mortality}} rate in Asian elephants. This form of the virus was originally believed to occur naturally in African elephants (occasionally producing skin nodules), and to be transmitted to Asian elephants within captivity, but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species/types of EEHV (e.g. EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6) instead have been <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> African elephants. A second lethal subtype, EEHV1B, was <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> Asian elephants in 2001. EEHV3, EEHV4 and EEHV5 have also each {{been responsible for the}} deaths of at least one Asian elephant calf.|$|E

5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
