It is the most intact part of Kotagede. Chronicles mention that Senapati's father, Ki Gedhe Mataram, was buried {{to the west of}} the mosque and Senapati himself was buried to the south of the mosque, in the direction of his father's feet. Other important people buried in the cemetery include Sultan Hadiwijaya. The cemetery is guarded and maintained by Juru Kunci who are employed by the two palaces of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. The portal to the cemetery <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> of Hindu architecture, each portal contains a thick wooden handle heavily decorated with carvings. The walled cemetery does not act as a physical protection of the graves and their adornments, the enclosures separate the realm of the dead from those of the living.|$|E

L. at I, Dorotheergasse 6, Vienna; an address that I recommend your taking a note of; and I {{have also made}} the reflection that the fury, or whatever, that Edinburgh inspires you with ought, you know, to do the very opposite of drying up the founts of your genius in writing to me--since you say your letter would have been other (as it truly might have been longer) didn't you suffer so from all that surrounds you. That's the very most juvenile logic possible--and the juvenility of it (which yet in a manner touches me) is why I call you retrogressive--by way of a long stroke of endearment. There was exactly an admirable matter for you to write me about--a matter as to which you are strongly and abundantly feeling; and in a relation which lives on communication as ours surely should, and would (save for starving,) such occasions fertilise. However, of course the terms are easy on which you extract communication from me, and always have been, and always will be--so that there's doubtless {{a point of view}} from which your reservations (another fine word) are quite right. I'm glad at any rate that you've been reading Balzac (whose [...] "romantic" [...] side is rot!) and a great contemporary of your own even in his unconsidered trifles. I've just been reading Compton Mackenzie's Sinister Street and finding in it an unexpected amount of talent and life. Really a very interesting and remarkable performance, I think, in spite of a considerable, or large, element of waste and irresponsibility--selection isn't in him--and at one and the same time so extremely young (he too) and so confoundingly mature. It <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> of improving so as it goes on, and disposes me much to read, if I can, its immediate predecessor. You must tell me again what you know of him (I've forgotten what you did tell me, more or less,) but in your own good time. I think--I mean I blindly feel--I should be with you about Auld Reekie--which somehow hasn't a right to be so handsome. But I long for illustrations--at your own good time. We have emerged from a very clear and quiet Xmas--quiet for me, save for rather a large assault of correspondence. It weighs on me still, so this is what I call--and you will too--very brief.... I wish you the very decentest New Year that ever was. Yours, dearest boy, all affectionately, ...|$|E
