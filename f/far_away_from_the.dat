Though the storm was forecast to remain <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico, investors tracking the storm caused {{the price of crude}} oil to rise 60cents a barrel due to the potential impact to oil installations.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{original}} ages was also a problem, as the rate of Kula-Farallon spreading over that time would produce a chain of seamounts much longer than observed, and too <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> continent to explain the continentally derived sediments. This objection is attenuated somewhat in that the newer ages show a smaller range of ages.|$|E

5|$|Within the Philippines, PAGASA issued {{no public}} storm warning signals, {{as the storm}} was too <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> country to prompt the {{issuance}} of such advisories. However, they did warn that the cyclone was expected to enhance the southwest monsoon and bring rain over Central and Southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Ma-on posed {{a slight}} {{threat to the}} Mariana Islands and {{prompted}} the issuance of tropical storm warnings. However, the system remained <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area and only produced scattered rainfall. In Japan, hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide-prone areas. Torrential rains produced by the storm, estimated at more than 1,200mm (48in), led to widespread and damaging floods. Five people perished {{as a result of}} Ma-on, and damage reached ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E

5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area formed along a dissipating cold front {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico. The system moved westward, developing some tropical characteristics by October13. The next day, the system became a tropical storm over the Straits of Florida. On October15, it crossed over South Florida near Homestead with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm was never fully tropical, as its winds and precipitation extended <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> center. The storm intensified further over the Florida peninsula, peaking at 65mph (100km/h) early on October16. After affecting Florida, the storm crossed the western Atlantic and moved across the Outer Banks. The storm became extratropical on October17, and the next day it was absorbed by another extratropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered too <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed {{to be made by}} ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|He was disheartened {{with what}} he saw in Pernambuco, a {{province}} <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> imperial capital, {{but one of the}} most important in the country. Local political bosses were aligned with the Party of Order or the Liberal Party, but these were mostly nominal affiliations. Local oligarchs had vied among themselves for centuries over power. To them, political principles, such as those preached by the national leaders of the Party of Order, meant little or nothing. Their political ambitions focused on patronage and the annihilation of their local rivals. Honório Hermeto found himself embroiled in an ongoing power struggle between the aristocratic planters, who sought to exercise control over provincial affairs.|$|E

Eventually the city was taken over by the Roman Empire and it was renamed Melite. The city was again renamed Medina by the Arabs which led to its present name Mdina. Its fortifications were modified a number of times over time, and although most were dismantled and rebuilt between the 16th and 18th centuries, some foundations of the ancient Punic-Roman ramparts, as well as various medieval remains, were recently discovered during excavations.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner's corpse {{to bring it back}} to life.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} ultimately stayed <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast, and {{the heavy}} rainfall and thunderstorms remained at least 50miles (85km) offshore. While nearly stationary, Hurricane Ella produced waves of 5 to 9feet (2 to 3metres) in height, as well as rip currents along the coast. The highest wind gust from the storm over land was 31mph (50km/h) at Diamond Shoal Light. The waves reached the dunes along most beaches, causing some minor beach erosion; the depleted sand returned within a few days. Further north, {{along the coast of}} Virginia, no large waves were reported, which was considered unusual for how close the hurricane was to the state.|$|E
5|$|While a {{tropical}} system, Helene never approached land. Three ships {{were caught in}} the outer bands of Helene; the strongest of which reported 56mph (91km/h) sustained winds early on September 23 in the north Atlantic. Though it remained <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> island, the hurricane produced rough waves in Bermuda. As a weakened extratropical system, strong wind gusts were reported in Ireland and northern Scotland. The strongest reported wind gust in Ireland was at the Valentia Observatory, where 56mph (91km/h) gusts were reported. In Scotland, the strongest gust was on South Uist Island in the Outer Hebrides, where 74mph (118km/h) gusts were reported. No damage or fatalities were reported as a result of Helene.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, in 1808, he {{was offered}} the {{position}} of First Squire of the Emperor in Napoleon's Military Household, a dignity that offered an annual revenue of 30,000 Francs and which gained importance when the Grand Squire, General Armand Augustin Louis de Caulaincourt, was sent to Saint-Petersburg as ambassador. Napoleon allegedly chose Nansouty for his elegant manners and education, aristocratic posture and talent for administration. In his capacity as First Squire, Nansouty thus had to accompany the Emperor during the latter's short campaign in Spain (from November 1808 to early January 1809). There, {{he was in charge}} of several administrative tasks linked with managing the Emperor's stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers. The Emperor's aides-de-camp had their own aides-de-camp, who were also placed under the command of the First Squire. Although never very <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Emperor in a campaign that included many battles, Nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign, and in January 1809, he accompanied his master back to France, as the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition was imminent.|$|E
