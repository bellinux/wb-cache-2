40|$|The {{degree of}} women’s underrepresentation varies by STEM fields. Women are now overrepresented in social sciences, yet only {{constitute}} {{a fraction of}} the engineering workforce. In the current study, we investigated the gender differences <b>in</b> <b>interests,</b> and used it to explain the differential distribution of women across sub-disciplines of STEM as well as the overall underrepresentation of women in STEM fields. Specifically, we meta-analytically reviewed norm data on basic interests from 52 samples <b>in</b> 33 <b>interest</b> inventories published between 1964 and 2007, with a total of 209, 810 male and 223, 268 female respondents. We found gender differences <b>in</b> <b>interests</b> to vary largely by STEM field, with the largest gender differences <b>in</b> <b>interests</b> favoring men observed in engineering disciplines (d =. 83 to 1. 21), and in contrast, gender differences <b>in</b> <b>interests</b> favoring women <b>in</b> social sciences and medical services (d = -. 33 and -. 40, respectively). Importantly, the gender composition (percentages of women) in STEM fields reflects these gender differences <b>in</b> <b>interests.</b> The patterns of gender differences <b>in</b> <b>interests</b> and the actual gender composition in STEM fields were explained by the people-orientation and things-orientation of work environments, and were not associated with the level of quantitative ability required. These findings suggest potential interventions targeting <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> STEM education to facilitate individuals’ ability and career development and strategies to reform work environments to better attract and retain women in STEM occupations...|$|R

5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, in the shadow of St Andrew's, the home stadium of Birmingham City. Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s. In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the Post Office. He played {{football}} for the works team, and quickly received an invitation to play for Moor Green, one of the strongest amateur teams in the area. His performances for Moor Green resulted <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> from Birmingham City, and Barnes became part of their junior team, Birmingham City Colts. Barnes worked at the Post Office during the day, trained with Moor Green in the evening, and played for Birmingham City Colts at the weekend. However, the Colts stopped selecting Barnes after a clash of matches, in which Barnes chose to play for a local team instead of the Colts. Barnes then resumed playing for Moor Green.|$|E

5|$|By 1988, {{building}} costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million. The municipalities had co-signed {{for a foreign}} loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just <b>in</b> <b>interest,</b> {{in addition to the}} operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated. In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic. On 1January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put {{under the control of the}} Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor). Following the closure of Geilo Airport, Dagali in 2003, Fagernes experienced an increase in charter traffic.|$|E
5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E

5|$|In December 2009, Vildanden {{announced}} {{it plans to}} operate routes to Trondheim Airport, Værnes, but lacks financial maneuverability to commence operations. By October 2009, Vildanden owed Kontorbygg, the operator of Geiteryggen, NOK1.5 million in airport fees. Kontorbygg stated that if Vildanden did not pay, the airport would have to file for bankruptcy. Innovation Norway rejected to give Vildanden a loan for NOK3.5 million in December 2009. Kontorbygg stated that the operation of Geiteryggen had cost the municipality NOK50 million {{in the course of}} the five years Vildanden had been operating from it. In February 2010, the Municipality of Skien announced that it required Vildanden to pay back the NOK3.1 million, plus NOK200,000 <b>in</b> <b>interest,</b> that they borrowed in 2007. The loan was renewed in March, after Vildanden paid NOK385,000. From 16 August, Helitrans took over as the operator, using an ATR 42. From 6 September, the company started with flights to Trondheim. The company ceased operations after its last flight on 14 January 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed to a decline <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds {{can be bought}} for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies C. b. banksii and C. b. samueli. Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, with an increase <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining {{the integrity of the}} separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid crossbreeding.|$|E

5|$|Performances for St Helens gained Trautmann a {{reputation}} as an able goalkeeper, resulting <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> from Football League clubs. As the following season commenced, a number of League clubs showed interest in signing him.

40|$|While high {{motivation}} {{to expand the}} self may lead to <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-ethnic interactions, social self-efficacy may moderate this effect, such that those high in social self-efficacy will show a stronger effect of self-expansion motivation on <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions.

Study 2 extended Study 1, manipulating participants’ expectations about the success of the interaction. The primary interaction emerged: for those with high social self-efficacy, higher self-expansion motivation led to more <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions. For those low <b>in</b> social self-efficacy, <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> cross-group interactions was uninfluenced by self-expansion motivation.

5|$|The Mask of Zorro was {{initially}} set for release on December 19, 1997 before the release date {{was changed to}} March 1998. There was speculation within the media about whether TriStar changed the date {{in an attempt to}} avoid competition with Titanic. In reality Zorro had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar's parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release date was once again pushed back, this time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> costs.|$|E
5|$|The company {{collected}} NOK73.5 {{million in}} tolls, {{in addition to}} accumulating NOK16.3 million <b>in</b> <b>interest.</b> Costs, mostly for running of the toll plaza, were NOK7.6 million, in addition to financial costs of NOK20.0 million. This gave a profit of NOK62.4 million, including the necessary repayments of the initial loan. Because the debt had been financed with bonds, the company chose to place revenue in the bank with a higher interest instead of paying off the bonds faster. The preferred shares were repaid in 1980, while all bonds had been repaid by 1985. A/S Sotrabrua was formally liquidated on 9 February 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
