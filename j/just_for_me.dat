25|$|In March 2013, Morales {{revealed}} {{plans to}} fight {{at least once}} more. “The idea {{is to make a}} nice party for the farewell of my career,” he said. “I’ve had a 20-year career. “(The party is) not only for me, but for the people who stood by me – my father, my mother, my brothers, the fans, the press, especially the coaches, trainers, doctors, sparring partners and all of those who helped prepare me and demanded me to be better every day. But mostly, my children and my wife, who often had to endure my absence for long periods of time. This is not <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> but for everyone involved in my career,” Morales said.< As reported on April 25, 2013 by badlefthook.com, Morales plans to fight two times in 2013 in July and November. In June 2014, Morales officially announced his retirement forgoing a farewell fight.|$|E
500|$|... "One of Those Days" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song with}} a [...] "slight retro feel" [...] to it. Chuck Taylor of Billboard {{classified}} the song as a [...] "groovy, hip-swaying composition". The song's hook samples the melody from The Isley Brothers' 1983 song [...] "Between the Sheets". As Houston begins the first verse, she declares her stress: [...] "This is <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> [...] Got {{to take time}} out [...] You don't know what I'm going through." [...] She then sings about getting away from it, by indulging in activities like a manicure, pedicure and by having a [...] "late-night snack, a bubble bathe and a massage". Throughout the song, she sings over a [...] "warm bed of beats and horns". Writing for Entertainment Tonight, Tim Jaramillo commented that the song is a [...] "smoky track with a feel-good, chilled-out vibe". Dan LeRoy of NJ Star Ledger observed that the song sounded like an outtake from Brandy Norwood's debut album, while New York Daily News compared it to Houston's 1999 song [...] "It's Not Right but It's Okay". An official remix of the song features rapped verses from Nelly, which according to MTV News staffs has a reggae feel.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of his role from turntablist to keyboardist on Light Grenades (2006), Chris Kilmore stated that, during the band's hiatus, he [...] "took a lot of piano lessons and {{did a lot of}} learning keyboards. I made a lot of music, but it just sits at home, it’s not for everybody, it’s <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> as a learning process. A lot of practicing, I’d be playing music every single day, keys every single day. I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes. But I have questions, {{and there is a lot}} of people around me that I can ask, Ben is an incredible musician, Mike is an incredible musician and composer, and if I need something explained or helped with, I don’t have to go far to get an answer." ...|$|E

60|$|Well, I {{came out}} here to Carleton, and from the time I got here I was {{perfectly}} happy. John Henry had a little rented house, and he was as poor as a church mouse, being the ne'er-do-well of our family, and the best loved, as ne'er-do-wells are so apt to be. He'd nearly died of lonesomeness since his wife's death, {{and he was so}} glad to see me. That was delightful in itself, and I was just in my element getting that little house fixed up cosy and homelike, and cooking the most elegant meals. There wasn't much work to do, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and him, and I got a squaw in to wash and scrub. I never thought about Northfield except to thank goodness I'd escaped from it, and John Henry and I were as happy as a king and queen.|$|E

Ever since I can remember, we've been such friends. You've only seen the outside of him, and I know how different that is from what he really is. All his life he has thought only of me.

60|$|In {{the next}} place, it {{occurred}} to me, that albeit the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: these people had done me no injury: that if they attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate preservation to fall upon them, something might be said for it; but that I was yet out of their power, and they had really no knowledge of me, and consequently no design upon me; and therefore {{it could not be}} <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to fall upon them: that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards, in all their barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed millions of these people, who, however they were idolaters and barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in these customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation, even by the Spaniards themselves, at this time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man; and such, as for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity, or of Christian compassion: as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the product of a race of men, who were without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper in the mind.|$|E
60|$|When I {{considered}} this a little, it followed necessarily that I was {{certainly in the}} wrong in it; {{that these people were}} not murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their arms and submitted.
