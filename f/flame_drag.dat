40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} of <b>flame</b> <b>drag,</b> flame tilt and flame length, which {{were obtained for}} 2 m diameter Jet A fires in crosswinds of 3 - 10 m/s and described in Part I of this paper, were compared to values predicted using published semi-empirical correlations. Results were shown to be influenced in part by differences in the method used to measure flame geometry and in the boundary conditions between different experiments. Flame tilt values were predicted most successfully by correlations involving {{a combination of the}} Froude number U 2 /gD and the non-dimensionalized heat release rate Q 2 ̆ 217. Values estimated using similar correlations for <b>flame</b> <b>drag</b> and flame length were less successful, indicating gaps in the relevant physics modeled by those correlations. Fuel vapor density {{played an important role in}} determining the extent of <b>flame</b> <b>drag.</b> At high wind speeds, the horizontal momentum of the wind dominated over buoyancy effects in producing <b>flame</b> <b>drag,</b> physical effects not necessarily captured in the existing correlations. Flame length appeared to be governed by factors such as fuel vapor density and heat of combustion of the fuel, as well as wind speed and fuel burning rate. The restriction in air entrainment under conditions of large <b>flame</b> <b>drag</b> greatly increased flame length, particularly at high wind speeds, and should also be considered in future correlations.

50|$|The {{pastoral}} {{structure of}} the festival is {{carried out by the}} shepherd himself. After the sheep pen had been decorated with green branches and a wreath draped on the gate, the remainder of the ceremony took place in sequence. At the first sign of daylight, the shepherd would purify the sheep: by sweeping the pen and then constructing a bonfire of straw, olive branches, laurel, and sulfur. The noises produced by this burning combination were interpreted as a beneficial omen. The shepherd would jump through this <b>flame,</b> <b>dragging</b> his sheep along with him. Offerings of millet, cakes, and milk were then presented before Pales, marking the second segment of the ceremony. After these offerings, the shepherd would wet his hands with dew, face the east, and repeat a prayer four times. Such prayers requested Pales’s assistance in freeing the shepherd and the flock from evils brought about by accidental wrongdoings (e.g. trespassing on sacred grounds and removing water from a sacred water source). The final portion of the rural festival made use of the beverage burranica, a combination of milk and sapa (boiled wine). After consumption of this beverage, the shepherd would leap through the fire three times, bringing an end to the ceremony.|$|R

Whilst attacking hostile troops at about 500 feet he was encountered by eight triplanes, which dived from all directions, firing their front guns. He fired bursts at each machine in turn, shooting {{three of them}} down out of control. He was wounded himself six times, but continued the action until his machine caught fire. The pilot, although wounded five times, with great skill and coolness managed to climb to the left hand bottom plane and controlled the machine {{from the side of}} the fuselage, side-slipping to the ground.

40|$|Vorhersage der thermischen Strahlung großer, rußender Kohlenwasserstoff- Poolfeuer mit CFD SimulationComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{simulations}} of large-scale JP- 4 pool fires with pool diameters of d = 2 m, 8 m, 16 m, 20 m and 25 m {{in a calm}} condition, {{as well as with}} pool diameters of d = 2 m, 20 m and 25 m under cross-wind conditions with wind velocities in a range of 0. 7 m/s 10 m/s as it is found in experiments. In the upper section of the flames, depending on the <b>flame</b> tilt and <b>drag,</b> a decrease of flame temperature of several hundreds K is found. With increasing wind velocity uw > 2. 3 m/s the predicted flame tilt from the vertical becomes significant. The CFD results show that two counter rotating vortices at the leeward side of the fire are formed at the minimum uw = 1. 4 m/s as observed in experiments. The predicted <b>flame</b> tilt and <b>drag</b> for d = 20 m begins from 20 ° and 1. 1 at uw = 1. 4 m/s and ends with 80 ° and 2. 5 at uw = 16 m/s which agree with the experimental data. In a case of d = 2 m the <b>flame</b> tilt and <b>drag</b> reach values of 60 ° and 2. 5 for uw = 4. 5 m/s and 80 ° and 2. 8 for uw = 16 m/s as in the experiments. 	 Flame temperatures T, surface emissive power SEP, irradiances E and the wind influence on large pool fires were at the first time predicted with CFD simulations. The CFD predictions are generally in good agreement with the measured values. The CFD simulations allow (for future), the estimation of wind effects and also the important influence of multiple fires on the hazard potential. The present work has, also shown that the hazard potential of large pool fires with CFD {{simulations of}} the thermal radiation can be estimated much better than before...|$|R
60|$|A mighty shout hailed its downfall. The gods of the Britons, insulted and outraged, were avenged {{upon those}} of Rome; the altars of Mona had {{streamed}} {{with the blood}} of the Druids, those of Camalodunum were wet with the gore of Roman legionaries. The statues were broken to pieces, the altars torn down, and then the chiefs ordered the tribesmen to fetch in faggots. Thousands went to the forest, while others pulled down detached houses and sheds that had escaped the <b>flames,</b> and <b>dragged</b> the beams and woodwork to the temple. By nightfall an enormous pile of faggots was raised round each of the eight interior columns that in two lines supported the roof. Torches were applied by Boadicea, her two daughters and some of the principal Druids, and in a short time the interior of the temple was a glowing furnace. The beams of the ceiling and roof soon ignited and the flames shot up high into the air.|$|R

The nurse was out, and we two sleepers were alone. A spark from the wood-fire was shot out, and it lit on the slope of the tent. I suppose a quiet interval followed, then a scream from the baby awoke me, and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling! Before I could think, I sprang to the floor in my fright, and in a second was half-way to the door; but in the next half-second my mother's farewell was sounding in my ears, and I was back on the bed again.

50|$|Smith {{was one of}} {{the first}} proponents of the {{aesthetics}} which came to be known as 'camp' and 'trash', using no-budget means of production (e.g. using discarded color reversal film stock) to create a visual cosmos heavily influenced by Hollywood kitsch, orientalism and with <b>Flaming</b> Creatures created <b>drag</b> culture as it is currently known. Smith was heavily involved with John Vaccaro, founder of The Playhouse of the Ridiculous, whose disregard for conventional theater practice deeply influenced Smith's ideas about performance art. In turn, Vaccaro was deeply influenced by Smith's aesthetics. It was Vaccaro who introduced Smith to glitter and in 1966 and 1967, Smith created costumes for Vaccaro's Playhouse of The Ridiculous. Smith's style influenced the film work of Andy Warhol as well as the early work of John Waters. While all three were part of the 1960s gay arts movement, Vaccaro and Smith refuted the idea that their sexual orientation was responsible for their art.|$|R

50|$|The whole {{race was}} later revived {{after the battle}} with the wish-granting Id; J'onn's wish {{to be reunited with}} his human self — the League having been divided into their superhuman and {{civilian}} identities after a careless wish made by Superman — was subconsciously translated as a desire to cure his loneliness, thus prompting Id, in its usual sense of irony, to awaken those on Earth most like J'onn. This time, the White Martians captured various human psychics to work on means of expanding their own mental abilities while simultaneously constructing chemical processing towers which would fireproof Earth's atmosphere by binding all the free oxygen, making themselves completely invulnerable, and conveniently asphyxiating mankind into extinction. Although the towers were destroyed when J'onn escaped his imprisonment, the League were forced to trick the Martians into sending them to the Phantom Zone {{to come up with a}} plan of attack; the Zone was the one place Martian telepathy couldn't reach, allowing them to conceive a plan of attack and then return to Earth, J'onn placing a mental block on their minds that would stop them from remembering the plan- and thus giving the White Martians a chance to learn about it- until the moment came for them to take action. Released by the Atom (who had hidden inside Protex's head to use his own telepathy against him), the League faced the Martians in a climactic battle on the Moon. The plan required Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern to move the Moon itself to expose the Martians to <b>flame</b> by <b>dragging</b> it into Earth's atmosphere, J'onn keeping the Martians occupied while Atom manipulated Protex's telepathy to make the other White Martians believe that their fellows were the League members, Earth's magicians working to negate the damage that would have otherwise been caused to Earth by the lunar gravity. Placed in this position, the Martians were forced to accept being banished into the Phantom Zone — a common punishment for DC's most dangerous super-villains — or die on the Moon. J'onn was prepared to sacrifice his own life to defeat them, but was teleported out of danger at the last second by his teammates, Batman subsequently informing him that he was never alone, and that J'onn having considered himself such was the one thing that his teammates couldn't easily forgive.|$|R
40|$|A quasi-steady {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to study fuel droplet evaporation and combustion in a low pressure, zero-gravity environment. Combustion is modeled using finite-rate chemical kinetics and a one-step overall reaction. The gas-phase solution is obtained using the quasi-steady equations of mass, momentum, species, and energy conservation. Droplet circulation is accounted for by solving the quasi-steady equations for mass and momentum conservation in the liquid-phase. The evaporation and combustion of n-heptane droplets in air at atmospheric pressure is numerically investigated. ^ A vortex forms {{in the wake of}} an evaporating droplet at a lower Reynolds number than for the case of a solid sphere. An increase in ambient temperature results in a longer vortex at a given Reynolds number. ^ Results for extinction velocity as a function of droplet diameter and freestream temperature are presented. Experimental results available in the literature compare well with the numerical predictions. A linear dependence of the extinction velocity on droplet diameter constitutes the present state of knowledge. This study predicts a nonlinear dependence for small diameters (d 3 ̆c 1 mm), and a linear dependence only for large diameters (d 3 ̆e 2 mm). ^ A detailed description of envelope, transition, and wake flame configurations is provided. Transition flames cause an enhancement in the local surface mass flux at the point along the droplet surface near the start of the flame front. The location of the minimum surface pressure moves toward the rear of the droplet as the flame changes from a wake to an envelope flame. As the flame changes from a transition to an envelope <b>flame,</b> the friction <b>drag</b> decreases and the thrust drag increases with the net result being a slight reduction in overall <b>drag.</b> ^ Multiple <b>flame</b> configurations are predicted at lower ambient temperatures. The velocity which results in a change from an envelope flame to a different flame configuration exhibits an exponential dependence on the ambient temperature. ...|$|R
