5|$|Operation Freshman was the codename {{given to}} a British {{airborne}} operation conducted in November 1942 during World War II.

By 1942, the German nuclear weapons programme had come close {{to being able to}} develop a nuclear reactor, but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon. Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical, and it was finally <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant, demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden.|$|E
