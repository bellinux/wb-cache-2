25|$|The spathe {{provides}} a safe breeding {{area for the}} beetles. As such, the male beetles are often followed by female beetles {{with the intent of}} mating with the males within the spathe. The philodendrons benefit from this symbiotic relationship because the males will eventually leave the spathe covered in pollen and repeat the process at another philodendron, pollinating it in the process and thus providing philodendrons a means of sexual reproduction. In addition to gaining a safe location to mate, the male beetles may benefit from having a central location, because it allows them to broadcast to females that they are willing and able to mate. Females which see a male beetle headed for a philodendron flower know he does so with intention of mating, and females which are sexually receptive and need to mate <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find males if they follow the pheromones produced by the philodendron flowers. As a result, the male beetles benefit from this relationship with the philodendrons because {{they do not have to}} produce pheromones to attract females, since the philodendrons do it for them. Additionally, male beetles benefit because they are ensured of mating with only sexually receptive females, which is not necessarily certain otherwise. In doing so, the philodendron provides male beetles a more efficient way to find females than what they could achieve on their own. Interestingly, pheromones produced by the philodendrons may be similar to those produced by female beetles when they wish to attract males to mate. Also, the pheromones have a sweet, fruity smell in many species and no noticeable smell for others. In addition to the reproductive benefits to beetles, the philodendrons provide food in two forms. Pollen from the fertile male flowers is eaten by the beetles throughout the night. Secondly, the sterile male flowers consumed by the beetles are rich in lipids.|$|E
500|$|In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, the United States Supreme Court {{established}} {{a framework for}} determining whether a suspect's consent is voluntary. The Court noted that historically, when [...] "determining whether a defendant's will was overborne in a particular case, the Court has assessed the totality of all the surrounding circumstances—both {{the characteristics of the}} accused and the details of the interrogation". Consequently, the Court held that voluntariness should be determined [...] "from the totality of all the circumstances". The Court also clarified that judges should examine the [...] "possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who consents" [...] to determine whether a suspect was coerced into consenting, and [...] "account must be taken of subtly coercive police questions". However, the Court also held that suspects may still give valid consent even if they do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> refuse to consent to the search.|$|E

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do something about it.

500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been an easy thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums to let you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E
