40|$|As {{part of this}} {{research}} project, a test stretch with a sub-base with a hydraulic binder of sand (<b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> sand sub-base) was set up. The project aimed to observe the filling behaviour of the base {{as well as its}} characteristics after it had been laid compared to a <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> gravel base in accordance with ZTVT. The grading curve of the chosen sand lay within grading envelope 'A' as designated by the supplement for <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> sand sub-base. A blast furnace cement HOZ 35 L was used as a binder. In particular, extended suitability tests were used to investigate the strengths, frost resistance and initial stability of the mixed materials. The material mixture for <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> sand sub-base requires a higher binder content compared with that for <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> gravel base, though from a technical point of view, a material can be produced which meets ZTVT requirements. When the <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> sand sub-base was laid it became clear that compaction with the heavy-duty screed of a road finishing machine at a thickness of 15 cm was generally sufficient to achieve the specified rate of compaction. Owing to different weather conditions during the construction of the test stretch, there were two qualitatively different areas in the <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> sand sub-base section. The control test section with <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> gravel base served as a further comparison to these two sections. In light of the deflection measurement results {{on the surface of the}} <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> base, the <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> sand sub-base sections show slightly less favourable characteristics. Whether or not this has any effect on long-term behaviour remains to be seen. With a view to the course bonding between the <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> base and the asphalt road base, a bond could in no way be determined from the material taken from the drilling core. With the help of surveys carried out by the 'Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen' (Federal Highway research Institute) over a longer period of time, during which the deflections as well as the transverse and longitudinal profiles will be measured, the continued behaviour of the test stretch under traffic conditions is to be evaluated.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{summarize}} {{the results of}} coupled thermal, hydraulic, and mechanical (THM) modeling {{in support of the}} Northwest Geysers EGS Demonstration Project, which aims at enhancing production from a known High Temperature Reservoir (HTR) (280 – 400 °C) located under the conventional (240 °C) geothermal steam reservoir. The THM modeling was conducted to investigate geomechanical effects of cold-water injection during the stimulation of the EGS, first to predict the extent of the stimulation zone for a given injection schedule, and then to conduct interpretive analyses of the actual stimulation. By using a calibrated THM model based on historic injection and microseismic data at a nearby well, we could reasonably predict the extent of the stimulation zone around the injection well, at least for {{the first few months of}} injection. However, observed microseismic evolution and pressure responses over the one-year stimulation-injection revealed more heterogeneous behavior as a result of more complex geology, including a network of shear zones. Therefore, for an interpretive analysis of the one-year stimulation campaign, we included two sets of vertical shear zones within the model; a set of more permeable NW-striking shear zones and a set of less permeable NE-striking shear zones. Our modeling indicates that the microseismic events in this system are related to shear reactivation of pre-existing fractures, triggered by the combined effects of injection-induced cooling around the injection well and rapid (but small) changes in steam pressure as far as a kilometer from the injection well. Overall, the integrated monitoring and modeling of microseismicity, ground surface deformations, reservoir pressure, fluid chemical composition, and seismic tomography depict an EGS system <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bounded</b> by some of the NE-striking low permeability shear zones, with the more permeable NW-striking shear zone providing liquid flow paths for stimulation deep (several kilometers) down into the HTR. The modeling indicates that a significant mechanical degradation (damage) inferred from seismic tomography, and potential changes in fracture porosity inferred from cross-well pressure responses, are related to shear rupture in the stimulation zone driven by both pressure and cooling effects...|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. Pavement foundations for major roads in the UK were historically designed on an empirical basis, related to a single design chart, restricting the incorporation of superior performing materials or materials for which the empirical data sets were not available. The adoption of performance based specifications was promoted as they are perceived to ‘open up’ the use of alternative materials (including ‘local’ sources of primary materials) or techniques, and allow for the incorporation of superior performance into the overall pavement design. Parallel developments to the performance based design of pavement foundations (allowing for superior performance) and in situ testing required the support of laboratory based performance tests. These laboratory based tests were required to determine material performance parameters (elastic modulus and resistance to permanent deformation) for both unbound and <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> pavement foundation materials. A review of the available laboratory apparatus {{indicated that they were}} either; unrealistic (and hence unable to provide the required material performance parameters), or overly complex and more suited to fundamental research. Therefore, the requirement for developmental research work was identified. The research reported herein details the development, manufacture and initial evaluation of simplified laboratory apparatus (the Springbox for unbound materials and static stiffness test for <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> mixtures) designed to produce the performance parameters of elastic modulus and relative resistance to permanent deformation for pavement foundation materials. The equipment and test procedure evaluation was undertaken across a range of materials, giving initial guidance on likely in situ performance. The innovative laboratory apparatus and materials guidance (including the potential to use recycled and secondary aggregates) was incorporated into key Highways Agency specification and guidance documents, which in turn influence construction practice outside of motorways and major trunk roads. This research concludes by outlining a number of recommendations for continued development and evaluation, including feeding back data sets from long term in situ performance testing for subsequent refinement of assumptions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a vision of}} a sustainable and resilient built environment that is comprised of materials and structures that continually monitor, regulate, adapt and repair themselves without the need for external intervention. In this way, these self?healing materials and intelligent structures will significantly enhance durability and serviceability, improve safety and reduce maintenance costs. The conglomerate materials that form the basis of the majority of such construction materials (concrete, grouts, mortars, <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> materials, grouted soils etc), are extremely complex multiphase composites with multi?scale internal structures that exhibit a hierarchy of multi?dimensional, time?dependent damage mechanisms. For example, in cementitious composites nano?scale damage occurs during hydration and the strength development phase, while medium?term damage due to chemical attack also leads to the formation of defects in its structure. Other short?term factors can also produce dislocations at the nano-scale. In time, this nano?damage grows to form micro-cracks which eventually coalesce to form networks of meso?cracks which in turn lead to debonding between the paste and aggregate particles, followed by a discrete number of visible macro?cracks which so often lead to corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Hence, it is evident that to truly achieve a self?healing cementitious composite, a system is needed that can act at both the different time and length scales at which the damage can form.

40|$|Reflection {{cracks in}} a {{composite}} pavement are generally {{assumed to be}} caused either by {{the crack in the}} <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> base layer opening and closing as the result of thermal expansion and contraction or by a flexing and shearing action caused by the passage of a wheel load. These processes will induce a stress concentration in the asphalt immediately above the crack, which cause a crack to initiate and propagate towards the surface. However, extensive coring of in-service roads in the UK has shown that reflection cracks often start at the surface of the road and propagate downwards to meet the existing crack in the underlying concrete base rather than travel upwards. Furthermore, field data have shown environmental effects to be the primary cause of reflection cracks in as-laid composite pavements. When the pavement is new, the surface course appears to be ductile enough to withstand the thermally induced stresses but as the asphalt ages it will progressively loose this capability. Modellers generally treat the asphalt surfacing as a passive layer that responds to the thermal movements of the crack in the cement bound base. This approach will predict bottom-up cracking. This paper presents a thermal response model, which treats the cement bound and asphalt layers as a complete system and recognises that: • The thermal expansion coefficient of asphalt is much higher than that of concrete; • The largest diurnal temperature changes occur in the asphalt surfacing; • Age hardening results in asphalt close to the surface becoming brittle. This response model predicts top-down cracking and, it also predicts that bottom-up cracking from the existing crack will not normally occur. The field data also supports these predictions...|$|E

The database provides on-line access to Best Practice Guides, practical application case studies and international literature reviews elaborated from the review of national documents. There are three different ways for searching the database: 1) Via specific documents – Literature reviews, Case study reports and Best Practice Guides – for each material type; 2) Via quick or advanced search for specific terms; 3) Via a map where case studies are geo-tagged. The DIRECT-MAT database has been developed by some fifty experts from fifteen European countries. This means that national documents, working sites data and research results have now become easily available to road authorities, CEN technical committees and researchers from other countries.

40|$|Fatigue {{calculations}} {{show that}} the service life of asphalt pavements can be increased at high temperatures {{through the use of}} harder binders and at low temperatures, through the use of softer binders. The research project was therefore designed to calculate the optimum bitumen viscosity for asphalt pavement of differing thickness in relation to the carrying capacity of the base and the tensile stress distribution resulting from temperature distribution and traffic load distribution using a suitable law of fatigue. A bitumen viscosity was to be calculated which promised the longest possible service life with a view to structural considerations rather than the asphalt used. In order to carry out this task: structural variants needed to be categorised according to construction method and construction class; assumptions needed to be made with regard to carrying capacity of the base in relation to the time of year and the construction method selected; frost blanket course, broken stone sub-base on frost blanket course or <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> road base on frost blanket course; spatial and time distribution of the asphalt body temperatures needed to be developed from the asphalt surface temperatures; assumptions needed to be drawn up based on traffic volumes - DTV and DTV(SV) - and traffic time series with regard to spatial and time distribution of traffic; tensile stress distribution caused by temperature and traffic load needed to be calculated in relation to geometrical location and time; estimates of the probable service life needed to be made based on these constraints and load stresses which make clear which bitumen viscosity guarantees the longest possible undamaged service life as seen from a structural point of view.

Continuous project information will be available at [URL] At present, many European countries have acquired experience in dismantling and recycling road materials back into roads. However, research results are not widely implemented and national documents are not often available to specialists from other countries. In this European project, twenty partners cooperate to build a web database that will provide access to validated guidelines, national document references, harmonised literature reviews and practical application case studies based on jobsite data sets. In this way DIRECT-MAT will actively contribute to generating closer cooperation between research and practice within road material recycling and also contribute to reducing the waste disposal associated with roads...|$|E
40|$|The NR 2 C vision 2040 designates {{four main}} {{concepts}} {{for the road}} of the future. The innovations considered in WP 2 all deal with solutions for {{one or more of}} the above concept needs, and mainly with the green infrastructure by reservation of rare resources via recycling and use of industrial by-products. Innovation 2. 1 A Design of high performance layer with raw material (EPFL-Switzerland, BRRC Belgium, and other FEHRL-laboratories as VTI, KTI, DRI). The goal is to evaluate if the growing share of recycled aggregate used in asphalt high stiffness base courses influences the asphalt mechanical properties. It is the aim of this study that no significant loss in asphalt fatigue, deformation and durability characteristics counterbalances the environmental and economic benefits coming from the use of recycled material. Comprehensive laboratory and Accelerated Loading Tests (ALT) are performed in the project. Innovation 2. 1 B Crack free semi-rigid pavement incorporating industrial waste (LCPC-France) The goal is to evaluate if the natural cement concrete shrinkage can be compensated by adding industrial by-products (steel slag, fly ash) with swelling ability to the mixture. The consequences of the use of additional CaO are also tested. The main idea is to minimise (even to stop) the cracking of <b>hydraulically</b> <b>bound</b> layers and so, to avoid the reflection cracking in the asphalt layers built on them. The innovation is closely connected to the concept "safe infrastructure". Innovation 2. 2. Use of the infra-red characteristics of materials to improve drivers' visibility (LCPCFrance). The goal is to enhance the traffic safety by improving the drivers' visibility among unfavourable conditions (darkness, fog etc.). The use of infrared image technique can be the solution. Simulation and real test site measurements are applied for the validation of the innovative technique. It can contribute to the concept "reliable infrastructure". Innovation 2. 3. Optimisation of the maintenance process (Eurovia-France) The goal is to evaluate whether asphalt laying activities can be performed without detrimental consequences under extreme weather conditions (too low or too high temperature, rain etc.). The proposed innovative techniques are supposed to ensure the required asphalt quality and not to increase the construction costs considerably. The success of the project can contribute to the lengthening of the construction season without quality compromise. It was to contribute to the concept "reliable infrastructure". Innovation 2. 4. Improving the mechanical properties of a low noise section (VTI-Sweden, ZAGSlovenia) The goal of this innovation initiated in a later phase of NR 2 C WP 2 activities is to evaluate (and eventually to improve) the functional and the mechanical properties (durability) of low-noise poroelastic layers built on cement concrete blocks. Laboratory and site tests are to be performed for the evaluation of these properties. So, it contributes to the concept "green infrastructure", by the reduction of noise nuisance coming from traffic...|$|E
