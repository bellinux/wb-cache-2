There, Reyes phones <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about the case, but Mulder cedes {{to the authority of}} John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who is formally running the X-Files. However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head. Suddenly, he notices something wrong with his face; he claws at his face, peeling away the skin to reveal burning embers beneath the skin.|$|E
5|$|Smith gave an {{interview}} to the Columbia newspaper The State about his book and his interest in researching {{the history of the}} Central Intelligence Agency. He explained that he was long interested in researching military history, and was initially asked by the American Society of Journalists and Authors to put together a monograph on the 1944 Invasion of Normandy by Western Allied forces during Operation Overlord in World War II. His literary representative later telephoned <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> if he would instead be interested in writing an encyclopedia detailing the history of the CIA. Smith agreed as he felt the CIA was highly relevant to military history.|$|E
5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new aviary {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|William Cragh (born ca. 1262, died {{some time}} after 1307), was a medieval Welsh warrior and {{supporter}} of Rhys ap Maredudd, lord of the lands of Ystrad Tywi, in his rebellion against King Edward I of England. Captured in 1290 by the son of William de Briouze, the Cambro-Norman Lord of Gower, he was tried and found guilty of having killed thirteenmen. Cragh was executed just outside Swansea within sight of de Briouze's Swansea Castle, twice, as the gallows collapsed during his first hanging. Lady Mary de Briouze decided for reasons unknown to intercede on Cragh's behalf, and prayed to the deceased Bishop of Hereford, Thomas de Cantilupe, requesting <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> God to bring Cragh back from the dead. Cragh began {{to show signs of}} life the day after his execution, and over the subsequent few weeks made a full recovery, living for at least another eighteenyears.|$|E
5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Đính was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} III Corps, which oversaw the region surrounding the capital Saigon. He was given the post because Diệm regarded {{him as one of}} his most loyal officers. This position meant that Đính would be important to {{the success or failure of}} any coup. In late 1963, with Diệm becoming increasingly unpopular, Đính's colleagues recruited him into a coup by playing on his ego. They convinced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Diệm for a cabinet post, knowing that the president was adamantly opposed to military officers serving as ministers and would chastise him. Diệm promptly rebuffed Đính, who became upset and was lured into the plot. Diệm and his brother and chief advisor Ngô Đình Nhu were aware of a coup plot, but did not know of Đính's involvement. Nhu planned a fake coup of his own in an attempt to trap his opponents and generate positive publicity for his family's regime. He put Đính in charge of the fake coup, and the general promptly redeployed loyal units outside Saigon and rebel forces near the capital. On 1 November 1963, the rebels' actual coup proceeded, and the Ngô brothers were deposed and executed.|$|E

25|$|Conversations {{and debates}} with Dave Sim were also dropped, as their {{friendship}} fell through over Brown's refusal {{to sign an}} online petition asserting Sim was not a misogynist, {{it would have been}} awkward for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Sim for permission to include those scenes.|$|E
25|$|The City of Modesto was {{originally}} {{a stop on}} the railroad connecting Sacramento to Los Angeles. When Modesto was founded in 1870, it was to be named Ralston after financier William C.

25|$|On Saturday nights Perkins {{would listen}} to the Grand Ole Opry on his father's radio. Roy Acuff's {{broadcasts}} inspired <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> his parents for a guitar. Since {{they could not afford}} one, his father made one from a cigar box and a broomstick. Finally, a neighbor in hard times offered to sell his dented and scratched Gene Autry model guitar with worn-out strings. Buck Perkins bought it for his son for a couple of dollars.|$|E
25|$|Church was a {{key figure}} in American foreign policy during the 1970s, and served as {{chairman}} of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 1979 to 1981. Following the instinct that led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions early on (see above), Church {{was one of the first}} senators to publicly oppose the Vietnam War in the 1960s, although he had supported the conflict earlier. He was the co-author of two legislative efforts to curtail the war: the Cooper–Church Amendment of 1970, and the Case–Church Amendment of 1973.|$|E

Ryurik Rostislavich submitted to Roman and Vsevolod III Yuryevich, and promised to sever relations with the Olgovichi and the Cumans. After that, Roman also advised <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Vsevolod III Yuryevich to reinstate him in Kiev and promised to support his request. Consequently, Vsevolod III Yuryevich forgave Ryurik Rostislavich and reappointed him to the town.|$|E
25|$|Convening the Eighth Provincial Synod of the clergy, August, 1875, he enacted many salutary regulations, {{particularly}} with regard to clerical dress, mixed marriages, and church music. Illness obliged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for a coadjutor and Bishop James Gibbons of Richmond was appointed to that position May 29, 1877. The archbishop then went abroad to seek for relief, but in vain. He returned to his former home in Newark in August, 1877, and after lingering for two months, died in his old room, where he had laboured for so long, on October 3, 1877.|$|E
25|$|Back in the present, the Prince contemplates what he {{believes}} to be the historical significance of the vote and also its deeper meaning. This leads <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Ciccio how he voted in the Plebiscite. At first reluctant, Don Ciccio finally admits that, {{as the son of}} a Bourbon royal game keeper, he could not bring himself to vote in favor of the revolution. Many others in Donnafugata voted the same way, but Don Calogero rigged the election and announced the results as unanimously in favor of the House of Savoy.|$|E

25|$|Defying orders, Max {{visits a}} former {{colleague}} named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne but, blind from a wartime injury, cannot confirm her identity.

Max seeks out a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph and instructs <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Delamare whether she really is Marianne. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop informs him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer. Max also hears that this whole operation might be a test, before he is given a vital job in the run-up to D-Day.|$|E
25|$|In 579, Pelagius II chose Gregory as his apocrisiarius (ambassador to the {{imperial}} court in Constantinople), a post Gregory would hold until 586. Gregory {{was part of}} the Roman delegation (both lay and clerical) that arrived in Constantinople in 578 to ask the emperor for military aid against the Lombards. With the Byzantine military focused on the East, these entreaties proved unsuccessful; in 584, Pelagius II wrote to Gregory as apocrisiarius, detailing the hardships that Rome was experiencing under the Lombards and asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Emperor Maurice to send a relief force. Maurice, however, had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the Lombards to intrigue and diplomacy, pitting the Franks against them. It soon became obvious to Gregory that the Byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force, given their more immediate difficulties with the Persians in the East and the Avars and Slavs to the North.|$|E
25|$|His family {{stated that}} Tobares' enthusiasm for work went {{down a few}} months before he disappeared. He told his sister that he was scared, and one time he called her sobbing. In March 2013, he spoke to his sister and told her that he wanted to return to Argentina. They believe that Tobares was kidnapped because he might have seen {{something}} suspicious while on the job that his employers did not want him to see. Tobares worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki Sushi Bar, but he was also a hired chef for private parties; his family told investigators that Tobares was sometimes taken by the CJNG, Tobares' last employer, to their private islands in western Mexico to cook for their exclusive events. He was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone while he was there. His family believes that in one of those private parties, Tobares saw something suspicious and began asking third-parties to clarify what he saw. When the CJNG found out what he was doing, Gerardo reportedly threatened him and told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> those question to his face. A week before his disappearance, Gerardo reportedly ordered Tobares to close down the Asian restaurant and fire all of the employees.|$|E
