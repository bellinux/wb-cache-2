5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the <b>downstage</b> area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to assess the}} evidence on tumour <b>downstaging</b> before liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initially staged beyond the Milan criteria. Methods: MEDLINE (from 1952), Embase (from 1980) and the Cochrane Library were searched. The review included cohort studies that reported the outcomes of patients with HCC outside the Milan criteria who underwent <b>downstaging</b> before transplantation. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and included a total of 720 patients who underwent transplantation following <b>downstaging</b> after initial presentation with disease outside the Milan criteria. The rate of successful <b>downstaging</b> varied from 24 to 69 per cent of patients. Reported survival rates ranged from 82 to 100 per cent, 79 to 100 per cent and 54 · 6 to 94 per cent at 1, 3 and 5 years respectively. These were comparable with results for patients presenting within the Milan criteria. Conclusion: Successful <b>downstaging</b> of HCC to within the Milan criteria is feasible in a proportion of patients. Absolute and disease-free survival rates in patients transplanted following <b>downstaging</b> are comparable to those in patients within the Milan criteria. © 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} To evaluate {{the role of}} preoperative induction therapy on prognosis of locally advanced thymic malignancies. Methods Between 1994 and 2012, patients received preoperative induction therapies (IT group) in the Chinese Alliance for Research in Thymomas (ChART) database, were compared with those having surgery directly after preoperative evaluation (DS group). All tumors receiving induction therapies were locally advanced (clinically stage III-IV) before treatment and those {{turned out to be}} in pathological stage I and II were considered <b>downstaged</b> by induction. Clinical pathological characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. To more accurately study the effect of induction therapies, stage IV patients were then excluded. Only stage I-III tumors in the IT group and stage III cases in the DS group were selected for further comparison in a subgroup analysis. Results Only 68 (4 %) out of 1, 713 patients had induction therapies, with a R 0 resection of 67. 6 %, 5 -year recurrence of 44. 9 %, and 5 - and 10 -year overall survivals (OS) of 49. 7 % and 19. 9 %. Seventeen patients (25 %) were <b>downstaged</b> after induction. Significantly more thymomas were <b>downstaged</b> than thymic carcinomas (38. 7 % vs 13. 9 %, P= 0. 02). Tumors <b>downstaged</b> after induction had significantly higher 5 -year OS than those not <b>downstaged</b> (93. 8 % vs 35. 6 %, P= 0. 013). For the subgroup analysis when stage IV patients were excluded, 5 -year OS was 85. 2 % in the DS group and 68. 1 % in the IT group (P< 0. 001), although R 0 resection were similar (76. 4 % vs 73. 3 %, P= 0. 63). However, 5 -year OS in tumors <b>downstaged</b> after induction (93. 8 %) was similar to those in the DS group (85. 2 %, P= 0. 438), both significantly higher than those not <b>downstaged</b> after induction (35. 6 %, P< 0. 001). Conclusion Only 68 (4 %) out of 1, 713 patients had induction therapies, with a R 0 resection of 67. 6 %, 5 -year recurrence of 44. 9 %, and 5 - and 10 -year overall survivals (OS) of 49. 7 % and 19. 9 %.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TACE was performed before surgery in 49 of 76 patients undergoing resection and in 54 of 111 patients undergoing liver transplantation. Results were retrospectively analyzed with regard to the response to treatment, the type of procedure performed, the incidence of complications, the incidence and pattern of recurrence, and survival. RESULTS: In liver resection, <b>downstaging</b> of the tumor by TACE (21 of 49 patients [42 %]) and total necrosis (24 of 49 patients [50 %]) were associated with a better disease-free survival than either no response to TACE or no TACE (<b>downstaging,</b> 29 % vs. 10 % and 11 % at 5 years, p = 0. 08 and 0. 10; necrosis, 22 % vs. 13 % and 11 % at 5 years, p = 0. 1 and 0. 3). Five patients (10 %) with previously unresectable tumors could be resected after <b>downstaging.</b> In liver transplantation, <b>downstaging</b> of tumors > 3 cm (19 of 35 patients [54 %]) and total necrosis (15 of 54 patients [28 %]) were associated with better disease-free survival than either incomplete response to TACE or no TACE (<b>downstaging,</b> 71 % vs. 29 % and 49 % at 5 years, p = 0. 01 and 0. 09; necrosis, 87 % vs. 47 % and 60 % at 5 years, p = 0. 03 and 0. 14). Multivariate analysis of the factors associated with response to TACE showed that <b>downstaging</b> occurred more frequently for tumors > 5 cm. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Downstaging</b> or total necrosis of the tumor induced by TACE occurred in 62 % of the cases and was associated with improved disease-free survival both after liver resection and transplantation. In liver resection, TACE was also useful to improve the resectability of primarily unresectable tumors.

25|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) {{is usually}} performed for unresectable tumors or {{as a temporary}} treatment while waiting for liver transplant. TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure it to restrict the tumor’s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE {{has been shown to}} increase survival and to <b>downstage</b> HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure may are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists. As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8nbsp&cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.|$|E

40|$|Abstract AIM: To {{evaluate}} the <b>downstaging</b> of rectal cancer after preop R +/- CT. METHODS: 392 patients (pts) with rectal cancer were observed. Only 172 pts (58 %) with II and III stage cancer of middle and lower third were examined. Enrol-led pts were 168 : 52 of them received preop R +/- CT (32 RT, 20 R + CT). Preop R +/- CT group included 14 middle third cancers (73 %), 38 lower third (17 %). In this group, tumor stage was as follows: 44 T 3 stage tumors (86. 4 %), 8 (15. 4 %) T 4. Mean age {{of this group}} was 57 years (range 42 - 67). Patients received 45 Gy for 5 weeks in 25 fractions and continuous administration of 5 -FU (300 - 500 mg/m 2 /die). Surgery was performed 6 weeks +/- 7 days after the therapy. RESULTS: <b>Downstaging,</b> at least of 1 T-stage level, was detected in 45 patients (86 %) (8 middle third; 32 lower third), in 5 (9. 6 %) (4 middle third, 1 lower third), tumor decreased to pT 0 N 0, while in 7 (13. 5 %) (2 middle third, 5 lower third), there was no response.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This retrospective, nonrandomized review evaluates 125 {{patients}} with esophageal carcinoma (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell) who underwent either surgery only or preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy followed by surgery. Major end points were survival and postchemoradiation <b>downstaging.</b> METHODS: Forty-four patients underwent radiation therapy of 4500 cGy over 5 weeks. Fluorouracil and cisplatin were administered {{on the first}} and fifth week of radiotherapy. Ninety-eight patients underwent "potentially curative" resections-transhiatal esophagectomy (70), Lewis esophagogastrectomy (25), and left esophagogastrectomy (3). All {{patients with}} preoperative adjuvant therapy underwent endoscopy and biopsy before surgery. RESULTS: There were no differences in overall mortality (5 %) or surgical complications in either group. Fourteen of 44 patients (32 %) <b>downstaged</b> to complete pathologic response, with 5 -year survival of 57 %. Fifteen of 44 patients (34 %) <b>downstaged</b> to microscopic residual tumor, with 1 - and 3 -year survival of 77 % and 31 %, respectively. Twenty-eight of 29 patients in the two <b>downstaged</b> groups were lymph node negative. Overall, 5 -year survival in the adjuvant therapy plus surgery group versus surgery only was 36 % and 11 % (p = 0. 04).

40|$|Most {{patients}} with rectal cancer receive neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT), causing a variable decrease in tumor mass. We evaluated the prognostic impact of pathologic parameters reflecting tumor response to RCT, {{either directly or}} indirectly. Seventy-six rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant RCT between 2006 and 2009 were included. We studied the association between disease-free survival (DFS) and the "classical" clinicopathologic features as well as tumor deposits, circumferential resection margin (CRM), Dworak regression grade, and tumor and nodal <b>downstaging.</b> Patients with tumor <b>downstaging</b> had a longer DFS (p = 0. 05), indicating a more favorable prognosis when regression {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in tumor infiltrative depth, referred to as tumor shrinkage. Moreover, tumor <b>downstaging</b> was significantly associated with larger CRM and nodal <b>downstaging</b> (p = 0. 02), suggesting that shrinkage of the primary tumor was associated with a decreased nodal tumor load. Higher Dworak grade did not correlate with tumor <b>downstaging,</b> nor with higher CRM or prolonged DFS. This implies that tumor mass decrease was sometimes due to fragmentation rather than shrinkage of the primary tumor. Lastly, the presence of tumor deposits was clearly associated with reduced DFS (p = 0. 01). Assessment of tumor shrinkage after RCT via tumor <b>downstaging</b> and CRM is a good way of predicting DFS in rectal cancer, and shrinkage of the primary tumor is associated with a decreased nodal tumor load. Assessing regression based on the amount of tumor in relation to stromal fibrosis does not accurately discern tumor fragmentation from tumor shrinkage, which is most likely the reason why Dworak grade had less prognostic relevance...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March 1995 and August 1998, 46 consecutive patients with pathology proven N 2 disease were treated with three cycles of vindesine-ifosfamide-platinum (VIP). All patients underwent a rigorously performed cervical mediastinoscopy. Patients with at least partial response (n = 26) were surgically explored. RESULTS: The clinical response rate to chemotherapy was 57 % (26 patients). Resection was complete in 23 patients (88. 5 %). Pneumonectomy was performed in 16 patients. In 11 patients (42. 9 %) the mediastinal nodes (which were positive at mediastinoscopy) had become negative (<b>downstaging</b> group). The projected 2 -year survival of resected patients is 41 %.

These were compared to 75 patients both clinically and pathologically N 1 (cN 1 /pN 1) who underwent surgery without induction therapy and 79 patients clinically and pathologically not N 1 (cN 0 /pN 0) who underwent surgery without induction therapy. Analyses focused on survival and the cost and benefit of therapy. Results: For comparison, the extremes of 5 -year survival were 69 % for cN 0 /pN 0 patients who underwent surgery alone and 12 % for cN 1 /pN 1 patients who underwent surgery alone. Of 69 patients who received induction therapy, 37 were pN 0 at resection (downstaged); they had an intermediate survival of 37 % at 5 years. Those patients not <b>downstaged</b> with induction therapy had a 12 % 5 -year survival, similar to patients with cN 1 /pN 1 who underwent surgery alone. After adjusting for the strongest predictors of poor outcome, pN 1, and increasing N 1 burden, a modest increased risk of death after induction therapy was identified. However, this cost of induction therapy was more than counterbalanced by the benefit of improved survival of <b>downstaging</b> to pN 0. Conclusions: (1) pN 1 is the strongest determinant of poor outcome. (2) cN 1 patients who are <b>downstaged</b> by induction chemoradiation therapy to pN 0 have an intermediate outcome. (3) cN 1 patients who are not <b>downstaged</b> by induction therapy have a poor outcome. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 121 : 454 - 64...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of clinical staging of depth of tumor invasion (cT), the relationship of cT to survival, the benefits of <b>downstaging</b> cT, and the role of cT in treatment decisions. Methods: The accuracy of determining T by means of endoscopic ultrasonography and the relationship of cT to survival were assessed in 209 patients undergoing esophagectomy alone for esophageal carcinoma. The benefit of <b>downstaging</b> cT was assessed in 128 patients undergoing induction therapy and esophagectomy. The role of cT in treatment decisions was determined by integrating these results with the results of previous work. Results: Compared with pathologic T (pT), cT was 87 % accurate, 82 % sensitive, 91 % specific, 89 % positively predictive, and 86 % negatively predictive of tumors confined to (≤T 2) or invading beyond (>T 2) the esophageal wall. In cN 0, increasing cT was predictive of progressively poorer survival. For each category of pT N 0, cT accurately predicted survival, except for pT 3, which was underestimated (P <. 0001). In cN 0, <b>downstaging</b> by induction therapy was beneficial only if tumors invaded beyond the wall (≥cT 3, P =. 0003). In cN 1, it was beneficial only when <b>downstaging</b> was synchronous in cT 3 /T 4 (P <. 001). Conclusions: cT should be the principal determinant of treatment in cN 0. In cN 0, if endoscopic ultrasonography identifies tumors of greater than cT 2, multimodality therapy should be considered. However, only when cT 3 /T 4 tumors are <b>downstaged</b> to pT 2 or less will patients benefit, but their survival will not equal that of patients with tumors of cT 2 or less having esophagectomy alone. If endoscopic ultrasonography identifies tumors of cT 2 or less, esophagectomy alone should be used because induction therapy might adversely affect survival.

40|$|In the {{treatment}} of hepatocellular carcinomas, therapies such as trans-arterial chemo-embolisation, trans-arterial radioembolisation, percutaneous ethanol injection and radio-frequency ablation can decrease the size (and overall viability) of the tumours, thus potentially increasing the proportion of patients qualifying for resection and transplantation. While {{the use of such}} <b>downstaging</b> therapies is straightforward when resection is the aim, in a similar way to other neo-adjuvant treatments in the surgery of tumours that are too large or awkwardly placed to be primarily resected the issues related to transplantation are more complex. In the context of transplantation the word "downstaging" designates not only a neo-adjuvant treatment, but also a selection strategy to allow patients who are initially outside accepted listing criteria to benefit from transplantation should the neo-adjuvant therapy be successful in reducing tumour burden. The effectiveness of <b>downstaging</b> as a selection strategy, at first questioned because of methodological bias in the studies that described it, has been recently demonstrated by more solid prospective investigations. Several issues however remain open, such as inclusion criteria before the strategy is implemented (size/number, surrogate markers of differentiation/vascular invasion such as alpha-fetoprotein), the choice of which <b>downstaging</b> therapy, the end-points of treatment, and the need and duration of a period of observation proving disease response or stabilisation before the patient can be listed. The present review discusses which treatments and strategies are available for <b>downstaging</b> HCC {{on the basis of the}} published literature...|$|R
