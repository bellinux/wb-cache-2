Erosion wear caused by the lignite particle impact {{on the walls of}} the ducts transporting and distributing the pulverised fuel, is calculated and evaluated. A bifurcation geometry has been selected for the simulation of the fuel distributing ducts.

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of flash <b>furnace</b> <b>burners</b> can be evaluated {{quickly and efficiently}} using CFD modelling. Gas flows are modelled using the conventional Eulerian approach, while Lagrangian particle tracking is used to model the flow of solid feed through the burner and into the reaction shaft. A composite particle model has been developed that considers the solid feed to {{be made up of}} single particles containing appropriate quantities of concentrate, flux and dust. Solid fuels (such as coal) can also be included in the composite particle. Reactions between the solids and gas are then modelled using standard heat and mass transfer relationships. Results from the modelling process are shown for BHP-Billiton’s Olympic Dam copper flash smelter with the burner that was used from 1998 – 2003. Flow patterns, temperature and gas composition distributions, particle dispersion and residence time, and overall extent of sulphur removal are predicted and used to evaluate furnace performance. However, results are sensitive to the assumed size of the composite particles, and plant measurements are required to determine the appropriate composite particle size to predict quantitative data...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the furnace and heat recovery area design and analysis task of the Conceptual Design of Oxygen-Based PC Boiler study is to optimize the location and design of the <b>furnace,</b> <b>burners,</b> over-fire gas ports, and internal radiant surfaces. The furnace and heat recovery area were designed and analyzed using the FW-FIRE and HEATEX computer programs. The furnace is designed with opposed wall-firing burners and over-fire air ports. Water is circulated in the furnace by natural circulation to the waterwalls and divisional wall panels. Compared to the air-fired furnace, the oxygen-fired furnace requires only 65 % of the surface area and 45 % of the volume. Two oxygen-fired designs were simulated: (1) without over-fire air and (2) with 20 % over-fire air. The maximum wall heat flux in the oxygen-fired furnace is more than double that of the air-fired furnace due to the higher flame temperature and higher H{sub 2 }O and CO{sub 2 } concentrations. The coal burnout for the oxygen-fired case is 100 % due to a 500 F higher furnace temperature and higher concentration of O{sub 2 }. Because of the higher furnace wall temperature of the oxygen-fired case compared to the air-fired case, furnace water wall material was upgraded from carbon steel to T 91. The total heat transfer surface required in the oxygen-fired heat recovery area (HRA) is 25 % less than the air-fired HRA due to more heat being absorbed in the oxygen-fired furnace and the greater molecular weight of the oxygen-fired flue gas. The HRA tube materials and wall thickness are practically {{the same for the}} air-fired and oxygen-fired design since the flue gas and water/steam temperature profiles encountered by the heat transfer banks are very similar...|$|E

40|$|Coal is {{presently}} the world's primary fuel for generating electrical power and, being more abundant {{and less expensive}} than oil or natural gas, {{is expected to continue}} its dominance into the future. Coal, however, is more carbon intensive than natural gas and oil and consequently coal-fired power plants are large point source emitters of carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }). Since CO{sub 2 } is a greenhouse gas, which may have an adverse impact on the world's climate/weather patterns, studies have been conducted to determine the feasibility and economic impact of capturing power plant CO{sub 2 } emissions for pipeline transport to a sequestration/storage site. The stack gas that exhausts from a modern coal-fired power plant typically contains about 15 % CO{sub 2 } on a dry volume basis. Although there are numerous processes available for removing CO{sub 2 } from gas streams, gas scrubbing with amine solvent is best suited for this application because of the large gas volumes and low CO{sub 2 } concentrations involved. Unfortunately the energy required to regenerate the solvent for continued use as a capturing agent is large and imposes a severe energy penalty on the plant. In addition this ''back end'' or post combustion cleanup requires the addition of large vessels, which, in retrofit applications, are difficult to accommodate. As an alternative to post combustion scrubbing, Foster Wheeler (FW) has proposed that the combustion process be accomplished with oxygen rather than air. With all air nitrogen eliminated, a CO{sub 2 }-water vapor rich flue gas will be generated. After condensation of the water vapor, a portion of the flue gas will be recirculated back to the boiler to control the combustion temperature and the balance of the CO{sub 2 } will be processed for pipeline transport. This proposed oxygen-carbon dioxide (O{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 }) combustion process eliminates the need for CO{sub 2 } removal/separation and reduces the cost of supplying a CO{sub 2 } rich stream for sequestration. FW has developed a conceptual design of an O{sub 2 } fired boiler to determine overall plant performance and economics. Five subtasks were conducted: (1) a literature review, (2) a system design and analysis, (3) a low NOx burner design and analysis, (4) a furnace and heat recovery area design analysis, and (5) an economic analysis. The objective of the literature search is to locate any data/information relevant to the Oxygen-Based PC Boiler conceptual design. The objective of the system design and analysis task is to optimize the PC boiler plant by maximizing system efficiency within practical considerations. Simulations of the oxygen-fired plant with CO{sub 2 } sequestration were conducted using Aspen Plus and were compared to a reference air-fired 460 MW plant. Flue gas recycle is used in the O{sub 2 }-fired PC to control the flame temperature. Parametric runs were made to determine the effect of flame temperature on system efficiency and required waterwall material and thickness. The degree of improvement on system efficiency of various modifications including hot gas recycle, purge gas recycle, flue gas feedwater recuperation, and recycle purge gas expansion were investigated. The selected O{sub 2 }-fired design case has a system efficiency of 30. 6 % compared to the air-fired system efficiency of 36. 7 %. The design O{sub 2 }-fired case requires T 91 waterwall material and has a waterwall surface area of only 65 % of the air-fired reference case. The objective of the low NOx burner design and analysis task is to optimize the burner design to ensure stable ignition, to provide safe operation, and to minimize pollutant formation. The burners were designed and analyzed using the Fluent CFD computer program. Four burner designs were developed: (1) with no OFG and 65 % flue gas recycle, (2) with 20 % OFG and 65 % flue gas recycle, (3) with no OFG and 56 % flue gas recycle and (4) with 20 % OFG and 56 % flue gas recycle. A 3 -D Fluent simulation was made of a single wall-fired burner and horizontal portion of the furnace from the wall to the center. Without primary gas swirl, coal burnout was relatively small, due to the low oxygen content of the primary gas. Consequently, the burners were modified to include primary gas swirl to bring the coal particles in contact with the secondary gas. An optimal primary gas swirl was chosen to achieve sufficient burnout.

The hot exhaust can be used to pre-heat the incoming combustion air and fuel gas (recuperation) to boost efficiency.|$|R
40|$|The conical {{tunnel burner}} is an {{improvement}} of the cylindrical tunnel burner because, by maintaining all its advantages by means of burning intensification, it may also insure the flame stabilization {{in a wide range}} of regulation with considerable diminished pressure losses. Technical applications for the conical <b>furnace</b> <b>burner</b> can vary due to the limited dimensions required by the system, as well as the important thermal loads, and also because of the burning stability characteristic that spreads over an important range of regulation. The low costs required by the burner, generated mainly by its simple construction, also raise the interest for this technical solution. A physical model is proposed for the ignition and flame front stabilization. The flame front stabilization contains different steps from the ignition moment to final flame front stabilization, with specific flame front geometries and specific locations along the burner axis.

40|$|The {{muffle furnace}} main {{purpose is to}} anneal the rough sponge iron powder transported through it, which is done by burning natural gas.

In {{order to reduce the}} consumptions of fossil fuel, some companies of the industry aims to exchange the natural gas in their muffle <b>furnace’s</b> <b>burners</b> to syngas, produced from biomass. This will however affect the performance of the furnace in the heating aspect. For this work, it is assumed that the effect will be negative. Thus the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how to compensate the loss of effect from the burners, by examining which other parameters have influence on the furnace heating performance of the sponge iron powder transported through the furnace. The investigation is executed by simulating a 1 meter of the furnace in COMSOL multiphysics for 10 min, not including the combustion chambers. The investigated parameters are the packing degree of the powder, surface emissivity of the muffle, process gas velocity, conveyor belt velocity and the heat transfer rate coefficient to muffle from the combustion chambers. Alas, the process gas velocity and conveyor belt velocity only have minor influence on the final result, according to this simulation. However, the simulation exhibited that the surface emissivity of the muffle and the packing degree of the powder has great impact on the heating of the powder and could compensate some of the lost effect from the burners.

Each burner pair has a rated thermal power of 100 kWth firing Dutch natural gas. The objective {{of the study was}} to optimize the furnace performance, i. e., to maximize the cooling tube efficiency and minimize the CO and NO emissions. In the study the following parameters were varied: the positions of the <b>burners</b> in the <b>furnace</b> (<b>burner</b> configuration), the firing mode (parallel and staggered), the excess air ratio (λ) and the cycle time (tcycle). Also, the influence on the furnace performance of the jet momentum of the combustion air and the temperature uniformity in the furnace were studied. It was concluded that staggered firing mode is disadvantageous, since it results in significantly higher NO emissions than parallel firing mode. Also, out of the five investigated burner configurations one has been exempted, since its cooling tube efficiency was significantly lower compared to the other configurations. Furthermore, a horizontal setup of the firing burners improves the cooling tube efficiency at a fixed temperature uniformity. Also, for the burner configurations with the firing burners positioned closer to the regenerating burners and further from the stack, the temperatures in the regenerators are higher, leading to higher combustion air preheat temperatures. The temperature in the regenerators was also influenced by the cycle time; higher cycle times leading to higher (peak) temperatures in the regenerators. Finally, this temperature in the regenerators was shown to be more decisive for the final amount of CO emitted than the excess air ratio or the jet momentum.

This research project aims at developing deeper understanding of the degradation and failure mechanisms acting on TBCs during high temperature exposure, and to use this knowledge to improve life assessments of TBCs. The present work includes a study on the influence of coating interface morphology on the fatigue life of TBCs and a study on the influence of some different heat treatments on the adhesive properties of TBCs. The influence of coating interface morphology on fatigue life has been studied both experimentally and by modelling. Large interface roughness has been found experimentally to increase fatigue life of TBCs. The modelling work do, to some extent, capture this behaviour. It is evident, from the study, that interface morphology has a large impact on fatigue life of TBCs. Three thermal testing methods, that degrade TBCs, have been investigated: isothermal oxidation, <b>furnace</b> cycling and <b>burner</b> rig test. The degraded TBCs have been evaluated by adhesion tests and microscopy. The adhesion of TBCs has been found to depend on heat treatment type and length. Cyclic heat treatments, (<b>furnace</b> cycling and <b>burner</b> rig test), lower the adhesion of TBCs while isothermal oxidation increases adhesion. The fracture surfaces from the adhesion tests reveal that failure strongly depends on the pre-existing defects in the TBC...|$|R
