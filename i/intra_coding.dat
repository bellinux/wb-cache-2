30|$|The {{influence}} of the skip and <b>intra</b> <b>coding</b> options becomes more prominent in case of Soccer 'a high-motion sequence’ where SI generation is strained. Considering the system with SW coding only, Figure  5 shows that the RD performance experiences a saturation effect at the higher rate points, in particular for the larger GOPs. The encoder has difficulty to create an accurate approximation of the SI, and thereby accurate SW rate estimates. Adding only the skip mode does not increase the performance since for such a high-motion sequence, {{the quality of the}} SI at the decoder is lower. However, adding the <b>intra</b> <b>coding</b> mode drastically increases the compression performance and completely removes the performance saturation. Since <b>intra</b> <b>coding</b> is completely independent of the SI, it boosts the performance when the SI quality is low. Under such conditions, replacing SW coding with <b>intra</b> <b>coding</b> decreases the distortion by reducing the number of bit-planes that fail to decode, in particular significant ones.

The <b>intra</b> <b>coding</b> framework of HEVC follows that of traditional hybrid codecs and is built on spatial sample prediction followed by transform coding and postprocessing steps. Novel features contributing to the increased compression efficiency include a quadtree-based variable block size coding structure, block-size agnostic angular and planar prediction, adaptive pre- and postfiltering, and prediction direction-based transform coefficient scanning. This paper discusses the design principles applied during the development of the new <b>intra</b> <b>coding</b> methods and analyzes the compression performance of the individual tools. Computational complexity of the introduced intra prediction algorithms is analyzed both by deriving operational cycle counts and benchmarking an optimized implementation. Using objective metrics, the bitrate reduction provided by the HEVC <b>intra</b> <b>coding</b> over the H. 264 /advanced video coding reference is reported to be 22 % on average and up to 36 %.

In this paper, we show how pattern matching is used to improve intra prediction. We also show how this operation is speeded by exploiting motion estimation calculation effort to find good initial matching points. The reduced cost allows selected inter and intra transform coefficients to be combined, to realize a tradeoff between rate, quality and resilience. The simulations with improved intra prediction show that large calculation efforts can be reduced and that a small amount of intra information is sufficient to improve coding resiliency. I...|$|R
