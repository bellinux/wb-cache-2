After {{completing}} his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007, Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter, with agencies like O and J. Walter Thompson. He then worked as an assistant director, but left it to pursue acting. He then decided to send his portfolio to directors. [...] He would go for all kinds of auditions, but did not get any good opportunities, while only getting calls for minor roles: [...] "Everything was so bleak. It was very frustrating. There were times I would think whether <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> right thing or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} took Bob's {{frustration with}} celebrating mediocrity and Syndrome's comment that [...] "when everyone's super, {{no one will}} be" [...] {{as a reflection of}} views shared by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche or an extension of Russian-American novelist Ayn Rand's Objectivism philosophy, which Bird felt was [...] "ridiculous." [...] He stated that {{a large portion of the}} audience understood the satire whereas [...] "two percent thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>The</b> Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged." [...] Some purported that The Incredibles exhibited a right-wing bias, which Bird also scoffed at. [...] "I think that's as silly of an analysis as saying The Iron Giant was left-wing. I'm definitely a centrist and feel like both parties can be absurd." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing!</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E

But as long as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> looking after the guys in my dressing room, then I'll be happy," [...] Ponting stated, adding that he wished to remain captain.|$|R
500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in {{that this was not}} going to be the type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] want to do is keep our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He went on to say that this method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E
500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing it as something which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of the}} low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly." [...] Simon described himself as [...] "combative" [...] and said that most people see him as having a [...] "bad attitude".|$|E

"We {{were playing}} a Shield game in Queensland and I threw my arm out {{on the day before}} the match," [...] he recalls. “I lost a lot of power, and a lot of things I could do before I wasn’t able to do. So I {{probably}} changed my technique after that to get more side-on, but I probably got more back-on. I was coming in to bowl but I was facing the wrong way. I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> right thing by changing things, but it didn’t work... Nowadays I would’ve had a shoulder operation... I got told I could have one, but it was really up to me to organise.” ...|$|E

"No; I was not {{wishing to}} argue," [...] {{answered}} Lady Lufton, almost humbly; [...] "but I was desirous of excusing myself to you, so that you should not think me cruel in withholding my consent.

5000|$|Evidence {{spoke about}} the album's production, saying: [...] "Babu and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} of the production, which {{is very different from}} when we were just excited to have two or three tracks on an album before. I think we still are excited just to have two or three on the album, but it's working out that we're getting more. It changes everything when you are really self-making an album and not hiring people. It's really different. Not to mention, we're making music in our studio with different mixing techniques. We're from an analog era, so we're doing things differently right now." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{might as}} well give the secret away right here. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> work of two men. Before me, one mature able-bodied {{labourer}} had done the day shift and another equally mature able-bodied labourer had done the night-shift. They had received forty dollars a month each. The superintendent, bent on an economical administration, had persuaded {{me to do the}} work of both men for thirty dollars a month. I thought he was making an electrician of me. In truth and fact, he was saving fifty dollars a month operating expenses to the company.|$|E
60|$|I {{raised a}} flush {{in each of}} his sallow cheeks at that, and I was glad of it, for it was the first sign of spirit which I had ever {{observed}} in him. For a moment he put his hand out towards his water-jug, as though he would have hurled it at me, but then he shrugged his shoulders and sat in silence once more, biting his nails, and scowling down at the floor. I could not but think, as I looked at him, that perhaps <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> Flying Artillery a very bad service by bringing him back to them.|$|E
60|$|And just then, as {{luck would}} have it, I found an {{employer}} that was of the same mind. I was willing to work, and he was more than willing that I should work. I thought I was learning a trade. In reality, I had displaced two men. I thought he was making an electrician out of me; as a matter of fact, he was making fifty dollars per month out of me. The two men I had displaced had received forty dollars each per month; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> work of both for thirty dollars per month.|$|E
5000|$|Dhammarakhita {{graduated}} with a business degree in Australia. As a lay person {{she worked as a}} secretary and translator. Before her ordination in 2002 Dhammarakhita had been a mae chii for nine years. Her ordination was surrounded by controversy and heated discussion in Thai media and politics due to the conservative views surrounding female ordination present in the country. The discussion was, however, less fierce than a year earlier when Dhammananda Bhikkhuni was ordained in Sri Lanka. In 2002 many newspapers supported the decision. Dhammarakhita defended her choice saying: [...] "I know that there might <b>be</b> resistance. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> prepared, knowing that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> right thing." [...] The ordination has not been yet recognised by the Thai Buddhist religious authorities.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> {{cultural}} {{analysis of}} culinary programs on home cooking. Specifically, the Czech programs Dita P. Diary, Carolina, The Home Cook, When Dad Cooks, Boys in Action and Cheap and Tasty with Lada Hruska. At {{the same time}} this work briefly presents the context of British culinary programs. The aim is to deduce what values the Czech programs can transmit to viewers. Inspiration in this respect draws upon cultural texts dealing with food / tv studies mentioned in {{the introductory part of}} the thesis. In {{the last part of the}} thesis it occurs that a particular aspect of the programs is too broadly defined. As a result only very general characteristics of values presented in the analysed programs could be deduced...|$|R

We needed his help, all right. Mother was sick, and my brother's ranch was playing to hard luck. But don't think I married him for his money--I liked him then, and, besides--well, I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> right thing--but now--well, I'm guessing." [...] She ended abruptly, and in the tremor of that final word Moss read her secret. She had never loved her husband. Pity and a kind of loyalty to her word had carried her to his side, and now a sense of duty bound her there.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{notion of}} {{duplicated}} work relies on noticing {{that after the}} first reduction of <b>I</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> <b>the</b> value of the other <b>I</b> <b>I</b> can <b>be</b> determined, {{because they have the}} same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting II terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of II can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the II term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.|$|R

How do I know if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> best therapy, or if the dosage (frequency and duration) is enough? The answer is to use evidence-based practice.
