GDP and population for each scenario were constructed by IPCC and climate data for each scenario was reported by the Hadley Center and are used in this research to consider results in different contexts. Production and consumption of primary agriculture crops {{of the world for}} each socio-economic scenario are obtained and investigated by using the modified world <b>food</b> <b>model.</b> Simulation results show that crop production in some countries or regions will have different trends depending on the context. These alternative contexts depend on the rate of GDP growth, population, temperature, and rainfall. Results suggest that the development of environment friendly technologies lead to more consumption of food in many developing countries. Relationships among environmental policy, clean energy development, and poverty elimination warrant further investigation.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the tribological and rheological properties of liquid and semi-solid <b>food</b> <b>model</b> systems containing micro-granular rice starch. Native (uncooked) and gelatinized rice starch dispersions, o/w emulsions and emulsion-filled gelatin gels were studied as <b>food</b> <b>model</b> systems. Native rice starch particles behaved as active fillers and increased the gel modulus with increasing concentration. At low concentration, soft gelatinized rice starch particles decreased gel modulus. At high concentration, gelatinized rice starch increased the gel modulus due to dense packing of particles. Native and gelatinized rice starch increased friction coefficients with increasing concentration due to different mechanisms. Native rice starch particles increase friction {{probably due to the}}ir irregular shape and particle agglomerations (at high concentration) that indirectly increase surface roughness and asperity contacts. Gelatinized rice starch particles increase friction probably due to the stickiness of leached-out starch polymers. The presence of oil droplets in rice starch-o/w emulsions could reduce the friction caused by stickiness of gelatinized rice starch. The tribological behaviors of rice starch-emulsion-filled gels are more complex than liquids due to the bulk and breakdown properties of the gel matrix. We conclude that morphology and surface properties of the rice starch particles together with bulk and breakdown properties of matrices are the main factors determining the tribological properties of <b>food</b> <b>model</b> systems containing rice starch particles...|$|E

40|$|The {{addition}} of antioxidants {{is one of}} the strategies to inhibit lipid oxidation, a major cause of lipid deterioration in foods leading to rancidity development and nutritional losses. However, several studies have been reported that conventional antioxidant assays, e. g., TPC, ABTS, FRAP, and ORAC could not predict antioxidant performance in several foods. This study aimed to investigate the performance of two recently developed assays, e. g., the conjugated autoxidizable triene (CAT) and the apolar radical-initiated conjugated autoxidizable triene (ApoCAT) assays to predict the antioxidant effectiveness of gallic acid and its esters in selected <b>food</b> <b>models</b> in comparison with the conventional antioxidant assays. The results indicated that the polarities of the antioxidants have a strong impact on antioxidant activities. In addition, different oxidant locations demonstrated by the CAT and ApoCAT assays influenced the overall antioxidant performances of the antioxidants with different polarities. To validate the predictability of the assays, the antioxidative performance of gallic acid and its alkyl esters was investigated in oil-inwater (O/W) emulsions, bulk soybean oils, and roasted peanuts as the lipid <b>food</b> <b>models.</b> The results showed that only the ApoCAT assay could be able to predict the antioxidative performances in O/W emulsions regardless of the antioxidant polarities.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} nitrites and sulfites as food {{preservatives}} {{has been}} {{a cause for concern}} due to the health problems that these additives can cause in humans. Natural products have been studied as an alternative, but most of them have hardly been applied in the food industry for technological and economic reasons. In this sense, organic salts such as sodium acetate are a good alternative due to their affordability. Thus, this study evaluated the capacity of sodium nitrite, sodium sulfite, a sodium acetate product (TQI C- 6000), and chitosan to inhibit two important foodborne pathogens, Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes. The MIC of each chemical was in vitro evaluated and their antibacterial action was subsequently checked in situ using minced meat as a <b>food</b> <b>model.</b> MIC values of sodium nitrite (10, 000 mg/L) and sodium sulfite (50, 000 mg/L) for Salmonella enterica were higher than the values allowed by legislation (450 mg/L for sulfites and 150 mg/L for nitrites). Additionally, the sodium acetate product caused the inhibition of Salmonella enterica and Listeria at a relative low quantity. The two foodborne pathogens were inhibited in the <b>food</b> <b>model</b> with 1 % of the sodium acetate product.

To bett er understand the effect of surface irregularities, a white light interferometer was used to analyse the surface smoothness of beef-agar media and LSA plates.

In aqueous systems, protein cross-linking by microbial transglutaminase (MTG) was significantly improved when NaCl (1 - 2 g hg- 1) was added, but respective doses of CaCl 2 reduced gel strengths. As shown by emulsion model systems of PPI and SPI with oil/protein ratios of 1 and 2 g g- 1, emulsification of corn oil into aqueous protein suspensions prior to enzymatic cross-linking enhanced gel formation depending on the emulsification technique. The impact of NaCl and oil varied among the protein isolates as to obtainable maximum gel strengths and optimum doses of these ingredients.
