40|$|The two-loop electroweak bosonic {{correction}} to the muon {{lifetime and}} the MW–MZ interdependece is computed using analytical methods of asymptotic expansion. Combined with previous calculations this copmletes the full two-loop correction to ∆r in the Standard Model. The {{shift to the}} prediction of W-boson mass due to two-loop bosonic corrections does not exceed 1 MeV for the range of the Higgs mass from 100 to 1000 GeV. The <b>Fermi</b> <b>constant</b> GF {{plays an important role in}} the precision tests of the Standard Model. In the theory GF can be related to other precision observables: electroweak coupling constant α and masses of electroweak gauge bosons MZ and MW. Other parameters enter expression through quantum corrections. Usualy one inverts this relation to predict MW and confront it with experimental value M exp W. The current error (39 MeV) of M exp W will be drasticaly reduced at future colliders. In fact, at LHC the experimental error can be reduced to 15 MeV [1] and at Linear Collider even down to 6 MeV [2]. Therefore much efforts have been spent to reduce the error of theoretical prediction. <b>Fermi</b> <b>constant</b> is defined as a coupling constant in low energy four fermion effective lagrangian describing the decay of the muon LF = LQED + GF √ 2 [¯νµγ α (1 − γ 5) µ][ēγα(1 − γ 5) νe] (1) where e and µ are electron and muon fields, νe and νµ are corresponding neutrinos and GF is <b>Fermi</b> <b>constant.</b> From Lagrangian (1) one gets the value of the muon lifetime 1 τµ = G 2 F m 5...|$|E

Their {{good agreement}} tests the standard model at the ± 0. 1 % level and provides stringent constraints on new physics. That utility is illustrated for: heavy neutrino mixing, 2 Higgs doublet models, S, T, and U parameters and excited W ∗± bosons (Kaluza-Klein excitations). For the last of those examples, mW ∗ ∼> 2. 9 TeV is found. The <b>Fermi</b> <b>constant,</b> GF, is an important, venerable holdover from the old local theory of weak interactions [1].
