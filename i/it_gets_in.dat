She has {{appeared in}} several films, including City Slickers, Just Write, Toys and As Good as <b>It</b> <b>Gets.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, Smith performed her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled More at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting For Ophelia, which had its world premiere at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009.|$|E
5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older <b>it</b> <b>gets.</b> <b>In</b> general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these chemicals in crude oil {{is a result of}} the inclusion of biological material in the oil; these chemicals are released by kerogen during the production of hydrocarbon oils, as these are chemicals highly resistant to degradation and plausible chemical paths have been studied. Abiotic defenders state that biomarkers get into oil during its way up as <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> touch with ancient fossils. However a more plausible explanation is that biomarkers are traces of biological molecules from bacteria (archaea) that feed on primordial hydrocarbons and die in that environment. For example, hopanoids are just parts of the bacterial cell wall present in oil as contaminant.|$|E

500|$|The varying {{conditions}} in the magnetosphere, known as space weather, are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in.</b> Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic storms, can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can {{cause a lot of}} disruption; the [...] "Halloween" [...] storm of 2003 damaged {{more than a third of}} NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.|$|E
500|$|Mega Man 6 {{has enjoyed}} a {{favorable}} reception from gaming publications and websites. The graphics, play control, challenge level, and added power-ups were generally praised. GamePro was impressed {{with some of the}} newer enemies and larger mid-stage bosses, but was displeased with the game's recycling of Master Weapons seen in previous Mega Man games. Overall, the magazine described the graphics, audio, and level design in Mega Man 6 as standard fare for the franchise and called the game a [...] "rock of reliable NES fun" [...] in a series that is as [...] "predictable as the tide". Destructoid editor Tony Ponce considered Mega Man 6 the best game in the entire series. He argued that the game [...] "was retro before retro was cool" [...] due to Capcom's decision to develop it as a higher profile game on the NES during the era of fourth generation consoles. He also expressed appreciation for its music, introductions for each Robot Master, and the use of branching pathways in each level, among many other reasons. Nintendo Power listed Mega Man 6 as the best NES game of 1993, stating, [...] "His sixth NES adventure, in which he uses two new, Special Power-Ups, might just be his best". Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack also appreciated these innovations and regretted missing out on the game when it was first released. Mega Man 6 is listed by IGN as the 58th best game on the NES. The writers summarized, [...] "Mega Man 6 is {{considered by many to be}} the last worthwhile NES release in the catalog, and though that's not saying much when looking at the title's contemporaries, Mega Man 6 is still as good as <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> many respects." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hyson {{debuted in}} Extreme Championship Wrestling in August 1996, and gained fame as [...] "Little" [...] Spike Dudley, {{as a part}} of the Dudley family. His in-ring persona was that of the [...] "runt" [...] of the family. His {{initials}} (LSD) and finishing move (a corner-running three-quarters facelock bulldog named the [...] "Acid Drop") were both drug references and, at times, he would stare at his hands waving in front of him as if he were on a trip. He quickly gained the nickname [...] "The Giant Killer". A storyline with Bam Bam Bigelow saw him on the end of two pay-per-views defeats, however, at Hardcore Heaven and As Good as <b>it</b> <b>Gets.</b> <b>In</b> one memorable moment in not only Spike's career but in ECW history in general, Bam Bam Bigelow threw Spike from the ring, over the top rope, and into the crowd. The fans caught him and proceeded to body surf him around the ECW Arena. This incident was incorporated into the ECW TV introduction for years.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 March 1985, the Jesus and Mary Chain {{played a}} gig at the North London Polytechnic {{in front of}} one of their largest crowds up to that point. The {{organizers}} had overbooked the venue, leaving hundreds of fans locked outside. When Gillespie and Hart attempted to break the locks, the police were called. Support band Meat Whiplash had stirred up violence before the Mary Chain set foot onto the stage when singer Paul McDermott threw an empty wine bottle into the audience, prompting four members of the crowd to attack him, leading to their set being abandoned. Second act The Jasmine Minks got through their set without incident, but the Jesus and Mary Chain then kept the audience waiting for over an hour before taking the stage, and then left the stage after playing for less than twenty minutes. Members of the audience began throwing cans at where the band were hiding behind the stage curtains, before mounting the stage to smash the equipment that remained there. The violence continued for some time before police eventually took control. The venue blamed the band's late appearance and two equipment breakdowns, while McGee issued a statement saying that [...] "the audience were not smashing up the hall, they were smashing up pop music", going on to say [...] "This is truly art as terrorism". The violence soon started to become a hindrance to the band, with people attending concerts simply for the violence rather than the music, William commenting [...] "I hate it, I despise it. <b>It</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> the way in terms of getting more gigs, and <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>in</b> the way of our image". Many performances were cancelled during the remainder of 1985, with promoters or local councils not prepared to risk a riot. The violence flared up again at a performance at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town in September, with bottles thrown at the band while they played, and a section of the audience smashing up the amplification equipment and smashing the lights afterwards, with several people injured by flying glass. A major factor in the audience reaction was the length of the band's sets at the time, which lasted less than twenty-five minutes, Jim explaining this with [...] "there's never been a group good enough to play any longer". Lack of songs was also a factor, according to Jim: [...] "We've only got enough songs to play for that long".|$|E

Fear provokes investors to ask: How bad can <b>it</b> <b>get?,</b> while hope: How good can <b>it</b> <b>get?.</b> <b>In</b> this case, fear drives investors to enhance security, while hope stimulates investors to emphasise potential.|$|R
