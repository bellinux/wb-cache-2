5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} in computers began {{in high school}} when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where <b>engineering</b> <b>students</b> had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A programmable calculator in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design a calculator kit.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to internal competitions, {{there are multiple}} external competitions between several universities focused on different areas of study: in the Intermed medical students from different universities compete against each other, and in the Engenharíadas, <b>engineering</b> <b>students</b> gather to play sports.

5|$|Pratt's {{curriculum}} is narrower in scope, but still accommodates double majors {{in a variety}} of disciplines. The school emphasizes undergraduate research—opportunities for hands-on experiences arise through internships, fellowship programs, and the structured curriculum.

5|$|The Faculty of Administration Sciences was {{established}} on July 26, 1984, but its origins {{can be traced}} to the administration courses offered for <b>engineering</b> <b>students</b> since 1961. It offers the undergraduate programs of Bachelor of Business Administration, Accountancy, Commerce, and an Associate degree in Technology of Executive Management. It also offers graduate diplomas in Finances, Strategic Marketing, Quality and Productivity Administration, Public Administration, Public Management and Policies; and the master's degrees in Business Administration, Organization Sciences, and Public Policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{also home to}} the Royal Naval Engineering College; opened in 1880 in Keyham, it trained <b>engineering</b> <b>students</b> for five years before they {{completed}} the remaining {{two years of the}} course at Greenwich. The college closed in 1910, but in 1940 a new college opened at Manadon. This was renamed Dockyard Technical College in 1959 before finally closing in 1994; training was transferred to the University of Southampton.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, {{scholastic}} Greek organizations appeared on grounds. The university chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1908, promoting scholarship in all fields of study. Different schools had specific honor and professional societies as well: Phi Delta Phi for the law department, Phi Rho Sigma for medicine, Kappa Delta Mu for chemistry, and many others. A chapter of Theta Tau, an engineering society, was founded in 1923, and Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 as a local fraternity for <b>engineering</b> <b>students.</b> Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time, often fielding competing candidates for student office. Likewise in the College, the University Party and the Cavalier Party were dominated by Lambda Pi and Skull & Keys, two Greek organizations.|$|E

The university further collaborated with the National University of Singapore to set up The Logistics Institute–Asia Pacific in Singapore.

5|$|After Shepard left NASA, {{he served}} {{on the boards of}} many corporations. He also served as {{president}} of his umbrella company for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, Freedom 7 and Apollo 14). He made a fortune in banking and real estate. He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a member of Rotary, Kiwanis, the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati, and the American Fighter Aces, an honorary member of the Board of Directors for the Houston School for Deaf Children, and a director of the National Space Institute and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute. Together with the other surviving Mercury astronauts, and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom's widow, in 1984 Shepard founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships to science and <b>engineering</b> <b>students.</b> It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by former astronaut Jim Lovell.|$|E
5|$|After its closure the {{pumping station}} lay {{derelict}} {{until the late}} 1960s, when the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust proposed to the British Waterways Board that students from the University of Bath conduct a survey and report on the viability of returning the pumping station to working order. Work started in 1969 with <b>engineering</b> <b>students</b> from Bath providing the labour {{under the supervision of}} John Butt, and the Trust providing the funding. Within the building rotten woodwork was replaced and electric lighting installed. To work on the sluices and the waterwheel the leat was dammed. Specialist wood and metal work was undertaken by apprentices from the British Aircraft Corporation in Filton. By 1972 some progress had been made; John Butt retired and Derrick Dudden took over as restoration manager, with more volunteers from the Canal Trust helping to provide the labour. Silt was removed from the pond, hatches replaced and the waterwheel restored. The 408 oak teeth on the pitwheel were replaced and the pumps overhauled with new rope packing. By February 1976 all the machinery was working and water could be pumped from the river to the canal. The pumping station was formally re-opened in 1978.|$|E

5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil <b>engineering</b> <b>students</b> to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E
