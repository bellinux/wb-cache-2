Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> <b>Reckoning.</b> The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online.

5000|$|The 2003 State of the Union Address was {{a speech}} {{delivered}} by U.S. President George W. Bush, the 43rd United States President, on Tuesday, January 28, 2003. It outlined justifications for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It began {{his discussion of}} the [...] "war on terror" [...] by asserting, as he had before September 11, 2001, that [...] "the gravest danger facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical and biological weapons." [...] Of such regimes, that of Saddam Hussein was the worst, and [...] "a brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States." [...] In this context, Bush also said, [...] "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa," [...] a line which became a source of contention in the later Plame affair. The domestic brutality of Hussein and the benefits of liberty and freedom for the Iraqi people were briefly noted {{near the end of the}} speech. He began with, [...] "In all these <b>days</b> <b>of</b> promise and <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>reckoning,</b> we can be confident. In a whirlwind of change and hope and peril, our faith is sure, our resolve is firm, and our union is strong." [...] In the middle of the speech, he said, [...] "In Afghanistan, we helped liberate an oppressed people. And we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children — boys and girls."He ended with, [...] "Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity." [...] He spoke to the 108th United States Congress.|$|R
2500|$|An {{example of}} the textual {{argument}} is given by North in his comparison of [...] with [...] The first passage establishes the timing, in days, for the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), while the second prescribes the timing, in years, for the Jubilee. In the first passage, the start of counting for the Festival of Weeks {{is said to be}} [...] "the day after the Sabbath" [...] (mimaharat ha-shabat, [...] ), and is to end [...] "the day after the seventh Sabbath" [...] (mimaharat ha-shabat ha-sheviyit, [...] ). These seven weeks would constitute 49 days in most modern methods <b>of</b> <b>reckoning.</b> Nevertheless, verse 16 says that they are to be reckoned as 50 <b>days.</b> This method <b>of</b> <b>reckoning</b> (sometimes called [...] "inclusive numbering") is fairly common in Scripture; for example, the Feast of Tabernacles is to last for seven days (...) , but the last day is called the eighth day (v. 36). North found this comparison between Leviticus 23 (Feast of Weeks) and Leviticus 25 (Jubilees) to be [...] "the strongest possible support for the forty-ninth year" [...] as the Jubilee year. His conclusion that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year was followed by Lefebvre, for this as well as additional reasons.|$|R

40|$|For some analysts, today’s {{representations}} of apocalypse are simply {{the latest version}} of a “pervasive sense of doom” that has characterized human civilization for millennia. 2 For others, in the context of current environmental problems, a sense of impending disaster expresses a scientifically supported assessment of today’s “risk society. ” Anthony Giddens argues that “[d]oomsday is no longer a religious concept, a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> spiritual <b>reckoning,</b> but a possibility imminent in our society and economy. ” 3 Our argument is that the current fascination {{with the end of the}} world is best understood neither as a near-timeless feature of human culture nor as a reasoned response to objective environmental problems. Rather it is driven by unconscious fantasy; the symbolic expression of an alienation from political subjectivity, characteristic of a historically specific period in the life of post–Cold War societies. With the script of the real apocalypse already written through scientific projections, how do environmental discourse and popular culture represent people? We will first consider recent critiques of the use of apocalypticism in environmental discourse, then examine elite uses of eco-apocalypse in political discourse, and finally discuss two films that envisage a world destroyed by catastrophic climate change: The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and The Age of Stupid (2009) ...|$|R

Our ability to respond to other international crises is constrained. A majority of the American people are soured on the war.

2500|$|In 1985, {{the band}} finally {{released}} their first full-length studio album, featuring the [...] "Death Row" [...] material and lineup of Liebling on vocals, Griffin on guitar, Swaney on bass and Rose on drums.

The album contained a mix of new songs and 1970s-era songs, as did all of the following Pentagram albums. The record's heavier sound and obscure lyrical themes helped cement Pentagram's {{reputation as one of the}} pioneers of the classic doom metal style.

2500|$|The American {{historian}} Gordon A. Craig {{complained that}} of Irving's double standard in Hitler's War [...] of crediting {{all of the}} German victories to the Führer while blaming all of the German defeats {{in the war on}} Hitler's unworthy and incompetent generals. Craig wrote that in his opinion some of Irving's language was inappropriate, such as Irving's remark that [...] "Hitler was cheated of the ultimate winter victory", and that Irving totally ignored Hitler's own incompetence as a military leader. Craig charged that it was simply wrong on the part of Irving to write that Hitler in October 1941 {{was in a state of}} pain over German losses on the Eastern Front with Hitler supposedly thinking [...] "What would be left of Germany and the flower of her manhood?" [...] As a way of rebuttal to this picture of Hitler, Craig quoted Hitler's remark later in 1941 when told of heavy German losses, [...] "But that's what the young people are there for!". Like many other historians, Craig was critical of Irving using the [...] "no liquidation" [...] comment in Himmler's telephone logbook from 30 November 1941 to prove that Hitler was opposed to the Holocaust. Citing Lucy Dawidowicz, Craig argued the phrase [...] "no liquidation" [...] referred only to Dr. Jekelius. Finally, to prove that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust, Craig quoted Hitler's remark to the Czechoslovak foreign minister in January 1939 that [...] "We are going to destroy the Jews!...The <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>reckoning</b> has come!" [...] plus the broad hints that Hitler dropped in his speeches of 30 January 1941; 30 January 1942; 24 February 1942; 30 September 1942, and 8 November 1942 that he knew of the Holocaust. Finally, Craig cited Himmler's remark of May 1944 where he stated he had orders from an unnamed higher authority (who Craig argued could only be Hitler) for the [...] "Final Solution." ...|$|E

5000|$|After a {{great deal}} of touring in both the US and Europe, The Showdown went back to the studio to record their second full length album. This album took a {{different}} direction trading in the screaming double-bassing death metal for a more southern approach mixed with elements of their older style such as heavy guitar riffs, some screams (although not as dominated by them), and distinct bass and drum lines, drawing also from 1980s to early 1990s-era metal like Pantera, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, and Metallica. In the fall of 2006, The Showdown joined the Christian rock/alternative band Pillar on The <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Reckoning</b> tour. The tour lasted from mid-October through November 2006 and also featured Christian rock bands <b>Day</b> <b>of</b> Fire and Decyfer Down. In late 2006, after completing the album, Andrew announced he was leaving the band(and possibly to pursue a career in professional wrestling). Andrew was soon replaced by another Andrew - A.J. Barrette of Still Remains. Although the album was already completed, The Showdown along with A.J. hit the studio once more to record the track [...] "Head Down" [...] which would be added to the album before its release. The completed album, Temptation Come My Way was released on February 20, 2007. Unknown to the public until release, two different versions were released, one with the song [...] "Fanatics and Whores", and one without, probably to avoid controversy in the Christian market. This upset many fans who had pre-ordered the CD and received the incomplete album, even though most distributors listed the song in their track listing. Temptation Come My Way received high popularity in the underground culture, and The Showdown was soon signed on March 21 of 2007 to play at Ozzfest 07.|$|R
