Fire retardant treatment "FUKAM" was studied to estimate {{its effect on the}} probability of wood ignition. The wind speed and the number and geometric sizes of particles were varied in the experiments. The results have shown that the increase in the wind speed leads to the increase in the probability of wood ignition by the particles of the same size, and <b>fire-retardant</b> <b>treatment</b> significantly increases the protective properties of wood exposed to smoldering pine bark particles...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{has been}} used for {{building}} facades to enhance the aesthetic design of buildings since the revision to the evaluation method associated with the amendment of the Building Standard Law of Japan in 2000. In response, wood that has been pressure-impregnated with fire retardants (fire-retardant treated wood) is often used to ensure it is safe {{in the event of a}} fire. Currently, when fire-retardant-treated wood is tested for certification of reaction to fire performance, a cone calorimeter test is conducted in Japan. This test applies radiant heat to the surface of a square specimen, 100 [*]mm each side, immediately after it has undergone <b>fire-retardant</b> <b>treatment.</b> However, when applying <b>fire-retardant</b> <b>treatment</b> to wood, aqueous chemical injection is the standard procedure. When wood is actually used to construct a building, there is a concern about environmental forces such as wind and rain that could cause the wood to deteriorate, and concerns about performance degradation associated with aging. One of the past studies in Japan [1] conducted a cone calorimeter test after an outdoor exposure test and accelerated weathering test, compared the post-test performance with the initial performance and confirmed the amount of remaining fire retardant in the treated wood had been reduced. However, no comparison of the fireproof performance of fire-retardant wood in actual use in a building facade had been conducted in Japan. There have been already valuable researches [e. g. 2, 3] on this issue internationally, but this paper is the first step in Japan and authors hope to focus on the wooden façade construction technique and the standard façade test in Japan...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{the natural}} {{materials}} become popular building material for houses, buildings and recreational property. The risk of fires in residential timber construction or eco houses cannot be completely ruled out, therefore {{there is a}} need for proper and correct implementing preventive measures and application of all available solutions, which may reduce the risk of fire as far as possible, to slow down the combustion process, to protect the life of people, animals and also the building itself until arrival members of the Fire and Rescue Services. Fireproofing of combustible materials is a specific area of fire protection. For scientific research as well as for real-life practice, not only their structural and physical properties, but also fire-technical characteristics are really important. The present researchers mostly focus on <b>fire-retardant</b> <b>treatment</b> of wood that is why the authors of this contribution focused on a different combustible material.

40|$|Wood-based {{composites}} {{represent a}} continuously increasing {{share of the}} wood products market. Commercial construction will be important for future expansion of the structural panels market. Use of engineered wood products {{as an alternative to}} traditional solid wood lumber is also increasing. A recent series of cone calorimeter tests evaluated the performance of several composite rim board materials, including three oriented strandboard (OSB) products, a com-ply product, a laminated veneer lumber product, plywood, and lumber. Although initial behavior was similar, the 300 -s average heat release rates of the three OSB products were higher than those of the other products. Other results from the FPL cone calorimeter database for wood composites are also reviewed. With increased use of wood composites, the market for <b>fire-retardant</b> <b>treatments</b> of composites is likely to increase. <b>Fire-retardant</b> <b>treatments</b> for wood composites are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Impregnating {{wood with}} {{certain types of}} {{chemicals}} can substantially extend its service life in degrading, destructive environments. This type of treatment can extend the utility of wood in new markets. This happened in North America, where fire-retardanttreated (FRT) plywood is sometimes permitted {{as an alternative to}} noncombustible materials in structures that require increased fire safety. However, in the mid- to late 1980 s, some commercial <b>fire-retardant</b> <b>treatments</b> failed to perform as expected when used in roof sheathing plywood and roof truss lumber. Elevated roof temperatures caused by solar radiation, in combination with moisture, prematurely activated some fire retardants chemicals, often causing the treated plywood to darken in color, become brittle, experienc...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a test method and predictive model to estimate the residual bending strength of fire-retardant-treated plywood roof sheathing from measurement of screw-withdrawal force. The preferred test methodology is described in detail. Models were developed to predict loss in mean and lower prediction bounds for plywood bending strength as a function of a screw-withdrawal force. Our analysis of fire-retardant-treated plywood from three different studies, each with various fire-retardant-treatment, processing, plywood thickness, and exposure temperature groupings, clearly indicated that different fire-retardant-treatments and plywood thicknesses could not be grouped into a single "universal" model. Nevertheless, some grouping was possible; parameter estimates for several grouped fire-retardant formulations and plywood thicknesses are reported for mean trends and lower prediction boundaries. Although the models were shown to acceptably predict plywood bending strength, additional work is needed to expand these models to address the effects of plywood quality, wood temperature, and moisture content at time of test.

Best overall performance was from joints made with 6 d hot-dipped galvanized nails; 6 d monel nails were next best. Although results from several types of fasteners used in treated wood and exposed in cold and standard conditions were as good as results obtained from untreated controls, most specimens exposed in warm, humid conditions were reduced in strength; some were reduced to zero strength...|$|R
30|$|<b>Fire-retardant</b> <b>treatments</b> of wood {{products}} {{are designed to}} reduce their flammability. The common method of introducing fire retardants in wood or plywood is through soaking or pressure impregnation [1, 2]. The surface coating of resins with fire retardants {{was found to be}} an effective and economical method of improving fire endurance [3, 4]. Such a surface treatment method can remove infusion and re-drying process, reduce the cost of the process and is applicable to any species because of no permeability limit. Based on their fire preventive effect, bond strength and formaldehyde emission, Kawarasaki et al. [3] selected some fire retardants mixed with melamine formaldehyde resin (MF) or urea–formaldehyde resin (UF) to examine their influence on fire preventive of plywood. The results showed that intumescent fire retardant (IFR) using ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as the catalyst, pentaerythritol as the carbonific material, and dicyanodiamide or azodicarbonamids as the blowing agent mixed with MF adhesive was a suitable surface treatment.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was an {{inventory}} of fire retardant treated wood, fire-retardanttreatments, properties, and use in different applications, and to analyze the possibilitiesfor the future. The project was funded by TCN – Träcentrum Norr. Expected industrialbenefit was an update of knowledge for wooden buildings. Fire retardant treatments can improve the reaction to fire properties of wood and thehighest fire classifications for combustible products can be reached, for example class Bs 1,d 0. This means that visible wood surfaces {{can be used in}} higher and larger buildings. Fire retardant treatment has no or very limited effect on the fire resistance of structuralelements, as the charring rate is hardly changed. One exception is intumescent fireretardant paints that swell and may postpone charring and thus increase the fireresistance. However, the improved fire behavior of many fire retardant treated woodproducts deteriorates over time, especially at outdoor use due to leaching. A system ofdurability classes has been developed as a complement to fire classes and makes itpossible for potential users to find reliable products for different uses. Fire retardanttreated wood products can maintain their properties after accelerated and/or natural agingif the retention levels are high enough, but many products are losing their firecharacteristics during aging. Paint systems are usually needed at exterior applications tomaintain the fire performance properties. The main use of fire retardant treated wood is asvisible wood surfaces indoors, such as in escape routes, apartments in high-rise buildings,public buildings and sports arenas. Documentation of long-term properties should beincluded to support the use of reliable fire-retardant wood, especially important forproducts to be used outdoors.
