25|$|Water {{is drawn}} {{in through the}} mouth by closing the {{operculum}} (gill cover), and enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over the gills. The mouth cavity then contracts inducing {{the closure of the}} passive oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth (Fig. 23). The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the <b>inhalatory</b> phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as suction pump and pressure pump to maintain a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction. Since the blood in the lamellar capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower diagram in Fig.22). Oxygen is therefore able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water. Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas {{from one side of the}} exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.|$|E

5000|$|Although CNH is {{typically}} {{characterized by the}} presence of lesions in the brainstem region, the mechanism by which these lesions create uninhibited stimulation of the expiratory and <b>inhalatory</b> centers is still poorly understood. These lesions typically arise after cancerous cells from another location of the body metastasize and move to the brain. The mechanism by which CNH was originally thought to occur involved the separation of the pontine and medullary respiratory centers by infiltrative tumors. Animal models mimicking this separation, however, do not exhibit CNH. [...] A secondary postulated mechanism by which CNH may function is that the lesions produce lactate which consequently serves as a stimulator for the chemoreceptors of the medullary region of the brainstem. Previous studies of CNH patients have verified the presence of lactic acid in cerebral spinal fluid.|$|E
50|$|The retching {{phase is}} {{characterized}} by a series of violent spasmodic abdomino-thoracic contractions with the glottis closed. During this time, the inspiratory (<b>inhalatory)</b> movements of the chest wall and diaphragm are opposed by the expiratory contractions of the abdominal musculature. At the same time, movements of the stomach and its contents take place. Whereas a patient will complain of disagreeable sensations during nausea, speech is not possible during retching. The characteristic movements furnish a ready diagnostic sign of the retching phase. Schindler (1937) studied retching on two occasions during gastroscopy and noted that longitudinal folds appeared in the previously smooth antrum, thickened quickly, came together and completely closed the antrum. Retching involves a deep inspiration against a closed glottis. This, along with contraction of the abdomen, leads to a pressure difference between the abdominal and thoracic cavities. As a result, the stomach and gastric contents are displaced upwards toward the thoracic cavity.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is a review of the data in the {{literature}} on the transdermal and <b>inhalatory</b> routes of opioid administration. The majority of the published experience is based on the use of transdermal and <b>inhalatory</b> opioids for the management of postoperative pain. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that transdermal fentanyl is well absorbed although there is a considerable delay in reaching steady state plasma level and also a slowly declining plasma concentration after removal of the transdermal patch. Clinical experience suggests that it is well-tolerated. There is very limited knowledge about the absorption and pharmacokinetics of morphine when given by the <b>inhalatory</b> route. A better understanding of the absorption and pharmacokinetics of different nebulized opioids is needed before reliable clinical trials can be designed on these drugs.

40|$|Background: Chronic upper {{respiratory}} tract infections (cURTI) are very frequent illnesses which occur at any age of life. In elderly, cURTI are complicated by immunosenescence, with involvement of lung immune responsiveness. Results: In the present study, 51 elderly (age range: 66 - 86) and 51 young (age range 24 - 58) cURTI patients underwent a single cycle (two weeks) of <b>inhalatory</b> therapy with salt-bromide-iodine thermal water in the thermal station "Margherita di Savoia" (Margherita di Savoia, BAT, Italy). Peripheral blood serum cytokines and clinical assessment were performed before therapy (T 0) and after six months (T 1) and 12 months (T 2) from <b>inhalatory</b> treatment. In both elderly and young patients, at baseline an increased release of T helper (h) 1 -related cytokines [interleukin (IL) - 2 and interferon-γ] and of Th 2 -related cytokine (IL- 4) was documented. <b>Inhalatory</b> treatment reduced the excessive secretion of all the above-cited cytokines. IL- 10 values were above normality at all times considered in both groups of patients. In addition, an increase in IL- 17 and IL- 21 serum levels following therapy was observed in both groups of patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8 and tumor necrosis factor-α) baseline values were lower than normal values at T 0 in both elderly and young cURTI patients. Their levels increased following <b>inhalatory</b> treatment. Clinically, at T 2 a dramatic reduction of frequency of {{upper respiratory}} tract infections was recorded in both groups of patients. Conclusion: Thermal water inhalation is able to modulate systemic immune response in elderly and young cURTI patients, thus reducing excessive production of Th 1 and Th 2 -related cytokines, on the one hand. On the other hand, increased levels of IL- 21 (an inducer of Th 17 cells) and of IL- 17 may {{be interpreted as a}} protective mechanism, which likely leads to neutrophil recruitment in cURTI patients. Also restoration of pro-inflammatory cytokine release following <b>inhalatory</b> therapy may result in microbe eradication. Quite importantly, the maintenance of high levels of IL- 10 during the follow-up would suggest a consistent regulatory role of this cytokine in attenuating the pro-inflammatory arm of the immune response...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to describe and}} discuss the current and proposed European occupational health policy on two categories of substances that pose serious effects: those potentially carcinogenic or genotoxic and those with toxic effects on reproduction. The precautionary principle was applied to setting standards for the workplace for those two categories of substances, to give an impression of the resulting limit values {{and the consequences of}} the implementation of this precautionary principle. A pragmatic approach was chosen as this starts with substantial indications of health risks. For the suspected carcinogenic or genotoxic substances 0. 1 mg/m 3 as a precautionary occupational exposure limit (precautionary OEL) is proposed. For the substances suspected of causing reproductive toxicity the precautionary OEL was derived in three ways, depending on the availability of data and of a current Dutch workplace standard (MAC, maximum accepted concentration) : (a) by calculation based on available <b>inhalatory</b> animal data on the risks of reproductive toxicity; (b) by adding a safety factor of 10 to the current MAC, if no <b>inhalatory</b> animal data on reproductive toxicity are available; (c) by using 0. 1 mg/m 3 as precautionary OEL for substances suspected of having reproductive toxicity but without <b>inhalatory</b> animal data on reproductive toxicity and without a MAC...|$|E

METHODS: Five volunteers (two men and three women) were dermally exposed to vaporised and liquid ME and EE. Dermal exposure on {{an area of}} about 1000 cm 2 (forearm and hand) to vapours of ME and EE (4000 mg/m 3 ME and 3700 mg/m 3 EE) lasted for 45 minutes. Duration of exposure to liquid ME and EE on an area of 27 cm 2 (forearm) was 15 minutes. Dermal uptake was assessed by measurement of the main metabolites in urinary methoxyacetic acid (MAA) and ethoxyacetic acid (EAA). For each volunteer, excretion of metabolites was compared with a reference <b>inhalatory</b> exposure. RESULTS: Mean (SD) absorption rates of ME and EE vapour were 36 (11) and 19 (6) cm/h respectively. The mean (SD) absorption rates of the liquid ME and EE amounted to 2. 9 (2. 0) and 0. 7 (0. 3) mg/cm 2. h. CONCLUSIONS: Vaporised and liquid ME and EE are readily absorbed through the skin.

40|$|Local {{lymph node}} {{activation}} and increased total serum IgE levels are suggested to be predictive parameters of airway hypersensitivity caused by {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) chemicals. Whether increases of total serum IgE are indicative of actual induction of specific airway reactions (morphological and functional) after inhalation challenge was examined in the present study. In Brown Norway (BN) and Wistar rats, serum IgE concentrations were examined following topical exposure of chemicals with known diverse sensitization potential in humans: trimellitic anhydride (TMA), a dermal and respiratory sensitizer; dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), a dermal sensitizer with no known potential to cause respiratory allergy; and methyl salicylate, a skin irritant devoid of sensitizing properties. Functional and histopathological changes in the respiratory tract were examined after subsequent <b>inhalatory</b> challenge with these chemicals. Of the three tested chemicals, only topical exposure to TMA resulted in {{a significant increase in}} total serum IgE concentrations in the high-IgE-responding BN rat. Upon subsequent <b>inhalatory</b> challenge of these rats, TMA induced specific airway reactions which included a sharp decrease in respiratory rate during challenge, followed by an increase in breathing rate with a concomitant decrease in tidal volume 24 and 48 h after <b>inhalatory</b> challenge, and histopathological changes in the larynx and lungs of animals necropsied 48 h after challenge. Interestingly, despite low IgE levels, TMA induced histopathological changes in the larynx and lungs of Wistar rats too. Laryngeal changes were also observed in Wistar rats upon sensitization and challenge with DNCB. These data suggest that increased total serum IgE after topical sensitization is associated with immediate-type specific airway reactivity after inhalation challenge in BN rats and thus may be a valuable parameter in testing for respiratory sensitization potential of LMW compounds. Histopathological examination upon subsequent inhalation challenge of sensitized low-IgE-responders may provide information on other allergic inflammatory airway reactions...|$|E

The descriptors "crying", "inhalation", "aerosol", "work of breathing" and "child", in Portuguese and in English, were applied. Data synthesis: 13 studies were selected, 12 in English and one in Portuguese. Most studies reported the effects of inhalation therapy in children, without discussing {{the influence of}} crying and breathing patterns on the deposition of the medication. Studies related to this subject found that the respiratory pattern, especially the cry, reduces the amount of drug that reaches the peripheral airways.

In a two-year <b>inhalatory</b> study in rats (highest dose tested: 483 mg/m 3) no signs of systemic toxicity or carcinogenicity are observed. Dose-related changes are observed in the nasal mucosas. The lowest dose tested (54 mg/m 3 = 15 ppm) induces a slight effect on the respiratory and olfactory nasal mucose. Me-acr induces mutations and chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells in vitro.

Four hours after welding dyspnea appeared and 22 h later he was admitted at the Emergency Department due to severe respiratory insufficiency with pO 2 = 6. 7 kPa. Chest X-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltration. Pulmonary function and gas diffusion tests revealed a severe restriction (55 % of predictive volume) and impaired diffusion capacity (47 % of predicted capacity). Toxic interstitial pneumonitis was diagnosed and high-dose systemic corticosteroid methylprednisolone and <b>inhalatory</b> corticosteroid fluticasone therapy was started. Computed Tomography (CT) of the lungs showed a diffuse patchy ground-glass opacity with no signs of small airway disease associated with interstitial pneumonitis.

Both Palythoa spp. and Ostreopsis spp. contain congeners of palytoxin, a highly potent toxin whose inhalation hazard is however unknown. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of high levels of palytoxins (palytoxin and hydroxypalytoxin) in both soft coral and seawater from a home marine aquarium involved in the poisoning of a whole family. Due to the high toxin levels found in seawater, a procedure for a rapid and efficient determination of palytoxin in seawater was set-up.

The granulomas were observed in the lungs, associated with respiratory insufficiency leading to death, in the hilum lymph nodes and liver. Diagnosis was done after {{a search of the}} occupational background of the patients followed by chemical and histochemical identification of the inhaled dusts within the lesions (morin and chromotropic acid methods and atomic absortion spectrophotometry) and experimental production of the disease in guinea-pigs. The harmful effects of titanium are not restricted to its dioxide, or to the <b>inhalatory</b> route. Different types of ceramic used in human implants and prostheses and the textile and aerospace industries use titanium.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To compare {{complications}} during induction, maintenance, {{recovery and}} post-operative period with sevoflurane and propofol. Methods: In this randomized study, {{a total of}} fifty children, American Soci-ety of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) status I or II, were assigned randomly to intravenous propofol(Group P) or <b>inhalatory</b> sevoflurane group(Group S). N 2 O was used in both groups. Complications were observed and noted during induction, maintenance and recovery. A chi- square {{test was used to}} determine statistical significance of complications data. Results: No significant differences were detected in age, sex and ASA grading between two groups.

40|$|Abstract The {{upper airway}} {{respiratory}} diseases (i. e. common cold, allergic rhinitis, nonallergic/vasomotor rhinitis, acute and chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis) in which nasal congestion {{is a common}} symptom are often undertreated due to the frequent inadequate efficacy and safety concern with current therapies. In scientific literature, few studies seem to {{support the hypothesis that}} nasal <b>inhalatory</b> treatment with thermal water promotes the improvement of nasal symptoms, even if the mechanisms by which the improvement from SPA therapy can be expected remain debated. A prospective comparative study with a pre-post design has been performed consecutively enrolling 33 (males 70...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} {{breathing}} {{can be used as}} a cue to turn-taking behaviour. The paper improves on ex- isting accounts by considering all possible transitions between speaker states (silent, speaking, backchanneling) and by not re- lying on global speaker models. Instead, all features (including breathing range and resting expiratory level) are estimated in an incremental fashion using the left-hand context. We identify several <b>inhalatory</b> features relevant to turn-management, and as- sess the fit of models with these features as predictors of turn- taking behaviour.  the Swedish Research Council project 2014 - 1072 Andning i samtal (Breathing in conversation...|$|E
