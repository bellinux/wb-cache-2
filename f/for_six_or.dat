5|$|Waldron {{went on to}} {{work with}} Ike Quebec in New York in 1950 and made his {{recording}} debut with the saxophonist in 1952. They played at Café Society Downtown on Mondays <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> seven months, which helped Waldron gain exposure and more work. Waldron worked frequently with Charles Mingus from 1954 to 1956, {{as part of the}} latter's jazz composers' workshop. He was pianist on several Mingus recordings, including Pithecanthropus Erectus, which was a key development in the movement towards freer collective improvisation in jazz. In 1955, Waldron worked with Lucky Millinder and Lucky Thompson. Waldron formed his own band in 1956, which consisted of Idrees Sulieman (trumpet), Gigi Gryce (alto saxophone), Julian Euell (bass), and Arthur Edgehill (drums). This band recorded Waldron's first release as a leader, Mal-1, in November of that year. Waldron was Billie Holiday's regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959, including for the all-star television broadcast The Sound of Jazz.|$|E
5|$|Xenogears {{composer}} Yasunori Mitsuda {{announced plans}} to create an album of orchestral arrangements of music from that game on October 6, 2010, via his Twitter account. Mitsuda had previously released two albums of music from the game, both in 1998, the year the game was released—Xenogears Original Soundtrack, a soundtrack album for the game, and Creid, an album of arranged music inspired by Celtic folk music and Japanese rock. He {{has said that he}} decided to make the album due to the emotions that he and fans still felt about the game 13 years after its release, which led him to want to commemorate that. The music of Xenogears is particularly close to Mitsuda, as it was the last soundtrack that he worked on for Square Enix—the first video game company he worked for—and he knew that he would be leaving when he composed the soundtrack for the game. He has said that he had been considering the idea of a Xenogears orchestral album <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> seven years prior to starting on it, but until then did not have both the opportunity to work on the project and the confidence in his own abilities as an orchestrator to make the album sound as he wished.|$|E

In 1725 his serenata Antonio e Cleopatra, was performed at Naples; the principal roles were sung by Carlo Broschi, better known as Farinelli, and Vittoria Tesi. The success of this work not only earned Hasse many commissions from Naples's opera houses, but also, according to Johann Joachim Quantz, brought him into contact with Alessandro Scarlatti, who became his teacher and friend; Hasse also altered his style in several respects to reflect that of Scarlatti.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, the New York Post {{reported}} that several sanitation workers confessed that cleanup was intentionally slowed down {{to protest the}} aforementioned budget cuts.

Allegations were also made that sanitation workers slept on the job, hung out at a doughnut shop for 11 straight hours while on the job, and drank beer <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> seven hours while on the job. Claims were also made that supervisors encouraged such work stoppages. However, a month later, the New York Times reported that the allegations of a slowdown remained unsubstantiated and that Councilman Daniel Halloran, who had originally reported the confessions, had not named his sources.|$|E

However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever {{consumed}} food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to the telling) which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother {{for the rest of the}} year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth.

His mobile style of play, in which he provided support to his defencemen by coming out of the goal area to play the puck was revolutionary, and inspired future generations of goaltenders, such as Martin Brodeur. He was also known for being one of the NHL's most aggressive goaltenders: he was suspended <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>or</b> more games on three occasions, had more than 100penalty minutes in each of his first three seasons, and set new records for the number of [...] penalty minutes recorded by a goaltender in the NHL.|$|E
