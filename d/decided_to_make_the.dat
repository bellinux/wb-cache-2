5|$|Darko Pančev got {{his prize}} for 1990–91 season later, only in 2006, {{following}} a protest from Cyprus where a player supposedly scored 40 goals (though the official topscorers for the season, Suad Beširević and Panayiotis Xiourouppas, are listed with 19 goals each). Due to this affair, France Football <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> competition unofficial.|$|E
5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> August tour their last.|$|E
5|$|As {{required}} by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into the Catholic {{faith in the}} Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence. By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he felt compelled to make a public profession of faith, perhaps {{on the floor of}} the United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> profession among those who knew him best in Texas.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film a prequel {{as he did}} not want the Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the film's final storyline. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacements, with the screenplay partly based upon the 1939 film Gunga Din.|$|E
5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors {{from the}} Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film in English to appeal to a wider {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.|$|E
5|$|General Mack {{thought that}} Austrian {{security}} relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous Black Forest area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack {{believed that there}} would be no action in Central Germany. Mack <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.|$|E
50|$|Gold Pack {{introduces}} notable {{changes to}} the difficulty setting. The player choosing an advanced difficulty level may also <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> player turns timed and whether to disallow saving during combat, {{as opposed to the}} original Jagged Alliance 2, which set these settings automatically.|$|R

Worried that the disruption will ruin his wedding announcement, he <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> audience believe that the Constable {{is part of the}} play.|$|R
50|$|The scheme backfires when {{promoter}} Larry Herman {{takes a look}} at Bob's {{film and}} <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> skater a star. Unfortunately, it's actually amateur (and illegal immigrant) Marie Bergin in the newsreel footage, not the great figure skater from Switzerland. Chaos ensues as Bob tries to straighten everybody out.|$|R
5|$|In 1980, Nancy Fink, a Brooklyn Law School professor, {{was elected}} as the congregation's first female president. Fink called a full {{membership}} meeting in 1982 {{to decide whether}} women could lead the services, blow the shofar (the rams-horn trumpet blown on the High Holidays), and whether daughters of kohanim (hereditary priests) could give the priestly blessing. Advised by Scheindlin, the congregation <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> services fully egalitarian, allowing women to perform all three functions.|$|E
5|$|In July 1986, Peterson {{offered a}} free flattop haircut {{to anyone who}} {{attended}} the opening of his third store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson, who got his first flattop haircut in 1952, hired three barbers to give haircuts {{on the floor of}} his showrooms. They gave about 50 haircuts the first day, and Peterson <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> gimmick a weekly event. He continued offering the haircuts for two decades and as of 2002 was still giving away about ten haircuts per week.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{development}} was funded personally by Jensen and Patti along with Danish government grants, including {{funding from the}} Nordic Game Program, while large investors were sought later in the development cycle. Jensen and Patti {{did not want to}} commit to major publishers, preferring to retain full creative control in developing the title. Jensen originally planned to release Limbo as a free Microsoft Windows title, but by this point, Jensen and Patti <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game a retail title.|$|E

5|$|The Simpson {{family first}} {{appeared}} as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and {{assumed that the}} figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, {{which led to the}} crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> characters yellow.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{struggled in}} devising gameplay features {{that would be}} enjoyed by the fans of the series. One of the hardest tasks chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki was assigned {{to do was to}} attract people who had no prior experience with the series; he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> gameplay as simple as possible. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto presented the staff with a variety of opinions which they in turn would have to incorporate into the game the best way possible. Miyamoto let the team decide which graphics they wanted to use without restrictions.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E

50|$|After being blackballed from Hollywood {{because of}} his drunken antics, Danny Roane, a washed up TV actor, sobers up to direct his first feature film. As the {{pressure}} builds, Roane turns to the bottle again and attempts to finish his movie about drug and alcohol abuse. But in his drunken madness, he <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film a musical.|$|R
5|$|David Wallace {{comes to}} the Scranton branch and says that the client was so pleased with the {{discount}} that they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> company their exclusive provider of office supplies. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up {{a conference call with}} the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E

5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> movie himself.|$|E
5|$|The Bank of the United States was {{established}} by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale, and sought to open a branch in Boston. Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts, and Gore <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> move. He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank, and became {{a director of the}} Boston branch of the U.S. Bank. He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank, a relatively large investment. Gore was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch, and sought to merge state-chartered banks into the organization, arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service. Gore resigned from the board in 1794, citing the demands of his law practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed {{to show off}} the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost in the Foyer, ghosts playing cards in the Parlor, ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi standing outside the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E
50|$|Cummins {{began his}} career riding in the British Championship and the Virgin Mobile Yamaha R6 Cup. However, the lack of {{opportunities}} in these competitions led him <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> switch <b>to</b> road racing. 'The more I raced I realised {{it was time to}} switch over to pure roads and it's a decision I've not regretted once', he commented.|$|R
50|$|Making {{a switch}} {{involves}} cutting {{it from the}} stem and removing twigs or directly attached leaves. For optimal flexibility, it is cut fresh shortly before use, rather than keeping it for re-use over time. Some parents <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> cutting of a switch an additional form of punishment for a child, by requiring the disobedient child to cut his/her own switch.|$|R
