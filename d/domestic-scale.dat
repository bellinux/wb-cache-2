40|$|Solar {{water heater}} {{is the most}} popular means of solar energy {{utilization}} because of technological feasibility and economic attraction compared with other kinds of solar energy utilization. Earlier assessments of <b>domestic-scale</b> solar water heaters were based on the first thermodynamic law. However, this kind of assessment cannot perfectly describe the performance of solar water heaters, since the essence of energy utilization is to extract available energy as much as possible. So, it is necessary to evaluate <b>domestic-scale</b> solar water heaters based on the second thermodynamic law. No matter the technology process, from the property of energy utilization perspective, we can separate the technology process into three intimately related sub-procedures, namely conversion procedure, utilization procedure, and recycling procedure. An energy analysis entitled 'Three Procedure Theory' can be conveniently conducted as presented by Professor Hua Ben. Compared with other theories of energy analysis, three procedure theory exhibits great advantages. The utilization procedure puts forth requirement for the design of parameters in conversion procedure and sets up limits in the consideration of recycling procedure. Of course, under specific conditions, the utilization procedure also receives feedback from other procedures. Three procedure theory furnishes us a good platform to perform energy analysis. The study in this paper is based on three procedure theory. Exergy analysis is conducted with the aim of providing some methods to save cost and keep the efficiency of <b>domestic-scale</b> solar water heater to desired extent {{and at the same time}} figuring out related exergy losses. From this survey, it is shown that for an ordinary thermally insulated <b>domestic-scale</b> solar water heater, Dju (exergy losses due to imperfectly thermal insulation in collector) and DjR (exergy losses due to imperfectly thermal insulation in storage barrel) cannot be avoided. Dku (exergy losses due to irreversibility in collector) is mainly caused by irreversibility of heat transfer and DkR (exergy losses due to irreversibility in storage barrel) is dominated by the mixing of water at different temperature. Dku acts as the driving force for the system while DkR is of little contribution. A good design of storage barrel with little DkR will go a long way in improving exergy efficiency. An equation for computing DkR is presented. For the collector, which is the core of the <b>domestic-scale</b> solar water heater, a judicious choice of width of plate W and layer number of cover is necessary. We define collector exergy efficiency [eta]xc to be [eta]xc=Exo/Exu. The relation between collector exergy efficiency and width of plate together with layer number of cover is also analysed. <b>Domestic-scale</b> solar water heater Exergy Three procedure theory...|$|E

The approach was implemented as a case study at ten UK locations where <b>domestic-scale</b> turbines were previously installed. In stage one, sites were pre-screened using a boundary-layer scaling model to predict the mean wind power density, including estimated uncertainties, and these predictions were compared to a minimum viability criterion. Using this procedure, five of the seven non-viable sites were correctly identified without direct onsite wind measurements and none of the viable sites were excluded. In stage two, more detailed analysis was carried out using 3 months onsite wind measurements combined with measure-correlate-predict (MCP) approaches. Using this process, the remaining two non-viable sites were identified and the available wind power density at the three viable sites was accurately predicted. The effect of seasonal variability on the MCPpredicted wind resource was considered and the implications for financial projections were highlighted.

40|$|The UK has {{introduced}} two schemes that incentivise {{the adoption of}} <b>domestic-scale</b> renewable energy technologies (RETs), specifically the feed-in tariff (FiT) and renewable heat incentive (RHI). Both policies offer householders who install RETs a payback tariff based on the quantity of renewable energy they can produce and were introduced {{in the context of}} UK’s 2050 carbon reduction targets. A dual method is used to analyse the differing adoption under both schemes and reasons for it. First, registration data are analysed to assess impact in terms of stimulation of RET adoption in the domestic setting. Second, agent-based models are used to simulate adoption under both schemes and test the impact of non-financial factors on the rates of adoption. Results of the analysis and models are combined to give insight into differing rates of adoption. The paper concludes that factors beyond pure financial considerations have significant effects on rates of adoption, with the FiT stimulating far more adoption of rooftop photovoltaics than the RHI has stimulated adoption of heat pumps. It is recommended that policymakers take account of these non-financial factors when designing policy to encourage adoption of technology necessary for smart low-carbon future energy systems...|$|E

Further, controllable devices such as micro combined heat and power (CHP) could be used to assist in maintaining stability in addition to simply providing heat and power to dwellings. To analyse the behaviour of such a system requires the modelling of both the electrical distribution system and the coupled microgeneration devices in a realistic context. In this paper a pragmatic approach to HDPS modelling is presented: microgeneration devices are simulated using a building simulation tool to generate time-varying power output profiles, which are then replicated and processed statistically {{so that they can be}} used as boundary conditions for a load flow simulation; this is used to explore security issues such as under and over voltage, branch thermal overloading, and reverse power flow. Simulations of a section of real network are presented, featuring different penetrations of micro-renewables and micro-CHP within the ranges that are believed to be realistically possible by 2050.

Pine and corn fiber derived pyrolysis oil have been studied, with light fuel oil (LFO) used as a baseline fuel for comparison. Gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions have been measured, and the particulate samples studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate morphology and composition. In-situ visualization studies have been performed by employing high speed imaging of flame luminosity and several laser diagnostic methods including Mie scattering, hydroxyl radical planar induced fluorescence (OH-PLIF), fuel planar laser-induced fluorescence (Fuel-PLIF), and laser induced incandescence (LII). Spray characteristics have been investigated by employing Mie scattering and phase Doppler particle analysis(PDPA). Particulate emissions in pyrolysis oil have been found to consist predominately of unburned fuel residues (cenospheres), rather than soot, with higher emissions than LFO.

The system is simulated {{with a range of}} organic working fluids and its performance is optimised for operation in the UK climate. The findings are applicable to similar geographical locations with significant cloud coverage, a low solar resource and limited installation areas. A key feature of the system’s design is the implementation of fixed fluid flow-rates during operation in order to avoid penalties in the performance of components suffered at part-load. Steady operation under varying solar irradiance conditions is provided by way of a working-fluid buffer vessel at the evaporator outlet, which is maintained at the evaporation temperature and pressure of the ORC. By incorporating a two-stage solar collector/evaporator configuration, a maximum net annual electrical work output of 1070 kWh yr− 1 (continuous average power of 122 W) and a solar-to-electrical efficiency of 6. 3 % is reported with HFC- 245 ca as the working fluid at an optimal evaporation temperature of 126 ◦C (corresponding to an evaporation pressure of 16. 2 bar). This is equivalent to ∼ 32 % of the electricity demand of a typical/average UK home, and represents an improvement of more than 50 % over a recent effort by the same authors based on an earlier S-CHP system configuration and HFC- 245 fa as the working fluid [1].

The Nano Membrane Toilet (NMT) is a unique <b>domestic-scale</b> sanitary solution currently being developed to treat human waste on-site. This toilet will employ a small-scale gasifier to convert human faeces into products of high energy value. This study investigated the suitability of human faeces as a feedstock for gasification. It quantified the recoverable exergy potential from human faeces and explored the optimal routes for thermal conversion, using a thermodynamic equilibrium model. Fresh human faeces were found to have approximately 70 – 82 wt. % moisture and 3 – 6 wt. % ash. Product gas resulting from a typical dry human faeces (0 wt. % moisture) had LHV and exergy values of 17. 2 MJ/kg and 24 MJ/kg respectively at optimum equivalence ratio of 0. 31, values that are comparable to wood biomass. For suitable conversion of moist faecal samples, near combustion operating conditions are required, if an external energy source is not supplied. This is however at 5 % loss in the exergy value of the gas, provided both thermal heat and energy of the gas are recovered.

Stofer’s installation took over the bedroom on the house’s ground floor, where he unpacked a personal miscellany, turning the room into a sort of confessional.

The simulation model has been developed using Matlab/Simulink and incorporates a Stirling engine mCHP module embedded in a lumped-parameter domestic energy model, together with contributions from micro wind and photovoltaic modules. The Stirling cycle component model is based on experimental identification of a <b>domestic-scale</b> system which includes start up and shut down characteristics. The integrated model is used to explore the interactions between the various energy supply technologies and results are presented showing the most favourable operating conditions {{that can be used to}} inform the design of advanced energy control strategies in building. The integrated model offers an improvement on previous models of this kind in that a fully-dynamic approach is adopted for the equipment and plant enabling fast changing load events such as switching on/off domestic loads and hot water, to be accurately captured at a minimum interval of 1 min. The model is applied to two typical 3 - and 4 -bedroom UK house types equipped with a mCHP module and two other renewable energy technologies for a whole year. Results of the two cases show that the electrical contribution of a Stirling engine type mCHP heavily depends on the thermal demand of the building and that up to 19 % of the locally-generated electricity is exported whilst meeting a similar percentage of the overall annual electricity demand. Results also show that the increased number of switching of mCHP module has an impact on seasonal module efficiency and overall fuel utilisation. The results demonstrate the need for the analysis of equipment design and optimal sizing of thermal and electrical energy storage...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{integrated}} {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) solutions for a <b>domestic-scale</b> solar {{combined heat and power}} (S-CHP) system based on an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine and low-cost non-concentrating solar-thermal collectors. TES is a critical element and distinct advantage of solar-thermal systems. It can allow, depending on how it is implemented, improved matching to the end-user demands, improved load factors, higher average efficiencies and overall performance, as well as reduced component and system sizes and costs, especially in climates with high solar-irradiance variability. The operating temperature range of the TES solution must be compatible with the solar-collector array and with the ORC engine operation in order to maximise the overall performance of the system. Various combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and solar collectors are compared and the S-CHP system’s performance is simulated for selected months in the contrasting climates of Cyprus and the UK. The most important performance indicator of the ORC engine, i. e., net-power output, and the required TES volume are compared and discussed. The PCM-TES solutions that enable the best summer performance from an ORC engine sized for a nominal ∼ 1 -kWe output in combination with a 15 -m 2 solar collector array result in diurnal volume requirements as low as ∼ 100 L in Cyprus and 400 – 500 L in the UK. However, the required TES volume is strongly influenced by the choice of operational strategy for the system in matching the domestic load profiles. In a full-storage strategy in which electrical energy generation from the ORC engine is offset to match the week-day evening peak in demand, it is found that a ∼ 20 % higher total daily electrical output per unit storage volume can be achieved with a PCM compared to water as a sensible storage medium. The isothermal operation of the PCMs during phase-change allows for smaller diurnal storage temperature swings and higher energy conversion efficiencies from the solar collector array. These results are useful in informing the development of small-scale solar-thermal heat and power systems and of suitable integrated TES solutions for such applications...|$|E
40|$|Load {{shedding}} {{events are}} a major concern today for the Senegalese power grid, which production, transport, distribution and selling are operated by the national power company SENELEC. Even if some improvements have been made these last years through important power plant renovation campaigns, unserved energy still represented 1. 5 % of the total power demand in 2013. These events are mainly due to two factors: grid failure or work {{on the one hand}} (65 % of unserved energy in 2013) and production lack or failure on the other hand (35 % of unserved energy in 2013). If grid failure problems are being tackled by some rehabilitations and extension of the network, production lack problems will only be solved on the long term by setting up new power plants to face the increasing power demand. In order to face these power shortages, many customers have installed their own generation sources, mostly diesel generators used in case of emergency, but also more recently photovoltaic panels to both ensure power supply reliability thanks to storing batteries and reduce their electricity bills. These installations represent an important power production still unexploited today by SENELEC. The goal of this Master Thesis was then to see the potential use that could be made of these generation sources to reduce unserved energy in the short term. Diesel generators could thus be used for voluntary load shedding if properly implemented and photovoltaic installations could be connected to the grid to inject their production surplus. These two solutions were studied both from a technical and economical point of view, and their potential impact on unserved energy reduction was quantified. The results show that voluntary load shedding could actually reduce the amount of unserved energy due to production lack or failure by 40 % to 80 %, and that it is economically viable compared with other solutions such as production capacity renting. They also show {{that it is possible to}} connect <b>domestic-scale</b> photovoltaic installations to the low voltage grid without any negative impact on its operation in most of the situations met today. Finally, some recommendations were made, including proposals for voluntary load shedding implementation and the setting up of a dedicated team at Senelec for photovoltaic integration studies...|$|E
