It is now obvious that Catherine Ashton has been a success. In her unobtrusive but determined way, she can boast real achievement. Last year a peace deal was struck between Serbia and Kosovo. Nobody had thought it possible. It was a massive step towards healing ancient hatreds and building economic prosperity. It was brokered by Baroness Ashton....

5000|$|While Sebastian's {{recording}} {{career has}} been relatively short, prior to this album he had released five top ten albums which produced ten top fifty singles. Nine of these singles peaked inside the top 15 of the ARIA singles charts, with six reaching the top ten including four number ones. The earliest indication {{that he would be}} releasing a retrospective album came in October 2010 when it was revealed he had recorded a new single titled [...] "Who's That Girl". The artwork of the album was revealed shortly after, along with the official track listing. Sebastian {{said in an interview with}} the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It's weird to have a best of, I've only been doing this for seven or eight years. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those things, the record company contract finishes and they've got that in their artillery." [...] In the EPK for the release Sebastian said, [...] "We put together more of a compilation that was packaged in a way that was different. I put 20 of the songs on and then got ten of them and did totally different versions. It gives the fans something else, and takes them back too through that journey" [...] As Sebastian has recorded songs in a variety of genres on his five previous albums, the songs on Twenty Ten range from pop, pop rock, funk, R&B, jazz, gospel through to soul. He said [...] "I have a really eclectic taste in music, so in the best of there are so many styles". The release of Twenty Ten completed Sebastian's original contract he signed when he first won Australian Idol in 2003. In November 2010 he was re-signed by Sony Music for another long term contract.|$|R
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style.

2500|$|A 2006 {{study at}} the University of Minnesota showed atheists {{to be the most}} distrusted {{minority}} among Americans. In the study, sociologists Penny Edgell, Joseph Gerties and Douglas Hartmann conducted a survey of American public opinion on attitudes towards different groups. 40% of respondents characterized atheists as a group that [...] "does not at all agree with my vision of American society", putting atheists well ahead of every other group, with the next highest being Muslims (26%) and homosexuals (23%). When participants were asked whether they agreed with the statement, [...] "I would disapprove if my child wanted to marry a member of this group," [...] atheists again led minorities, with 48% disapproval, followed by Muslims (34%) and African-Americans (27%). Joe Foley, co-chairman for Campus Atheists and Secular Humanists, commented on the results, [...] "I know atheists aren't studied that much as a sociological group, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> atheists are <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the last groups remaining that it's still socially acceptable to hate." [...] A University of British Columbia study conducted in the United States found that believers distrust atheists as much as they distrust rapists.

6000|$|April 4th, 1856.--On Tuesday I went to No. 14 Ludgate Hill, to dine with Bennoch at the Milton Club; a club {{recently}} founded for dissenters, nonconformists, {{and people}} whose ideas, religious or political, are not precisely in train {{with the establishment}} in church and state. I was shown into a large reading-room, well provided with periodicals and newspapers, and found two or three persons there; but Bennoch had not yet arrived. In a few moments, a tall gentleman with white hair came in,--a fine and intelligent-looking man, whom <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those who were to meet me. He walked about, glancing at the periodicals; and soon entered Mr. Tupper, and, without seeing me, exchanged warm greetings with the white-haired gentleman. [...] "I suppose," [...] began Mr. Tupper, [...] "you have come to meet--" [...] Now, conscious that my name {{was going to be}} spoken, and not knowing but the excellent Mr. Tupper might say something which he would not, quite like me to overhear, I advanced at once, with outstretched hand, and saluted him.

50|$|Asked {{about being}} called a godfather of {{alternative}} rock music, Meade had this to say:I hate to try to credit myself for something that I {{may or may not}} have created. At the time, I was fed up with everything going on in music. If you were alive in the 80s you know to what music and bands I am referring. The music that was happening was in no way speaking to me. Furthermore, life in general seemed so restricted. When I started writing music, I was not satisfied with the two choices that were given to me as an 18-year-old. The first choice was go to college in order to work your life away at an office. The other choice was to be a townie and work at a machine shop or restaurant in my hometown. I wanted something different that did not entail a new couch, a new car, a new dining room set. Fortunately, I met a like-minded soul in my hometown and we innocently and haphazardly went about putting together a band. This whole process was a head banging one; that is, a banging my head against the wall one. I soon learned, no clubs would book a band that played original songs. Clubs only booked cover bands at that time in the early and mid-80s. So, we played house parties and VFW halls. If we made 20 bucks we were happy, not 20 bucks apiece but altogether. There were a few other bands that were not hardcore punk doing the same thing but not very many. And, I wrote songs about my life and my inner-struggles and all of that sort of stuff that you have going on when you are in your late teens and early 20s. We rammed 50s guitar licks into 60s power pop colliding into 70s glam and punk and more glam and then pureed it in a blender and we had our sound. Soon after, a hoard of other bands did the same and called it grunge or alternative rock. It then became a big business. I never made any money; I have been paid in fan letters, which is really what I set out to do. I set out to make some sort of change. And I feel as if I did. So, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> am <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the alterna-Forefathers. I am a starving alterna-Forefather.|$|R

Last year, Underoath went on a {{headlining}} tour. I can't tell you how stoked we were. It was long over due since {{it was the first time}} we had headlined off of our current record. Things were going incredible until about nine days into the trip when I got <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those routine drummer blisters and super glued it shut. I woke the next morning to find that I could barely pull on my pants, my thumb hurt so bad. It was pulsing and had a dark purple-ish hue. This kind of thing has happened before (not to sound tough or anything, but its true) so I just taped it up and played the show that night. I was in extreme pain for the whole show, and afterwards I started to wonder why this hurt so bad. I mean, my thumb had never been hurt before to the point where it messed up my playing. I went to see the crowd paramedic, you know the little station beside the stage. She told me that it needed to be lanced (cut open and drained) and that she could do it, no problem. So she lanced it and I wrapped up my thumb, ate an in and Out burger and went to sleep. While we were driving to Vegas I woke up and my thumb was even more swollen than before. Also, there were red lines crawling up my arm sign of blood poisoning - ed. Immediately, I went to the emergency room, got a shot, an IV and some minor surgery. It was weird and I was a baby about it. After it was over, I had to go home for a few days, but I made it back just in time to record our live CD/DVD Survive Kaleidoscope." ...|$|R
5000|$|Elder {{was known}} as an inveterate prankster. As a child, he once cut out paper silhouettes of a man {{carrying}} a knife and a woman. Attaching them to a rotating record turntable, he projected their image onto the windowshade, and began screaming. People {{on the outside of}} the building saw what they thought was an assailant chasing his victim around the room. EC colorist Marie Severin recalled, [...] "Will used to have this painting of a deer... <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those 5-and-10-cent store things. It had a deer, a mountain, some trees, a path, flowers and the like, and he'd change it with the seasons! If it was winter he'd paint snow on the deer, and then he would paint over that and put the sun out for the springtime with flowers coming up." [...] Kurtzman recounted the time Elder and his playmates found a stock of fresh meat as a child: [...] "These kids collected a bunch of clothes and they dressed the meat in clothes and spread the combination of meat and clothes along the right-of-way for about half a mile on the railroad tracks. Then Willy started shrieking at the top of his voice that Mikey had fallen down onto the railroad tracks. Naturally every woman for miles around who had a son named Mike went out of their mind, seeing this mess of clothes and meat along the tracks... This is the kind of kid that Willy was." [...] Years later, Elder still had a gruesome side to his humor, sending his wife a heart from a slaughterhouse as a Valentine's Day gift.|$|R
6000|$|This was how. You are {{to imagine}} a four-wheeled gig; one horse; {{in the front seat}} two Tahiti natives, in their Sunday clothes, blue coat, white shirt, kilt (a little longer than the Scotch) of a blue stuff with big white or yellow flowers, legs and feet bare; in the back seat me and my wife, who is a friend of yours; under our feet, plenty of lunch and things: among us a great deal of fun in broken Tahitian, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the natives, the sub-chief of the village, being a great ally of mine.

We drive between the sea, which makes a great noise, and the mountains; the road is cut through a forest mostly of fruit trees, the very creepers, which take the place of our ivy, heavy with a great and delicious fruit, bigger than your head and far nicer, called Barbedine. Presently we came to a house in a pretty garden, quite by itself, very nicely kept, the doors and windows open, no one about, and no noise but that of the sea. It looked like a house in a fairy-tale, and just beyond we must ford a river, and there we saw the inhabitants. Just in the mouth of the river, where it met the sea waves, they were ducking and bathing and screaming together like a covey of birds: seven or eight little naked brown boys and girls as happy as the day was long; and {{on the banks of the}} stream beside them, real toys - toy ships, full rigged, and with their sails set, though they were lying in the dust on their beam ends. And then I knew for sure they were all children in a fairy-story, living alone together in that lonely house with the only toys in all the island; and that I had myself driven, in my four-wheeled gig, into a corner of the fairy-story, and the question was, should I get out again? But it was all right; <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the wheels of the gig had got into the fairy-story; and the next jolt the whole thing vanished, and we drove on in our sea-side forest as before, and I have the honour to be Tomarcher's valued correspondent, TERIITEPA, which he was previously known as ...|$|R
