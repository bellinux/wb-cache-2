25|$|By 1962 Sergei Korolev's health {{problems}} {{were beginning to}} accumulate and {{he was suffering from}} numerous ailments. He had a bout of intestinal bleeding that led to him being taken to the hospital in an ambulance. In 1964 doctors diagnosed him with cardiac arrhythmia. In February he spent ten days in the hospital after a heart problem. Shortly after he was suffering from inflammation of his gallbladder. The mounting pressure of his workload was also taking a heavy toll, and he was suffering <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fatigue. Korolev was also experiencing hearing loss, possibly from repeated exposure to loud rocket engine tests.|$|E
25|$|At last, {{the missing}} Collins enters the apartment, {{presenting}} Angel, {{who is now}} in full drag and shares the money she made and the amusing story of how she killed a dog to earn it ("Today 4 U"). Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves ("You'll See"). Mark must leave to fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, but he unexpectedly meets Joanne at the stage. They overcome their awkwardness by connecting over their shared distrust of Maureen's promiscuous behaviors ("Tango: Maureen"). Mark joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting ("Life Support"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment ("Out Tonight"). Roger is clearly upset by Mimi's intrusion and he demands she leave him alone ("Another Day"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts ("Will I?").|$|E

Has a better arm than people think. I don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's a kid who could surprise people {{at the end of}} the day." [...] Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka [...] "knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. I can see him being one of those sleeper type guys." [...] A scout before the draft said that Kafka [...] "throws a lot of picks, but at least he's willing to pull the trigger.

[...] Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton conceded that his teammate had done a [...] "fantastic job," [...] stating that [...] "t the end of the day, he was quicker during the race." [...] Speaking about his start at the post-race press conference, Hamilton explained that his car suffered <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of wheelspin, which made him get off the line slowly.

500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs.

She told Marie Claire: [...] "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable." [...] Kristen Wiig commented that [...] "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [...] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [...] The New York Times labeled her [...] "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent [...] "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|From 1955 to 1957, Williamson {{produced}} over 400 {{pages of}} three-to-five-page stories for Atlas Comics, the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics, working in various genres but primarily Westerns. He continued {{to collaborate with}} Torres and Krenkel, {{as well as with}} Gray Morrow, George Woodbridge and Ralph Mayo. With Mayo, one of the first editors to give Williamson work, at Standard Comics, Williamson collaborated on the jungle girl series Jann of the Jungle #16–17 (April and June 1957). Following Mayo's death, Williamson drew stories solo for the planned #18, but the series was abruptly canceled before that issue could be published. His [...] "prolific though somewhat uneven two-year stint at Atlas", where he first drew war comics, yielded superlative art in such stories as [...] "The City That Time Forgot", in Marvel Tales #144 (March 1956); [...] "Menace from the Stars", in Mystery Tales #44 (Aug. 1956); [...] "The Unknown Ones", in Astonishing #57 (Jan. 1957); [...] "Dreadnaught", in Navy Tales #2 (March 1957); and [...] "Helpless", in Battle #55 (Nov. 1957). While [...] "something appeared to be missing <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of his Atlas work: enthusiasm," [...] Williamson's Atlas Westerns, at least, [...] "form a strongly consistent body of work, characterized by minimal to nonexistent action, a preponderance of closeups and reaction shots, and well-defined figures set against sparse backgrounds." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] {{it would be a}} beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E

500|$|In September 2005, {{the paper}} decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns {{in a program}} known as TimesSelect, which {{encompassed}} many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, TimesSelect cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year, though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty. To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material, {{and at least one}} site once compiled links of reprinted material. On September 17, 2007, The New York Times announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site. In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, The New York Times news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain. Access to the Premium Crosswords section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year. Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized TimesSelect, with Friedman {{going so far as to}} say [...] "I hate it.

American rock band A Day to Remember recorded their own version of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which was included in the reissued version of their album, For Those Who Have Heart. Indie rock artist Ted Leo recorded an acoustic version of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] for a videotaped web session a few hours after watching the song's music video. He commented, [...] "It's just one great hook after another. I also really appreciate the more advanced pop pastiche aspects of it. It's written {{in a way that is}} so transparent in terms of drawing <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of what's vaguely edgy and popular right now, but put together in such a perfect little package. It's undeniable." [...] A cover of the song by Canadian indie rock band Tokyo Police Club was included in their [...] "Ten Days, Ten Covers, Ten Years" [...] project where they covered a song every day for ten days. [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] was sampled in Girl Talk's [...] "Here's The Thing" [...] on his 2008 album, Feed the Animals.

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following.

[...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people and I enjoy that.
