40|$|China is {{the largest}} {{non-metallic}} mineral producer {{in the world and}} one of the key consumers of four major non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products,</b> including cement, refractories, plate glass and ceramics. The non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industry’s rapid growth has brought about a large demand for energy. The present study provides an overview of China’s non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industry in terms of production, energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. In this industry, the energy efficiency is relatively low and the level of carbon dioxide emission is much higher than developed countries’ average. This study interprets the effects of some newly issued policies and analyses the influential factors in achieving energy conservation and emission reduction goals. It also discusses the prospects for saving energy and emission reduction in the industry. Retrofitting facilities and using new production technologies is imperative. Additionally, implementing market-based policies, promoting industrial transformation and effective international cooperation would help decrease carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{enormous}} {{increase of}} production and service sectors leads to increase in demand for energy consumption. Therefore, energy and oil consumption {{in a variety of}} countries are considerably effected by energy and oil prices. International oil prices are crucial for both oil exporting countries and capital market investors as a means of volatility spillovers. This paper aims to analyze whether volatility spillovers exist between world oil market and several sector indices operating in Borsa Istanbul (BIST) 100 including energy, non-metal <b>mineral</b> <b>products,</b> and transportation using bivariate GARCH (1, 1) model. Estimation results suggest that except for non-metal <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> sector, there are interactions between oil returns and the underlying sectors in terms of both shocks and conditional variance...|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{intensity}} {{is an important}} indicator for measuring production efficiency. A comparative study could offer {{a new perspective on}} investigating determinants of electricity demand. The Japanese non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industry is chosen as the object for comparison considering its representative position in production efficiency. By adopting the cointegration model, this paper examines influencing factors of electricity demand in Japanese and Chinese non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industries under the same framework. Results indicate that although economic growth and industrial development stages are different between the two countries, major factors that affect the sectoral energy consumption are the same. Specifically, economic growth and industrial activity contribute to the growth of sectoral electricity consumption, while R&D intensity, per capita productivity and electricity price are contributors to the decline of sectoral electricity consumption. Finally, in order to further investigate the development trend of sectoral electricity demand, future electricity consumption and conservation potential are predicted under different scenarios. Electricity demand of the Chinese non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industry is predicted to be 680. 53 TWh (terawatt-hours) in 2020 and the sectoral electricity conservation potentials are estimated to be 118. 26 TWh and 216. 25 TWh under the moderate and advanced electricity-saving scenarios, respectively...|$|R
