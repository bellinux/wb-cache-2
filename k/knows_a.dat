25|$|When and how {{applications}} are taught varies from style to style. Today, many styles begin to teach new students {{by focusing on}} exercises in which each student <b>knows</b> <b>a</b> prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, {{in order to allow}} its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. 'Sparring' refers to {{the most important aspect of}} application training, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.|$|E
25|$|The surname 'Irani' {{was adopted}} by the Zoroastrian {{immigrants}} in the 18th century and later, and only by them, for legal and communal reasons. Sheriar was then not born with 'Irani' as a last name, and would originally have had his father's first name as a surname; thus his birth name was probably Sheriar Moondegar. Inversely, in Indian Zoroastrian tradition, which goes back to the days before family names were introduced by the British colonial government, the middle name is always the father's first name, so if one <b>knows</b> <b>a</b> person's middle name, one knows the name of the father. For instance, Meher Baba's full legal name was Merwan Sheriar Irani.|$|E
25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor <b>knows</b> <b>a</b> lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
