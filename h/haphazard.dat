5|$|<b>Haphazard</b> {{industrial}} planning, increased urbanisation, {{poverty and}} lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wanat {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the bloodiest Taliban attacks of the war and one of several attacks on remote outposts. In contrast to previous roadside bombings and <b>haphazard</b> attacks and ambushes, this attack was well-coordinated with fighters from many insurgent groups with an effort that was disciplined and sustained which was able to precisely target key equipment such as a wire-guided missile launcher.|$|E
5|$|The {{slightly}} <b>haphazard</b> {{nature of}} the cricket tournament was mirrored {{throughout the rest of}} the 1900 Olympics. Events took place throughout a six-month period from May through until October, and like the Games themselves, were often considered part of the Exposition Universelle, a world's fair held in Paris from 15 April until 12 November 1900.|$|E
5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that <b>haphazard</b> astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} motivate and inspire {{everyone}} by taking {{them on a}} field trip to Gettysburg. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a <b>haphazard</b> tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is.|$|E
5|$|Coronel was {{replaced}} by session musician Ron Leejack, and the group continued their efforts to finish the album. Some songs were completely re-recorded to accommodate Leejack's different playing style. The entire recording process, which followed a <b>haphazard</b> schedule, took nearly a year to complete. When the completed album was presented to Don Ellis, Epic's A director, he stated that he hated the album and {{was not going to}} release it. The next day, Wicked Lester manager Lew Linet requested and received the group's release from Epic Records.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a <b>haphazard</b> manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many girls}} of her time, Barney had a <b>haphazard</b> education. Her {{interest}} in the French language began with a governess who read Jules Verne stories aloud to her so {{she would have to}} learn quickly to understand them. Later she and her younger sister Laura Clifford Barney attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school in Fontainebleau, France, founded by feminist Marie Souvestre, who also founded Allenswood, in Wimbledon, outside London, which was attended by such notables as Eleanor Roosevelt. As an adult she spoke French fluently without an accent and made her home in Paris. Nearly all her published works were written in French.|$|E
5|$|Oakwood was {{designed}} by John C. Sidney, a Philadelphia engineer familiar with cemetery design, {{with the help of}} Garnet Douglass Baltimore, the first African American to earn a degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The plan consisted of roads, man-made lakes, dense vegetation, and rolling hills, covering about , including the modern sections A through Q. Sidney also designed the original superintendent's house and receiving tomb, neither of which exist today. For all Sidney's extensive planning, the first plots were laid out in a seemingly <b>haphazard</b> manner by the first superintendent, Robert Fergusson.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of the city are known as Mysoreans in English and Mysoorinavaru in Kannada. The dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the sharing of Kaveri river water often leads to minor altercations and demonstrations in the city. Growth in the information technology industry in Mysore {{has led to a}} change in the city's demographic profile; likely strains on the infrastructure and <b>haphazard</b> growth of the city resulting from the demographic change have been a cause of concern for some of its citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{stands and}} {{terraces}} were {{arranged in a}} <b>haphazard</b> manner due to space constraints, and by 1920 the club had outgrown the cramped venue. A decision to seek an alternative venue was hastened in November 1920, when the Main Stand was destroyed by fire. Manchester City moved to the 80,000-capacity Maine Road in 1923, and Hyde Road was demolished shortly afterward. One structure from the ground is still in use in the 21st century, a section of roofing which was sold for use at The Shay, a stadium in Halifax.|$|E
5|$|The western {{third of}} Sicily fell {{relatively}} quickly into Muslim hands, but {{conquest of the}} eastern portion of the island was a protracted and <b>haphazard</b> affair. There is little evidence of large-scale campaigns or pitched battles, and warfare was dominated by repeated Arab attacks on Byzantine citadels, coupled with raids (sa'ifa) in the surrounding countryside, aimed at looting or the extraction of tribute and prisoners from the threatened localities. In this type of warfare, the south-eastern third of the island (Val di Noto) suffered comparatively more than the more mountainous and inaccessible north-eastern portion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{many of the}} large country estates in the area, with their mansions and {{associated}} grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting <b>haphazard</b> housing development and small farms. By {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the A23 Londonâ€“Brighton road. Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} of 669 clearly demonstrated to the Arabs {{the possibility of}} a direct strike at Constantinople, as well as the necessity of having a supply base in the region. This was found in the peninsula of Cyzicus on the southern shore of the Sea of Marmara, where a raiding fleet under Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd wintered in 670 or 671. Mu'awiya now began preparing his final assault on the Byzantine capital. In contrast to Yazid's expedition, Mu'awiya intended to take a coastal route to Constantinople. The undertaking was not <b>haphazard,</b> but followed a careful, phased approach: first the Muslims had to secure strongpoints and bases along the coast, and then, with Cyzicus as a base, Constantinople would be blockaded by land and sea and cut off from its agrarian hinterland, on which it depended for its food supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the telegraph had resulted in a trail that could be followed for interstate travel, {{but it was a}} <b>haphazard</b> route which only the more adventurous motorists would take. Many travellers were unprepared for the harsh conditions and lack of services; they would cause a nuisance for station owners and other travellers by scrounging petrol, contaminating water supplies, leaving gates open, and committing acts of vandalism. In 1938 the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) called for a national highway to be constructed by the federal government, as it would be a strategic defence road, provide another link between Western Australia and other states, and improve the tourist experience. The federal government did not see the road as important enough for its involvement.|$|E
5|$|By 1871 Burnside {{had grown}} significantly; {{it was now}} a mix of villages {{supporting}} a modest population of 1,557. By comparison, Kensington-Norwood, though smaller in area, had grown to 5,132 persons. Glen Osmond, still affected by its immense growth following the expansion of mining, was the largest single population centre with 343 residents. The District Council had also constructed its first council chambers in December 1869, finally concluding the <b>haphazard</b> meeting agreement. Two villages, Beulah Park (North Kensington) and Eastwood experienced booms in population growth and development between 1870 and 1880, providing both housing to new immigrants and investments for the wealthy Adelaide Establishment. Parkside Hospital (now Glenside), a mental health asylum was constructed in 1866 to replace a crowded building in the Parklands. Built on beautifully tended grounds and with an elaborate faÃ§ade, it was an early Burnside architectural monument. In 1881 Thomas Cooper started brewing South Australia's first branded beer, 'Coopers', at Leabrook. During this era, Stonyfell saw economic expansion as well; its large quarry changed hands in 1867 and the Stonyfell Olive Co was founded in 1873. The late 19th century was a significant time of development in Burnside. This development, however, was brought {{to an abrupt end}} in the last decade, the 1890s, when depression stuck the economies of Australasia after decades of reckless expansion, hitting Burnside hard.|$|E
5|$|Cromwell {{did much}} work through his many offices {{to remove the}} tasks of {{government}} from the Royal Household (and ideologically from the personal body of the King) and into a public state. He did so, however, in a <b>haphazard</b> fashion that left several remnants, not least because he needed to retain Henry's support, his own power, {{and the possibility of}} actually achieving the plan he set out. Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration. The role of the King's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council, much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor. A difference emerged between the financial health of the king, and that of the country, although Cromwell's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy, which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending that strained relations as well as finances. Cromwell's reforms ground to a halt in 1539, the initiative lost, and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act, the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539. He too was executed, on 28 July 1540.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is <b>haphazard</b> and {{buildings}} float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{the work}} shows {{evidence}} of its having been {{put together in}} a very <b>haphazard</b> and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative. Birley sees {{an example of the}} carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the Life of Marcus Aurelius the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'. The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus. However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.|$|E
5|$|Maya {{cities were}} not {{formally}} planned, and {{were subject to}} irregular expansion, with the <b>haphazard</b> addition of palaces, temples and other buildings. Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture. Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes. The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls. These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools. Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city. Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship {{equal to that of}} royal art.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} Pipe roll from 1130 records {{an income}} of Â£24,500. This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals Â£68,850. The income that they record {{in the early years}} of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about Â£10,000 to Â£15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to Â£20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about Â£30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only Â£8,000 in the early years, rising to Â£16,500 by 1225. Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were <b>haphazard</b> and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.|$|E
5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and <b>haphazard</b> in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial â€“ he was born in the Cape Colony after all â€“ he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E
5|$|During the {{conflict}} itself, monuments were erected near the battlefields and the temporary cemeteries {{being used to}} store the dead. It had been hoped in Britain to repatriate the war dead, but this rapidly proved entirely impractical, leading to <b>haphazard,</b> improvised arrangements around the battlefields. By 1916 over 200 war cemeteries had been commissioned in France and Belgium, prompting debate about what longer term memorials might be appropriate at these sites. The government was concerned that unsuitable, even distasteful memorials might be erected by relatives at the cemeteries and the decision was taken that the cemeteries would be controlled by the state, and that a uniform design would {{be applied to the}} memorials at the graves. French cemeteries were used for as memorial sites for ceremonies by injured soldiers during the war and many towns began to name streets and squares after Verdun. In Belgium, where the movement of the war and losses of territory had meant that the Flemish elements of the population were increasingly forming a disproportionate percentage of the army, the language on the memorial headstone gradually became an issue, leading to calls for the creation of heldenhuldezerkjes, headstones inscribed in Flemish, rather than the usual French. In Imperial Russia, the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was constructed for the war dead in 1915 by the Imperial royal family and senior Moscow political leaders, who hoped that its inspiring architecture would ensure patriotism in future generations of Russians.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{generation}} Prius has stirred {{controversy over the}} style and cohesion of its exterior design, with analysis from critics contending that the excessively angular headlamps and unnecessary creases in the bodywork has created a <b>haphazard</b> design, that falls {{into the trap of}} equating aggressiveness with sportiness.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Saxons built churches for Christian worship, and the present structure contains re-used stones, some with sundial markings, which can be seen arranged <b>haphazard</b> in the masonry.

25|$|However, {{infrastructure}} has {{not kept}} pace with urbanization and <b>haphazard</b> building practices without zoning regulations has left in its wake a chaotic and congested city rife with lawlessness. The World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution database's 2016 update indicates that Onitsha is the most polluted city in the world.|$|E
25|$|More peak-hour {{cars were}} put on between the Market Place and Hyson Green, {{together}} with other short workings.

The motion was adopted.|$|E
25|$|TRAP is {{associated}} with osteoclast migration to bone resorption sites, and, once there, TRAP is believed to initiate osteoclast differentiation, activation, and proliferation. This hypothesis was formed from {{the examination of the}} bone structure of TRAP-null mice. It was noted that, in addition to osteopetrosis, bone formation occurred in a <b>haphazard</b> manner, where the microarchitecture was highly irregular.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} of 911 {{service in the}} USA was a gradual and <b>haphazard</b> process.
