25|$|Uranium dioxide (UO2) powder is {{compacted}} to cylindrical pellets and sintered at {{high temperatures}} to produce ceramic nuclear fuel pellets {{with a high}} density and well defined physical properties and chemical composition. A <b>grinding</b> <b>process</b> is used to achieve a uniform cylindrical geometry with narrow tolerances. Such fuel pellets are then stacked and filled into the metallic tubes. The metal used for the tubes depends {{on the design of}} the reactor. Stainless steel was used in the past, but most reactors now use a zirconium alloy which, in addition to being highly corrosion-resistant, has low neutron absorption. The tubes containing the fuel pellets are sealed: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped into fuel assemblies that are used to build up the core of a power reactor.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired setting qualities in the {{finished}} product, a quantity (2–8%, but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) {{is added to the}} clinker, and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement mill. The <b>grinding</b> <b>process</b> is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range, in which typically 15% by mass consists of particles below 5 μm diameter, and 5% of particles above 45 μm. The measure of fineness usually used is the 'specific surface area', which is the total particle surface area of a unit mass of cement. The rate of initial reaction (up to 24 hours) of the cement on addition of water is directly proportional to the specific surface area. Typical values are 320–380m2·kg−1 for general purpose cements, and 450–650m2·kg−1 for 'rapid hardening' cements. The cement is conveyed by belt or powder pump to a silo for storage. Cement plants normally have sufficient silo space for one to 20 weeks of production, depending upon local demand cycles. The cement is delivered to end users either in bags, or as bulk powder blown from a pressure vehicle into the customer's silo. In industrial countries, 80% or more of cement is delivered in bulk.|$|E

High Performance <b>Grinding</b> <b>processes</b> offer a huge potential to overcome these challenges and increase productivity. They are characterized by a significant increase in material removal rate and component quality plus a reduced need of resources. In this paper, possibilities are presented and discussed for extending the process boundaries of conventional <b>grinding</b> <b>processes</b> in order to create High Performance <b>Grinding</b> <b>processes.</b> Based on current research, potentials to increase productivity of conventional <b>grinding</b> <b>processes</b> are described. In addition to process-specific optimization of the machine and the grinding tools, opportunities are pointed out for the numerical prediction of the process boundaries as well as methods for mathematical interpretation and analysis of grinding wheel structures and topographies.

25|$|Many birds {{possess a}} muscular pouch along the {{esophagus}} called a crop. The crop functions to both soften food and regulate its {{flow through the}} system by storing it temporarily. The {{size and shape of}} the crop is quite variable among the birds. Members of the Columbidae family, such as pigeons, produce a nutritious crop milk which is fed to their young by regurgitation. The avian stomach is composed of two organs, the proventriculus and the gizzard that work together during digestion. The proventriculus is a rod shaped tube, which is found between the esophagus and the gizzard, that secretes hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen into the digestive tract. The acid converts the inactive pepsinogen into the active proteolytic enzyme, pepsin, which breaks down certain specific peptide bonds found in proteins, to produce a set of peptides, which are amino acid chains that are shorter than the original dietary protein. The gastric juices (hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen) are mixed with the stomach contents through the muscular contractions of the gizzard. The gizzard is composed of four muscular bands that rotate and crush food by shifting the food from one area to the next within the gizzard. The gizzard of some species of herbivorous birds, contains small pieces of grit or stone called gastroliths that are swallowed by the bird to aid in the <b>grinding</b> <b>process,</b> serving the function of teeth. The use of gizzard stones is a similarity found between birds and dinosaurs, which left gastroliths as trace fossils.|$|E

However, their teeth and jaws are very {{different}} from those of other herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs, suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. not only the fused up-down motion to which stegosaur jaws were likely limited). Unlike the sturdy jaws and grinding teeth common to its fellow ornithischians, Stegosaurus (and all stegosaurians) had small, peg-shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal (up-down) movements. Their teeth were [...] "not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding", and no evidence in the fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of gastroliths—the stone(s) some dinosaurs (and some present-day bird species) ingested—to aid the <b>grinding</b> <b>process,</b> so how exactly Stegosaurus obtained and processed the amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains [...] "poorly understood".|$|E
500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the <b>grinding</b> <b>process</b> warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it evenly over the drying floor—a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|E

2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread <b>grinding</b> <b>process</b> is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E

In 1915, Fisk officials debated the issue and agreed to ban [...] "fraternities and other secret or oath-bound societies" [...] because the trustees believed such organizations did not reflect the democratic ideals taught at the University and could lead to inappropriate student conduct. However, student organizations such as debating, literary and other academic societies were encouraged. McKenzie viewed religion as an important component of a Fisk education, and firmly rooted in the educational intent of its founders and the history of the school. Fisk's faculty and staff required that students conduct themselves according to Christian principles of character at all times. McKenzie linked the concepts of Christianity and sacrifice, suggesting that [...] "sacrifice is not an action nor a deprivation. It is a spiritual attitude." [...] In 1921, McKenzie published a small leaflet simply titled, the Fisk Creed. The leaflet, published partly as a response to persistent disciplinary problems, articulated Fisk's approach to education and student conduct.
