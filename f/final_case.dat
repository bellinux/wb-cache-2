5|$|In a {{fifth and}} <b>final</b> <b>case,</b> (not {{present in the}} {{original}} Game Boy Advance release, but added for the DS and subsequent releases) Phoenix, now running Fey's firm as Wright and Co., is hired by teenager Ema Skye to defend her sister Lana, {{the head of the}} prosecutor's office, in a case where the body of a detective, Bruce Goodman, was found in the trunk of Edgeworth's car. Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the murder to an incident two years prior, in which a serial killer allegedly murdered Edgeworth's predecessor while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, a senior police captain, is tricked into admitting that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana into doing his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post in order to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Feast or Fired match next. In the Feast or Fired match, four {{briefcases}} are held above four different turnbuckles on poles, with three having future title shots for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, and TNA World Tag Team Championships; the remaining briefcase holds a pink slip, leading to that wrestler's contract termination. A wrestler must retrieve the briefcase {{and then leave}} the ring {{in order to gain}} official possession of the case. The participants in the bout were Scott Steiner, Senshi, B.G. James, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Lance Hoyt, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Homicide, Hernandez, Kip James, Jimmy Rave, Chris Harris, and Sonjay Dutt. The contest lasted eleven minutes and fifty-five seconds. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave and Hoyt to the ring for the contest. Williams was the first to obtain a case in the match. Kip was the second; however he threw it to his Voodoo Kin Mafia tag team partner B.G. James who was standing at ringside, thus giving B.G. James possession of the case. A short time later, Senshi retrieved the third case. The <b>final</b> <b>case</b> was collected by Steiner, after he took it from Kip, who had taken it from the retriever Daniels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and <b>final</b> <b>case,</b> Phoenix is visiting a {{mountain}} retreat with Maya and Pearl when a fellow guest, Elise Deauxnim, is murdered. While looking for Maya, he falls into a river and becomes ill, forcing Edgeworth and Franziska to temporarily fill in as attorney and prosecutor to keep his client, a nun named Iris, from being found guilty. When Phoenix returns, he explains that Elise is really Maya's long-lost mother, Misty Fey, and that her death {{was the result of}} a plan engineered by her sister Morgan to kill Maya with the help of the now deceased Dahlia, who turns out to be Iris's twin. Through cross-examination, Phoenix reveals that not only is Dahlia impersonating Iris, she is using Maya's body to do so. With Mia's help, Dahlia is exorcised from Maya and Iris is declared innocent. Godot is revealed as the one responsible for killing Misty to protect Maya, leading to the discovery of his true identity: Diego Armando. Having spent many years blaming Phoenix for Mia's death, he sought revenge, but concedes that Phoenix has done more to continue her legacy than him. Iris also reveals that she posed as Dahlia while Phoenix was attending college to protect him, ended up falling in love with him, and that she regrets her failure to stop her sister from becoming a criminal. Reuniting with his friends, Phoenix celebrates finally being free of his past.|$|E
25|$|Author William Bernhardt wrote a {{novel about}} the murders and Elliot Ness's involvement, titled Nemesis: the <b>Final</b> <b>Case</b> of Elliot Ness. Although {{generally}} non-fiction, it was written as a novel, and makes some assumptions. The only significant deviation from the true story is the ending. A climax is fictionalized where Ness confirms the killer was Sweeney, and captures him, but is prevented from arresting him due to political pressure. It does try to remain factual to the case otherwise, while still remaining entertaining. NBC is currently in the works to adapt this book into a mini-series. No release date or cast has been announced as of January 2014.|$|E

25|$|The game's {{narrative}} involves master thief Carmen Sandiego, who {{has used}} {{a time machine}} called the Chronoskimmer to plant her associates at key historical events, aiming to influence history by stopping these events from occurring. The objective {{of the game is}} to track down Carmen Sandiego and her henchmen by jumping through time tunnels that link historical periods together, and correct the course of history. The player visits well-known historical events, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence and Lewis and Clark's expedition to the Pacific Northwest, and meets historical figures including Queen Hatshepsut, William the Conqueror, and Yuri Gagarin. In each segment, or case, the player must interact with the culture and solve historical puzzles to catch Carmen's villains and retrieve the stolen item. At the end of case 18 the player locates the Chronoskimmer, thereby acquiring the tools to chase and capture Carmen for the <b>final</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

The following week Mickie James, (Magnus's real-life fiancé) returned to TNA to confront Bram who threatened Mickie in return. The week after, Magnus returned and attacked Bram in retaliation for threatening Mickie.

Magnus would get redemption and attack Bram backstage. This would lead to a No Disqualification match between the two which Magnus won to end the feud.|$|E

500|$|In the <b>final</b> <b>case,</b> Apollo is {{selected}} {{to serve as}} the defense in an experimental jury trial organized by Phoenix. His client, professional forger Vera Misham, is accused of poisoning her father Drew. After Vera succumbs to poison while testifying, the player is instructed by Phoenix to investigate the circumstances leading to the case. Seven years earlier, while representing magician Zak Gramarye in court, Phoenix was tricked into using false evidence created by Vera, costing him his reputation and job. Zak subsequently disappeared, leaving his daughter Trucy in Phoenix's custody. Over the years, Phoenix uses his experience and connections to gradually uncover the truth: Trucy and Apollo are half-siblings gifted with a unique power of perception by their mother, Thalassa Gramarye. Furthermore, Zak was forced to abandon Trucy, his daughter, in order to honor the wishes of her grandfather, who passed the legal rights to his magic to her side of the family. It also transpires that Zak is Shadi Smith, the victim in the first case, who had come to give the rights to Magnifi's magic to Trucy before being killed by Kristoph when the latter recognized him. The whole matter takes a surprise turn when Kristoph is summoned to testify and Apollo accuses him for setting up Phoenix out of jealousy and then killing everyone related to the case out of fear of being found out. Following the final arguments, the player takes control of a member of Phoenix's jury and must decide whether or not Vera is guilty. If [...] "Not Guilty" [...] is chosen, then she is declared innocent by unanimous vote and ultimately recovers from the poison. With his name cleared, Phoenix decides to apply for readmission to the bar and assures Lamiroir, who is really Thalassa in disguise, that he will watch over Apollo and Trucy. If [...] "Guilty" [...] is chosen, it triggers an alternate ending in which a hung jury forces the court with no choice but to delay the verdict. Vera's sudden death occurs soon after, resulting in an uncertain future for the Wright Anything Agency.|$|E
