[...] AllMusic journalist Sharon Mawer described the track as [...] "a charity sounding record without the All Saints rhythm 'All This Time', without the multi-vocals, and without much of a tune either".|$|R

Asaph had not seen very much of his sister since she had grown up and married; and when he came to live with her he thought that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> things pretty <b>much</b> his own way. But it was not long before he entirely changed his mind.|$|R

5000|$|Kevin Parker {{started writing}} and {{recording}} new material for Lonerism {{almost immediately after}} releasing Innerspeaker, saying [...] "I started writing songs straight after Innerspeaker, but I told myself I wouldn't get hung up with the pressure, so I kinda pretended they were for some other weird project that wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as <b>much</b> consequence". While Innerspeaker was recorded in a very structured manner with a designated time period to record, Parker recorded Lonerism in many different {{places around the world}} whilst touring with Tame Impala. Speaking about this, Parker revealed [...] "I've got a recording thing with me at the moment, I can do vocal takes and guitar takes wherever I am, so it's getting recorded all over the world. There's a guitar take in Vienna, or a vocal take in the aeroplane from Singapore to London. I've got my studio at home, so a lot is being done in Perth." ...|$|R
500|$|Some media sources {{proposed}} that the dress {{could be interpreted as}} anti-vegan. Vegetarian singer Morrissey stated that he felt the dress was acceptable {{as long as it was}} a social or political statement, and not just a [...] "loony idea", pointing out that artist Linder Sterling had previously worn a meat dress in 1982 to protest against what she believed to be the perception of women by men. Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, [...] "... it has many interpretations. For me this evening, if we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights pretty soon, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as <b>much</b> rights as the meat on our own bones. And, I am not a piece of meat." [...] She explained further that she was also using the dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy.|$|R
5000|$|Teasing {{the premise}} of season two in April 2016, Klemmer stated, [...] "We're coming {{at it from a}} {{completely}} different angle. We're determined to make every part of season two feel like its own show. first episode of season two will very much be a new pilot with new good guys, new bad guys, new stakes, new dynamics, new goals. The team will basically <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find a new purpose. Once you save the world, what do you do then?... The fact that the world was in peril sort of forced our team to fall into its own dysfunctional version of lockstep. Season two, they're no longer <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be hunted by Time Masters. They're no longer <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be burdened with <b>having</b> <b>to</b> save the world. It's no longer <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be about saving Miranda and Jonas. The interesting thing about season two is I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>much,</b> much different tone because our Legends are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a totally different purpose. They're actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a totally different constitution. There will be new faces and new everything." [...] The season also introduced members of the Justice Society of America. The Society consisted of Hourman, Vixen, Commander Steel, Obsidian, Stargirl and Dr. Mid-Nite. The season also featured a version of the Legion of Doom, composed of the Reverse-Flash, Malcolm Merlyn, Damien Darhk and Captain Cold.|$|R
5000|$|Brenner knew {{early that}} he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> of a career in {{professional}} baseball. While still playing with the Mets, coach Birdie Tebbetts watched him pitch a terrible game. When Tebbetts came out to the mound, Brenner asked him what was wrong. Tebbetts replied, [...] "Horse-spit pitcher"—and Brenner knew his time in the big leagues was finished. While playing minor league baseball, Brenner attended Temple University and then Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. He graduated from Saint Joseph's with a bachelor's degree in political science and Communication studies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{survey of}} 665 clubs showed that 56% {{were in the}} red {{at the end of}} the 2010 {{financial}} year. Although UEFA pointed to some improvements in the situation such as the 6.6% rise in overall income, a small drop in the proportion of clubs' revenue going on players' wages, and an increase in the number of home-grown players in the Champions League, these were the worst statistics on record. UEFA's head of legal affairs, Alistair Bell, said, [...] "The system is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> credibility if a big club that is in serious breach of the rules is not punished in an effective way. For me the sanctions need to be effective enough that people come into compliance with the system, otherwise clubs are going to become disillusioned rapidly." ...|$|E

500|$|Gaga was {{the most}} {{nominated}} artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for Video of the Year (the first female artist to achieve this feat). She arrived in an Alexander McQueen dress and changed into a Giorgio Armani number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t {{stand up for what}} we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as <b>much</b> rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote. [...] "But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?" ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{accepting}} her {{award for}} Video of the Year, presented by legendary singer and actress Cher, Lady Gaga wore a dress made entirely from cuts of raw meat. The dress bore a resemblance to an artwork, Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic, created by Canadian artist Jana Sterbak in 1987. Along with the dress, her hat, shoes, and purse were all made from meat as well. PETA president Ingrid Newkirk {{issued a statement}} concerning the controversial outfit. After questioning whether the meat was real or not, Newkirk was quick to disparage Gaga saying, [...] "Meat is the decomposing flesh of a tormented animal who didn't want to die, {{and after a few}} hours under the TV lights, it would smell like the rotting flesh it is and likely be crawling in maggots--not too attractive, really." [...] Franc Fernandez, the designer of the meat dress, said later in an interview with MTV, “...it's not a sticky meat. It's not a messy dress at all, surprisingly. ... It's actually very clean meat, very sturdy and strong and doesn't run at all. ... The meat dries out, rather than rotting. It becomes jerky.” Gaga later explained to Ellen DeGeneres that the outfit exhibited her disapproval with the United States military's Don't ask, don't tell policy and further clarified, [...] "If we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights, pretty soon we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as <b>much</b> rights as the meat on our own bones. And I am not a piece of meat." [...] She also commented on the outfit's nature, [...] "...it is certainly no disrespect to anyone that is vegan or vegetarian. As you know, I am the most judgment-free human being on the earth." [...] Afterwards, DeGeneres, who is a vegan, jokingly gave Gaga a bikini and skirt made from lettuce and other various vegetables.|$|R
5000|$|After the murder, Michael makes a [...] "startling" [...] {{change in}} {{behavior}} by not showing any emotional reaction, believing Claudia deserved what she got, and justifying his actions {{to save his}} mother and sister. However, Michael only feels guilty {{because he did not}} come forward about his flashbacks sooner and knows he could have prevented the situation. When it comes to Claudia, [...] "Michael is in a very dark place," [...] said Garrett to Soap Opera Digest. The reckless behavior is Michael's attempt {{to live up to the}} Corinthos reputation, even going so far as to sic Sonny's goons on Kristina's jerk boyfriend, Kiefer Bauer (Christian Alexander). Despite Sonny's disapproval, Michael is more than determined to join Sonny's organization. Michael feels invincible believing he got away with what he did because of who his father is. Most of Michael's decisions are a source of conflict for his parents. Michael constantly insinuates himself into Sonny's business, despite Carly and Jason's disapproval. Sonny disapproves too, but believes keeping Michael close will protect him. Weeks prior to his 18th birthday, Michael warns his parental figures that he will start making decisions for himself. From the moment Michael realizes that Sonny might be convicted, Michael returns home with the evidence (his bloody shirt) in hand. However, Dante does not believe Michael's claims of guilt until after a forensics exam confirms them. According to Duell, Michael is in turmoil because no one wants him to confess. Dante tells Michael that if he comes forward, the judge will give him a lighter sentence. Duell stated: [...] "Dante thinks I need to get it off my chest. Of course he wants Sonny in prison, but he doesn't want me to hold this burden on myself. He wants me to get it out of my system." [...] Dante relays Michael's story to the entire courtroom moments before the verdict for Sonny is delivered. When asked about Michael's future following the murder confession, Duell said, [...] "A different life. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go through a big change. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a <b>much</b> different lifestyle." ...|$|R
5000|$|Adventure Gamers rated it 2.5 stars, writing [...] "You {{certainly}} won’t {{be missing}} a classic if you skip it, but for Xbox fans starved for adventure, Life in the Dorms is an admirable comedic effort that works {{enough of the}} time to consider its student-friendly price tag." [...] In a negative review, Indie Gamer Ckick said [...] "This {{is one of the}} most clunky, cumbersome, awful interfaces I’ve ever seen. It’s like Life in the Dorms is overdosing from that slow-motion drug from Dredd. I just want to move the plot forward with as little resistance as possible. Yet every rinky dinky action requires Dack to turn and face the camera to address the situation, in what I can only guess is an attempt to break down the fourth wall. [...] " [...] Rating the game a 6 out of 10, ThisIsXbox summed up its review saying [...] "Life in the Dorms has its ups and downs. It has a pretty cool graphical style with sprites that sort of resemble Xbox LIVE Avatars. The storyline isn’t bad and most of the characters are unique rather than just flat cardboard cutouts. On the other hand, the game progresses at such a leisurely pace that if you aren’t already a fan of the point-and-click genre in general, you probably aren’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> fun with this game. It doesn’t help things that the same background music just drones on and on and on the whole time." ...|$|E
40|$|Teacher {{education}} has too largely concerned {{itself with a}} study of schooling rather than a study of education. In the next generation, given the concerns that I’ve talked about, we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look <b>much</b> more intensively, on the one hand, at how much human beings learn as biological creatures and, on the other hand, at all the cultural and legal constraints on learning that exist. We will look at education in industry, in the community, in community action programs, in the tribal council, education through ritual, and through play, {{as well as through}} public schooling. The job of the graduate educator will be to know how people learn in order to create the legal, economic, and community mechanisms to help people learn in community how to achieve fulfillment in community. The pressure of the job market, of society, and of the law on the graduate teacher educator is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> move many graduate educators to become community clinicians—working in such areas as law, validation, economics, epistemology, and community building. In the future I look for the development of school-community teacher training centers. Graduate teacher educators, clinicians, will be hired by school districts and higher education. The group which will determine the day-to-day job of the teacher educator, the perimeters of that job, would be the parents themselves, and the children. The teacher educator will be the servant of the community. When I speak of the school-community teacher training center, I am talking about the general movement in this country toward combining the human services and centering them in the schools or centering them in single agencies...|$|R
