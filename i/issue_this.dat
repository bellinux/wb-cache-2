5|$|SR 275 {{began as}} part of Legislative Route 6, one of the shorter main routes of the initial system funded by the 1910 bond <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> highway, which {{included}} the several-mile-long Yolo Causeway, connected Sacramento with the northsouth Route 7 at Davis, thereby linking the capital city with the San Francisco Bay Area. Route 6 traffic initially left Sacramento on the 1911 I Street Bridge, heading southwest through the small settlement of Washington via D Street, 5th Street, and present Tower Court to West Capitol Avenue. The state highway {{was moved to the}} M Street Bridge in 1926, {{as part of}} an improvement that also took it through a two-lane subway under the Sacramento Northern Railroad, still present on West Capitol Avenue. The M Street Bridge was replaced by the Tower Bridge in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5|$|The Sustainment Brigade and its {{soldiers}} {{have been the subject}} of numerous army publications during its tours in Iraq, most of which having to do with the culture and lifestyle of soldiers serving the unit. Among these have been feature stories by the Multi-National Force: Iraq public affairs office, on married soldiers who deploy together. The Army Logistician, an Army publication for soldiers serving in support units, published a feature story on the stories of soldiers serving in Iraq for their Septemberâ€“October 2007 <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> story was intended to display the versatility of sustainment brigades overall. Another story was written for defenselink.mil, the press service for the United States Armed Forces in March 2007 about soldiers of the brigade and how they react to the desert climate of the country, having to cope with sandstorms and other issues.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{spent the}} next few years in Selsey, where he founded an episcopal see and {{converted}} the pagan inhabitants of the Kingdom of Sussex to Christianity. Theodore and Wilfrid settled their differences, and Theodore urged the new Northumbrian king, Aldfrith, to allow Wilfrid's return. Aldfrith agreed to do so, but in 691 he expelled Wilfrid again. Wilfrid went to Mercia, where he helped missionaries and acted as bishop for the Mercian king. Wilfrid appealed to the papacy about his expulsion in 700, and the pope ordered that an English council should be held to decide the <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> council, held at Austerfield in 702, attempted to confiscate all of Wilfrid's possessions, and so Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal against the decision. His opponents in Northumbria excommunicated him, but the papacy upheld Wilfrid's side, and he regained possession of Ripon and Hexham, his Northumbrian monasteries. Wilfrid died in 709 or 710. After his death, he was venerated as a saint.|$|E

25|$|The Trident {{emerged in}} {{response}} to a call by the state-owned British European Airways Corporation (BEA) for a jet airliner for its premier West European routes. BEA had been induced by the government to <b>issue</b> <b>this</b> call despite its unwillingness to buy a large jet fleet. The airline's requirements fluctuated greatly in the 1950s and a decade later evolved radically away from what the Trident could offer. Adherence to BEA's changing specification was widely seen as limiting the Trident's appeal to other airlines and delaying its service entry.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{called for}} the People's Republic of China to resolve the {{territorial}} dispute.

25|$|In the 1970s de Beauvoir became {{active in}} France's women's liberation movement.

Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir, but given the secrecy surrounding the <b>issue,</b> <b>this</b> cannot be known. Signatories were diverse as Catherine Deneuve, Delphine Seyrig and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.|$|E
25|$|The Vernon Greene/Walter Gibson Shadow {{newspaper}} {{comic strip}} {{from the early}} 1940s was collected by Malibu Graphics (Malibu Comics) under their Eternity Comics imprint, beginning with {{the first issue of}} Crime Classics dated July 1988.

Some of the Shadow storylines were contained in one issue, while others were continued over into the next. When a Shadow story ended, another tale would begin in the same <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> back-to-back format continued until the final 13th issue, when the strip storylines ended.|$|E
25|$|Court cases {{challenging}} BSL {{have focused}} on constitutional concerns such as substantive due process, equal protection, and vagueness.

Because state and local jurisdictions enjoy broad police powers, including protecting the public's safety and welfare, courts have not had trouble finding that BSL is rationally related to the goal of protecting the public from allegedly dangerous breeds.|$|E

25|$|According to a 2007 {{study by}} MacPherson, {{prenatal}} Diagnostic Techniques Act (PCPNDT Act) was highly publicized by NGOs and the government. Many {{of the ads}} used depicted abortion as violent, creating fear of abortion itself within the population. The ads focused on the religious and moral shame associated with abortion. MacPherson claims this media campaign was not effective because some perceived this as an attack on their character, leading to many becoming closed off, rather than opening a dialogue about the <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> emphasis on morality, claims MacPherson, increased fear and shame associated with all abortions, leading {{to an increase in}} unsafe abortions in India.|$|E
25|$|Teacher {{dissatisfaction with}} {{representation}} {{by the three}} Trinidad unions had grown in the 1970s. There was the view that adversarial relations between the three units had severely hampered Industrial Relations in the Teaching Service. As early as 1966 there was a struggle {{between two of the}} three unions to be the sole representative for any class of, or classes of teachers. The Special Tribunal No. 10 of 1974, which stated that any one of the three unions could represent any class or classes of teachers decided this <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> resulted in rapid changes of membership among teachers. However, not one of these unions emerged as the majority union.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{election}} of 1844, Whig candidate Henry Clay and the presumed Democratic candidate, former President Van Buren, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas, each hoping to keep the troublesome topic from becoming a campaign <b>issue.</b> <b>This</b> unexpectedly led to Van Buren being dropped by the Democrats in favor of Polk, who favored annexation. Polk tied the Texas annexation question with the Oregon dispute, thus providing a sort of regional compromise on expansion. (Expansionists in the North were more inclined to promote the occupation of Oregon, while Southern expansionists focused primarily on the annexation of Texas.) Although elected by a very slim margin, Polk proceeded as if his victory had been a mandate for expansion.|$|E
