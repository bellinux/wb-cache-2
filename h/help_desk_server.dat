This chapter describes the development of <b>help</b> <b>desk,</b> ranging from <b>help</b> <b>desk</b> structures to support tools. This chapter also discusses the application of knowledge management techniques {{in the development of a}} proposed conceptual knowledge management framework and a proposed redistributed knowledge management framework. While the conceptual knowledge management framework proposes a standard methodology to manage <b>help</b> <b>desk</b> knowledge, the proposed redistributed knowledge management framework allows simple and routine enquiries to be rerouted to a user self-help knowledge management system. The proposed system also enables <b>help</b> <b>desk</b> to provide technical knowledge to users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

In response to the increasing demand for support of this desktop equipment, <b>Help</b> <b>Desks</b> were formed. <b>Help</b> <b>Desks</b> have since become an important function of the organisation and {{have been the subject of}} much research on topics such as the ratio of <b>Help</b> <b>Desk</b> staff to users, the prescriptions and functions of <b>Help</b> <b>Desks,</b> and user satisfaction with <b>Help</b> <b>Desk</b> support.

Overall, the results of the survey showed that there is no difference between the In-house and the Outsourced <b>Help</b> <b>Desk</b> Support Model in end user satisfaction and efficiency.
