50|$|A {{crevasse}} splay is a sedimentary <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> {{which forms}} when a stream breaks its natural or artificial levees and deposits sediment on a floodplain. A breach that forms a crevasse splay deposits sediments in similar pattern to an alluvial fan deposit. Once the levee has been breached the {{water flows out}} of its channel. As the water spreads onto the flood plain sediments will start {{to fall out of}} suspension as the water loses energy. The resulting deposition can create graded deposits similar to those found in Bouma sequences. In some cases crevasse splays can cause a river to abandon its old river channel, a process known as avulsion. Breaches that form a crevasse splay deposits occur most commonly on the outside banks of meanders where the water has the highest energy. Crevasse splay deposits can range in size. Larger deposits can be 6 m thick at the levee and spread 2 km wide, while smaller deposits may only be 1 cm thick.|$|E
50|$|Huangling Complex {{represents}} {{a group of}} rock units appear {{in the middle of}} Yangtze Block in South China, distributed across Yixingshan, Zigui, Huangling and Yichang counties. The group of rock involves nonconformity that sedimentary rocks overlie the metamorphic basement. It is a 73-km long, asymmetrical dome-shaped anticline with axial plane orientating in north-south direction. It has a steeper west flank and a gentler east flank. Basically, there are three tectonic units from the anticline core to the rim, including Archean to Paleoproterozoic metamorphic basement, Neoproterozoic to Jurassic sedimentary rocks and Cretaceous <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> sedimentary cover. The northern part of the core is mainly tonalite-trondhjemite-gneiss (TTG) and Cretaceous sedimentary rock, it is called the Archean Kongling Complex. The middle of the core is mainly the Neoproterozoic granitoid. The southern part of the core is the Neoproterozoic potassium granite. Two basins are situated on the western and eastern flanks of the core respectively, including the Zigui basin and Dangyang basin. Both basins are synforms while Zigui basin has a larger extent of folding. Yuanan Graben and Jingmen Graben are found within Dangyang Basin area. Huangling Complex is an important area that helps unravel the tectonic history of South China Craton because it has well-exposed layers of rock units from Archean basement rock to Cretaceous sedimentary rock cover due to the erosion of the anticline.|$|E

40|$|In {{the search}} for life on Mars, {{investigating}} <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> will be {{a high priority for}} future landers. Although there is abundant evidence that fluvial processes worked with great intensity in the past (e. g., outflow channels, valley networks, and modified impact craters), aeolian processes dominate under the current environmental conditions. In fact there is evidence that extensive aeolian deposits may have filled in valley networks [1] and even shallow depressions where water may have ponded [2]. Thus, quite often there may be a disparity between the geology identified by orbital data and the geology accessible to a lander. Determining where <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> occur on the surface is important for addressing NASA's goal to "follow the water. " In order to do that, however, existing remote sensing data must be evaluated and a set of diagnostic criteria for recognizing <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> must be established. To that end, we are conducting a first order analysis of the thermal characteristics of fluvial and aeolian materials collected from central Australia...|$|R

50|$|The {{course of}} the Brahmaputra River has changed {{drastically}} {{in the past two}} and a half centuries, moving its river course westwards for a distance of about 80 km, leaving its old river course, appropriately named the old Brahmaputra river, behind. In the past, the floodplain of the old river course had soils which were more properly formed compared to graded sediments on the operating Jamuna river. This change of river course resulted in modifications to the soil-forming process, which include acidification, breakdown of clays and buildup of organic matter, with the soils showing an increasing amount of biotic homogenization, mottling, coating arounds Peds and maturing soil arrangement, shape and pattern. In the future, the consequences of local ground subsidence coupled with flood prevention propositions, for instance localised breakwaters, that increase flood-plain water depths outside the water breakers, may alter the water levels of the floodplains. Throughout the years, bars, scroll bars and sand dunes are formed {{at the edge of the}} flood plain by deposition. The height difference of the channel topography is often not more than 1m-2m. Furthermore, flooding over history of the river has caused the formation of river levees due to deposition from overbank flow. The height difference between the levee top and the surrounding floodplains is typically 1m along small channels and 2-3m along major channels. Crevasse splay, a sedimentary <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> which forms when a stream breaks its natural or artificial levees and deposits sediment on a floodplain, are often formed due to a breach in levee, forming a lobe of sediments which progrades onto the adjacent floodplain. Lastly, flood basins are often formed between the levees of adjacent rivers.|$|E

40|$|The Late Permian to Middle Triassic Narrabeen Group {{succession}} {{is mostly}} composed of fluviatile deposits and was {{deposited in the}} retro-arc foreland Sydney Basin, Australia. Two major sources were present: the New England Magmatic Belt towards {{the north and the}} Lachlan Fold Belt in the west. Detailed outcrop, borehole and laboratory studies, using the concepts of sequence stratigraphy and genetic relationships between the strata, were used to study the lithofacies in detail and delineate depositional sequences, depositional complexes and depositional systems. Three depositional sequences are recognised. The major part of the studied succession belongs to the Narrabeen depositional sequence. However, the lowermost and uppermost depositional systems belong to the Illawarra depositional sequence and Hawkesbury depositional sequence respectively. The basin-wide erosional surface {{at the base of the}} Scarborough depositional system is considered to be the lower boundary of the Narrabeen depositional sequence and upper boundary of the Illawarra depositional sequence. The hiatal surface at the top of the Bald Hill Claystone marks upper boundary of the Narrabeen depositional sequence and lower boundary of the Hawkesbury depositional sequence. Based on detailed lithofacies and bounding surfaces analysis, architectural element studies and palaeohydrology, one depositional complex and six depositional systems are recognised. In an ascending stratigraphic order, they are: the Wombarra depositional system including mixed-load <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> A (Coal Cliff Sandstone Member), bed-load <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> A (Otford Sandstone Member) and floodplain deposit A (Wombarra Shale); Scarborough depositional system including bed-load <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> B (Scarborough Sandstone) and floodplain deposit B (Stanwell Park Claystone); Bulgo depositional complex including bed-load <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> C (lower Bulgo Sandstone), braidplain <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> (middle Bulgo Sandstone), mixed-load <b>fluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> B (upper Bulgo Sandstone) and floodplain deposit C (Bald Hill Claystone); and Newport depositional system including Garie Claystone Member (a tuffaceous unit) and lagoonal to lacustrine deposits (Newport Formation). Based on detailed sedimentological studies and considering the genetic relationships between the strata, eight modifications to the currently-accepted stratigraphy are recommended. The W ombarra depositional system has a strong affinity with the Illawarra Coal Measures and should be excluded from the Narrabeen Group and included in the former. The Coal Cliff Sandstone is degraded to member status and together with the Otford Sandstone, form two sandstone members in the newly defined Wombarra Formation. The Narrabeen Group, as defined in this study starts with the Scarborough Sandstone and terminates with the Bald Hill Claystone. The Newport Formation rests on a hiatal surface at the top of the Bald Hill Claystone and has a strong genetic relationship with the Hawkesbury Sandstone. It is recommended that the Newport Formation be excluded from the Narrabeen Group. The Garie Formation is down-graded to member status and termed Garie Claystone Member of the newly defined Newport Formation. The Gosford Subgroup is recommended to be upgraded to a group status to accommodate the genetically-related Newport Formation (including Garie Claystone Member), Terrigal Formation, Hawkesbury Sandstone and Mittagong Formation. In terms of sequence stratigraphy, four new terms are defined based on two controlling factors: major sedimentation processes (aggradational versus progradational) and tectonism (syntectonic versus post-tectonic). These new terms are: Syntectonic Aggradational Systems Tract (SAST); Syntectonic Progradational Systems Tract (SPST); Post-tectonic Progradational Systems Tract (PPST); and Post-tectonic Aggradational Systems Tract (PAST). These new terms are successfully applied to interpret the Sydney Basin development (a foreland basin), but they have potential to be applied on other types of basins as well. In contrast to previous studies, the lower fine-grained sequences in the studied succession are considered to be syn tectonic (excluding the uppermost fine-grained units) and the major coarse-grained sequences are considered to be post-tectonic. These deposits have been laid down in two tectonic cycles. The mostly fine-grained deposits of the Wombarra depositional system (uppermost part of the Illawarra Coal Measures) was deposited during extensive basin subsidence resulting from compaction of the underlying coal-bearing sequence and basin floor flexure related to the thrust-front loading in the northern part of the basin. The Wombarra depositional system represents the SAST of the first tectonic cycle. Alluvial fan deposits of the Munmorah Conglomerate close to the thrust belt are considered to be a SPST of the same cycle. Rebounding of the basin floor, due to the erosion of the thrust belt, caused uplifting of the proximal parts of the basin, and resulted in progradation of the coarse-grained materials farther into the basin. The PPST of the Scarborough Sandstone was formed at this time and marks the end of the first tectonic cycle. The second tectonic cycle constitutes the SAST of the Stanwell Park Claystone, SPST of coarse-grained units close to the thrust belt and PPST of the Bulgo Sandstone. The Bald Hill Claystone and Newport Formation are considered to be PAST in nature. This study revealed that the new concepts in foreland basin development are quite applicable to the Sydney Basin. It also was revealed that sequence stratigraphic concepts can be implemented on fluviatile deposits. This study also emphasised the importance of genetic relationships between strata in a succession for solving stratigraphic problems...|$|E
