5000|$|The High Court {{consists}} of three divisions: the Queen's Bench Division, the Chancery Division, and the Family Division. Their jurisdictions overlap in some cases, and cases started in one division may be transferred by court order to another where appropriate. The differences of procedure and practice between divisions are partly historical, derived from the separate courts which were merged into the single High Court by the 19th-century Judicature Acts, but are mainly driven by the usual nature of their work, for example, conflicting evidence of fact is quite commonly given in person in the Queen's Bench Division, but <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> <b>affidavit</b> is more usual in the Chancery Division which is primarily concerned with points of law.|$|E

Ltd. Vs Rashtriya Girni Kamgar Sangh, citation 1960 AIR571, 1960 SCR(2) 841). Therefore, an affidavit cannot ordinarily be used as evidence in absence of a specific order of the Court.|$|R

50|$|Tradition {{holds that}} this {{reorganization}} came in 1841 {{under the aegis}} of Francophile Melkite Patriarch Maximos III. The evidence for this, albeit quite plausible, is circumstantial due to the destruction of pertinent records during the 1860 Druze/Marionite Mount Lebanon conflagration and further ruination of Patriarchal papers at Al-Ain in the 1983 civil war. Nevertheless, a reorganization indisputably occurred under Patriarch Cyril VIII who became the order’s protector for a while in 1911 as did later patriarchs——all safely before the canonical extinction year of 1957. The debate about the historicity of the 1941 Melkite protection is moot, as the Declaration of Kevelaer in 2012 issued by Patriarch Gregorios III Laham, the current Melkite granting authority, confirms, <b>by</b> <b>affidavit,</b> the 1841 advent of the Melkite protection.|$|R
