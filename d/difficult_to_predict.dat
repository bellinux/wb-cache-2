5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars {{much more quickly than}} would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> future developments.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict.</b> Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the US 1st Cavalry Division {{suffered}} 770 killed, 2,613 wounded, 62 captured {{during its}} time at Pusan Perimeter. This included about 600 casualties, with around 200 {{killed in action}} it had already suffered during the Battle of Taegu the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 14,703 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. South Korean casualties at the battle were <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict,</b> but also thought to be heavy. The ROK 1st Division had numbered 10,482 men September 1.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur. Problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions, short-term memory loss, dementia, amnesia, psychosis, irritability, a strange gait, speech disturbances, Parkinson's disease-like syndromes, cortical blindness, and a depressed mood. Depression may occur in {{those who did not}} have pre-existing depression. These delayed neurological sequelae may occur in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days. It is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial neurological abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport of chance yet some players claim skill is involved. Some strategies involve the way in which the stick is held before it is dropped and trying to find the fastest route in the river. Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, Schott’s Sporting, Gaming and Idling Miscellany, but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> and may vary according to the season.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications {{used to treat}} MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy can help with people's ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, {{despite a lack of}} evidence. The long-term outcome is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict,</b> with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. Life expectancy is on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash {{can have}} a {{detrimental}} {{impact on the environment}} which can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone. Natural waterways can be impacted {{in the same way as}} urban water supply networks. Ash will increase water turbidity which can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. Acidification will also occur, which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment. Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
5|$|It is {{extremely}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; {{a very large}} batch of the molecules is prepared, and {{a wide variety of}} crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E

Various trends have, however, been identified. The work function tends to be smaller for metals with an open lattice, and larger for metals in which the atoms are closely packed. It is somewhat higher on dense crystal faces than open crystal faces, also depending on surface reconstructions for the given crystal face.|$|R
