It assumed {{authority for}} the 177th Fighter Interceptor <b>Group</b> <b>at</b> Atlantic City Air National Guard Base and the 125th Fighter Interceptor <b>Group</b> <b>at</b> Jacksonville Air National Guard Base. Both units flew the F-106. It also assumed command of the 107th Fighter Interceptor <b>Group</b> <b>at</b> Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and the 147th Fighter Interceptor <b>Group</b> <b>at</b> Ellington Field, Texas. The latter two flew the F-4C Phantom.|$|E

Meanwhile, Andrea is rescued by Michonne and the two {{discover}} Woodbury, a fortified town led by a man known as the Governor. He learns of Rick's <b>group</b> <b>at</b> the prison, leading to conflict between the groups. Rick's group eventually raids and destroys Woodbury, but the Governor has Andrea ultimately killed and escapes. Woodbury's citizens live with Rick’s <b>group</b> <b>at</b> the prison.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen's <b>group</b> <b>at</b> Caltech and Robert Henderson's <b>group</b> <b>at</b> Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E

5|$|Transport {{aircraft}} {{were controlled}} by the 54th Troop Carrier Wing, which was commanded by Colonel Paul H. Prentiss, with his headquarters at Port Moresby. He had two groups under his command: the 374th Troop Carrier <b>Group</b> <b>at</b> Ward's Field and the 375th Troop Carrier <b>Group</b> <b>at</b> Dobodura, plus the 65th and 66th Troop Carrier Squadrons of the 403rd Troop Carrier <b>Group</b> <b>at</b> Jackson's Field. In addition, Prentiss could draw on the 317th Troop Carrier <b>Group</b> <b>at</b> Archerfield Airport and RAAF Base Townsville, {{although it was not}} under his command. Postponing the operation from August to September 1943 allowed for the arrival of the 433rd Troop Carrier Group from the United States. Each squadron was equipped with 13 C-47 aircraft, and each group consisted of four squadrons, for a total of 52 aircraft per group.|$|E

5|$|Four {{universities}} {{provided the}} locations where the experiments were taking place. The laboratory at the University of Birmingham {{was responsible for}} all the theoretical work, such as what size of critical mass was needed for an explosion. It was run by Peierls, {{with the help of}} fellow German refugee scientist Klaus Fuchs. The laboratories at the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford experimented with different types of isotope separation. Chadwick's <b>group</b> <b>at</b> Liverpool dealt with thermal diffusion, which worked {{based on the assumption that}} different isotopes of uranium are attracted to different temperatures. Franz Simon's <b>group</b> <b>at</b> Oxford investigated the gaseous diffusion of isotopes. This method works on the principle that at differing pressures uranium 235 would diffuse through a barrier faster than uranium 238. Eventually the most promising method of separation was gaseous diffusion. Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather's <b>group</b> <b>at</b> Cambridge investigated whether another element, now called plutonium, could be used as an explosive compound. Because of the French scientists, Oxford also obtained the world's only supply of heavy water, which helped them theorise how uranium could be used for power.|$|E
