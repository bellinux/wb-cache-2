5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks at the woman from the page. His pencil-drawn <b>hand</b> <b>reaches</b> out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E
500|$|A trapper in a canoe takes Totor up the river. Leaving the trapper, Totor {{goes back}} to the ranch to find it deserted. [...] As he {{searches}} the place a <b>hand</b> <b>reaches</b> out and pulls him through a doorway where a fierce brawl ensues in the darkness. Totor is victorious, and throws his three captors out of the building. [...] He discovers his uncle tied to a chair; Totor frees him, and Pad tells his nephew that the bandits kidnapped his aunt Save. [...] Totor suddenly has an idea to use the treasure he found as a ransom for his aunt. [...] The two of them set out to go fetch it, but along the way a criminal steals their map while they sleep. After discovering the loss of their jewels they follow the thief's unique footprints for a few miles. [...] When they see another set of footprints join the first and then head up into some mountains, Totor continues on his own. Having eluded several Native sentries he spies the chest {{in the hands of the}} Chief. After recovering the box and outrunning the Natives back to his uncle, they hurriedly head home. [...] There they find a ransom note from the leader of the bandits, Jim Blackcat, saying to meet them under a big fir tree that day or they would kill his aunt. [...] Totor rushes to the rendezvous where he overwhelms the criminals and orders them to tell him where they are keeping his aunt hostage. After a heroic rescue and an emotional reunion between his aunt and uncle, he finds out that it is time for him to go back to Belgium. Once back, he tells everyone of his adventures and wistfully yearns for more.|$|E
2500|$|An {{improved}} {{version is}} currently in development at Loughborough University, which will add visual feedback by showing {{a representation of the}} bowler projected onto a screen.

[...] This version of the machine is intended for mass production, so it can be sold to cricket clubs around the world.

50|$|The {{realization}} of this vision started when Frankl met Dr. Stephen R. Covey, educator, businessman, and bestselling {{author of the}} The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. They {{decided it was time}} to move past conversation. Covey contacted world-renowned sculptor Gary Lee Price and asked him to sculpt the concept of the Statue of Responsibility. Gary, an award-winning sculptor and Fellow of the National Sculpture Society, envisioned a statue depicting a <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> up for help with another <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> down in a clasping position. The hands are symbolic of Responsibility: in different times of our lives we are the <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> up for help or the <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> down to lift others.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} the after-reach hazard using a power press simulator. The after-reach hazard occurs when a worker reaches into the point of operation on a power press after initiating the downstroke of the press ram. The <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> capabilities of industrial power press operators were measured to quantify <b>hand</b> <b>reach</b> speed and to determine variables which may affect after-reach movement times. The results of this study identified three variables which may be important in characterizing a worker's ability to make rapid <b>hand</b> <b>reach</b> movements: age, gender, and the location of the dual palm button workstation. Another key finding was that male workers, 30 years of age and younger, had the fastest <b>hand</b> <b>reach</b> speed of all groups tested and appear to be at the greatest risk of sustaining a traumatic injury due to the after-reach hazard...|$|R
2500|$|As {{he heads}} towards the Safe Point, he is cornered by {{a herd of}} Shadows. However, before they can attack him, a <b>hand</b> <b>reaches</b> up from a manhole and drags him down into the sewers. Wayne is knocked unconscious, and {{experiences}} flashbacks of his life before the outbreak, mingled with vague memories of returning to his home upon {{the onset of the}} Shadows. Waking up in the sewers, he meets the [...] "Rat"; an old man who has turned the sewer system into an elaborate series of booby traps to protect himself from both Shadows and the New Law. The Rat tells Wayne if he can make it through the traps, he will help him find his friends. When Wayne does so, the Rat tells him that his teenage son is missing, and asks Wayne to find him, promising him that if he does so, the Rat will search for information on Wayne's family and friends.|$|E

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that grasping with the left hand is more vulnerable to visual size illusions than grasping with the right hand. The present study investigated whether this increased sensitivity of the left hand for visual context extends to reaching. Left- and right-handed participants reached for targets embedded in two different visual contexts with either left or right hands. Visual context was manipulated by presenting targets either in a blank field or within an array of placeholders marking possible target locations. Regardless of handedness, the presence of placeholders affected left hand, but not right <b>hand,</b> <b>reaching</b> by improving end-point accuracy and reducing movement speed. Furthermore, left <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> was more accurate for far than near targets, whereas right <b>hand</b> <b>reaching</b> showed the opposite pattern. We discuss two possible hemispheric lateralization accounts of these findings...|$|R
