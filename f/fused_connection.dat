40|$|Historically batter piles {{were used}} to resist lateral forces in marine structures. However, due to poor {{performance}} in recent earthquakes, plumb piles are now the system of choice. Nevertheless, there are situations where batter piles are desirable, for example, where the new structure has to be compatible with an existing batter pile structure or has high service-level lateral loading conditions such as ship mooring.

It {{is closely related to}} Cryptococcus neoformans and diverged from a common ancestor ∼ 40 million years ago. While C. gattii has a characterized sexual cycle dependent upon a dimorphic region of the genome known as the MAT locus, mating has rarely been observed in this species. In this study, we identify for the first time clinical (both human and veterinary) and environmental isolates from Australia that retain sexual fecundity. A collection of 120 isolates from a variety of geographic locations was analyzed for molecular type, mating type, and the ability to develop mating structures when cocultured with fertile tester strains. Nine isolates produced dikaryotic filaments with paired nuclei, <b>fused</b> clamp <b>connections,</b> and basidiospores. DNA sequence analysis of three genes (URA 5, the MATα-specific SXI 1 α gene, and the MATa-specific SXI 2 a gene) revealed little or no variability in URA 5 and SXI 2 a, respectively. However across the 108 MATα strains sequenced, the SXI 1 α gene was found to exist as 11 different alleles. Phylogenetic analysis found most variation to occur in the more fertile genotypes. Although some lineages of Australian C. gattii have retained the ability to mate, the majority of isolates were sterile, suggesting that asexuality is the dominant mode of propagation in these populations...|$|R

50|$|Gorgodon is an extinct genus of basal synapsid. The genus is monotypic, {{known only}} from the type species Gorgodon minutus from the Early Permian of the southwestern United States.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the correlational and casual connection between identity and intimacy development in later adolescents using lagged data and multiple measures of each construct. Developmental paths were hypothesized from four theoretically based models and designed to investigate gender and sex role orientation differences in the relationship of identity and intimacy formation. Identity was measured by the Revised Version of the Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status. Both identity and intimacy were assessed by the Erikson Psychosocial Stage Inventory and the Inventory of Psychosocial Development. The Bem Sex Role Inventory and the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy were used to assess sex role orientation. Using a two-wave cross-lag panel design, the pattern of correlational dominance between identity and intimacy was examined and directionality inferred. The results indicate that when examining gender differences, with sex role identification removed from the assessment of identity and intimacy, identity appears to be a dominant precursor to intimacy for both sexes. However, sex role orientation does appear to mediate the identity/intimacy relationship, where for males femininity enhances the identity/intimacy association but does not change the general male pattern of identity predicting intimacy. For females, a masculine sex role orientation results in a pattern similar to either masculine or feminine males, while femininity is associated with a more <b>fused</b> <b>connection</b> between identity and intimac...|$|E

40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans is a human-pathogenic fungus {{that has}} evolved into three {{distinct}} varieties that infect most prominently the central nervous system. A sexual cycle involving haploid cells of a and α mating types has been reported for two varieties (C. neoformans var. neoformans, serotype D, and C. neoformans var. gattii, serotypes B and C), yet {{the vast majority of}} infections involve a distinct variety (C. neoformans var. grubii, serotype A) that has been thought to be clonal and restricted to the α mating type. We recently identified the first serotype A isolate of the a mating type which had been thought to be extinct (strain 125. 91). Here we report that this unusual strain can mate with a subset of pathogenic serotype A strains to produce a filamentous dikaryon with <b>fused</b> clamp <b>connections,</b> basidia, and viable recombinant basidiospores. One meiotic segregant mated poorly with the serotype A reference strain H 99 but robustly with a crg 1 mutant that lacks a regulator of G protein signaling and is hyperresponsive to mating pheromone. This meiotic segregant was used to create congenic a and α mating type serotype A strains. Virulence tests with rabbit and murine models of cryptococcal meningitis showed that the serotype A congenic a and α mating type strains had equivalent virulence in animal models, in contrast to previous studies linking the α mating type to increased virulence in congenic serotype D strains.

40|$|Fusion {{has been}} {{reported}} to occur in a variety of membrane systems in response to the application of certain electric currents to the medium (Zimmermann, U., 1982, Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 694 : 227 - 277). The application of a weak but continuous alternating current causes the membranes in suspension to become rearranged into the "pearl-chain" formation. Fusion can then be induced by one or more strong direct current pulses that cause pore formation. This results in the conversion of individual membranes in the "pearl-chain" formation to a single membrane with one or more hourglass constrictions that form lumens which connect the cytoplasmic compartments. As the diameter of the lumens increases, the overall membrane shape grows to one large sphere. To further characterize electric field-induced fusion, experiments were conducted using the erythrocyte ghost as a model membrane, and a new combination of electrical circuit and fusion chamber that is simpler and improved over previous systems. All odd- shaped ghosts (collapsed or partly collapsed spherical shapes, echinocytes, discocytes, and stomatocytes) in 30 mM phosphate buffer was first converted to spherocytes and then fused with increasing yields by increasing the number of pulses. After fusion, the lateral diffusion of a fluorescent lipid soluble label (Dil) from labeled to unlabeled membranes was observed to occur both with and without the appearance in phase-contrast optics of distinct communication (lumens) between cytoplasmic compartments of the <b>fused</b> membranes. <b>Connections</b> between cytoplasmic compartments, however, were unmistakable with the instant transfer of a fluorescent water-soluble label (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran) from labeled to unlabeled cytoplasmic compartments upon fusion. Although pulses still resulted in the lateral diffusion of Dil to unlabeled membranes, the presence of glycerol in the medium strongly reduced the yield of lumens observable by phase- contrast optics in fusion events. The presence of glycerol also inhibited the conversion of membranes to spherocytes, but did not inhibit the lateral diffusion of Dil from labeled to unlabeled membranes...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in fungi {{is governed}} by a specialized genomic region called the mating-type locus (MAT). The human fungal pathogenic and basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus neoformans has evolved a bipolar mating system (a, alpha) in which the MAT locus is unusually large (> 100 kb) and encodes > 20 genes including homeodomain (HD) and pheromone/receptor (P/R) genes. To understand how this unique bipolar mating system evolved, we investigated MAT in the closely related species Tsuchiyaea wingfieldii and Cryptococcus amylolentus and discovered two physically unlinked loci encoding the HD and P/R genes. Interestingly, the HD (B) locus sex-specific region is restricted (similar to 2 kb) and encodes two linked and divergently oriented homeodomain genes {{in contrast to the}} solo HD genes (SXI 1 alpha, SXI 2 a) of C. neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. The P/R (A) locus contains the pheromone and pheromone receptor genes but has expanded considerably compared to other outgroup species (Cryptococcus heveanensis) and is linked to many of the genes also found in the MAT locus of the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. Our discovery of a heterothallic sexual cycle for C. amylolentus allowed us to establish the biological roles of the sex-determining regions. Matings between two strains of opposite mating-types (A 1 B 1 xA 2 B 2) produced dikaryotic hyphae with <b>fused</b> clamp <b>connections,</b> basidia, and basidiospores. Genotyping progeny using markers linked and unlinked to MAT revealed that meiosis and uniparental mitochondrial inheritance occur during the sexual cycle of C. amylolentus. The sexual cycle is tetrapolar and produces fertile progeny of four mating-types (A 1 B 1, A 1 B 2, A 2 B 1, and A 2 B 2), but a high proportion of progeny are infertile, and fertility is biased towards one parental mating-type (A 1 B 1).

5000|$|The {{test vehicle}} was a 3/10-scale {{model of the}} Miles E.24/43 design except for the {{omission}} of the distinctive annular air intake of the full-scale aircraft. To maintain {{the center of gravity}} (c.g.) it was necessary to include a large balance weight (a!most 1/10 of total all-up weight) in the foremost section of the nose. The layout was further restricted by the need to maintain a constant c.g. position during the consumption of the fuels. This was achieved by placing a small tank ahead of the wing holding one third of the total oxidant (as well as the fuel in the shaped nose tank) and locating the main oxidant tank aft of tile wing. Other large components were placed fore and aft of the wing. In the space below and above the wing centre section were located the air, fuel, oxidant and warm-air pipes, telemetering transmitter, instruments and batteries as well as the autopilot, timing clock, wiring terminal <b>fuses</b> and the <b>connections</b> by which the test vehicle was carried on the parent aircraft.

40|$|Abstract Background Swarming {{motility}} allows microorganisms to move rapidly over surfaces. The Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus vortex exhibits advanced cooperative motility on {{agar plates}} resulting in intricate colonial patterns with geometries {{that are highly}} sensitive to the environment. The cellular mechanisms that underpin the complex multicellular organization of such a simple organism are not well understood. Results Swarming by P. vortex was studied by real-time light microscopy, by in situ scanning electron microscopy and by tracking the spread of antibiotic-resistant cells within antibiotic-sensitive colonies. When swarming, P. vortex {{was found to be}} peritrichously flagellated. Swarming by the curved cells of P. vortex occurred on an extremely wide range of media and agar concentrations (0. 3 to 2. 2 % w/v). At high agar concentrations (> 1 % w/v) rotating colonies formed that could be detached from the main mass of cells by withdrawal of cells into the latter. On lower percentage agars, cells moved in an extended network composed of interconnected "snakes" with short-term collision avoidance and sensitivity to extracts from swarming cells. P. vortex formed single Petri dish-wide "supercolonies" with a colony-wide exchange of motile cells. Swarming cells were coupled by rapidly forming, reversible and non-rigid connections to form a loose raft, apparently connected via flagella. Inhibitors of swarming (p -Nitrophenylglycerol and Congo Red) were identified. Mitomycin C was used to trigger filamentation without inhibiting growth or swarming; this facilitated dissection of the detail of swarming. Mitomycin C treatment resulted in malcoordinated swarming and abortive side branch formation and a strong tendency by a subpopulation of the cells to form minimal rotating aggregates of only a few cells. Conclusion P. vortex creates complex macroscopic colonies within which there is considerable reflux and movement and interaction of cells. Cell shape, flagellation, the aversion of cell masses to <b>fuse</b> and temporary <b>connections</b> between proximate cells to form rafts were all features of the swarming and rotation of cell aggregates. Vigorous vortex formation was social, i. e. required > 1 cell. This is the first detailed examination of the swarming behaviour of this bacterium at the cellular level. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in fungi {{is governed}} by a specialized genomic region called the mating-type locus (MAT). The ascomycetes, the largest phylum of fungi, primarily possess a bipolar mating system while the basidiomycetes, the second largest group, are mostly tetrapolar. The human fungal pathogen and basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus neoformans has evolved a bipolar mating system that encodes homeodomain (HD) and pheromone/receptor (P/R) genes. The MAT locus of C. neoformans is unusually large, spans greater than 100 kb, and encodes more than 20 genes. To understand how the pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex evolved this unique bipolar mating system, we investigated the evolution of MAT in closely and distantly related species and discovered an extant sexual cycle in Cryptococcus amylolentus. Phylogenetic analysis using a six-gene multi-locus sequencing (MLS) approach identified the most closely related species to the pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex that are currently known. The two non-pathogenic sibling species, Tsuchiyaea wingfieldii and Cryptococcus amylolentus, and the more distantly related species Filobasidiella depauperata define the Filobasidiella clade. We also resolved the phylogeny of the species located in the sister clade, Kwoniella. A comprehensive tree dendrogram revealed that the 15 Tremellales species examined suggests a common saprobic ancestor. Moreover, the pathogenic Cryptococcus species have a saprobic origin but later emerged as pathogens. We further characterized the mating-type locus for T. wingfieldii and C. amylolentus by cloning and sequencing two unlinked genomic loci encoding the HD and P/R genes. Interestingly, linked and likely divergently transcribed homologs for SXI 1 and SXI 2 are present in T. wingfieldii and C. amylolentus, while the P/R alleles contain many genes {{also found in the}} MAT locus of the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. Also, hypothetical genes present in C. neoformans MAT are also MAT-linked in both species and indicate a possible translocation event between chromosomes 4 and 5 of C. neoformans. Our analysis of MAT in the sibling species indicates that T. wingfieldii is likely tetrapolar, and the C. amylolentus sequence comparison of the dimorphic SXI 1 and SXI 2 region and the pheromone receptor, STE 3, suggests that C. amylolentus is also tetrapolar. The examination of MAT in these sibling species confirms the model for MAT evolution previously proposed in which this structure in C. neoformans and C. gattii evolved from an ancestral tetrapolar mating system. Moreover, the organization of MAT in these sibling species mirrors key aspects of the proposed intermediates in the evolution of MAT in the pathogenic Cryptococcus species, and for sex chromosomes in plants, animals, and alga in general. We discovered an extant sexual cycle for C. amylolentus, a species previously thought to be asexual. Matings between two strains of opposite mating-types produce dikaryotic hyphae with <b>fused</b> clamp <b>connections</b> and uni- and bi-nucleate basidiospores. Genotyping of basidiospores using markers linked and unlinked to MAT revealed that genetic exchange (recombination) occurs during the sexual cycle of C. amylolentus, and it is likely that either aneuploids are generated during sex or more than one meiosis event occurs within each basidium. This is in contrast to C. neoformans, where only one meiotic event per basidium has been observed. Uniparental mitochondrial inheritance has also been observed in C. amylolentus progeny; similar to the pathogenic Cryptococcus species, mtDNA is inherited from the C. amylolentus MATa parent. Analysis of sex in C. amylolentus has provided insight into the mechanisms that phylogenetically related fungi employ in orchestrating sexual reproduction. We also extended our analysis to include the distantly related tetrapolar basidiomycete Tremella mesenterica. We completed comparisons of MAT-specific genes between five strains of T. mesenterica and identified the regions that define its mating-type system. The HD locus is limited to the SXI 1 - and SXI 2 -like genes while the P/R locus is defined by STE 3, STE 12, STE 20, and the pheromone gene, tremerogen a- 13. Interestingly, many of the genes associated with the MAT locus of the pathogenic Cryptococcus species flank the HD and P/R locus and are not incorporated in MAT in T. mesenterica. The MAT region includes transposons and C. neoformans hypothetical genes also present in T. wingfieldii and C. amylolentus. The mating-type system in T. mesenterica reflects an ancestral intermediate {{in the evolution of the}} MAT locus in the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. In conclusion, this study provides an in-depth analysis on the structure, function, and evolution of an unusual mating-type locus with broader implications for the transitions in modes of sexual reproduction in fungi that impact gene flow in populations.

The thesis problem {{is a part of}} the research to give their customers a better product with much shorter delivery time. Today the customers normally have to wait several weeks to get their visual aid glasses. The reason for this is that the holes are milled manually. With CNC mills existing some decades now, the visual aid community should also bene t from the advantage of CNC milling. Both producer and customers will bene t from a new automated small ve axis mill, especially ProVista that has started this paradigm shift. ProVista wants the opportunity to mill holes in their own glasses. Today they are depending on two foreign companies to mill the holes. This is both time consuming and costly for ProVista and their customers. This master thesis comprises the study, design and manufacturing of a ve axis mill. The decision to build a ve axis CNC mill was made early in the process, this was done by integrating a three axis CNC mill with two extra rotations axes. The project incorporates the main areas within mechatronics such as designing and building mechanical and electronic parts and the interplay between them, control system for controlling and tuning the motors. The mill shall produce di erent holes, mostly circular with angles so that the binoculars achieve the correct focal point in accordance to the user's needs. The users are mainly surgeons and dentists, who depend on magni cation provided with two binoculars, focused at an item to performer their work more e ciently and correctly. In ProVista sub market the users vary from hobbyist using binocular glasses to paint tin soldiers, old people reading the paper and other people that are visually impaired. The solution this project presents is a new small ve axis CNC mill special designed for milling in glasses. The mill is based on the High-Z S 400 purchased from CNC-Step in Germany. The chosen design for the two extra axes is a two axis rotary table design also known as trunnion. The trunnion table was tted with two stepper motor, from the same producer used on the High-Z S 400. The stepper motors were chosen mainly for their low cost and ease of use. There has been made a control box with motor drives and power supply for the trunnion table. The control box is also tted with serial ports, parallel port, fan, emergency button, <b>fuse</b> and power <b>connection.</b> A new xture for glasses is also designed and built. This will most probably be the rst milling xture for a pair of glasses in the world. The software used in the project is Excel and Mach 3. Excel was used to generate the G code from the position, diameter and the angle of the holes. After this the data is saved in a txt le, making it readable by Mach 3. This process has been made as user friendly as possible so that a user can operate the milling machine without problems. The Mach 3 CNC program already has a good enough interface, and only needed to be modi ed with a six axes interface. The Excel spreadsheet is been made simpler and the user may only change a few variables, the transfer of the G code is also been done simpler by adding the possibility to save the column with G code as txt le. The most typical holes that ProVista needs are circular holes and oblong holes (prism). After implementation several test were carried out to verify that the di erent parts obtained the requirements. Among the tests that were carried out was: resolution and repeatability for the mill, and the backlash for the trunnion table. In the last test it was milled holes through glasses to verify that the nal product met the requirements All tests met the requirements with good margin, except the last test. The problem will be xed and the test will be redone before handing over the machine to ProVista. With the new automated mill ProVista will be able to o er high quality visual aids on the world market. Their products will be made quicker and at a lower cost, bene ting both ProVista and the customers. ProVista will also have a new tool in their further research, which may result in new methods to help visually impaired so they may have a better quality of life. With the newly acquired high capacity to mill holes in glasses, ProVista would be able to take in orders from other visual aid companies. Further work may involve reducing the size of the mill since a large portion of the work area is unused. The user interface should be something similar to HMI (Human Machine Interface) where the users do not see the Mach 3 or Excel and just put in the desired position, diameter and angles on a touch screen. The xture should also be modi ed so that the glasses are self centred, this will reduce any minor errors. A new spindle should also be re tted to reduce noise level...|$|R

The project incorporates the main areas within mechatronics such as designing and building mechanical and electronic parts and the interplay between them, control system for controlling and tuning the motors. The mill shall produce di erent holes, mostly circular with angles so that the binoculars achieve the correct focal point in accordance to the user's needs. The users are mainly surgeons and dentists, who depend on magni cation provided with two binoculars, focused at an item to performer their work more e ciently and correctly. In ProVista sub market the users vary from hobbyist using binocular glasses to paint tin soldiers, old people reading the paper and other people that are visually impaired. The solution this project presents is a new small ve axis CNC mill special designed for milling in glasses. The mill is based on the High-Z S 400 purchased from CNC-Step in Germany. The chosen design for the two extra axes is a two axis rotary table design also known as trunnion. The trunnion table was tted with two stepper motor, from the same producer used on the High-Z S 400. The stepper motors were chosen mainly for their low cost and ease of use. There has been made a control box with motor drives and power supply for the trunnion table. The control box is also tted with serial ports, parallel port, fan, emergency button, <b>fuse</b> and power <b>connection.</b> A new xture for glasses is also designed and built. This will most probably be the rst milling xture for a pair of glasses in the world. The software used in the project is Excel and Mach 3. Excel was used to generate the G code from the position, diameter and the angle of the holes. After this the data is saved in a txt le, making it readable by Mach 3. This process has been made as user friendly as possible so that a user can operate the milling machine without problems. The Mach 3 CNC program already has a good enough interface, and only needed to be modi ed with a six axes interface. The Excel spreadsheet is been made simpler and the user may only change a few variables, the transfer of the G code is also been done simpler by adding the possibility to save the column with G code as txt le. The most typical holes that ProVista needs are circular holes and oblong holes (prism). After implementation several test were carried out to verify that the di erent parts obtained the requirements. Among the tests that were carried out was: resolution and repeatability for the mill, and the backlash for the trunnion table. In the last test it was milled holes through glasses to verify that the nal product met the requirements All tests met the requirements with good margin, except the last test. The problem will be xed and the test will be redone before handing over the machine to ProVista. With the new automated mill ProVista will be able to o er high quality visual aids on the world market. Their products will be made quicker and at a lower cost, bene ting both ProVista and the customers. ProVista will also have a new tool in their further research, which may result in new methods to help visually impaired so they may have a better quality of life. With the newly acquired high capacity to mill holes in glasses, ProVista would be able to take in orders from other visual aid companies. Further work may involve reducing the size of the mill since a large portion of the work area is unused. The user interface should be something similar to HMI (Human Machine Interface) where the users do not see the Mach 3 or Excel and just put in the desired position, diameter and angles on a touch screen. The xture should also be modi ed so that the glasses are self centred, this will reduce any minor errors. A new spindle should also be re tted to reduce noise level...|$|R
