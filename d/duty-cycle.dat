However, previous work on geographic routing makes the unrealistic assumption that all the nodes in the network are awake during routing. This overlooks the common deployment scenario where sensor nodes are <b>duty-cycled</b> to save energy. In this paper we investigate several important aspects of geographic routing over <b>duty-cycled</b> nodes. First, we extend existing geographic routing algorithms to handle the highly dynamic networks resulting from duty-cycling. Second, we provide the first formal analysis {{of the performance of}} geographic routing on <b>duty-cycled</b> nodes. Third, we use this analysis to develop an efficient decentralized sleep scheduling algorithm for reducing the number of awake nodes while maintaining both network coverage and a (tunable) target routing latency. Finally, we evaluate via simulation the performance of our approach versus running existing geographic routing algorithms on sensors <b>duty-cycled</b> according to previous sleep scheduling algorithms. Our results show, perhaps surprisingly, that a network of <b>duty-cycled</b> nodes can have slightly better routing performance than a static network that uses comparable energy. Our results further show that, compared to previous algorithms, our sleep scheduling algorithm significantly improves routing latency and network lifetime...|$|R

Moreover, for connected K-neighborhood (CKN) sleep scheduling-based <b>duty-cycled</b> IWSNs in which the network lifetime of IWSNs can be prolonged, the two-phase geographic greedy forwarding (TPGF) geographic routing algorithm has attracted attention due to its unique transmission features: multi path, shortest path, and hole bypassing. However, the performance of TPGF in CKN-based <b>duty-cycled</b> IWSNs with radio irregularity is not well investigated in the literature. In this paper, we first evaluate the impact of radio irregularity on CKN-based <b>duty-cycled</b> IWSNs. Furthermore, we investigate the routing performance of TPGF in CKN-based <b>duty-cycled</b> IWSNs with radio irregularity, {{in terms of the}} number of explored routing paths as well as the lengths of the average and shortest routing paths. Particularly, we establish the upper bound on the number of explored routing paths. The upper bound is slightly relaxed with radio irregularity compared with without radio irregularity; however, it is bounded by the number of average 1 -hop neighbors in always-on IWSNs.
