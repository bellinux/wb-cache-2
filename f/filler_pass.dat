40|$|Though butt-welds {{are among}} the most {{preferred}} joining methods in aerostructures, their strength dependence on inelastic mechanics is generally the least understood. This study investigated experimental strain distributions across a thick aluminum U-grooved weld and identified two weld process considerations for improving the multipass weld strength. One is the source of peaking in which the extreme thermal expansion and contraction gradient of the fusion heat input across the groove tab thickness produces severe angular distortion that induces bending under uniaxial loading. The other is the filler strain hardening decreasing with increasing <b>filler</b> <b>pass</b> sequences, producing the weakest welds on the last weld pass side. Both phenomena are governed by weld pass sequences. Many industrial welding schedules unknowingly compound these effects, which reduce the weld strength. A depeaking index model was developed to select <b>filler</b> <b>pass</b> thickness, pass numbers, and sequences to improve depeaking in the welding process. The result was to select the number and sequence of weld passes to reverse the peaking angle such as to combine the strongest weld pass side with the peaking induced bending tension component side to provide a more uniform stress and stronger weld under axial tensile loading...|$|E
40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels are {{a category of}} {{stainless steels}} with a microstructure containing approximately equal amounts of ferrite and austenite. They have desirable properties of both austenitic and ferritic stainless steels, such as high tensile strength, low temperature toughness and excellent resistance to corrosion, particularly chloride stress corrosion cracking). Poor welding has induced adverse microstructural features and consequently increased the susceptibility to various forms of corrosion such as stress corrosion cracking and intergranular corrosion. The focus of this research study was to (i) conduct an in-depth microstructural analysis of the various weld passes of gas tungsten arc welded (GTAW) AISI- 2507 super duplex stainless steel plate, {{in terms of the}} weld morphology, phase transformations within the weld regions and distribution of major alloying elements and (ii) determine the susceptibility to various forms of localised corrosion to include the degree of sensitisation (inter granular corrosion), susceptibility to pitting corrosion in terms of the critical pitting temperature and corrosion rate assessment using potentiodynamic scanning. Microstructural variations were observed not only between the base metal and weld regions, but between the different weld regions themselves. Phase identification using X-ray diffraction and electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques confirmed the absence of detrimental secondary phases and intermetallic precipitates in the base metal, while in contrast emphasized the presence of sigma, chi, and chromium carbides in the weld regions. Vickers hardness measurement showed relatively higher values for the root pass and <b>filler</b> <b>pass</b> compared to the base metal while the cap pass showed the lowest hardness values. This has been correlated primarily with differences in the ferrite content between these regions and also other factors such as grain size, presence of intermetallic precipitates, and concentration of interstitial atoms such as C and N. A reproducible DL-EPR test method was successfully developed to characterize the degree of sensitization in the super duplex stainless steel grade 2507. This DL-EPR test induced the most favourable selective attack conditions for studying sensitisation, without inducing other forms of corrosion such as pitting or general corrosion. The critical pitting temperature was shown to be a maximum for the base material and lowest for the cap region. The pitting corrosion resistance (elevated CPT) was observed for the weld regions with increased ferrite (fill region). Likewise, increased amounts of austenite (cap and root) were accompanied by a reduction in the CPT. This has been confirmed by corrosion rate measurements where lower corrosion rates were observed for studies conducted at temperatures lower than the CPT and higher corrosion rates were observed for studies conducted at temperatures higher than the CPT. Correlations existed between microstructural variations and corrosion behaviour of welded components and the un-welded base material, revealing that the corrosion performance was strongly influenced by microstructure features, such as ferrite/austenite ratio, grains shape and size, and the presence of chromium rich intermetallic precipitates and secondary phases...|$|E

Generally the hand hole pipe and dish end component are provided in the header for the inspecting the inner surface of the header. Conventionally the welding of dish end with hand hole pipe of the header is carried out using manual GTAW welding process for root pass and manual SAW welding process for <b>filler</b> <b>passes</b> which is a time consuming process. Thus it is substituted with a semi-automatic welding process i. e., STT- root pass followed by the pulsed GMAW for <b>filler</b> <b>passes</b> through a newly designed welding positioner.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to provide background information on asphaltic concrete mixtures peculiar to northwest Iowa. This background is necessary to provide the basis for future specifications. There were several projects let in 1967 involving l", 3 / 4 " and 3 / 8 " mixes of Type "B'' asphaltic concrete which specified in part, II Not less than 40 % of the material passing the No. 200 sieve shall be pulverized limestone or mineral filler, but in no case shall the per cent of pulverized limestone or mineral <b>filler</b> <b>passing</b> the No. 200 sieve be less than 2 %. No credit will be allowed for limestone in gravel - II Northwest Iowa has no suitable limestone or mineral filler locally available. As a result, this material has to be imported, raising the cost of the mix approximately twenty-five cents per ton. The purpose of this study, therefore, was designed to compare some original job mix samples with alternate mixes from the same local material, but without the addition of pulverized limestone or mineral filler. Since the filler from the crushed gravel does not have the same crushing characteristics or sieve analysis as the pulverized limestone or mineral filler, they could not be compared on an equal percentage basis. Therefore, the alternate mixes were made to conform to the following proposed specification, "No less than 40 % of the material passing No. 200 sieve shall be pulverized limestone or mineral filler or a 100 % crushed gravel, but in no case shall the per cent of pulverized limestone or mineral filler or a 100 % crushed gravel passing the No. 200 sieve be less than 2 %. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} sustainability of road materials and technologies {{plays a key}} role in pavement engineering. In this sense, the use of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), that is, a modified asphalt concrete that can be produced and applied at lower temperature, is considered an effective solution leading to environmental and operational benefits. The {{environmental sustainability}} of WMA can be further enhanced with the inclusion of steel slag in partial substitution of natural aggregates. Nevertheless, such innovative material applied at lower temperatures containing warm additives and steel slag should be able to guarantee at least the same performance of traditional hot mix asphalts, thus assuring acceptable mechanical properties and durability. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the rheological behaviour of bituminous mastics obtained combining a warm-modified binder and a <b>filler</b> (material <b>passing</b> to 0. 063 [*]mm) coming from electric arc furnace steel slag. To evaluate the influence of both warm additive and steel slag, a plain binder and limestone filler were also used for comparison purposes. Complex modulus and permanent deformation resistance of bitumens and mastics were assessed using a dynamic shear rheometer. Experimental results showed that steel slag warm mastics assure enhanced performance demonstrating promising applicability...|$|R
40|$|Palm oil {{industry}} currently {{has been seen}} as an important role in Malaysia’s economy. However, it also driving towards increasing of waste such as empty fruit bunch, mesocarp fibre, palm oil mill effluent (POME), and palm oil fly ash (POFA). POFA is identified as a material that shows good potential to be used as filler in asphalt mixture. Intensive literature showed that most of research primarily used POFA in concrete material, and limited in pavement material. Therefore, in this study, the potential of POFA in asphalt concrete was evaluated as an alternative initiative to promote waste recycling in road construction industry. POFA was incorporated as <b>filler</b> (material <b>passing</b> 75 m) into a mixture design ACW 20 with varied amount - (0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 % by weight of total aggregate) and bitumen content 5. 1 %± 0. 5. The specific gravity properties of each amount of POFA were assessed to be used during Marshall volumetric properties. These materials then were analyzed using Marshall stability and resilient modulus. A correlation derived as the specific gravity decreased, the Marshall stability decreased and resilient modulus increased compared to conventional asphalt mixes. Based on the results also, the appropriate amount of POFA found as 3 % with the optimum asphalt content 5. 1 %. The laboratory results showed that the resilient modulus of asphalt mixture was improved with the certain amount of POFA and indicated that POFA have the good potential as alternative filler material in asphalt mix...|$|R
40|$|The Silicone-Wax Filler {{discussed}} in this paper was developed for a reputed porcelain tile manufacturing company {{for use as a}} surface filler/sealer to a grade of floor tile called the polished tile, to make the tile stain resistance. Further investigations on the sealing characteristics on other surfaces have revealed that the filler is suitable as a surface filler/sealer to many surfaces such as marble, granite, terra cotta, terrazzo, cement and timber. The polished tile is a tile with a polished surface closely resembling a marble or granite surface. This tile is different to the normal glazed tile in that after the firing process the surface is cut and polished to give high reflection. In the cutting and polished process, 0. 3 - 0. 5 mm of the glazed surface is removed, resulting in a polished surface, which has microscopic pores on the surface, due to the removal of the glazed layer in the cutting and polishing process. The tile can get stained easily because coloured materials such as food stains, mud stains and organic stains can get into the surface pores. The removal of such stains is extremely difficult, if not impossible, because, the pores are so small that a surfactant cannot easily enter these pores to remove the stain. This problem is also common to terrazzo, marble, granite and terracotta floors. Due to the surface staining problem of polished tiles the said company had many customer complaints and had a special cleaning team visit such customers and clean floor stains using expensive and dangerous chemicals. As the chemicals used were hazardous they could not be recommended for client use. To overcome this problem, the only option available to the company was to apply a surface filler/sealer to the polished tile after the manufacturing process so that the surface became stain resistant. At the time the author was requested to develop the filler the company was using a surface filler imported from Italy at a very high price. The cost of applying the surface filler was approximately Rs. 10 /= per sqft. After several months of experiments and trials the author was able to develop a Silicone- Wax Surface Filler, which had sealing and stain resistant properties {{similar to that of the}} imported filler. The Research and Development Division of the tile manufacturing company carried out rigerous tests on the filler for coverage, stain resistance, discolouration, durability and other possible effects that could arise after the application, with time. The <b>filler</b> has <b>passed</b> all these tests and the cost has been found to be l/ 3 rd of that of the imported filler. The filler is now used by the said tile manufacturing company, to give stain resistance to the polished tile...|$|R
