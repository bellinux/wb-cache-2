Yavuz Sultan Selim had her name officially shortened to Yavuz Sultan in 1930 and then to Yavuz in 1936. Another short refit was conducted in 1938, and in November that year she carried the remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit. She and the other ships of the navy were considered outdated by the British Naval Attache by 1937, partly due to their substandard anti-aircraft armament, but in 1938 the Turkish government began planning to expand the force. Under these plans the surface fleet was to comprise two 10,000 ton cruisers and twelve destroyers. Yavuz would be retained until the second cruiser was commissioned in 1945, and the navy expected to build a 23,000 ton ship between 1950 and 1960. The naval building program did not come about, as the foreign shipyards which were to build the ships concentrated {{on the needs of}} their own nations leading up to World War II.|$|E
5|$|<b>İsmet</b> <b>İnönü</b> became Turkey's second President {{following}} Atatürk's {{death on}} 10 November 1938. In 1939 Turkey annexed the Republic of Hatay. Turkey remained neutral {{during most of}} World War II, but entered the closing stages {{of the war on}} the side of the Allies on 23 February 1945. On 26 June 1945, Turkey became a charter member of the United Nations. In the same year, the single-party period in Turkey came to an end, with the first multiparty elections in 1946. The Truman Doctrine in 1947 enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece during the Cold War, and resulted in large-scale U.S. military and economic support. In 1948 both countries were included in the Marshall Plan and the OEEC for rebuilding European economies. In 1949 Turkey became a member of the Council of Europe. The Democratic Party established by Celâl Bayar won the 1950, 1954 and 1957 general elections and stayed in power for a decade, with Adnan Menderes as the Prime Minister and Bayar as the President. After participating with the United Nations forces in the Korean War, Turkey joined NATO in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean. Turkey subsequently became a founding member of the OECD in 1961, and an associate member of the EEC in 1963.|$|E

25|$|The film {{also made}} many {{references}} to the political situation in Europe. Turkey, which was a neutral country during the war but a rival of the Soviet Union in the Cold War, was portrayed {{as if it was}} an Axis state; the Turkish ambassador even greeted Hitler in the name of <b>İsmet</b> <b>İnönü.</b> The Nazi sympathies of Vatican ambassador Cesare Orsenigo were emphasized as well. Churchill, seen as an enemy after his 1946 Fulton Speech, was portrayed in a highly negative fashion.|$|E

Although the conference halted on 4 February, it continued after 23 April mainly on the economic issues. On 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed by the Powers with the GNA, thus recognising the latter as the government of Turkey.|$|E

50|$|In 1983 {{military}} rule {{decided to turn}} to civilian regime and allowed the formation of new parties albeit with severe restrictions. According to instructions, the new parties {{were not allowed to}} use the names of the former parties and senior politicians were not allowed to be the charter member of the new parties. Furthermore, {{military rule}} had the power of rejecting the founders. This gave the military rule a privilege {{to limit the number of}} parties that would attend the coming parliamentary elections. It was clear that neither Bülent Ecevit nor the other notable left-of-center politician would participate in the elections which would be held on 6 November 1983.Under these circumstances CHP partisans founded two new parties; Social Democracy Party (SODEP) of Erdal İnönü, a physics professor and late <b>İsmet</b> <b>İnönü's</b> son, and People's Party (HP) of Necdet Calp, a former bureaucrat.|$|R

25|$|After the 12 September coup d'état, {{to select}} Atatürk's comrades {{who would be}} {{transfer}} to the State Cemetery, the Turkish Historical Society identified Nureddin Pasha {{as one of the}} Atatürk's closest 50 comrades during the War of Independence and made him honorable member of the Atatürk Research Center. Moreover, Nureddin Pasha was shown not Ferik but Orgeneral (four-star rank) and fourth man after <b>İsmet</b> <b>İnönü</b> and Fevzi Çakmak. And these decisions were accepted by the General Staff. But because of the public reaction to the decision, the General Staff gave up the transfer of the Nureddin Pasha's body to the State Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Turkish {{president}} <b>İsmet</b> <b>İnönü</b> {{signed a}} decision {{to help the people}} whose army he had personally fought during the Turkish War of Independence 19 years previous. The people of Turkey thus became the first to lend a helping hand to Greece. Foodstuffs were collected by a nationwide campaign of Kızılay (Turkish Red Crescent) and the operation was mainly funded by the American Greek War Relief Association and the Hellenic Union of Constantinopolitans. Food supplies were sent to the port of Istanbul to be shipped to Greece. SS Kurtuluş was prepared for her voyage with big symbols of the Red Crescent painted on both sides.|$|E

The plan of the Greeks was to cut Anatolia in two, as the above towns were on the main rail-lines connecting the hinterland with the coast. Eventually, after breaking the stiff Turkish defences, they occupied these strategically important centres. Instead of pursuing and decisively crippling the nationalists' military capacity, the Greek Army halted. In consequence, and despite their defeat, the Turks managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on {{the east of the}} Sakarya River, where they organised their last line of defence.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, Selim Sarper was {{appointed}} Turkey's Ambassador to Moscow, an important mission {{during the last}} years of World War II and {{the early years of the}} Cold War (1947-1991). According to President <b>İsmet</b> <b>İnönü's</b> judgement relating to a conversation between Sarper and Stalin's Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov on June 7, 1945, Turkey, even remained neutral in the war, might have been under a territorial claim threat from the Soviet Union. Due to this context, Turkey subsequently positioned itself alongside the United States. After the related official documents in the U.S. archives were made available to the public, it became clear that Sarper reported the subject of his conversation to the U.S. Ambassador W. Averell Harriman, even before he notified his government. However, his report to Harriman does not mention any threat by the Soviet Union, and the memoirs of Molotov deny such an allegation.|$|R

25|$|Menderes {{became quite}} famous for selling or distributing {{most of the}} estate he had {{inherited}} to small shareholders. He was more tolerant towards traditional lifestyles and different forms of practice of Islam than Atatürk and his party had been – he campaigned in the 1950 elections on the platform of legalizing the Arabic Islamic call to prayer (adhan), which had been banned in order to wean Turkey from Arabic influences. He re-opened thousands of mosques across the country which had been closed down, and as such, he was blamed by his political opponents for using religion {{as a tool for}} political gain. One of his first political moves was to exclude the pictures of <b>İsmet</b> <b>İnönü</b> on Turkish banknotes and stamps and instead put Atatürk pictures back, which were taken off when Inönü became President in 1938. Thanks to the public support and the legacy of Atatürk, it was a successful move, even if the Turkish law under the former President stated that the image of the President of the country would be placed on the banknotes (in this case Celal Bayar). In one of his speeches, he said that members of parliament could bring back caliphate if they so desired.|$|E
25|$|Turkey's most {{important}} international {{relationship has been}} with the United States {{since the end of the}} Second World War and the beginning of the Cold War. Turkey's association with the United States began in 1947 when the United States Congress designated Turkey, under the provisions of the Truman Doctrine, as the recipient of special economic and military assistance intended to help it resist threats from the Soviet Union. A mutual interest in containing Soviet expansion provided the foundation of U.S.–Turkish relations for the next four decades. As a result of Soviet threats and U.S. assistance against them, Turkey moved away from a single-party government towards democracy; in fact holding the first democratic elections in 1950, as a result of which President <b>İsmet</b> <b>İnönü</b> was replaced by Adnan Menderes, who was elected by popular vote. In support of overall United States Cold War strategy, Turkey contributed personnel to the United Nations forces in the Korean War (1950–53), joined NATO in 1952, became a founding member of the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) collective defense pact established in 1955, and endorsed the principles of the 1957 Eisenhower Doctrine. In the 1950s and 1960s, Turkey generally co-operated with other United States allies in the Middle East (Iran, Israel, and Jordan) to contain the influence of those countries (Egypt, Iraq, and Syria) regarded as Soviet clients. Throughout the Cold War, Turkey was the bulwark of NATO's southeastern flank, directly bordering Warsaw Pact countries and risking nuclear war on its soil during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Turkey received around 2.5 billion dollars in military aid from 1950 to 1970 (in 1970 dollars).|$|E

40|$|Ankara : The Institute of Economics and Social Science of Bilkent Univ., 1997. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 1997. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 115 - 118 The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} analyse the evolution {{of the relationship between the}} Turkish Armed Forces and the Republican People’s Party (RPP) between 1960 - 1983. The analysis will be done by refemng to the three militaiy interventions of 1960, 1971, and 1980. The reason for focusing on the three militaiy interventions is that they reveal to a great extent the nature of civil-militaiy relations. The origins of the great alliance between the RPP and the Turkish military that lasted until the 1970 s can be traced back to the War of National Independence. The RPP, which was closely identified with Kemalist state, shared with the Turkish military the role of guardianship of the republican regime. However, after <b>Ismet</b> <b>Inonu’s</b> death in 1973, the RPP under Bulent Ecevif s secretary-generalship gradually dropped Kemalism and took a position totally opposed to the basic tenets of the republican regime, thus moved the party from its traditional role as the guardian of the state. Consequently, the military rule of 1980, unlike the one of 1960, reflected the collapse of the grand coalition between the RPP and the Turkish military. Eruygur, AyçaM. S...|$|R
40|$|Despite its Ottoman {{security}} culture the Republic of Turkey {{followed a}} neutrality policy throughout the Second World War. This paper argues that Turkey's policy of neutrality is {{closely linked to}} Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s foreign policy objectives and his principles. <b>Ismet</b> <b>İnönü’s</b> “wait and see policy” was created {{as a result of}} Turkey's modernization project. Turkey’s Western orientation and shift of foreign policy is greatly related to its will to become an economically developed sovereign state. Turkey’s neutrality policy was based on this objective. This policy created tensions between the Allies and the Turkish Republic, which from time to time impinged upon Turkey's foreign policy during the Second World War. The debate on Turkish foreign policy has been an extension of the debate on the “neutrality” policy in the past. There is extensive literature that enriches our understanding of this period. After outing the broad survey of literature this paper will analyze what was written in Turkish press reports on this issue in order to better understand the main determinants of Turkey's foreign policy behaviors and preferences during the inter war period. It will seek to find out the repercussions of this policy on press. Parallels between the government's balance policy and its repercussions on the press will be studied with the purpose of disclosing the past and understanding the prospects of the future impacts of government policy’s and its ramifications on the press in Turkey...|$|R
