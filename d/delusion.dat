5|$|After {{finishing}} Yuka, Haruka, Saki, and Kurumi's routes, {{the player}} gets {{access to the}} Izumi Cure route, in which Makoto learns that Izumi and Okuhiko had deceived him into thinking that his premonitions were true. Makoto confronts Izumi, after which both he and Izumi fall off a cliff. They travel back in time, retaining their memories of the past six days. Makoto accepts that he has traveled through time, and Izumi reveals {{that she is the}} professor in charge of the seminar camp, and that {{the events of the past}} week were a science experiment; she attempted to test the phenomenon known as Curé Syndrome, where if multiple people believe in a <b>delusion</b> and the <b>delusion</b> is spread to others, the <b>delusion</b> becomes reality. Makoto was the test subject of the experiment, which was meant to involve him having the <b>delusion</b> that he could have premonitions; unexpectedly, he turned out to have real premonitions.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a <b>delusion,</b> and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a <b>delusion.</b> She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the <b>delusion,</b> and the six days in his <b>delusion</b> will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a <b>delusion,</b> and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his <b>delusion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God <b>Delusion</b> (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a <b>delusion.</b> He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E

2500|$|Grandiose <b>delusions</b> or <b>delusions</b> of {{grandeur}} are principally a subtype of delusional disorder but could possibly feature as {{a symptom of}} schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Grandiose <b>delusions</b> are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, omnipotent or otherwise very powerful. The <b>delusions</b> are generally fantastic, often with a supernatural, science-fictional, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one's own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have [...] "delusions {{of grandeur}}". This is generally due to excessive pride, rather than any actual <b>delusions.</b> Grandiose <b>delusions</b> or <b>delusions</b> of grandeur can also be associated with megalomania.|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{associated}} with cognitive and functional impairment as well as neuropsychiatric sequelae, including psychotic symptoms such as <b>delusions</b> and hallucinations. Strong evidence supports the need to study <b>delusions</b> separate from hallucinations. Integrating the epidemiology, clinical correlates, and neuropathological and genetic literature for <b>delusions</b> in AD allows us to speculate on etiology and mechanisms. Plaque and tangle deposition in individuals with susceptible alleles of serotonergic, muscarinic, nicotinic, or Apoε 4 genes appears to result in disruption of cortical circuitry, culminating in <b>delusions.</b> While <b>delusions</b> in AD correspond to a phenotype distinct from AD without <b>delusions,</b> subtypes of <b>delusions</b> may also define further distinct clinical entities. Persecutory <b>delusions</b> may occur earlier in the illness and have a more significant genetic component than misidentification <b>delusions,</b> which are associated with increased cognitive impairment and advanced dementia. Clearly distinguishing between these two syndromes is essential to making progress {{in the area of}} <b>delusions</b> in AD. peer-reviewe...|$|R

When a Noah II-created <b>delusion</b> causes people to panic, Sena and Kozue destroy nearby transmitters, and Takumi, Sena and Kozue join forces to stop Nozomi. They infiltrate Nozomi's headquarters and reach an underground research facility where they find Noah II and Genichi Norose, the president of Nozomi, who tries to stop them; they defeat him and destroy the machine, but it {{is revealed}} that the machine was just a prototype and not the actual Noah II, and that the Norose they fought was a real-booted <b>delusion</b> projected by the machine.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>delusions</b> of {{reference}} {{are one of}} the most common psychotic symptoms, they have been the focus of little research. The aims of the present research were, first, to determine whether it is possible to identify different kinds of referential <b>delusions</b> reliably and, if so, to investigate associations among them and between these <b>delusions</b> and other positive psychotic symptoms. Participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 57) were recruited from a volunteer register (n = 26) and from inpatient psychiatric wards (n = 31). They were interviewed with the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) except that the questions about ideas and <b>delusions</b> {{of reference}} were replaced with questions targeted at seven particular <b>delusions</b> and three content areas. Ratings were made independently by two assessors. Agreement between the assessors was high for all of the <b>delusions</b> of reference and other psychotic symptoms. A factor analysis of these ratings revealed two factors that represent <b>delusions</b> of communication and <b>delusions</b> of observation. Only <b>delusions</b> of observation were associated with hallucinations and persecutory ideation. <b>Delusions</b> of communication showed few significant correlations with other symptoms and therefore appear to require different explanations...|$|R
5|$|In {{a review}} {{of the history of the}} Moberly-Jourdain {{adventure}} and the extensive public reaction to it, Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared <b>delusion</b> may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women.

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which {{contained}} ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred {{critique of the}} political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct.

40|$|Abstract: Assessments and {{clinical}} understanding of late-onset <b>delusions</b> {{in the elderly}} are inconsistent and often incomplete. In this review, we consider the prevalence, neurobehavioral features, and neuroanatomic correlations of <b>delusions</b> in elderly persons – those with documented cognitive decline and those with no evidence of cognitive decline. Both groups exhibit a common phenotype: <b>delusions</b> are either of persecution or of misidentification. Late-onset <b>delusions</b> show a nearly complete absence of the grandiose, mystical, or erotomanic content typical of early onset psychoses. Absent also from both elderly populations are formal thought disorders, thought insertions, and <b>delusions</b> of external control. Neuroimaging and behavioral studies suggest a frontotemporal localization of <b>delusions</b> in the elderly, with right hemispheric lateralization in delusional misidentification and left lateralization in <b>delusions</b> of persecution. We propose that <b>delusions</b> in the elderly reflect a common neuroanatomic and functional phenotype, and we discuss applications of our proposal to diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{roles for}} emotion {{in the development}} of <b>delusions</b> have been outlined. Some authors argue that <b>delusions</b> defend against low self-esteem and negative emotion (the delusion-as-defense account). Other authors hypothesize that <b>delusions</b> are not a defense but are a direct reflection of emotion and associated processes (the emotion-consistent account). An empirical investigation was conducted of the delusion-as-defense account with reference to grandiose <b>delusions.</b> Twenty individuals with grandiose <b>delusions</b> and 21 individuals without mental illness were compared on overt and covert measures of self-esteem. No evidence for a discrepancy between overt and covert self-esteem in individuals with grandiose <b>delusions</b> was found. One potential interpretation of the results is that the tasks were not able to penetrate defensive processes. However, we argue that in this group, the grandiose <b>delusions</b> do not currently defend against low self-esteem. Instead, grandiose <b>delusions</b> may in part be direct exaggerations of the emotional state of individuals...|$|R

5|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the film to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who digitally altered the footage until it was deemed suitable. The episode's title is a reference to Folie à deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with one person who conceives of a delusional belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same <b>delusion.</b>|$|E

40|$|BackgroundDelusional {{thinking}} {{is one of}} the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the underlying neural substrate for <b>delusions</b> in schizophrenia remains unknown. In an attempt to further our understanding of the neural basis of <b>delusions,</b> we explored gray matter deficits and their clinical associations in first-episode schizophrenia patients with and without <b>delusions.</b> MethodsTwenty-four first-episode schizophrenia patients with <b>delusions</b> and 18 without <b>delusions</b> as well as 26 healthy controls (HC) underwent clinical assessment and whole-brain structural imaging which were acquired a 3. 0 [*]T scanner. Voxel-based morphometry was used to explore inter-group differences in gray matter volume using analysis of covariance, and Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) between the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) -delusion scores and mean regional brain volumes was obtained. ResultsPatients with <b>delusions</b> showed decreased brain gray matter volumes in the left putamen, thalamus, and caudate regions compared with HC. Patients with <b>delusions</b> also showed decreased regional volume in the left putamen and thalamus compared with patients without <b>delusions.</b> SAPS-delusion scores were negatively correlated with the gray matter volumes of the left putamen and thalamus.

Screenwriter Robert Bloch {{did not intend to}} write a Caligari remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original Caligari except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the <b>delusion</b> of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari.

5|$|In another Buddhist text Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha criticizes Jain {{emphasis}} on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma {{as a means to}} end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and <b>delusion,</b> which are observable and verifiable. In the Upālisutta dialogue of this Majjhima Nikāya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to the actions of speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that the actions of mind are most criminal, and not the actions of speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Religious <b>delusions</b> are {{prevalent}} {{symptoms in}} schizophrenia. It is unclear, however, whether religious <b>delusions</b> reflect illness- or culture-related factors. METHODS: Cross-cultural retrospective {{comparison of the}} prevalence of religious <b>delusions</b> in 132 patients treated for paranoid schizophrenia in East Berlin (former GDR) from 1980 to 1985, and 151 patients from Regensburg (FRG) who were treated as in-patients from 1980 to 1983. RESULTS: Prior to the German re-unification, religious <b>delusions</b> were significantly less frequent in East Berlin compared to Regensburg (11. 6 % as opposed to 28. 6 %, chi 2 = 8. 029; p = 0. 0046).
