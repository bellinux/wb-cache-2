5|$|On 3 December 1938, 11 {{years after}} they had first met, Julia married Alf after proposing to <b>him.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> married in the Bolton Street Register Office, and Julia wrote 'cinema usherette' on the {{marriage}} certificate as her occupation, {{even though she had}} never been one. None of Julia's family were there, but Alf's brother Sydney acted as a witness. They spent their honeymoon eating at 'Reece's' restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where his son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), and then went to a cinema. On their wedding night, Julia stayed at the Stanleys' house and {{he went back to his}} rooming house.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with <b>him.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined <b>him,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> concerned with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E

25|$|Constantin von Tischendorf, {{discoverer}} of Codex Sinaiticus, {{believed that}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus were among these fifty Bibles prepared by Eusebius in Caesarea.

He administered the compound tartar-emetic to each of them, having purchased it from a chemist in Hastings, Sussex. Rich in the metallic element antimony, improper usage of tartar-emetic causes a painful death with symptoms similar to arsenic poisoning.|$|E

25|$|By 1670 the buccaneer era was in decline, {{and many}} of the pirates turned to log cutting and wood trading as a new income source. At this time a Welsh {{privateer}} named Henry Morgan started to promote himself and invited the pirates on the island of Tortuga to set sail under <b>him.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> hired by the French as a striking force that allowed France to have a much stronger hold on the Caribbean region. Consequently, the pirates were never really controlled and kept Tortuga as a neutral hideout for pirate booty.|$|E

Their books were endorsed by Castaneda as authentic works. He dismissed others who claimed to share a history with don Juan Matus as pretenders.

25|$|It {{would take}} {{until the end}} of the century for the city's Greek {{community}} to recover. The revolt, however, gained momentum in Mount Athos and Kassandra, and the island of Thasos joined it. Meanwhile, the revolt in Chalkidiki was progressing slowly and unsystematically. In June 1821 the insurgents tried to cut communications between Thrace and the south, attempting to prevent the serasker Hadji Mehmet Bayram Pasha from transferring forces from Asia Minor to southern Greece. Even though the rebels delayed <b>him,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ultimately defeated at the pass of Rentina.|$|E

After the selectors chose Jacques Rudolph ahead of <b>him,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> overruled by Percy Sonn, then president of the UCB. Sonn insisted that Ontong, a Cape Coloured, play instead of Rudolph as part of South Africa's racial quota policy, and Ontong duly made his Test debut at the SCG.

25|$|In Cornwall, Winwaloe is {{the patron}} of the churches at Tremaine, St Wynwallow's Church, Landewednack, Gunwalloe and Poundstock as well as East Portlemouth in Devon and two lost chapels in Wales.

The churches of St Twynnells, near Pembroke, Pembrokeshire and Wonastow, Monmouthshire may have been {{originally}} dedicated to <b>him.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> probably founded by his successor at Landévennec, Gwenhael, who certainly made trips to Great Britain.

The two leaders met Ibn Laythawayh's forces a farsakh outside the city and engaged him in battle. Ibn Laythawayh, however, executed a feigned retreat, and when the Zanj pursued <b>him</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ambushed by a second regiment. With the rebels being routed, Ibn Laythawayh rejoined the battle, and the Zanj were compelled to make a full retreat. Once the battle was over, Ibn Laythawayh collected the heads of the slain rebels and headed for Tustar.|$|E
25|$|Before Charles could regroup, orders {{arrived from}} the Aulic Council, the {{imperial}} body in Vienna charged with conduct of war, to countermand his plan; Charles' troops were to leave Zurich in the supposedly capable hands of Korsokov, re-cross the Rhine and march north to Mainz. Charles stalled this operation {{as long as he}} could, but eventually he had to concede to Vienna's orders. Consequently, the Russian troops under a novice general replaced the Austrian troops and their seasoned commander. Charles withdrew his force {{to the north of the}} Rhine. Although the order to Charles to recross the Rhine and march north was eventually countermanded, by the time such instructions reached <b>him,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> too late to reverse.|$|E

25|$|At first, Niels Krogh Mortensen {{was doing}} all of the {{graphics}} and animation, using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga computer.

Niels Krogh Mortensen worked on Hugo between 1990 and 1998. During this time he usually directed and managed the projects; he also created storyboards and drew graphics. The Krogh Mortensen brothers and Jakob Steffensen left ITE in 1997 and founded their own company, Krogh Mortensen Animation A/S (KMA). KMA was later contracted to animate several more Hugo games.|$|E
25|$|In 1905 Widor and Schweitzer {{were among}} the six musicians who founded the Paris Bach Society, a choir {{dedicated}} to performing J.S. Bach's music, for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913. He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orféo Català at Barcelona and often travelled there for that purpose. He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of Bach's organ works, with detailed analysis of each work in three languages (English, French, German). Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach's notation with no additional markings, wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912–14. Three more, to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzer's analyses, were {{to be worked on}} in Africa: but these were never completed, perhaps because for <b>him</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> inseparable from his evolving theological thought.|$|E
