25|$|Printer ink {{cartridges}} can be reused. They are sorted by brand and model, to be refilled or resold {{back to the}} manufacturers. The companies then refill the <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> to resell to consumers. Toner cartridges are recycled {{the same way as}} {{ink cartridges}}, using toner instead of ink. This method is highly efficient as there is no energy spent on melting and recreating the cartridges.|$|E
25|$|Ballpoint pens are {{produced}} in both disposable and refillable models. Refills {{allow for the}} entire internal <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir,</b> including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip, which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.|$|E
25|$|A tattoo {{machine is}} a {{hand-held}} device generally {{used to create}} a tattoo, a permanent marking of the skin with ink. The basic machine, which was called Stencil-Pens, was invented by Thomas Alva Edison and patented in the United States in 1876. It was originally intended to be used as an engraving device, but in 1891, Sean Casey discovered that Edison's machine could be modified and used to introduce ink into the skin, and later patented it as a tube and needle system serving as an <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ball-point plotter pens with refillable {{clear plastic}} <b>ink</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are available. They {{do not have}} the fading or wear effects of fiber pens, but are {{generally}} more expensive and uncommon. Also, conventional ball-point pens can be modified to work in most pen plotters.|$|R
50|$|Initially, pens {{were made}} by slicing a {{suitable}} nib point {{from the end of}} a thin, hollow natural material which could retain a small <b>reservoir</b> of <b>ink</b> by capillary action. However, these <b>ink</b> <b>reservoirs</b> were relatively small, requiring the pen to be periodically dipped back into an external inkwell for replenishing.|$|R
25|$|Although {{designs and}} {{construction}} vary between brands, basic {{components of a}}ll ballpoint pens are universal. Standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating ball itself (distributing the ink on the writing surface), a socket holding the ball in place, small ink channels that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> supplying ink to the ball. In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity. Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points, then housed in a brass socket.|$|E
25|$|A {{ballpoint pen}} is a writing {{instrument}} with an internal <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber {{is filled with}} a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first ballpoint pen {{is the creation of}} American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball to mark up his leather hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen, it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up. Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888. However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge-free.|$|E
2500|$|Manfred Kohrs [...] (born January 24, 1957) is a German tattooist and {{conceptual}} artist, {{who has been}} tattooing since 1974. He was a student of Horst Heinrich Streckenbach ("Tattoo Samy") (August 5, 1926 – June 27, 2001). Together they developed the barbell piercing in 1975. Kohrs invented a rotary tattoo machine with main part an electric motor and an <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir.</b> [...] In 1977 Kohrs founded the first German Tattoo Artist Association.|$|E
5000|$|Injecting ink: Depending on {{the type}} of {{cartridge}} being refilled, ink can either be injected through a hole on top of the cartridge, or directly into the ink chambers after the top has been popped off. The ink can be injected directly from a bottle (with a needle tip on it) or from a needle filled with ink. The ink must be slowly injected into the cartridge so as not to cause damage, or overfilling, or overflow to other-color <b>ink</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> (For colors, a label on the cartridge might have three ordered color-dots to indicate the corresponding three ink colors of the reservoir chambers.|$|R
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of economical, reliable ballpoint pens {{as we know}} them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens. If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear. <b>Ink</b> <b>reservoirs</b> pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps the easiest, most {{trouble-free}} {{method of}} refilling ink cartridges {{is through the}} use of a CISS (Continuous Ink Supply System). A CISS consists of a set of cartridges that have tubes connected to them, through which the ink continuously flows from <b>ink</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on the outside of the printer. Instead of refilling the cartridges themselves, the user simply refills the bottles on the outside of the printer. Early CIS systems were composed of OEM cartridges that had been drilled and outfitted with fittings to accept the ink delivery tubes, a set of 'ribbon' tubes, and plastic bottles with holes drilled in the caps for the tubes and the vents. Today's CIS systems are mass-produced in China, often incorporating all ink bottles into one partitioned container. They typically utilize auto-reset chips, which means the cartridges rarely have to be removed from the printer.|$|R
2500|$|Because of a ballpoint pen's {{reliance}} on gravity {{to coat the}} ball with ink, most cannot be used to write upside-down. However, technology developed by Fisher pens in the United States resulted {{in the production of}} what {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Fisher Space Pen". Space Pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurised <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> that forces the ink toward the point. Unlike standard ballpoints, the rear end of a Space Pen's pressurized reservoir is sealed, eliminating evaporation and leakage, thus allowing the pen to write upside-down, in zero-gravity environments, and reportedly underwater. Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space.|$|E
50|$|The feed of a {{fountain}} pen is the component {{that connects the}} nib of the pen with its <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inking of {{the stamp}} occurs through the {{application}} of a thiol solution either by immersion or coating the stamp with a Q-tip. The highly hydrophobic PDMS material allows the ink to be diffused into the bulk of the stamp, which means the thiols reside not only on the surface, but also in the bulk of the stamp material. This diffusion into the bulk creates an <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> for multiple prints. The stamp is let dry until no liquid is visible and an <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> is created.|$|E
50|$|Like many Parker {{fountain}} pens, the 180 had {{a flexible}} <b>ink</b> sac <b>reservoir.</b> To load the pen with ink, one would remove the outer casing {{of the pen}} body, lower the nib into a bottle of ink, and squeeze-and-release the ink sac, drawing ink into the pen as the springy rubber sac returned to its rest shape.|$|R
40|$|Porous stamps {{fabricated}} by one-step {{phase separation}} micromolding {{were used for}} microcontact printing of polar inks, in particular aqueous solutions of dendrimers, proteins, and nanoparticles. Permanent hydrophilicity was achieved without any additional treatment by tailored choice of the polymer components. Pores with several hundred nanometers to micrometers were obtained during the phase separation process. These pores can act as <b>ink</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The porous stamps were thoroughly characterized by SEM, NMR, and contact angle measurement. The versatility of the porous stamps was shown in three printing schemes. First, positive microcontact printing was achieved by printing a polar thioether-modified dendrimer as the ink, followed by backfilling and wet etching. Second, the porous stamps were used for multiple printing of fluorescent proteins without reinking. Third, nanoparticles of about 60 nm in diameter, which cannot be directly transferred by oxidized PDMS stamps, were successfully printed onto substrates by using these porous stamp...|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} that thermal ink jet print heads {{can be used to}} place GaN {{nanowires}} on patterned substrates. The semiconductor nanowires had diameters ranging from 70 to 300 nm and lengths from 5 µm to 20 µm. They were dispersed in alcohol-water solutions for loading into <b>ink</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> To avoid clogging, the thermal ink jet heads were chosen with drop weights from 72 to 165 ng. The thermal ink jet method was successfully used to place nanowires across narrow gaps in metal patterns. When using a low-power optical microscope to align the nozzle with substrate pattern features, the placement accuracy is much higher than with micropipette placement. For unknown reasons, nanowires would not pass through piezoelectric ink jet heads. These experiments demonstrate that ink jet technology holds promise for low-cost, rapid, massively parallel placement and processing of nanowires for optoelectronic, electronic, and sensor applications...|$|R
5000|$|Fountain pens were {{developed}} in the 19th century. These consist of the nib unit, an <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> chamber, and an external casing. The casing usually includes a cover for the nib, {{in order to protect}} its shape and keep the ink from evaporating dry or wicking into the user's pocket. Depending on the design of the pen, the <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> can be filled in several different ways: direct addition by eyedropper, suction from an internal mechanism, or disposable pre-filled cartridges. Some cartridge-based fountain pens can be fitted with [...] "converters", which are separate piston/suction reservoirs of the same dimensions as the pen's usual refill cartridge; these allow the pen to refill from bottled ink.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic siphon recorder of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> and is deflected by the process signal. In modern strip chart recorders, a disposable cartridge combining both a fiber-tipped pen and <b>ink</b> <b>reservoir</b> has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an impact printer using a ribbon and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto electro-sensitive paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror galvanometers, directed at light-sensitive paper.|$|E

Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited and the patent eventually lapsed.The manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as we know them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century.
