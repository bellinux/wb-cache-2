And when I, Abt Vogler, touched the keys, I called the Spirits of Sound to me, {{and they have}} built my palace of music; and to inhabit it all the Great Dead came back till in the vision I made a perfect music. Nay, for a moment, I touched in it the infinite perfection; {{but now it is}} gone; I cannot bring it back. Had I painted it, had I written it, I might have explained it. But in music out of the sounds something emerges which is above the sounds, and that ineffable thing I touched and lost. I took the well-known sounds of earth, and out of them came a <b>fourth</b> <b>sound,</b> nay not a sound--but a star. This was a flash of God's will which opened the Eternal to me for a moment; and I shall find it again in the eternal life. Therefore, from the achievement of earth and the failure of it, I turn to God, and in Him I see that every image, thought, impulse, and dream of knowledge or beauty--which, coming whence we know not, flit before us in human life, breathe for a moment, and then depart; which, like my music, build a sudden palace in imagination; which abide for an instant and dissolve, but which memory and hope retain as a ground of aspiration--are not lost to us though they seem to die in their immediate passage. Their music has its home in the Will of God and we shall find them completed there." ...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the significance of}} audible gallop sounds in the right supraclavicular fossa we performed simultaneous external heart sound recordings at 50 and 100 Hz at the left ventricular apex, left sternal border, and right supraclavicular fossa in 50 patients with audible gallop sounds at the left ventricular apex. In each patient heart sounds were recorded with a simultaneous jugular phlebogram, apex cardiogram, and carotid pulse tracing. In 44 patients an apical <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound</b> coincident with the 'a' wave of the apex cardiogram was recorded, and in 32 (73 %) the <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound</b> was audible and recordable in the right supraclavicular fossa. A left ventricular third heart sound, coincident with the rapid filling wave of the apex tracing, was present in 25 patients but was recorded in the right supraclavicular fossa in only 7 (28 %). Intracardiac phonocardiography (high-fidelity catheter) was performed in six patients with left ventricular gallop sounds and in each instance arterial transmission of the third or <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound,</b> or both, was present. Five additional patients had a prominent jugular venous 'a' wave, but only two had a soft parasternal <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound.</b> Intracardiac phonocardiography in these five patients failed to reveal transmission of right ventricular gallop sounds to the superior vena cava. We conclude that since left ventricular gallop sounds commonly are transmitted to the right supraclavicular fossa auscultation {{in this area is}} often helphful in their detection.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} left atrial {{systolic}} time intervals anil Doppler echocardiography {{were used in}} a quantitative assessment of left atrial function {{in relation to the}} presence or absence of a <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound</b> and to left ventricular hypertrophy in 47 patients with hypertension. Left atrial systolic time interval indexes included atrial pre-ejection period (the time between the onset of an electrocardipgraphic P wave and the onset of left ventricular inflow during atrial systole [A wave]), corrected atrial pre-ejcctlon period (the airial pre-ejection period divided by the duration of the P wave), and atrial ejection time (the time between the onset and cessation of the A wave). Twenty-one patients with a <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound</b> on the phonocardiogram had a shorter atrial pre-ejection period (81 ± 10 versus 89 ± 14 ms p < 0. 05) and a corrected atrial pre-ejection period (66 ± 17 versus 83 ± 18 ms, p < 0. 01), as well as a longer atrial ejection time (147 ± 15 versus 126 ± 13 ms, p < 0. 001) than did 26 patients without a <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound.</b> The ratio of atrial pre-ejection period to atrial ejection time and that of corrected atrial pre-ejection period to atrial ejection time was smaller in patients with than in patients without a <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound</b> (0. 56 ± 0. 08 versus 0. 71 ± 0. 11, p < 0. 001; 0. 46 ± 0. 16 ms− 1 versus 0. 67 ± 0. 17 ms− 1, p < 0. 001, respectively). Left ventricular wall thickness (the sum of interventricular septal thickness and left ventricular posterior wall thickness) evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiography correlated positively with left atrial ejection time (r = 0. 42, p < 0. 01) and negatively with corrected atrial pre-ejection period (r = − 0. 34, p < 0. 02), the ratio of atrial pre-ejection period to atrial ejection time (r = − 0. 35, p < 0. 02) and the ratio of corrected atrial pre-ejection period to atrial ejection time (r = − 0. 40, p < 0. 01).

We report a case with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Wenckebach second-degree atrioventricular block, in which the S 4 was initially misdiagnosed as an S 3 on auscultation and later confirmed using a phonocardiogram with an apexcardiogram. Interestingly, the amplitude of the S 4 dynamically and regularly fluctuated in proportion to the interval between the S 4 and the preceding ventricular contraction. These findings were associated with transmitral inflow patterns assessed by Doppler echocardiography, highlighting the importance of not only transmitral A but also E waves for the amplitude of S 4 in patients with arrhythmias. <Learning objective: A <b>fourth</b> heart <b>sound</b> could be difficult to diagnose and dynamically fluctuate in amplitude in patients with arrhythmias, such as Wenckebach second-degree atrioventricular block.
