25|$|Eris is {{a goddess}} of the RPG world whom Kazuma first meets after he is killed during a battle. She is {{kindhearted}} but {{is prone to}} embarrassment from Aqua, who is jealous over <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> Eris is worshiped despite being Aqua's junior goddess. It is later revealed Chris is her persona in this world.|$|E
25|$|But Naaman's {{servants}} {{advised him}} that if Elisha had directed him to do some difficult thing {{he would have done}} it, so <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> should he do what Elisha directed when he said merely to wash and be clean. So Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, and his flesh came back like the flesh of a little child.|$|E
60|$|The {{new idea}} made the squire {{walk up and}} down the library rapidly. He was a great schemer and could evolve a whole transaction, no matter <b>how</b> intricate, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> rapidly than most men.|$|R
60|$|I hope it {{will appear}} that I am not the less, but the more capable of giving a full account of things, by <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the <b>more</b> {{deliberation}} I have taken {{in the view of}} them, and by <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the oftener I have had opportunity to see them.|$|R

"That is {{all very}} well, Domiloff," [...] Hassen said, [...] "but have you ever {{considered}} <b>how</b> very <b>much</b> <b>more</b> useful Reist would be to us if he were outwardly on friendly terms with the King, near him now and {{at the head of}} his men--and all the time ours?" ...|$|R
25|$|Charles Cutler Torrey taught Semitic {{languages}} at Yale University. His lasting contribution {{has been}} to show <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He {{thought this was a}} point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose. Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, {{he would have had to}} use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.|$|E
25|$|Such {{growth has}} not come without difficulties. There are {{questions}} as to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> passenger growth can occur. The airport's present terminal and runway layout are reaching full utilization and PHL remains the world's largest airport without an inground fueling system thus requiring fuel to be trucked to each airplane. These two factors have led to congestion and delays. Additionally, the airport's parking facilities have been severely taxed. Exhaustion of all 17,000 parking spaces at the airport has become a regular occurrence. However, airport officials have ambitious plans for terminal and runway expansion.|$|E
25|$|The toy {{version of}} the new series design (made by Character Options Ltd.) was {{slightly}} larger than the on screen version to accommodate a working sound chip. It also includes an ultraviolet light and changeable invisible ink nib for viewing messages written in the ultraviolet ink. A common misconception is that the Doctor Who production team at BBC Wales were so impressed by <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> resilient the toy sonic screwdriver was than the real prop, that they obtained moulds of the original prototype of the toy {{to use in the}} 2006 series, in fact, this was not the case.|$|E
50|$|When US {{soldiers}} {{first saw}} the gun it was ridiculed for its use of stamped steel parts, until it was realized <b>how</b> <b>much</b> quicker and <b>more</b> cheaply guns of this type could be manufactured.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes! I don't {{quite know}} <b>how</b> <b>much.</b> But perhaps <b>more</b> debts {{than there is}} property. I shall go and see the lawyer in the morning. Perhaps there will be nothing at all left for me, when {{everything}} is paid." ...|$|R
6000|$|Edgar laughed. 'Dear W. W., let it not trouble you! What it {{may lead}} to is a bugbear to you. You can't think <b>how</b> <b>much</b> younger and <b>more</b> {{agreeable}} you will be when you have learnt {{that there can be}} passages that lead to nothing.' ...|$|R
25|$|This amazingly gruesome predatory {{behavior}} {{is a great}} example of a collaboration between solitary and cooperative predation. The first ant will initially act alone in her predation, but after that other ants will come and join in the hunt, and still other will travel back to the domatia to recruit even more ants to aid in holding down and eventually dismembering the prey. This also demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> effective a group of individuals can be than an individual working on its own. A single ant {{would never be able to}} kill such large prey; they are only able to do so by incorporating communication and cooperation.|$|E
25|$|The FTC's {{decision}} {{to pursue the}} case came in for some criticism. Some commentators, who thought the case title was humorous enough to make extended references to the Superman comics in their commentary, questioned whether the commission's action against a retailer who did not deceive any American consumers was a wise use of its limited resources, and whether {{it might have been}} better to prosecute him in Britain. Another, in the course of criticizing the failings of the European Union's Data Protection Directive when it came to dealing with cloud computing, did not criticize the enforcement action as such but showed that it pointed out <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> work needed to be done in ensuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Program.|$|E
25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{a probability}} density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function, whose value {{at any given}} sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) {{can be interpreted as}} providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample. In other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there are an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> likely it is that the random variable would equal one sample compared to the other sample.|$|E
60|$|And consider, if the Abbot found such {{difficulty}} in the mere economic department, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> in <b>more</b> complex ones, in spiritual ones perhaps! He wears a stern calm face; raging and gnashing teeth, fremens and frendens, many times, {{in the secret}} of his mind. Withal, however, there is a noble slow perseverance in him; a strength of 'subdued rage' calculated to subdue most things: always, in the long-run, he contrives to gain his point.|$|R
60|$|Claude was {{the daily}} {{bulletin}} of the Gap. He knew whose cow died the night before, {{who was at the}} strawberry dance, and all about Abe Anderson's night in jail up at the Siding. If his coming was welcome to the Kennedy's, who took the Bluff Siding Gimlet and the county paper, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the <b>more</b> cordial ought his greeting to be at Haldeman's, where they only took the Milwaukee Weekly Freiheit.|$|R
50|$|The general {{method for}} calculating short-run {{multipliers}} is called comparative statics. That is, comparative statics calculates <b>how</b> <b>much</b> one or <b>more</b> endogenous variables {{change in the}} short run, given a change {{in one or more}} exogenous variables. The comparative statics method is an application of the implicit function theorem.|$|R
25|$|The {{peoples of}} Southeast Asia, {{especially}} those of Austronesian descent, have been seafarers for thousands of years, some reaching the island of Madagascar, became the ancestors of modern-day Malagasy people. Passage through the Indian Ocean aided the colonisation of Madagascar, as well as commerce between Western Asia, eastern coast of India and Chinese southern coast. Gold from Sumatra {{is thought to have}} reached as far west as Rome. Pliny the Elder wrote in his Natural History about Chryse and Argyre, two legendary islands rich in gold and silver, located in the Indian Ocean. Their vessels, such as the vinta, were capable to sail across ocean. Magellan's voyage records <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> manoeuvrable their vessels were, as compared to the European ships. A slave from the Sulu Sea was believed to have been used in Magellan's voyage as a translator.|$|E
25|$|For the {{complexity}} classes defined in this way, {{it is desirable}} to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), {{it would be interesting}} to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.|$|E
25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
50|$|A supply {{schedule}} is a table which shows <b>how</b> <b>much</b> one or <b>more</b> firms {{will be willing}} to supply at particular prices under the existing circumstances. Some of the more important factors affecting supply are the good's own price, the prices of related goods, production costs, technology and expectations of sellers.|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} much {{difficulty}} that at last Andor succeeded in effecting his escape and {{running away from}} the series of ovations which greeted him when and wherever he was recognized. The women embraced him without further ado, the men worried him to tell them some of his adventures then and there. Above all, everyone wanted to hear <b>how</b> very <b>much</b> <b>more</b> wretched, uncomfortable and God-forsaken {{the rest of the}} wide, wide world was in comparison with Hungary in general and the village of Marosfalva in particular.|$|R
40|$|Virtual Economies {{provides}} a comprehensive and thought provoking view of <b>how</b> economics is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than its academic definition and how virtual world economies {{could be a}} starting point for rethinking the problems of the real world economies. This is an excellent and understandable approach to a dynamic and timely topic, writes Clare Chambers-Jones...|$|R
25|$|Midna has {{received}} mostly positive reception {{from both the}} video game press and the public {{for her role in}} Twilight Princess. Game Informer editor Andrew Reiner stated that she, along with Link's wolf transformation, had incredible effects on Twilight Princess gameplay. Fellow Game Informer editor Billy Berghammer stated that he loved Midna, describing her as a cool character due to how she messed with Link throughout the game. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that the supporting characters of Twilight Princess make up for Link's laconic nature, Midna more so than others. He described her as being acerbic and thoughtful, as well as an intricate character who moves the plot forward for her own means. While America's Intelligence Wire editor Dave Arey described her as intriguing, he felt that she could have been more so if Nintendo had developed her further. GamesRadar listed her as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that before Midna, the only characters they could relate to were Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon. RPGamer editor Matthew Rickert stated that he found nothing intriguing or likable about her, complaining about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> plot time she receives in spite of this, arguing that she offers little help to Link and that it felt like she had replaced Zelda in Twilight Princess.|$|E
500|$|On 23 October, the BBC {{said it was}} [...] "too early" [...] {{to confirm}} <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> airtime would {{be given to the}} BNP in the future; The Times {{reported}} on 24 October that the BBC had [...] "no plans" [...] to have Griffin on Question Time before the next general election.|$|E

Wha' dem want? a white god, well God come black. True true." ...|$|E
50|$|His writing {{revealed}} {{the amount of}} time the UK police now take to deal with relatively petty crimes. He described in detail the hugely complicated paperwork process which meant, for example, that the theft of a bicycle by three boys took around 20 hours (over the course of a month or so) to clear up. This struck a chord with a British public - and media - which wondered <b>how</b> so <b>much</b> <b>more</b> money could have been spent on the police service for apparently so little a return.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Where Is Danny?s re-release in 2011, Danny! {{began to}} compose {{what began as}} a vindictive satirical project to expose <b>how</b> {{listeners}} were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> interested in high-profile collaborations than music of substance. Danny! would spend the remainder of 2011 assembling a catalog of tracks originally intended for the Interscope digital download version of what would become Payback.|$|R
60|$|In these {{circumstances}} the defection was wholly unexpected. The rajah had a standing army of six thousand men; and could, on an emergency, place fifty thousand in the field. Nevertheless, seeing <b>how</b> other very <b>much</b> <b>more</b> powerful native princes {{had been unable}} to withstand the British arms, his conduct was not only ungrateful and treacherous, but wholly unaccountable.|$|R
500|$|For more {{practical}} special {{effects on the}} set as opposed to CG, Kusama said it [...] "was a choice that we all sort of made organically". She said they appreciate [...] "those kind of effects in older movies and [...] sometimes <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> effective it {{is to use a}} ton of CG" [...] and that they [...] "always started with a practical effect and then moved forward from there to lay a groundwork of something that's actually physically, materially there". They found this to be more enjoyable.|$|E
500|$|The XJ220 {{appeared}} in later motoring press articles; Evo journalist David Vivian, writing a head-to-head test between the XJ220 and the Lamborghini Murcielago in 2009, commented that [...] "going ludicrously fast seems trivially easy", and {{acknowledged that the}} decision to change the V12 engine for a turbocharged V6 engine [...] "would garner more acceptance now". The Lamborghini delivered the far better driving experience however: [...] "After the XJ220, it’s almost absurdly agile", [...] "the big difference, and it is massive, is <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> exciting, entertaining and accessible the LP640 is to drive." ...|$|E
500|$|A year later, Moore {{still did}} not {{understand}} the controversy that caused photos of a naked, pregnant woman to be viewed as morally objectionable. Moore stated that, [...] "I did feel glamorous, beautiful and more free about my body. I don't know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> family oriented I could possibly have gotten." [...] She considered the cover to be a healthy [...] "feminist statement." [...] In 2007, Moore stated that the picture was not originally intended for publication. [...] She had posed in a personal photo session, not a cover shoot. [...] Leibovitz has had personal photo sessions of Moore and all of her daughters.|$|E
6000|$|When {{we look at}} {{a map of the}} world, one of {{the first}} things that strikes us as curious is, how little dry land there is, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> sea. <b>More</b> than half the world covered with deep, wild, raging, waste salt water! It seems very strange. Of what use to man can all that sea be? And yet the Scripture says that the whole earth has God given to the {{children}} of men. And therefore He has given to us the sea which is part of the earth. But of what use is the sea to us? ...|$|R
60|$|If {{one were}} {{bold enough to}} generalise after the manner of Globe-trotters, {{it would be easy}} to build up a theory on the well {{incident}} to account for the apparent insanity of some of our cold weather visitors. Even the Young Man from Manchester could evolve a complete idea for the training of well-bullocks in the East at thirty seconds' notice. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> the <b>more</b> could a cultivated observer from, let us say, an English constituency, blunder and pervert and mangle? We in this country have no time to work out the notion, which is worthy of the consideration of some leisurely Teuton intellect.|$|R

One night he meets Vincent Lauria, a young, charismatic pool player and video gamer who plays small-time nine-ball games {{while working as a}} sales clerk at a toy store.
