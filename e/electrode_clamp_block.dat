40|$|AbstractThe GluN 3 {{subunits}} of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor {{are known}} to reduce its Ca 2 + permeability and Mg 2 + sensitivity, however, {{little is known about}} their effects on other channel blockers. cRNAs for rat NMDA receptor subunits were injected into Xenopus oocytes and responses to NMDA and glycine were recorded using two <b>electrode</b> voltage <b>clamp.</b> Channel <b>block</b> of receptors containing GluN 1 - 1 a/ 2 A, GluN 1 - 1 a/ 2 A/ 3 A or GluN 1 - 1 a/ 2 A/ 3 B subunits was characterised using Mg 2 +, memantine, MK- 801, philanthotoxin- 343 and methoctramine. IC 50 values for Mg 2 + and memantine increased when receptors contained GluN 3 A subunits and were further increased when they contained GluN 3 B, e. g. IC 50 s at − 75 mV for block of GluN 1 - 1 a/ 2 A, GluN 1 - 1 a/ 2 A/ 3 A and GluN 1 - 1 a/ 2 A/ 3 B receptors respectively were 4. 2, 22. 4 and 40. 1 μM for Mg 2 +, and 2. 5, 7. 5 and 17. 5 μM for memantine. Blocking activity was found to be fully or partially restored when G or R (at the N and N+ 1 sites respectively) were mutated to N in GluN 3 A. Thus, the changes cannot be attributed to the loss of the N or N+ 1 sites alone, but rather involve both sites or residues elsewhere. Block by MK- 801 and philanthotoxin- 343 was also reduced by GluN 3 A, most strongly at − 100 mV but not at − 50 mV, and by GluN 3 B at all Vh. Methoctramine was the least sensitive to introduction of GluN 3 subunits suggesting a minimal interaction with the N and N+ 1 sites. We conclude that GluN 3 B-containing receptors provide increased resistance to channel block compared to GluN 3 A-containing receptors and this must be due to differences outside the deep pore region (N site and deeper) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, {{manually operated}} tool enables precise bending (typically, within 1 / 2 of the specified bend angle) of a metal tube {{located in a}} confined space, {{with a minimum of}} flattening of the tube and without significant gouging of the tube surface. The tool is designed for use in {{a situation in which the}} tube cannot be removed from the confined space for placement in a conventional benchmounted tube bender. The tool is also designed for use in a situation in which previously available hand-held tube benders do not afford the required precision, do not support the tube wall sufficiently to prevent flattening or gouging, and/or do not fit within the confined space. The tool is designed and fabricated for the specific outer diameter and bend radius of the tube to be bent. The tool (see figure) includes a clamping/radius block and a top <b>clamping</b> <b>block</b> that contain mating straight channels of semicircular cross section that fit snugly around the tube. The mating portions of the clamping/radius block and the top <b>clamping</b> <b>block</b> are <b>clamped</b> around a length of the tube that is adjacent to the bend and that is intended to remain straight. The clamping/radius block is so named because beyond the straight clamping section, its semicircular channel extends to a non-clamping section that is curved at the specified bend radius. A pivot hole is located in the clamping/radius block at the center of the bend circle. The tool includes a bending block that, like the other blocks, contains a straight semicircular channel that fits around the outside of the tube. The bending block contains a pivot hole to be aligned with the pivot hole in the clamping/radius block.

40|$|Thick {{composite}} beams {{are used}} as primary structural members in various engineering applications, for example, composite flex beams in a hinge less rotor system of modern helicopters. One end of the flex beam yoke {{is connected to the}} rotor hub through joints and the other end is connected similarly to the rotor blade. A flex beam yoke has to support rotating loads, vibratory bending loads and torsional loads. It should be strong enough to hold the blade yet flexible enough to allow for the flapping motion. Hence, it is essential to understand the mechanism of stress development, crack initiation and propagation in a bolted thick composite beam, which is subjected to axial and flexural loads. A unidirectional glass/epoxy thick composite beam is considered in this study. A common engineering practice is to use bolted joints to attach two structural members and the bolts are pre-tensed. Buffer pads are attached to the composite beam to avoid localized damage. To simulate the real life situation, a CAD model is generated using ABAQUS 1] consisting of a thick composite beam with eight bolt holes, buffer pads, steel <b>clamping</b> <b>blocks,</b> steel washers and steel bolts. The composite beam is attached to a rigid <b>block</b> using a <b>clamping</b> <b>block,</b> washers and bolts. The finite element mesh is generated using 3 -D continuum elements, C 3 D 8 I. Nonlinear stress analysis is performed for bolt pre-tension and bending loads with material and contact nonlinearity. The numerical results depend on the element type in finite element analysis. Parametric study for element selection between SC 8, C 3 D 8 and C 3 D 20 is carried out. The finite element analysis results are compared with the experimental values. Different failure criteria are considered to study the failure behavior of the thick composite beam: Tsai-Wu, Christensen, and Puck, Hashin and quadratic delamination failure criteria. These failure criteria are coded in ABAQUS through user subroutines. The bolt holes act as stress concentration regions in the beam, where the failure behavior is studied utilizing the above criteria. The effect of different loading, such as bolt pre-tension, bending on the failure of the composite thick beam are investigated...|$|R

5000|$|A typical {{alternating}} current furnace {{is powered by}} a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 °C (5000 °F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch hoists or hydraulic cylinders. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the <b>electrode</b> <b>clamps)</b> or be [...] "hot arms", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency.

The free length of the beam is used to accommodate piezoelectric strain actuators. The two masses at the ends are equipped with inertial accelerometers.

Another arrangement is also studied where the two accelerometer outputs are time-integrated twice in order to implement displacement feedback loops that change the beam stiffness to shift the characteristic frequency of the device. The two feedback approaches are first analysed theoretically, using a mobility-impedance model, and then experimentally on a prototype absorber unit. The stability of the feedback loops is studied using the Nyq uist criterion in order to estimate the limits on the tuneable range of frequencies which are set by the maximum stable feedback gains. The study indicates that the stability margins for the acceleration feedback loops substantially depend on the application of an appropriate low-pass filter. On the contrary, the implementation of displacement feedback gives better stability margins...|$|R

The processes occurring on the electrodes and in the liquid phase during the arc discharge in the liquid phase (ADL) have been considered in the present work and we explain the mechanism of carbon nanostructures (CNS) formation proposing the model based on the analysis of existing regularities in behaviour of charged particles under extreme temperature and pressure gradients. The CNS synthesis by ADL method has been performed in dielectric liquids: hydrocarbons, liquid gases (N 2, Ar, He etc.), deionized water and others. Suspension containing clusters of synthesized nanostructures has been formed by the synthesis. The efficiency of this method is sharply increased by using arc discharge in the liquid phase where powder reagent layer is used as anode.
