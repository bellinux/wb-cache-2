40|$|A Master's Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the award of the Master Of Science degree of Loughborough University. The dissertation reviews the role of objective testing in mathematics at institutes <b>of</b> <b>further</b> <b>education</b> in the United Kingdom. The possibilities of usefully expanding this role are also discussed. Within typical <b>further</b> <b>education</b> classes, students exhibit a wider variation in age, maturity, and mathematical ability than is seen in school classes; because of this, testing in colleges is more important, and serves a greater range of purposes, than in schools. The variation in mathematical ability is particularly pronounced in courses where mathematics is a service subject, and any means of rapidly locating areas of weakness early in the course are most valuable. In many colleges, the bulk of the mathematics teaching is of this type, and it may be partly for this reason that <b>further</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> mathematics show at least as much interest in objective testing as do those of any other subject. The discussion of the potential role of objective testing with <b>further</b> <b>education</b> students in mathematics is, based, largely on the published findings of prominent researchers in educational assessment methods. The literature, however, covers the wide field <b>of</b> <b>education</b> generally, and evidence based on the writer's own experience at Birmingham Polytechnic is therefore included; a brief account is also given of the practices and attitudes at certain other colleges. Suggestions are offered regarding the use of objective tests at the beginning of, and throughout, each year of a course and proposals are also made for introducing such methods into the formal end-of- session examinations, where at present they appear to be little used. The complete replacement of conventional methods of examining is not suggested, but rather {{a combination of the two}} so as to exploit the various strengths of each method...|$|R

Goals such as these are likely to be identified internationally (Niss, 1996). Whether or not these goals are espoused by all Australasian mathematics educators, the question arises: Where is the research on the outcomes of school mathematics in relation to the non-cognitive and authentically practical aspects? How do governments, state and federal, as well as the community at large, evaluate the benefits of public and private investment in school mathematics education? Cognitive outcomes are monitored through year 12 assessments, TIMSS, and PISA, for example.

40|$|Efficient {{planning}} {{and execution of}} teaching process in art education depends on the teachers’ expertise, their creativity and attitude to teaching. In execution of teaching processes {{it is necessary to}} provide the conditions for development of potential students’ abilities, acquisition of art knowledge, skills and positive attitudes. The students’ active participation should also be stressed, as well as the use of modern teaching strategies, i. e. efficient teaching methods, different learning and teaching styles and respect of students’ developmental capacities- individual differences in adaptation, understanding and interpretation of teaching content. Past evaluation studies on adequacy <b>of</b> art <b>education</b> in primary schools have pointed {{to the fact that the}} majority <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> do not sufficiently apply methodical pluralism and creative approach to learning and teaching. Their passive attitude is reflected in the use of set ways <b>of</b> teaching. Art <b>education</b> is still perceived as “non- cognitive” activity in which it is sufficient to direct the students’ activity towards practical work or, towards introduction of and work with art material and accessories, i. e. acquisition of motoric aptitude. The execution of art teaching, particularly in lower grades of primary school, often shows certain passivity and non- critical approach <b>of</b> the <b>teachers,</b> which is seen in use of set teaching methods and procedures and in lack of freedom and openness for use of more efficient ways of learning and teaching (Tacol, Tomšič Čerkez, 2004). The subject of research is modernization of the way of learning and teaching art in schools, i. e. testing of successfulness of interactive approach to learning and teaching with the use of combination of general and specific (art) teaching methods. Interactive style of learning and teaching should ensure quality realization of curriculum and developmental abilities of each individual student, in accordance with his/her individual features. This approach also includes the use of modern teaching strategies such as active, empiric, independent, investigative learning and learning through problem solving. In order to check the artistic abilities and skills of students in managing of art techniques, their level of knowledge and understanding of art terms and artistic creativity of students, two different ways of execution of teaching process were included in the research. The first one used approaches to learning and teaching in line with the modern pedagogical concepts resulting from cognitivist and constructivist theories. The second way of teaching was realized through use of usual, set approaches to teaching and learning. Quantitative and qualitative analysis on the basis of results achieved by the pedagogical experiment was used in the research. In the first part of research a questionnaire for teachers in lower grades of primary school was used, together with the knowledge test for students. In the second part, for testing of development of art ability in managing of art material and techniques, understanding of art terms and determination of the level of artistic creativity, a five- degree evaluation scale of Likert type was used (evaluation was done by three independent evaluators). Creativity of art objects was evaluated in reference to six categories: sensitivity for art problem, elaboration (organization and use of art elements), flexibility (solving art problems in a new way), fluency (abundance of ideas), originality (unusualness of ideas) and redefinition (connection of previous art experiences into a new art content) (Karlavaris, 1991). Characteristics of measuring instruments were checked by factorial analysis and hypotheses by Mann-Whitney’s U-test and Spearman’s correlation test.
