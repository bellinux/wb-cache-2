5|$|As the Eisenhower dollar awaited <b>its</b> <b>demise,</b> {{approximately}} 50 {{million per}} year were struck, using the eagle design for the reverse. In both years, the majority coined were at Denver. No silver collector's edition was issued; the blue and brown Ikes ended with 1974.|$|E
5|$|As the new-fangled Ford Model Ts {{and other}} early {{automobiles}} increasingly {{took to the}} roads in the 1920s, inland steamship lines in the U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on their boats. By the Depression-ravaged 1930s, however, the Old Bay Line {{became one of the}} first inland steamship companies to promote the carriage of automobiles as a means of filling its ships' empty cargo holds. The Depression and loss of business to improved highways took an increasing toll of many U.S. steamship lines in the 1930s, as historic companies such as the Fall River Line ceased operation in 1937, preceded by the Lake Champlain company, which was the oldest steamboat line in the U.S. at <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> in 1932.|$|E

5|$|At his death, {{the role}} of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by Ivan III, Grand duke of Muscovy. He had married Andreas' sister, Sophia Paleologue, whose grandson, Ivan IV, would become the first Tsar of Russia (tsar, or czar, meaning caesar, is a term {{traditionally}} applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. The idea of the Russian Empire as the successive Third Rome was kept alive until <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> with the Russian Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that during the}} Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich rocks in the Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered {{the remains of a}} defensive hill-fort. It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued {{to be part of the}} Wealden iron industry until <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> in the late eighteenth century. An iron forge remains in the grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.|$|E
5|$|Fred Frith was a classically-trained violinist {{who turned}} to playing blues guitar while at school. In 1967 {{he went to}} Cambridge University where he and fellow student, Tim Hodgkinson formed the English avant-rock group Henry Cow. Frith and Hodgkinson {{remained}} with the band until <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> in 1978. After the release of Henry Cow's second album in May 1974, Frith recorded his debut solo album, Guitar Solos (1974), which featured unaccompanied and improvised experimental rock music played on prepared guitars by Frith without any overdubbing. Guitar Solos was well received by music critics, and was voted {{one of the best}} albums of 1974 by NME.|$|E

5|$|Since Du Tertre {{wrote that}} the macaws were prone to sickness, an {{outbreak}} of a disease, along with hunting, {{may have contributed to}} <b>its</b> <b>demise.</b> In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson quoted a letter by French writer M. de la Borde, which stated that macaws had become very rare in the Antillean islands because they were hunted for food. By then they could only be found in areas not frequented by humans, and were probably extinct soon afterwards. Parrots are often among the first species to be exterminated from a given locality, especially islands.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw {{was traded}} and hunted by Amerindians, and by Europeans after their {{arrival in the}} 15th century. Many {{individuals}} were brought to Europe as cagebirds, and 19 museum skins exist today. It had become rare by the mid-19th century due to pressure from hunting, trade, and habitat destruction. Hurricanes may also have contributed to <b>its</b> <b>demise.</b> The last reliable accounts of the species are from the 1850s on Cuba and 1864 on Isla de la Juventud, but it may have persisted until 1885.|$|E
5|$|The Talbot Samba {{is a city}} car {{manufactured}} by the PSA Group in the former Simca factory in Poissy, France, and marketed under the short-lived modern-day Talbot brand from 1981 to 1986. Based on the Peugeot 104, {{it was the only}} Talbot not inherited from Chrysler Europe, engineered by PSA alone. It was also the last new Talbot to be launched, and the last in production. <b>Its</b> <b>demise</b> in 1986 was effectively the end of the Talbot brand for passenger cars. Launched initially as a three-door hatchback, it was also for some time the only small car available in a factory-ordered cabrio body style, and the most economical car in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{passes through}} a region which is largely rural, much of which is drained artificially. For most of its length, it is flanked by the North Soak Drain and the South Soak Drain, because it {{disrupted}} the established drainage scheme. Thorne Moors lie {{to the north and}} Hatfield Chase lies to the south. Until <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> in 1966, the canal was crossed by the Axholme Joint Railway at Ealand. The swing bridge was retained for several years after closure, so that stators from the nearby Keadby Power Station could be taken away for repairs, as there were no road bridges which could support the weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening <b>its</b> <b>demise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with <b>its</b> <b>demise.</b> Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought, but admitted {{that he did not}} know how to facilitate this.|$|E
50|$|Characene was {{the last}} rump state of the Seleucid Empire. Maga, therefore, comes as the last {{recorded}} successor of Alexander the Great {{and the end of}} his rule marks the terminus of the Hellenistic Age. Although the level of Hellenisation in Charax had diminished since its conquest by Trajan a century earlier, it is still true that Alexander's last foundation was also the last point of his dreamed union of east and west. Ironically <b>its</b> <b>demises</b> came {{at the hands of a}} resurrected Persian Empire.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to running the museum, Nettie {{had a large}} role in running the Master Building as a whole; however, the exact division of responsibilities between Nettie and her husband is unclear. She was secretary of the corporation, although this may have been a nominal position as Louis and his lawyer prepared most of the corporation's correspondence and its filings. She also probably helped her husband decide to provide more than one million dollars toward achieving the Roeriches' spiritual and cultural ambitions. She met with the Roeriches and their other supporters in making plans for the Roerich Museum, Master Institute, Corona Mundi, and the other organizations housed in the Master Building. She was active as president of the Roerich Society and, after <b>its</b> <b>demise,</b> directed the Riverside Museum for many years.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne Storm is a rugby {{league team}} based in Melbourne, Victoria, that {{participates in the}} National Rugby League. The first fully {{professional}} rugby league team based in the state, they entered the competition in 1998. Melbourne Storm was originally a Super League initiative and created in 1997 during the Super League war. The club plays its home games at AAMI Park. The Storm has won three official premierships since its inception, in 1999, 2012 and 2017, and has contested several more grand finals. Melbourne Storm also competed in the NRL's Under-20s competition (as Melbourne Thunderbolts) from 2008 until <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> in 2017. In addition, the club has also expanded into netball with {{a joint venture with}} University of the Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast Lightning commenced playing in the National Netball League in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Great Revolt and the {{subsequent}} sacking of Jerusalem in 70 CE brought about the destruction of Herod's Temple, including the Royal Stoa, {{by members of the}} Roman X Fretensis, XII Fulminata, XV Apollinaris and V Macedonica legions under the command of emperor Vespasian's son Titus. It is likely that the stoa was modified during the initial phases of the revolt when the Temple Mount was fortified, first by Simon Bar Giora and then by John of Gischala. The main entry at Robinson's Arch was destroyed and towers built. Excavated remains of the Stoa provide evidence of <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> in a great fire. Chemical analysis of the remains has shown that some of the materials underwent transformations requiring a minimum temperature of —a result of sustained, high-temperature burning consistent with Josephus's account of destruction in a large conflagration. Some remains also contain the mineral apatite, a component of bone, though its origins, human or animal, are unknown.|$|E

5|$|In the {{entertainment}} sector various ploys {{were used to}} attract tourists. In 1920 an annual beauty contest, named the Pageant of Pulchritude (also known as the Miss Universe contest) in 1926, was started in Galveston by C.E. Barfield, manager of a local amusement park owned by the Maceos. The contest was part of Splash Day, the kick-off of the summer tourist season each year, {{and became the first}} international beauty contest, attracting participants from England, Russia, Turkey, and many other nations until <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> in 1932. This contest is said to have served {{as a model for the}} modern Miss America pageant and others. At its height the pageant tripled the island's population the weekend it ran. Even after the international contest's closing, Splash Day was revived in various forms and continued to attract tourists. Other annual events included an extravagant Mardi Gras celebration in spring. The grand Buccaneer Hotel was constructed in 1929 creating an additional hotel landmark to compete with the Galvez (in addition to many other smaller hotel venues).|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys antillarum {{probably}} became extinct {{about the}} 1870s {{and is currently}} listed as such by the IUCN Red List. Its disappearance is usually attributed to the small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), which was introduced to Jamaica in 1872, and sometimes also to introduced Rattus species. Ray, on the other hand, argued that {{the significance of the}} mongoose had been overrated. Instead, he suggested that Oryzomys antillarum may have been affected by the massive environmental changes that occurred on the island after the British takeover in 1655. In that period, the bulk of the island came to be used for cultivation, so that the native habitat of Oryzomys was destroyed. Thus, Oryzomys was reduced to competition with introduced rats in man-made habitats, to which the latter are well adapted. Perhaps, Ray wrote, the black rat may {{not have been able to}} extirpate Oryzomys, but the brown rat, a later and more assertive invader, brought it to extinction. Cats and dogs preying on Oryzomys may also have contributed to <b>its</b> <b>demise.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 3rd-century crisis {{started a}} chain-reaction of {{socio-economic}} effects that proved decisive {{for the development}} of the late army. The combination of barbarian devastation and reduced tax-base due to plague bankrupted the imperial government, which resorted to issuing ever more debased coin e.g. the antoninianus, the silver coin used to pay the troops in this period, lost 95% of its silver content between its launch in 215 and <b>its</b> <b>demise</b> in the 260s. Thus 20 times more money could be distributed with the same amount of precious metal. This led to rampant price inflation: for example, the price of wheat under Diocletian was 67 times the typical price under the Principate. The monetary economy collapsed and the army was obliged to rely on unpaid food levies to obtain supplies. Food levies were raised without regard to fairness, ruining the border provinces where the military was mainly based. Soldiers' salaries became worthless, which reduced the army's recruits to a subsistence-level existence. This in turn discouraged volunteers and forced the government to rely on conscription and large-scale recruitment of barbarians into the regular army because of the shortfalls caused by the plague. By the mid-4th century, barbarian-born men probably accounted for about a quarter of all recruits (and over a third in elite regiments), likely a far higher share than in the 1st and 2nd centuries.|$|E
