5|$|In 1999, Herren {{signed to}} the British label Warp under two aliases, Prefuse 73 and Savath & Savalas, after Warp staff <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> {{previous}} record of Herren's which had sparked {{their interest in}} his work. Herren {{was familiar with the}} label through artists Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, but chose to sign to Warp as he was a fan of the group Broadcast who had released an EP through the label. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives features rapping from Mikah 9, Aesop Rock and MF Doom, and vocals from Sam Prekop of the indie rock band the Sea and Cake. The vocalists did not work directly with Herren, but sent him audio tapes of their own vocal recordings. Herren later commented on having Prekop sing on the album, noting that having an indie rock artist on the album was his way of trying to get his sound out to a new audience.|$|E
5|$|The British {{decided to}} {{despatch}} {{one of their}} Commonwealth ministers to Rhodesia for talks during early July, but debated for a while over {{whether it should be}} Bottomley or his deputy, Cledwyn Hughes, who should be sent. Wilson considered this a matter of urgency as he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> rumour that Rhodesia might declare independence on its main national holiday, Rhodes' Day (that year 12 July), but this proved false. On 15 July, Britain's High Commissioner to Rhodesia, John Baines Johnston, was instructed to propose a week-long round of talks between Smith and Hughes in Salisbury. Johnston was given permission to cave if the Rhodesian Prime Minister insisted on meeting with Bottomley, but this did not prove necessary: Smith cabled back on the 18th accepting Hughes' visit. The British delegation arrived in Salisbury four days later.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E

25|$|Jean Scheyfve {{recorded}} Cleutin's {{visit to}} England in February 1552, writing {{that he had}} 30 or 40 captains and soldiers with him, and <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> rumour that other French troops had passed through Ireland from the garrisons in Scotland, and that some might pass through England. After visiting France he returned to England en route to Scotland in July, but did not visit the English court.|$|E
25|$|The day {{itself can}} not be determined, but {{it is said that}} in April, 1808, Naomi went missing. Mr. Adams {{gathered}} a search party and followed the horse tracks to now Randleman, North Carolina, where they found Naomi Wise's body in the river. Mrs. Ann Davis, a resident close to the water, confirmed that she <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> woman screaming the night before. The coroner from Asheboro examined the drowned and battered body of Naomi and found her pregnant.|$|E
25|$|However, {{concerning}} the legend that cats could speak, {{it has been}} pointed out {{that it may have}} arisen because humans would misinterpret the cat's meowing as human language, and for this reason some would say that the cat is not a type of yōkai. In 1992 (Heisei 4), in the Yomiuri newspaper, there was an article that argued that when people thought they <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> cat speak, upon listening a second time, they realized that it was simply the cat's meowing and that it was only coincidence that it resembled a word in human language.|$|E

Mike Gray; and Billy Lang, a cattle rancher. Clanton, Crain, and Gray were either still in their bedrolls or in the act of getting dressed when killed. Lang {{was the only one who}} had a chance to fight back. Harry Ernshaw, a milk farmer, was grazed by a bullet on the nose; Billy Byers feigned death until the soldiers left.|$|E
25|$|Cleutin's {{correspondence}} {{during the}} discussions on a Papal dispensation for {{the marriage of}} Mary and Lord Darnley does not survive in the Vatican Archives. Cleutin wrote to Charles IX on 15 April 1566, to say that news {{of the murder of}} David Riccio and Mary's plight had reached Rome by several letters, although he had not yet been informed himself or discussed the events with the Pope. He <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> muddled report that Mary, who was pregnant, had fled from Edinburgh to a castle, but was brought back to Edinburgh by Darnley, and now wished to escape to France. The Bishop of Dumblane arrived with the official news on 26 April.|$|E
25|$|Alvin Thompson Smith {{was born}} in Branford, Connecticut, on November 17, 1802, to Thomas Smith. In the early 1830s he moved to Quincy, Illinois, where {{he worked as a}} {{carpenter}} and where he married Abigail Raymond (born April 21, 1793) on March 19, 1840. In 1840, he and his new wife crossed the Great Plains on what became the Oregon Trail with P. B. Littlejohn and the Reverend Harvey L. Clark and their wives, along with fur traders. They left in March after Smith <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> speech about a group of Native Americans who had traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, and asked to learn about Christianity. Clark and Littlejohn invited him to help establish a mission independent of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} is documented in America {{as early as}} 1721, when Zabdiel Boylston, {{at the urging of}} Cotton Mather, successfully inoculated two slaves and his own son. Mather, a prominent Boston minister, <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> description of the African practice of inoculation from his Sudanese slave, Onesimus, in 1706, and later from Timoni's report to the Royal Society, but had been previously unable to convince local physicians to attempt the procedure. Following this initial success, Boylston began performing inoculations throughout Boston, despite much controversy and at least one attempt upon his life. The effectiveness of the procedure was proven when, of the nearly three hundred people Boylston inoculated during the outbreak, only six died, whereas the mortality rate among those who contracted the disease naturally was one in six. Boylston traveled to London in 1724. There he published his results and was elected to the Royal Society in 1726.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutor}} called Joseph Faulkner, {{a tailor}} who knew Whelan in Montreal, {{hoping that he}} would testify about Whelan's Fenian connections; while he said he recollected Whelan being angered by McGee during the election season, which was contradicted by other witnesses who claimed Whelan showed no interest in politics, {{he said there was}} no known Fenian connection. Another witness identified as Turner testified that he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> member of parliament mention that the government had offered Doyle $16,000 and passage to anywhere in the world to restart his life, if he would make a sworn statement against Whelan. However Susan Wheatley later testified that she had heard Turner say he would swear his grandfather's life away for $10,000 or $20,000 and no mention was made of Doyle. Later witnesses were actually directly asked to swear whether they had received any money for their testimony.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{used the}} G.I. Bill to study from 1946-47 at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, {{where he took}} {{advantage}} of the museum's collections, and then at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. While in Paris Kelly established his aesthetic. There in the City of Lights he attended classes infrequently, but immersed himself in the rich artistic resources of the French capital. He <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> lecture by Max Beckmann on the French artist Paul Cézanne in 1948 and moved to Paris that year. There he encountered fellow Americans John Cage and Merce Cunningham, experimenting in music and dance, respectively; the French Surrealist artist Jean Arp; and the abstract sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, whose simplification of natural forms had a lasting effect on him. The experience of visiting artists such as Alberto Magnelli, Francis Picabia, Alberto Giacometti and Georges Vantongerloo in their studios was transformative.|$|E

25|$|The {{rest of the}} band, {{determined}} to continue, soon announced Nick Tart as his replacement. Tart had previously worked with many midlands based bands. Robin George recruited Tart after seeing him perform live at JBs in Dudley with Alabama Bombshell, a new project was underway to re-record some of Robin's songs that artists such as, Glenn Hughes, Ruby Turner, Robert Plant and coincidentally Sean Harris had previously recorded. Between 1992 -1996 they toured the UK, performed a live TV appearance on The James Whale show, and Radio 1 sessions with Tommy Vance under the name Life before releasing an album entitled Cocoon. Nick left the music business in 1997 but joined a new band in 2003. After a few weeks Diamond Head drummer Karl Wilcox dropped in on a rehearsal (as {{he was a friend}} of their drummer) and after hearing Nick sing, Karl immediately got on the phone to Brian saying he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> great singer and passed on his phone number. After introductions Tart agreed to join.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E

500|$|Yarrell's Birds was {{mentioned}} in a well-known letter to The Times in 1913, when a Fellow of the Royal Society, the naturalist and paleontologist Richard Lydekker, wrote on 6 February that he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> cuckoo, explaining that though contrary to Yarrell's statement that {{records of the}} bird calling as early as March [...] "must be treated with suspicion, if not with incredulity", it was a definite fact. Six days later on 12 February 1913, Lydekker wrote again, confessing that [...] "the note was uttered by a bricklayer's labourer". Letters about the first cuckoo became a tradition in the newspaper.|$|E
