5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively <b>inelastic</b> <b>demand</b> the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E

30|$|Using elastic {{analysis}} is considered in many seismic codes {{due to the}} simplicity and modeling assumptions. But, the experience of previous earthquakes confirms the entry of a structure to inelastic region. Thus, linear analysis cannot provide an accurate picture of <b>inelastic</b> <b>demands.</b> Although, the Nonlinear Dynamic Procedures (NDP) can provide a precise estimation of the structural responses, but the complexities of modeling, initial assumptions and earthquake content can affect {{the results of this}} method adversely. Therefore, several research efforts have focused on a simplified method of nonlinear analysis, which calculate envelope of <b>inelastic</b> <b>demands</b> of structure using simulation of structural behavior against an incremental monotonic loading. This method is known as Nonlinear Static Procedures (NSPs) or pushover analysis and it has been entered in different codes including the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design of buildings (Standard 2800 - 4 th edition). This method is also used in Performance-Based-Design. That is why several recent studies have had more focus on developing and promoting modified NSPs (conventional and adaptive). Today, Conventional Pushover Analysis (CPA) has been entered in many seismic codes such as ASCE/SEI 41 - 13 (2013). In conventional form, first a lateral Load Pattern (LP) is selected. In different codes, the LP is usually defined based on the relation of static load distribution over the height, uniform distribution and modal distribution. Under this monotonic LP, the structure is pushed up to reach the target displacement. Then, <b>inelastic</b> <b>demands</b> of structure are recorded and compared with preselected performance criteria. The main deficiency of conventional methods is that the LP remains constant during plastic hinge development. In other words, the effect of nonlinearity on stiffness matrix and corresponding mode shapes on the LPs are neglected. To overcome an aforementioned deficiency, several advanced methods have been proposed such as multi, single and adaptive modal NSPs. In the adaptive NSPs, in each loading step, stiffness matrix is calculated based on elastic and inelastic properties of elements and the LP corresponding to the mode shape of the same step is produced. However, performing adaptive NSPs requires special calculations.|$|R

40|$|Interaction between closely-spaced {{buildings}} {{subject to}} earthquake induced strong ground motions, termed {{in the literature}} as “seismic pounding”, occurs commonly during major seismic events in contemporary congested urban environments. This influence is not taken into account by current codes of practice and is rarely considered in practice {{at the design stage}} of new buildings constructed “in contact” with existing ones. Thus far, limited research work has been devoted to quantify the influence of slab-to-slab pounding on the <b>inelastic</b> seismic <b>demands</b> at critical locations of structural members in adjacent structures that are not aligned in series. In this respect, this paper considers a typical case study of a “new” reinforced concrete (R/C) EC 8 -compliant, torsionally sensitive, 7 -story corner building constructed within a block, in bi-lateral contact with two existing R/C 5 -story structures with same height floors. A non-linear local plasticity numerical model is developed and a series of non-linear time-history analyses is undertaken considering the corner building “in isolation” from the existing ones (no-pounding case), and in combination with the existing ones (pounding case). Numerical results are reported in terms of averages of ratios of peak <b>inelastic</b> rotation <b>demands</b> at all structural elements (beams, columns, shear walls) at each storey. It is shown that seismic pounding reduces on average the <b>inelastic</b> <b>demands</b> of the structural members at the lower floors of the 7 -story building.

The {{potential}} {{basis of}} a simplified methodology for estimating the inelastic peak floor acceleration demand (PFA) of multi-story buildings subjected to seismic excitation is explored. Inelastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillators are used to find a relation between the lateral strength and the <b>inelastic</b> acceleration <b>demand.</b> Effects of positive as well as negative post yielding stiffness and different damping types are assessed. Using regression analysis, a simplified approach is proposed to estimate <b>inelastic</b> acceleration <b>demands</b> for use within a probabilistic framework. Based on a fundamental mode approximation an existing approach for predicting elastic PFA demands is extended to inelastic multi-story structures. Pros and cons of this methodology are discussed, and further developments are recommended...|$|R
30|$|Evaluating the {{capability}} of elastic Load Patterns (LPs) including seismic codes and modified LPs such as Method of Modal Combination (MMC) and Upper Bound Pushover Analysis (UBPA) in estimating <b>inelastic</b> <b>demands</b> of non deteriorating steel moment frames is the main objective of this study. The Static Nonlinear Procedure (NSP) is implemented {{and the results of}} NSP are compared with Nonlinear Time History Analysis (NTHA). The focus is on the effects of near-fault pulselike ground motions. The primary demands of interest are the maximum floor displacement, the maximum story drift angle over the height, the maximum global ductility, the maximum inter-story ductility and the capacity curves. Five types of LPs are selected and the <b>inelastic</b> <b>demands</b> are calculated under four levels of inter-story target ductility (μ t) using OpenSees software. The results show that the increase in μ t coincides with the migration of the peak demands over the height from the top to the bottom stories. Therefore, all LPs estimate the story lateral displacement accurately at the lower stories. The results are almost independent of the number of stories. While, the inter-story drift angle (IDR) obtained from MMC method has the most appropriate accuracy among the other LPs. Although, the accuracy of this method decreases with increasing μ t so that with increasing number of stories, IDR is smaller or greater than the values resulted from NTHA depending on the position of captured results. In addition, increasing μ t decreases the accuracy of all LPs in determination of critical story position. In this case, the MMC method has the best coincidence with distribution of inter-story ductility over the height.|$|R

30|$|This study {{indicates}} that for structures responding primarily in the first mode, pushover methods may be a reliable choice to estimate <b>inelastic</b> <b>demands.</b> However, the validity depends {{on the level of}} expected inelastic behavior and the number of stories. On the other hand, the results show that in low-rise structures, all load patterns provide fairly accurate estimation of the global and inter-story demands. By increasing the number of stories the MMC appears to be promising in terms of better estimating peak values of critical inelastic response quantities such as inter-story drifts. It is shown that considering sufficient number of modes, inter-story drifts estimated by MMC is generally similar to trends resulted from NTHA. Moreover, studying all results shows that due to the pulse like near-fault ground shakings, the MMC method could be used as an appropriate load pattern in calculating distributed <b>inelastic</b> <b>demands</b> of structure over the height. However, the accuracy of this load pattern is dependent on the inter-story ductility level. Finally, this paper indicates that special care should be taken when using pushover procedures since the lateral load pattern used to estimate demand could have a significant influence on the computed demands (each load pattern has an inherent capability to estimate specific response). The comparison of the NTHA and NSPs results reveals that the pushover methods tend to underestimate demands at the upper levels, signifying the relevance of higher mode effects in mid to high-rise structures except the result of MMC. Moreover, each load pattern has a different result of capacity curve with different elastic and inelastic stiffness. Therefore, using the MMC cannot guaranty the unique ultimate capacity curve of the structure and this is the main disadvantage of this method.|$|R
40|$|The Emilia 2012 {{sequence}} featured seven {{events of}} moment magnitude (M) > 5, five of which occurred between May 20 and May 29, 2012. These earthquakes were structurally damaging {{over a wide}} area. The damage included partial or total collapse of industrial precast reinforced-concrete structures, historical masonry, and mainly nonstructural damage to reinforced-concrete buildings; see Section 8 (Data and sharing resources) for damage report repository. These structural typologies are, in principle, sensitive to different ground-motion intensity measures. For example, loss of support requires significant displacement demand at relatively long periods, while infilling damage {{is due to the}} ground-motion amplitude at higher frequencies, and masonry structures are comparatively more sensitive to the cyclic content of ground shaking. Moreover, because events were concentrated in time and space, {{it can be argued that}} the cumulative effects of the sequence contributed to the damage. As the current seismic code [C. S. LL. PP. 2008] uses a seismic hazard map [Stucchi et al. 2011] to determine the seismic actions for structural design, when a strong earthquake occurs, probabilistic estimates are understandably questioned for their consistency with respect to the observed ground motion. While it is easy to show that in terms of frequency of exceedance of intensity measures, the hazard can hardly be validated via the records of a single earthquake [e. g., Iervolino 2012], on the other hand, it can certainly be verified whether the observations are compatible or atypical with respect to what is predicted by the tools used in best-practice hazard studies. These issues mostly motivated the preliminary analysis briefly presented in this report; i. e., to investigate the engineering seismic demand (peak and cyclic) and to compare this with the prediction models.
