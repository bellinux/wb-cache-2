5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the {{relevance}} of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of {{life-cycle}} (or well-to-wheels, WTW) {{energy and}} emission impacts of vehicle/fuel systems requires energy use (or <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies)</b> of <b>energy</b> processing or conversion activities. In most such studies, petroleum fuels are included. Thus, determination of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of petroleum refineries becomes a necessary step for life-cycle analyses of vehicle/fuel systems. Petroleum refinery <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies</b> {{can then be}} used to determine the total amount of process energy use for refinery operation. Furthermore, since refineries produce multiple products, allocation of energy use and emissions associated with petroleum refineries to various petroleum products is needed for WTW analysis of individual fuels such as gasoline and diesel. In particular, GREET, the life-cycle model developed at Argonne National Laboratory with DOE sponsorship, compares energy use and emissions of various transportation fuels including gasoline and diesel. Energy use in petroleum refineries is key components of well-to-pump (WTP) energy use and emissions of gasoline and diesel. In GREET, petroleum refinery overall <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are used to determine petroleum product specific <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> Argonne has developed petroleum refining efficiencies from LP simulations of petroleum refineries and EIA survey data of petroleum refineries up to 2006 (see Wang, 2008). This memo documents Argonne's most recent update of petroleum refining efficiencies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{proposed}} green (energy-efficient) coverage probability, link and network <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in the downlink of a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) consisting of $K$ independent Poisson point processes (PPPs) of base stations (BSs). The important statistical {{properties of the}} universal (general) cell association functions are first studied and the cell load statistics for power-law cell association functions, which can characterize the accurate void cell probability of a BS in every tier, is also derived. A simple and feasible green channel-aware cell association (GCA) scheme is proposed and the green coverage probability is also proposed for any particular cell association scheme, such as the maximum received power association (MRPA) and nearest base station association (NBA) schemes. Then the link and network <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are proposed to characterize the mean spectrum efficiency per unit power consumption for a BS and the mean area spectrum efficiency for a HetNet, respectively. All the tight bounds on the green coverage probability, link and network <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the GCA, MRPA and NBA schemes are found. They are theoretically shown to pose the fundamental maximum limits on the link and network <b>energy</b> <b>efficiencies</b> achieved by any other cell association schemes and such a fact is validated by numerical results as well.
