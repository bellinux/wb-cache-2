Nevertheless, he was again selected to the NL All-Star team. His offensive strategy changed in early August, when he began a hitting streak that spanned the season's final 36 games; during the streak, he hit [...]379. It was the longest hitting streak in Phillies' history, surpassing Ed Delahanty, whose streak lasted 31 games. Throughout the streak, Rollins aspired to maintain a team-first mentality, and noted that he would trade the streak for a playoff berth: [...] "If we lose and I keep the streak, what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>The</b> season is automatically over. The playoffs is everything. That's what we all want." [...] Ultimately, the Phillies missed the playoffs by one game. Overall, Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple-double, tying Johnny Damon for most among active players, and posted a [...]290 batting average with 12 home runs, 54 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of {{interest}} rates, a very common but ambiguous way to say that an interest rate rose from 10% per annum to 15% per annum, for example, {{is to say that}} the interest rate increased by 5%, which could theoretically mean that it increased from 10% per annum to 10.05% per annum.

Undoubtedly, I say, the desert of Mount Sinai. What then is our obvious destiny? A lady of your intelligence must gather at once that it is----?' He paused and gazed at me.|$|E

What the world calls civilization, as distinguished from religion, is a retrograde movement, and will ultimately lead {{us back to}} the barbarism from which we have escaped. For instance, you talk of progress: what is the chief social movement of all the countries that three centuries ago separated from the unity of the Church of Christ? The rejection of the sacrament of Christian matrimony. The introduction of the law of divorce, which is, in fact, only a middle term to the abolition of marriage. What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>The</b> extinction of the home and the household on which God has rested civilization. If there be no home, the child belongs to the state, not to the parent. The state educates the child, and without religion, because the state in a country of progress acknowledges no religion. For every man is not only to think as he likes, but to write and to speak as he likes, and to sow with both hands broadcast, where he will, errors, heresies, and blasphemies, without any authority on earth to restrain the scattering of this seed of universal desolation. And this system, which would substitute for domestic sentiment and Divine belief the unlimited and licentious action of human intellect and human will, is called progress. What is it but a revolt against God?" ...|$|E

What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>The</b> separation between Church and State, talked of {{for a long}} time, now demonstrated. And what does separation between Church and State mean? That society is no longer consecrated. The civil governments of the world no longer profess to be Catholic. The faithful indeed among their subjects will be represented at the council by their pastors, but the civil powers have separated themselves from the Church; either by royal edict, or legislative enactment, or revolutionary changes, they have abolished {{the legal status of}} the Catholic Church within their territory. It is not their choice; they are urged on by an invisible power that is anti-Christian, and which is the true, natural, and implacable enemy of the one visible and universal Church. The coming anarchy is called progress, because it advances along the line of departure from the old Christian order of the world. Christendom was the offspring of the Christian family, and the foundation of the Christian family is the sacrament of matrimony, the sprit of all domestic and public morals. The anti-Christian societies are opposed to the principle of home. When they have destroyed the hearth, the morality of society will perish. A settlement in the foundations may be slow in sinking, but it brings all down at last. The next step in de-Christianizing the political life of nations is to establish national education without Christianity. This is systematically aimed at wherever the revolution has its way. The period and policy of Julian are returning. Some think this bodes ill for the Church; no, it is the State that will suffer. The secret societies are hurrying the civil governments of the world, and mostly the governments who disbelieve in their existence, to the brink of a precipice, over which monarchies, and law, and civil order, will ultimately fall and perish together." ...|$|E

50|$|Tina’s imperfections, {{if she has}} any, are of {{the kind}} that are quirky, and {{therefore}} endearing. This is good for a cartoon character. I believe the main character of a comic strip should be one that’s likable. But <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> main character should be flawless? It’s the weaknesses, or fixations, that make characters interesting. The other characters of the strip all have fixations that make them imperfect. Rob, the manager of Pepper’s Restaurant, is a misfit neat/control freak who hasn’t yet realized that it’s now cool to be a geek. Carlos is a sack of testosterone who must prove himself to be the manliest at any cost. Suzanne is a spoiled 30 something flake who has so many weaknesses she’s created a personality out of being less than perfect. And then there’s Monica. If you read the strip then I don’t have to waste my words on Monica. Tina stands apart. One good {{reason for this is that}} Tina is what’s known in the comedy world as the “Straight Man”. She’s the only sane character in a world of insanity. In the strip she represents logic, the voice of reason, while every one else is crazy. This is where most of the humor comes from.|$|E

The other one highlights the pervasive use of models in experimentation.

This question provides the departure point for this chapter. It is an important question because the answer has implications for how the creative process works, {{as well as for}} computational models of creativity, and thus it provides the departure point for this chapter. Next we look at how the creator sifts out from its vast contents those items to incorporate into a creative project, and converts these raw materials into a form that "gels" with the project. We then explore the hypothesis that the creative mind forges "mental wormholes" that connect concepts and percepts, often from seemingly disparate domains. Finally, we take a brief look at the strangely non-compositional interactions that take place in these mental wormholes, and techniques being advanced to model and understand these interactions.

A recent study requiring participants to detect small physical changes in melodies having a subjectively imposed beat (Repp, 2010) suggested a negative answer. The present study used a much simpler beat induction paradigm to revisit this issue. Following a brief isochronous induction sequence, musically trained participants heard two probe tones, one of which, or neither of which, fell on the projected beat. The task was to compare the two probe tones {{with regard to their}} relative loudness, which was varied systematically. The results showed that some participants judged an on-beat probe tone to be relatively louder than an off-beat tone, but only when the second probe tone fell on the first beat following the induction sequence and the beat tempo was relatively fast.
