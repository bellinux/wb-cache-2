5|$|Iceberg/Crisphead - {{the most}} popular type in the US, it is very <b>heat-sensitive</b> and was {{originally}} adapted for growth in the northern US. It ships well, but is low in flavor and nutritional content, being composed of even more water than other lettuce types.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already <b>heat-sensitive,</b> TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be <b>heat-sensitive,</b> was not identified. A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest growth promotion activity, 164% at 3.6µm, of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A <b>heat-sensitive</b> resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via <b>heat-sensitive</b> plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled into the walls when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E
25|$|Microwave {{volumetric}} heating (MVH) is {{the newest}} available pasteurization technology. It uses microwaves to heat liquids, suspensions, or semi-solids in a continuous flow. Because MVH delivers energy evenly and deeply into the whole body of a flowing product, it allows for gentler and shorter heating, so that almost all <b>heat-sensitive</b> substances in the milk are preserved.|$|E
25|$|Some snakes {{have extra}} sets of visual organs (in the loosest {{sense of the}} word) {{in the form of}} pits {{sensitive}} to infrared radiation (heat). Such <b>heat-sensitive</b> pits are particularly well developed in the pit vipers, but are also found in boas and pythons. These pits allow the snakes to sense the body heat of birds and mammals, enabling pit vipers to hunt rodents in the dark.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet light, {{specifically}} UVB, {{has been}} shown to cause cataracts, and some evidence indicates sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life. Microwave radiation has also been found to cause cataracts. The mechanism is unclear, but it may include changes in <b>heat-sensitive</b> enzymes that normally protect cell proteins in the lens. Another possible mechanism is direct damage to the lens from pressure waves induced in the aqueous humor.|$|E
25|$|Dry food (8–10% moisture) is {{generally}} made by extrusion cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed {{on the food}} to increase palatability, and other minor ingredients, such as <b>heat-sensitive</b> vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall paper bags, sometimes with a plastic film layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.|$|E
25|$|As a {{toxic gas}} that leaves no residue on items it contacts, {{ethylene}} oxide is a surface disinfectant that {{is widely used}} in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of <b>heat-sensitive</b> tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes. It is so extremely flammable and explosive that it {{is used as a}} main component of thermobaric weapons; therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid to control its hazardous nature.|$|E
25|$|Like vacuum {{distillation}}, {{steam distillation}} {{is a method}} for distilling compounds which are <b>heat-sensitive.</b> The temperature of the steam is easier to control than {{the surface of a}} heating element, and allows a high rate of heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature. This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Harden and William Young {{along with}} Nick Sheppard determined, {{in a second}} experiment, that a <b>heat-sensitive</b> high-molecular-weight {{subcellular}} fraction (the enzymes) and a heat-insensitive low-molecular-weight cytoplasm fraction (ADP, ATP and NAD+ and other cofactors) are required together for fermentation to proceed. This experiment begun by observing that dialyzed (purified) yeast juice could not ferment or even create a sugar phosphate. This mixture was rescued {{with the addition of}} undialyzed yeast extract that had been boiled. Boiling the yeast extract renders all proteins inactive (as it denatures them). The ability of boiled extract plus dialyzed juice to complete fermentation suggests that the cofactors were non-protein in character.|$|E
25|$|Chemicals {{are also}} used for sterilization. Heating {{provides}} a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, {{but it is not}} always appropriate if it will damage <b>heat-sensitive</b> materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. In these situations chemicals, either as gases or in liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for workplace safety, as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.|$|E
25|$|The African rock python's body {{is thick}} {{and covered with}} colored blotches, often joining up in a broad, {{irregular}} stripe. Body markings vary between brown, olive, chestnut, and yellow, but fade to white on the underside. The head is triangular and is marked on top with a dark brown “spear-head” outlined in buffy yellow. Teeth are many, sharp, and backwardly curved. Under the eye, there is a distinctive triangular marking, the subocular mark. Like all pythons, the scales of the African rock python are small and smooth. Those around the lips possess <b>heat-sensitive</b> pits, which are used to detect warm-blooded prey, even in the dark. Pythons also possess two functioning lungs, unlike more advanced snakes which have only one, and also have small, visible pelvic spurs, {{believed to be the}} vestiges of hind limbs.|$|E
25|$|Named after John Tyndall, Tyndallization is an {{obsolete}} and lengthy process {{designed to}} reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, then repeating the process {{a total of three}} to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the <b>heat-sensitive</b> vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.|$|E
25|$|For {{patterns}} containing 0.5mg/ml laminin, {{a higher}} proportion of neurites grew on the microdispensed lines than between the lines. On 10mg/ml and 1mg/ml BSA protein patterns and fatty-acid free BSA protein patterns a significant number of neurites avoided the protein lines and grew between the lines. Thus, the fatty-acid-containing BSA lines were just as non-permissive for neurite growth as lines containing BSA with fatty acids. Because microdispensing does not require direct contact with the substrate surfaces, this technique can utilitze surfaces with delicate micro- or nanotopology that could be destroyed by contact. It is possible to vary the amount of protein deposited by dispensing more or less droplets. An advantage of microdispensing is that patterns can be created quickly in 5–10 minutes. Because the piezoelectric microdispenser does not require heating, <b>heat-sensitive</b> proteins and fluids as well as living cells can be dispensed.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{discontinued}} {{the use of}} PowerPC microprocessors in 2006. At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs {{announced this}} transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures. This was done in order to modernize the company's computers, keeping pace with Intel's low power Pentium M chips, especially for <b>heat-sensitive</b> laptops. The PowerPC G5 chip's heavy power consumption and heat output (the Power Mac G5 had to be liquid-cooled) also prevented its use in Mac notebook computers (as well as the original Mac mini), which were forced to use the older and slower PowerPC G4 chip. These shortcomings of the PowerPC chips were the main reasons behind Apple's transition to Intel processors, and the brand was revitalised by the subsequent boost in processing power available due to greater efficiency {{and the ability to}} implement multiple cores in Mac CPUs.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the artwork}} for Year Zero {{was created by}} Rob Sheridan, art {{director}} for Nine Inch Nails, who is also credited for artwork on With Teeth, among other Nine Inch Nails releases since 2000. The album features a thermo-chrome <b>heat-sensitive</b> CD face which appears black when first opened, but reveals a black binary code on a white background when heat is generated from the album being played. The binary sequence translates to [...] "exterminal.net", the address of a website involved in the alternate reality game. Reznor displayed displeasure at the extra $10 added to the CD's price in Australia for the thermo-coating, saying it only cost an extra 83¢ per CD and that the extra cost came from his pocket.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} {{version of the}} album contains ten tracks and the deluxe edition adds three acoustic versions as bonus tracks. Editions of the album sold at Walmart stores in North America feature a censored version of [...] "The Devil Beneath My Feet". Manson later criticized the store and its gun sales policy, categorizing Walmart in an Australian interview as [...] "that store in America which sells guns to kids but won't sell R-rated lyrics." [...] Manson went on to joke that he might [...] "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, {{and you get a}} free record with it when you buy a gun." [...] American CD versions of the album were packaged with black polycarbonate discs identical to those used by Sony for the original PlayStation in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of Concord Music from the same plant Sony used. A <b>heat-sensitive</b> thermal texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.|$|E
2500|$|To combat <b>heat-sensitive</b> parasites, {{group members}} can elevate their {{temperature}} collectively—this defence {{is known as}} social fever and so far has only been found in honeybees (Apis): upon challenge by chalk brood (Ascosphaera apis), workers increase nest temperature preventatively—it is currently undetermined whether the cue for this action {{is due to the}} larvae communicating their infection to the workers or the workers detecting the parasite before symptoms develop.|$|E
2500|$|Bothrops is a genus of pit vipers {{endemic to}} Central and South America. The generic name, Bothrops, {{is derived from}} the Greek words βόθρος, bothros, meaning [...] "pit", and ώπς, ops, meaning [...] "eye" [...] or [...] "face", {{together}} an allusion to the <b>heat-sensitive</b> loreal pit organs. Members of this genus are responsible for more human deaths in the Americas than any other group of venomous snakes. Currently, 32 species are recognized.|$|E
2500|$|In 1888, George Nuttall {{found that}} sheep blood serum had mild killing {{activity}} against the bacterium that causes anthrax. The killing activity disappeared when he heated the blood. [...] In 1891, Hans Ernst August Buchner, noting the same property {{of blood in}} his experiments, named the killing property [...] "alexin," [...] which means [...] "to ward off" [...] in Greek. [...] By 1884, several laboratories had demonstrated that serum from guinea pigs that had recovered from cholera killed the cholera bacterium in vitro. [...] Heating the serum destroyed its killing activity. [...] Nevertheless, the heat-inactivated serum, when injected into guinea pigs exposed to the cholera bacteria, maintained its ability to protect the animals from illness. [...] Jules Bordet, a young Belgian scientist in Paris at the Pasteur Institute, concluded that this principle has two components, one that maintained a [...] "sensitizing" [...] effect after being heated and one (alexin) whose toxic effect was lost after being heated. The heat-stable component was responsible for immunity against specific microorganisms, whereas the <b>heat-sensitive</b> component {{was responsible for the}} non-specific antimicrobial activity conferred by all normal sera. In 1899, Paul Ehrlich renamed the <b>heat-sensitive</b> component [...] "complement." ...|$|E
2500|$|C. tetani is a rod-shaped, obligate anaerobe which stains Gram {{positive}} in fresh cultures; established cultures may stain Gram negative. During vegetative growth, the organism cannot {{survive in the}} presence of oxygen, is <b>heat-sensitive</b> and exhibits flagellar motility. As the bacterium matures, it develops a terminal spore, which gives the organism its characteristic appearance. C. tetani spores are extremely hardy as they are resistant to heat and most antiseptics. The spores are distributed widely in manure-treated soils and can also be found on human skin. The incubation period is typically 3-21 days. The period of illness is 14 days. C. tetani is not contagious.|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} Fear of Music, Talking Heads {{embarked on}} their first Pacific region tour in June 1979 and played concerts in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii. The album was released worldwide on 3August. The LP sleeve was designed by band member Jerry Harrison. It is completely black and embossed with a pattern that resembles the appearance and texture of diamond plate metal flooring. The rest of the artwork was crafted by Byrne and includes <b>heat-sensitive</b> photography created by Jimmy Garcia {{with the help of}} Doctor Philip Strax. Harrison suggested the [...] "ludicrous" [...] title to the band. According to Weymouth, it was accepted because it [...] "fit" [...] with the album's themes {{and the fact that the}} quartet was under a lot of stress and pressure when making it.|$|E
2500|$|In pitvipers, {{the heat}} pit {{consists}} of a deep pocket in the rostrum with a membrane stretched across it. Behind the membrane, an air-filled chamber provides air contact {{on either side of}} the membrane. The pit membrane is highly vascular and heavily innervated with numerous <b>heat-sensitive</b> receptors formed from terminal masses of the trigeminal nerve (terminal nerve masses, or TNMs). The receptors are therefore not discrete cells, but a part of the trigeminal nerve itself. The labial pit found in boas and pythons lacks the suspended membrane and consists more simply of a pit lined with a membrane that is similarly innervated and vascular, though the morphology of the vasculature differs between these snakes and crotalines. The purpose of the vasculature, in addition to providing oxygen to the receptor terminals, is to rapidly cool the receptors to their thermo-neutral state after being heated by thermal radiation from a stimulus. Were it not for this vasculature, the receptor would remain in a warm state after being exposed to a warm stimulus, and would present the animal with afterimages even after the stimulus was removed.|$|E
2500|$|When {{recording}} [...] "Hasu no Hana", {{the band}} {{decided that the}} mid-tempo pop song would pair well with [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion", a [...] "raw and emotional" [...] song, so decided to release these together as a double A-side single on October 29. [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] / [...] "Hasu no Hana" [...] was the band's 10th physical single release, so to commemorate this, made the release a deluxe CD/DVD package, featuring an EP-like single length and over 50 minutes of DVD footage. The single featured two B-sides, {{the first of which}} was a remix of the version of [...] "Ame(B) that Sakanaction performed on their Sakanaquarium Sakanatribe tour, given a stronger club sound by musician Aoki Takamasa. Yamaguchi asked Aoki to create this different mix of the song, as he felt that he had overworked the song. The second B-side was a remix of the band's 2013 single [...] "Music" [...] in an acoustic style by Japanese musician Cornelius. The single's DVD featured two studio live performances that had originally been broadcast on their Ustream channel: [...] "Good-Bye" [...] featuring Tamaki Roy and [...] "Sample", rearranged by Sachio [...] "Sunny" [...] Sasaki, including interviews with both Tamaki and Sasaki. The physical single's cover and booklet were created by Hatos. He attempted to create cover artwork that would make a world view that bridged both songs. The booklet was printed with <b>heat-sensitive</b> ink, so that the [...] "Hasu no Hana" [...] lyrics were only visible when exposed to heat.|$|E
