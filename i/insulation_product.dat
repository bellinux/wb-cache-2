His first major business venture, Eagle Shield, was an <b>insulation</b> <b>product</b> that claimed to utilize new technology developed by NASA and could reduce heating and cooling costs by up to 40%. In May 1988, the Attorney General of Texas concluded that the product's technology long predated NASA and did not reduce consumers' bills in the amounts advertised. Caster agreed to cease the misleading claims made about Eagle Shield. Caster's second product, the [...] "Electracat," [...] was sold as a pest control device. The Electracat reportedly emitted pulsed vibrations that repelled rats, crickets, snakes, ticks, spiders, mosquitoes, and scorpions. However, in January 1991, the Attorney General of Texas investigated the product and found that the Electracat emitted no vibrations whatsoever. The Attorney General declared, [...] "The device is a hoax, and stands on the same scientific footing as a perpetual motion machine." [...] Caster was ordered to stop selling the Electracat and to reimburse the state $125,000 in investigative costs.|$|E

40|$|Depleting {{energy sources}} is {{alarming}} many governments, organizations, and companies to set ambitious goals {{to reduce their}} energy use {{over the next few}} years. Buildings consume significant portion of energy. One of the most practical strategies to reduce buildings’ demand for energy is by avoiding heat losses and implementing energy saving measures. Today’s high performance insulation and thermal design can dramatically reduce heat losses. Many technical solutions are already available and applied across all regions, both in new build and renovation. The choice of the most appropriate <b>insulation</b> <b>product</b> has to be decided on a case-by-case basis as it largely depends on the building type and design and climate zone. This paper conducts technology assessment for different type of insulation technology that fits different construction application.

40|$|A low {{technological}} {{corn cob}} particleboard {{has been under}} research by this research team. It intends to be affordable and sustainable. So far, some of its assessed material properties (e. g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>product,</b> a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper acoustic insulation performance is also a fundamental property required {{for most of the}} above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard. At this stage, impact sound insulation tests have been performed in which the acoustic insulation gain of a pavement reinforced acoustically by a 3 cm thick corn cob particleboard was assessed. The obtained acoustic insulation gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound insulation products (e. g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound insulation products (e. g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep wool, cork and cellulose). The obtained results indicate that the proposed product may also have an interesting acoustic behaviour for building purposes. This conclusion is even more interesting taking into account that corn cob is a natural, organic, renewable and local raw building material...|$|E
