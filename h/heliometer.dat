500|$|Based on {{observations}} between 1800 and 1880, Epsilon Eridani {{was found}} to have a large proper motion across the celestial sphere, which was estimated at three arcseconds per year (angular velocity). This movement implied it was relatively close to the Sun, making it a star of interest for the purpose of stellar parallax measurements. This process involves recording the position of Epsilon Eridani as Earth moves around the Sun, which allows a star's distance to be estimated. From 1881 to 1883, American astronomer William L. Elkin used a <b>heliometer</b> at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, to compare the position of Epsilon Eridani with two nearby stars.

2500|$|The {{light-year}} unit {{appeared a}} few years after the first successful measurement of the distance to a star other than the Sun, by Friedrich Bessel in 1838. The star was 61 Cygni, and he used a [...] <b>heliometer</b> designed by Joseph von Fraunhofer. The largest unit for expressing distances across space at that time was the astronomical unit, equal to the radius of the Earth's orbit [...] or [...] In those terms, trigonometric calculations based on 61 Cygni's parallax of 0.314 arcseconds, showed the distance to the star to be [...] astronomical units ( [...] or [...] ). Bessel added that light employs 10.3 years to traverse this distance. He recognized that his readers would enjoy the mental picture of the approximate transit time for light, but he refrained from using the light-year as a unit. He may have resented expressing distances in light-years because it would deteriorate the accuracy of his parallax data due to multiplying with the uncertain parameter of the speed of light. The speed of light was not yet precisely known in 1838; its value changed in 1849 (Fizeau) and 1862 (Foucault). It was not yet considered to be a fundamental constant of nature, and the propagation of light through the aether or space was still enigmatic. The light-year unit appeared, however, in 1851 in a German popular astronomical article by [...] The paradox of a distance unit name ending on [...] "year"' was explained by Ule by comparing it to a hiking road hour (Wegstunde). A contemporary German popular astronomical book also noticed that light-year is an odd name. In 1868 an English journal labelled the light-year as a unit used by the Germans. Eddington called the light-year an inconvenient and irrelevant unit, which had sometimes crept from popular use into technical investigations.|$|E

Working with Frederick L. Chase and Mason Smith, the <b>heliometer</b> was used to undertake a survey which identified 238 parallaxes. These efforts were noted for their particular accuracy, at least for that time period, and elimination of systematic errors by Frank Schlesinger.|$|E

50|$|The first {{application}} of the divided object-glass and the employment of double images in astronomical measures is due to Servington Savary from Exeter in 1743. Pierre Bouguer, in 1748, originated the true conception of measurement by double image without the auxiliary aid of a filar micrometer, that is by changing the distance between two object-glasses of equal focus. John Dollond, in 1754, combined Savary's idea of the divided object-glass with Bouguer's method of measurement, resulting {{in the construction of}} the first really practical heliometers. As far as we can ascertain, Joseph von Fraunhofer, some time not long before 1820, constructed the first <b>heliometer</b> with an achromatic divided object-glass, i.e. the first <b>heliometer</b> of the modern type.|$|E

50|$|Around 1800, the {{observatory}} became an international center for astronomy, {{being the most}} modern astronomical institute primarily for its instruments.

50|$|By {{the start}} of the nineteenth century {{improved}} instrumentation was acquired from Munich, the standard place to acquire them in the 19th century: consisting of a theodolite (Reichenbach, Utzschneider & Liebherr), a different <b>heliometer</b> (Fraunhofer), new mounting, and three-foot meridian circle (Ertel, Utzschneider & Fraunhofer). No spectroscopy or photography was performed at the observatory and the only astrophysical equipment of the observatory was a Zöllner photometer.|$|E
50|$|Koenigsberg Observatory was {{an astronomical}} {{research}} facility which {{was attached to}} the Albertina University of Königsberg. It was founded in 1810 and started working in 1813. Well known astronomers who used the observatory included Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander, Arthur Auwers and Hermann Struve. In 1838, the parallax of a star was determined successfully for first time by Bessel using a <b>heliometer</b> of Fraunhofer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{year before}} Elkin left Strassburg, {{he had a}} meeting with the {{directory}} of the Cape Observatory, David Gill. The two men became fast friends and Gill extended Elkin an invitation to Cape Town. Dr. Elkin sailed for South Africa in December, 1880, arriving in 1881. While at the observatory, Gill and Elkin collaborated to measure stellar parallaxes of first magnitude stars using a <b>heliometer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Stellar {{parallax}} is {{so difficult}} to detect that its existence {{was the subject of}} much debate in astronomy for thousands of years. It was first observed by Giuseppe Calandrelli who reported parallax in α-Lyrae in his work [...] "Osservazione e riflessione sulla parallasse annua dall’alfa della Lira". Then in 1838 Friedrich Bessel made the first successful parallax measurement ever, for the star 61 Cygni, using a Fraunhofer <b>heliometer</b> at Königsberg Observatory.|$|E
50|$|Gill {{used the}} {{parallax}} of Mars {{to determine the}} distance to the Sun, and also measured distances to the stars. He perfected the use of the <b>heliometer.</b> He was Her Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope from 1879 to 1906. He was a pioneer in the use of astrophotography, making the first photograph of the Great Comet of 1882, and one of the early proponents of the Carte du Ciel project.|$|E
50|$|After {{graduation}} Hall {{became an}} assistant at the Naval Observatory. In 1885 he went to Yale University {{as a graduate student}} and {{an assistant at}} Yale Observatory. Because of a large difference between his father's measurement of the mass of Saturn at the Naval Observatory and that of Friedrich Bessel in Germany, Hall used the Yale <b>heliometer</b> to determine the mass of Saturn using the orbit of Titan. His results confirmed Bessel's measurement. He received his Ph.D. in 1889.|$|E
5000|$|While at Edinburgh Halm used a <b>heliometer</b> {{to feed a}} {{spectrograph}} {{in order}} to study the differential rotation of the Sun at different latitudes.

This was not due to obvious effects such as rotation. He also gave the first interpretation of what is now called a P Cygni profile [...] while discussing the spectrum of Nova Persei 1901.|$|E
50|$|The Kuffner {{observatory}} maintains {{four major}} pieces of observation equipment {{from the late}} 19th century in working condition: the 270 mm refracting telescope, built in 1884, to which an 156 mm astrograph (now used with modern CCD imagers) was added in 1890; the 132 mm meridian circle, the largest meridian passage instrument of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; its ancillary vertical circle instrument, {{one of the few}} that still exist at European observatories; and the 217/3000 mm <b>heliometer,</b> the largest of its type that was ever built.|$|E
50|$|Fraunhofer {{produced}} various {{optical instruments}} including microscopes for his firm. This included the Fraunhofer Dorpat Refractor used by Struve (delivered 1824 to Dorpat Observatory), and the Bessel <b>Heliometer</b> (delivered posthumously), which were both {{used to collect}} data for stellar parallax. The firm's successor, Merz und Mahler, made a telescope for the New Berlin Observatory, which confirmed {{the existence of the}} major planet Neptune. Possibly the last telescope objective made by Fraunhofer was supplied for a transit telescope at the City Observatory, Edinburgh, the telescope itself being completed by Repsold of Hamburg after Fraunhofer's death.|$|E

50|$|It was {{not until}} the 20th century that they were {{gradually}} superseded by large reflecting telescopes for professional astronomy. A great refractor was often the centerpiece of a new 19th century observatory, but was typically used with an entourage of other astronomical instruments such as a Meridian Circle, a <b>Heliometer,</b> and Astrograph, and a smaller refractor such as a Comet Seeker or Equatorial. Great refractors were often used for observing double stars and equipped with a Filar micrometer. Numerous discoveries of minor planets, satellites, the planet Neptune, and double stars were made, and pioneering work on astrophotography was done, with great refractors.|$|E
50|$|Stellar {{parallax}} is {{most often}} measured using annual parallax, defined as the difference in position of a star as seen from Earth and Sun, i. e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of Earth's orbit around the Sun. The parsec (3.26 light-years) {{is defined as the}} distance for which the annual parallax is 1 arcsecond. Annual parallax is normally measured by observing the position of a star at different times of the year as Earth moves through its orbit. Measurement of annual parallax was the first reliable way to determine the distances to the closest stars. The first successful measurements of stellar parallax were made by Friedrich Bessel in 1838 for the star 61 Cygni using a <b>heliometer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Photographing a rare event {{such as a}} {{total eclipse}} posed unique {{challenges}} for early photography, including the extreme contrast between the corona and the dark shadow of the moon, {{as well as the}} unusual angle to which photographic equipment had to be oriented. Prior to the eclipse of July 28, 1851, no properly exposed photograph of the solar corona had yet been produced. For this occasion, the Royal Prussian Observatory at Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) commissioned one of the city's most skilled daguerreotypists, Johann Julius Friedrich Berkowski, to record a still image of the event. [...] The observers attached a small six-centimeter refracting telescope to a 15.8 centimeter Fraunhofer <b>heliometer,</b> and Berkowski made an eighty-four second exposure shortly after the beginning of totality.|$|E

He found the light of the sun to be 300 times more intense than that of the moon, and thus made some of the earliest measurements in photometry. In 1730 he was made professor of hydrography at Havre, and succeeded Pierre Louis Maupertuis as associate geometer of the Academy of Sciences. He also invented a <b>heliometer,</b> afterwards perfected by Joseph von Fraunhofer. He was afterwards promoted in the Academy to the place of Maupertuis, and went to reside in Paris.|$|E

50|$|When Joseph von Fraunhofer {{invented a}} new type of <b>heliometer,</b> Bessel carried out another set of {{measurements}} using this device in 1837 and 1838 at Königsberg. He published his findings in 1838 with a value of 369.0±19.1 mas to A and 260.5±18.8 to B, and estimated the center point to be at 313.6±13.6. This corresponds to a distance of about 600,000 astronomical units, or about 10.4 light-years. This was the first direct and reliable measurement of the distance to a star other than the Sun. His measurement was published only shortly before similar parallax measurements of Vega by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and Alpha Centauri by Thomas Henderson that same year. Bessel continued to make additional measurements at Königsberg, publishing a total of four complete observational runs, the last in 1868. The best of these placed the center point at 360.2 ±12.1 mas, made during observations in 1849. This is close to the currently accepted value of 287.18 mas (yielding 11.36 light-years).|$|E
