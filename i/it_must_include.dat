She revealed her dissatisfaction with being labeled a jazz singer and her desire to showcase her versatility as an artist, saying she aimed to [...] "put out some music that we hadn't heard in a long time from anybody, really". The project was Cole's first collaboration with R producer Dallas Austin. Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot wrote the album represented how [...] " [...] had hung up the gowns and returned to her soul roots"; in past performances, Cole would wear gowns when singing jazz. During the production of the album, Verve Records stipulated that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>include</b> original material. One of the two new songs [...] "Five Minutes Away" [...] was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, CBS News Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was [...] "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards."

When asked if he had a problem with oil companies making a profit, Gilmore stated that he saw no problems with it and that he believed this was [...] "an appropriate thing to do."

500|$|The Court of Appeal {{considers}} incitement {{to consist}} of {{a situation in which}} a defendant [...] "incites another to do or cause to be done an act or acts which, if done, will involve the commission of the offence or offences by the other; and he intends or believes that the other, if he acts as incited, shall or will do so with the fault required for the offence or offences". Unlike attempts, incitement is a common law offence. Incitement has a particularly broad actus reus; it has been interpreted to include [...] "a suggestion, proposal, request, exhortation, gesture, argument, persuasion, inducement, goading or the arousal of cupidity". While <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>include</b> an act of incitement, this can be both express and implied. For an offence to be committed, the incited act must be criminal in nature, and an offence not only for the person doing the incitement but the person incited. Some exceptions are made; under section 5(7) of the Criminal Law Act 1977, incitement to conspire is not an offence, and incitement to an aid or attempt are similarly not specifically given as criminal acts. In terms of mens rea, the defendant must have intended the incited offence to be committed, and also be aware of the likely consequences. It has been suggested that intent should not be necessary; if the defendant knew that his advice would be followed, and this would result in a crime, he should be found guilty.|$|E

2500|$|As {{feminism}} {{continues to}} develop, many scholars and activists share {{the belief that}} feminism needs to be inclusive to all factors of oppression and that feminism needs to develop an intersectional lens if progress is to be made. When placed into categories, feminism becomes non-inclusive and promotes the colonial [...] "us vs. them" [...] practice. As stated by Jarune Uwujaren and Jamie Utt, [...] "a lack of intersectionality leads to an erasure of people and their identities", which in turn prohibits the creations of [...] "solutions that dismantle the intersectional oppressions at play". As this is often what many forms of feminism strive for, it's almost counterintuitive to form categories within feminism itself. For progress to be made, feminism needs to be intersectional and inclusive, which in turn will encompass all the base themes of Indigenous feminism and all other people-of-color feminisms. If Indigenous feminism is to encapsulate the intersectional framework Making Space for Indigenous Feminism suggests, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>include</b> such topics as indigenous people who are multiracial, LGBTQ+ indigenous bodies, indigenous violence committed by indigenous persons, and the active pursuit of inclusion of global indigenous populations and the issues that affect them as well.|$|E

6000|$|Fortune, Minerva, Muse, Holy Ghost,--these are quaint names, {{too narrow}} {{to cover this}} {{unbounded}} substance. The baffled intellect must still kneel before this cause, which refuses to be named,--ineffable cause, which every fine genius has essayed to represent by some emphatic symbol, as, Thales by water, Anaximenes by air, Anaxagoras by (Nous) thought, Zoroaster by fire, Jesus and the moderns by love; and the metaphor of each has become a national religion. The Chinese Mencius {{has not been the}} least successful in his generalization. [...] "I fully understand language," [...] he said, [...] "and nourish well my vast-flowing vigor."--"I beg to ask what you call vast-flowing vigor?"--said his companion. [...] "The explanation," [...] replied Mencius, [...] "is difficult. This vigor is supremely great, and in the highest degree unbending. Nourish it correctly and do it no injury, and it will fill up the vacancy between heaven and earth. This vigor accords with and assists justice and reason, and leaves no hunger."--In our more correct writing we give to this generalization the name of Being, and thereby confess that we have arrived {{as far as we can}} go. Suffice it for the joy of the universe that we have not arrived at a wall, but at interminable oceans. Our life seems not present so much as prospective; not for the affairs on which it is wasted, but as a hint of this vast-flowing vigor. Most of life seems to be mere advertisement of faculty; information is given us not to sell ourselves cheap; that we are very great. So, in particulars, our greatness is always in a tendency or direction, not in an action. It is for us to believe in the rule, not in the exception. The noble are thus known from the ignoble. So in accepting the leading of the sentiments, it is not what we believe concerning the immortality of the soul or the like, but the universal impulse to believe, that is the material circumstance and is the principal fact in the history of the globe. Shall we describe this cause as that which works directly? The spirit is not helpless or needful of mediate organs. It has plentiful powers and direct effects. I am explained without explaining, I am felt without acting, and where I am not. Therefore all just persons are satisfied with their own praise. They refuse to explain themselves, and are content that new actions should do them that office. They believe that we communicate without speech and above speech, and that no right action of ours is quite unaffecting to our friends, at whatever distance; for the influence of action is not to be measured by miles. Why should I fret myself because a circumstance has occurred which hinders my presence where I was expected? If I am not at the meeting, my presence where I am should be as useful to the commonwealth of friendship and wisdom, as would be my presence in that place. I exert the same quality of power in all places. Thus journeys the mighty Ideal before us; it never was known to fall into the rear. No man ever came to an experience which was satiating, but his good is tidings of a better. Onward and onward! In liberated moments we know that a new picture of life and duty is already possible; the elements already exist in many minds around you of a doctrine of life which shall transcend any written record we have. The new statement will comprise the skepticisms as well as the faiths of society, and out of unbeliefs a creed shall be formed. For skepticisms are not gratuitous or lawless, but are limitations of the affirmative statement, and the new philosophy must take them in and make affirmations outside of them, just as much as <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>include</b> the oldest beliefs.|$|E
