500|$|One former islander, James Simpson, {{recalls that}} [...] "we had {{about two hundred}} and fifty folks <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a boy. It never seemed a lonely place. There were always people {{going in and out of}} each other's houses, there were forty {{children}} at the school and there were two teachers. We had concerts; three concerts in the winter when you had to sing loud to get above the sound of the wind. The young people would meet at the shop in the long, long evenings in summer." [...] The island had some distinctively eccentric characters: Donald Banks, the island's coffin-maker, was known for quarrelling with his neighbours (telling one family, [...] "I'll no bury any more o' ye!") and combining poetry with coffin-making, as in the order he placed with a mainland supplier: ...|$|E
2500|$|... reflected, “I’m {{glad to be}} <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{look back}} to when I was 19 in the Hürtgen ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Poems? There are {{stacks of}} poems lying <b>here.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{began to write}} them I wanted to prepare myself a palette of words, as if I were dealing with colours. All these words were weighted, {{filtered}} and appraised. I don't put much stock in spontaneous expressions of the unconscious.." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>’ere</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come," [...] he said, eagerly; [...] "take that down, sir. I’ve {{only just}} come, {{and it was}} <b>’ere</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come. I tried to get away then, but I was locked in." ...|$|R
6000|$|The steward {{shook his}} head helplessly. [...] "He was <b>'ere</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went out last night," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "When I came back the room was empty and I was told as 'e was upstairs in my bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Except me," [...] {{retorted}} Joe Billing. [...] "You {{come down}} and get my breakfast ready. If I start early I shall catch Mr. Bill Ricketts on ’is way to work. And mind, if I find that steam-orgin <b>’ere</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come ’ome to-night you’ll hear of it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found your}} letter <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{came back on}} Wednesday evening, and was {{extremely}} glad to get it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Carden, {{there are}} letters here for some chap called 'John Silsbee.' They were <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> called, ten weeks ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fairly well--I used to {{come over}} <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a boy--to pick huckleberries. They are {{plentiful}} {{on the other side}} of the swamp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oah, yes, <b>here!</b> But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> go home I must conciliate popular superstition, {{and make}} ceremonies of purification, and my women will anoint idols." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a fool I'm {{making of}} myself!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "The idea of {{standing}} <b>here</b> raving <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to be}} trying to mend matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'More than suspect. But, Mortimer, while <b>I</b> lie <b>here,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> lie <b>here</b> no longer, I {{trust to}} you that the {{perpetrator}} is never brought to justice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hardy hesitated. [...] "In {{exchange}} for the service I want permission to visit <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> choose," [...] he said, at length; [...] "say twice a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{left him}} here this morning," [...] she replied. [...] "He {{has not been}} out for several days. I {{expected}} to find him <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> returned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{be coming}} back this way. In a day or so. If you're around <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come back you can come along with me. All right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he turned}} as Mrs. Macdonald {{came up to}} him. [...] "What are you doing <b>here</b> alone <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see there is nobody talking to the girl from Winnipeg?" ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. [Handing PAYNTER {{his coat}} and hat] Look <b>here,</b> Paynter! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> send up from the Club for my dress things, always put in a black {{waistcoat}} as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little girl}} asked if a lame lady didn't live <b>here,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> said yes, {{she told me}} to give you these, and say the grapes were very nice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' another thing, Jane," [...] he continued, {{then paused}} for long--"another thing--if you ain't <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come back--if you're gone--don't fear, I'll trail you--I'll find you out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by this?" [...] he demanded. [...] "Don't you know that I allow no one in <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am telephoning on the private wire?" ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. I {{am afraid}} {{it was hardly}} a couple of minutes. She was not <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> arrived; and I saw {{her for the first}} time at the tower.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he turned}} as Mrs. Macdonald {{came up to}} him. [...] "What are you doing <b>here</b> alone <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see there is nobody talking to the girl from Winnipeg?" [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Welcome to Bearn," [...] he said. [...] "It is {{a modest}} palace, countess; and I am {{a much less}} {{important}} person, <b>here,</b> than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{was supposed to be}} commanding our army." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Well, it's {{better than}} being shot, I suppose. He's OK. Hopefully they'll keep on looking after him while I'm not <b>here</b> and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> return and spend a bit more time with my son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Buster Jack," [...] {{said the}} cowboy. [...] "Just my luck! There wasn't any one <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> arrived. Reckon I oughtn't have stayed. Columbine, you look pretty much upset." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{had it to}} give I {{would give}} it as surely as I am {{standing}} <b>here.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> told my brother it should be so, he believed me at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Laughing.] No, not quite. I had a dressing-gown on {{and other}} paraphernalia. But I made him come <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wasn't made up, {{and he sat}} by while I rouged my cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got a chill, ma'am, but I ain't cryin' for that, 'cause I'm used to it. I dreamed Kit was <b>here,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> waked up he wasn't, and I couldn't help it, then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you see {{anything}} of a fan I left here?" [...] she said. [...] "I know I left it <b>here,</b> but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came yesterday it was gone. Perhaps {{you may have noticed}} it somewhere--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See <b>here,</b> mates, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came to {{this house}} I said to myself, `The Lord 'as given me success to-day in sellin' His word,'--you know, some of you, that I'm a seller of Bibles and Testaments?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I left me plug {{of tobacco}} <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was coiling down last," [...] said the little twisted man--no; {{he did not say}} it. He spat it out like so much venom.|$|E
6000|$|Fletcher {{turned to}} Duane. [...] "Pard, I'm takin' it on myself thet you meet enemies <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> swore you'd meet friends. It's my fault. I'll stand by {{you if you}} let me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had an idea}} I {{should find}} her <b>here</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> opened the door," [...] he answered. [...] "You were {{standing}} in the shadow. It seemed to be just what I had expected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{you told}} me about it. I found him useful <b>here,</b> {{especially}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wanted the place cleared; but it would not do, he broke one fellow's shoulder throwing him out, and it was getting me a bad name.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I have {{deserved}} it," [...] and Ingleby winced. [...] "Still, {{it will be}} horribly hard to let you go. It is a {{good deal}} to know that you are <b>here</b> even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> may not see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'd say {{the same}} thing, if I were in your place," [...] said Dale. [...] "And I'll tell you right <b>here</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was captain I never plugged any harder to win than I'll plug to-day." ...|$|R
