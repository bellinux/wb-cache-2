5|$|Although {{the use of}} the {{graduated}} scale and grid reference for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of Pei Xiu (224–271 AD), there is evidence that in the early 2nd century AD, cartographer Zhang Heng was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> scales and grids for maps.|$|E
5|$|Colt's {{manufacturing}} methods {{were at the}} forefront of the Industrial Revolution. His use of interchangeable parts helped him become one of the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the assembly line efficiently. Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and mass marketing.|$|E
5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that {{his use of the}} word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, who was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the term in a publication.|$|E

5000|$|Some of {{the more}} famous Toqui in the Arauco War with the Spanish {{introduced}} tactical innovations. For example Lautaro introduced infantry tactics to defeat horsemen. Lemucaguin was the <b>first</b> Toqui <b>to</b> <b>use</b> firearms and artillery in battle. Nongoniel was the <b>first</b> Toqui <b>to</b> <b>use</b> cavalry with the Mapuche army. Cadeguala was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>use</b> Mapuche cavalry <b>to</b> defeat Spanish cavalry in battle. Anganamón was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> mount his infantry {{to keep up with}} his fast-moving cavalry. Lientur pioneered the tactic of numerous and rapid malóns into Spanish territory.|$|R

5|$|Newton is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions {{to the theory of}} finite differences, and was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers of {{the brigade}} were also {{some of the}} <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the MRAP, or Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle. The {{soldiers}} used the vehicles to train other soldiers on use of the vehicle, particularly leaders of the 10th Sustainment Brigade, which replaced the 1st Sustainment Brigade in late 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{firm was}} founded at Newcastle-upon-Tyne with an {{ironworks}} and an alkali works nearby at Walker. The alkali works {{was the first}} in England to make Soda using the Leblanc process; the ironworks was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Cleveland Ironstone, presaging the 1850s boom in ironmaking on Teesside.|$|E
5|$|The launch was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last {{to use the}} original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. These {{had been replaced by}} a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, Bainbridge {{remained}} an outspoken proponent {{of civilian control}} of nuclear power and the abandonment of nuclear testing. In 1950 {{he was one of}} twelve prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the hydrogen bomb. Bainbridge retired from Harvard in 1975.|$|E
50|$|One of the <b>first</b> movies <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{subtractive}} {{color was}} a silent film titled Cupid Angling (1918). In 1932, Walt Disney made the <b>first</b> film <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a red, {{green and blue}} color process (Technicolor), Flowers and Trees. Two years later, the <b>first</b> feature film <b>to</b> <b>use</b> three-color Technicolor was made, titled The Cat and the Fiddle (1934), a partial color movie. In 1935, the first feature length movie to be filmed entirely in 3-color Technicolor was Becky Sharp.|$|R

5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He had studied geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, compact discs were making {{significant}} headway as a storage medium {{for music and}} video games. NEC had been the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> compact disc technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROM² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to develop its own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV multimedia system centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting CD-i from Philips finally arrived {{towards the end of}} that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While not the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> handcarts, {{they were the only}} group to use them extensively.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 Liverpool Street {{became the}} new {{terminus}} of the Central London Railway {{after the completion}} of an extension project from Bank. The deep-level Central line platforms 4 and 5 opened on 28 July 1912 as the eastern terminus of the Central London Railway. The tube station was one of the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Moore Vacuum Tube, a new system of lighting that produced three times as much as a normal bulb.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, French scholar George Wellers {{was one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> German data on deportations to {{estimate}} the number killed at Auschwitz, arriving at a figure of 1,471,595 deaths, including 1.35million Jews and 86,675 Poles. A larger study started by Franciszek Piper used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate at least 960,000 Jewish deaths and at least 1.1 million total deaths, a figure adopted as official by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in the 1990s. Piper stated that a figure of as many as 1.5 million total deaths was possible.|$|E
5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when lacquer {{was used for}} {{decorative}} objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes or writing cases.

5|$|Leonardo Bruni was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's {{first two}} periods {{were based on}} those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy {{was no longer in}} a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{has been with}} humans {{since at least the}} Bronze Age. The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians {{through the end of the}} first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits.|$|E
5|$|Mystery of the Emblem was {{released}} for the Super Famicom on January 21, 1994. It {{was the first}} Fire Emblem title for the system, and the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a 24-megabit cartridge. It would later receive multiple releases on Nintendo's digital Virtual Console platform: the version for the Wii released on December 26, 2006; the version for the Wii U on April 27, 2014; and the version for the Nintendo 3DS on June 22, 2016.
