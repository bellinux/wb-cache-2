40|$|Abstract Background Many genome {{projects}} are left unfinished due to complex, repeated regions. Finishing {{is the most}} time consuming step in sequencing and current <b>finishing</b> <b>tools</b> are not designed with {{particular attention to the}} repeat problem. Results We have developed DNPTrapper, a shotgun sequence <b>finishing</b> <b>tool,</b> specifically designed to address the problems posed by the presence of repeated regions in the target sequence. The program detects and visualizes single base differences between nearly identical repeat copies, and offers the overview and flexibility needed to rapidly resolve complex regions within a working session. The use of a database allows large amounts of data to be stored and handled, and allows viewing of mammalian size genomes. The program is available under an Open Source license. Conclusion With DNPTrapper, it is possible to separate repeated regions that previously were considered impossible to resolve, and finishing tasks that previously took days or weeks can be resolved within hours or even minutes. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} hardened tool steel milling studies. High speed milling is largely utilized to substitute some EDM and polishing operations, mainly in hardened <b>tool</b> steel <b>finishing.</b> <b>Tool</b> path strategy may either enable good surface finish or contributes to generate high roughness values and poor surface <b>finish.</b> <b>Tool</b> inclination (angle between tool axis and workpiece surface) influences the system response to vibration. In this work, several milling experiments were performed in a circular convex AISI D 6 hardened steel workpiece, having as input variables feed direction (upward and downward the circle) and tilt angle (tool inclination). The main results indicate that upward tool path presented mostly high roughness values which were also influenced by tool inclination. Downward tool path presented low roughness values and was less influenced by tool inclination. Upward tool path and positive tool inclination should be avoided because they presented roughness values incompatible to EDM process substitution...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{cutting of}} bevel gears on {{universal}} 5 -axis milling machines represents a promising solution {{to replace the}} conventional cutting process. The process is highly flexible and does not require neither special gear generating machines nor special tools. Thus, it is particularly suitable for small batches, prototypes or to obtain a specific and unique product. In this way, we {{have focused on the}} machining of a large-sized spiral bevel gear, from the initial design to the final machining. A gear will be machined using different milling paths and scallop heights. Each of the different strategies will be applied in consecutive teeth, and afterwards these teeth will be analyzed to check some of the gear quality parameters (roughness, profile angle variation, single pitch error [...] .) with the final goal of finding the optimal cutting strategy.

40|$|Machinability {{assessment}} of two ceramic materials {{was carried out}} using uncoated carbide tool inserts under dry conditions. The materials investigated were Macor and Boron nitride and the machining operation was a continuous operation (turning). The objectives of this investigation were to generate reliable machining data in terms of surface <b>finish,</b> <b>tool</b> life and cutting force in relation to cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The cutting tests were carried out using one-variable-at-a-time and design of experiments. For one variable at-a-time experiment, surface finish, cutting forces and tool life were measured. In these tests the cutting variables i. e, cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and nose radius were varied to study their effects on the surface <b>finish,</b> <b>tool</b> life and cutting forces. With the design of experiments, the combined effects of the cutting variables were investigated on the machining responses.

40|$|Abstract—A novel nanofinishing process using {{improved}} {{ball end}} magnetorheological (MR) <b>finishing</b> <b>tool</b> {{was developed for}} finishing of flat as well as 3 D surfaces of ferromagnetic and non ferromagnetic workpieces. In this process a magnetically controlled ball end of smart MR polishing fluid is generated at the tip surface of the tool which {{is used as a}} finishing medium and it is guided to follow the surface to be finished through computer controlled 3 -axes motion controller. The experiments were performed on ferromagnetic workpiece surface in the developed MR finishing setup to study the effect of finishing time on final surface roughness. The performance of present finishing process on final finished surface roughness was studied. The surface morphology was observed under scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscope. The final surface finish was obtained as low as 19. 7 nm from the initial surface roughness of 142. 9 nm. The outcome of newly developed finishing process can be found useful in its applications in aerospace, automotive, dies and molds manufacturing industries, semiconductor and optics machining etc. Keywords—Ball end MR <b>finishing</b> <b>tool,</b> Magnetorheological <b>finishing,</b> Nanofinishing...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the decoration of}} Greek bookbinding, through {{the study of the}} leather-covered bindings from the monastery of Saint Catherine in Sinai, Egypt. The manuscript collection is remarkable for the variety of binding styles that represent mainly Greek but also other bookbinding traditions, including Georgian. Syrian and Eastern European. The examination of the decorative motifs tooled on the leather covered bindings aims to identify the style and characteristics of bookbinding at the monastery. Moreover, links between and evidence for specific bindings and the manuscripts they contain are established by grouping them and relating them to specific binders and bookbinding workshops. The workshops of the monastery are examined in parallel with groups of bindings that were imported into the monastery. The extent to which the trade in books and the circulation of binding techniques between the monastery and the west was a reflection of the relations of the monastery with its dependencies is also explored. Rubbings of the approximately 5500 tool impressions on the 1195 decorated bindings have provided the core research material. They have been identified, classified and organized into a descriptive electronic database. Imaging techniques have been developed to compare the scanned impressions, which permitted the identification of impressions of the same <b>finishing</b> <b>tools.</b> Based on the identity of their decorative tools and on the process of comparison of their structural features, a number of the bindings have been ascribed to a total of 70 specific workshops, whose dates and origins are explored. 16 of these workshops - nine from the monastery of St Catherine and seven from elsewhere, which produced bindings imported to the monastery, are discussed analytically. In addition to that, 40 original bookbinding <b>finishing</b> <b>tools</b> were discovered at the monastery during this research, which have provided invaluable material for our understanding of the tooling methods and particularities of decorated book covers at the monastery.
