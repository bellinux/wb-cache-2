Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their buffalo live in very close {{association}} with them, and are often their greatest capital asset. The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffalo while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallowing places. Water buffalo are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of paddy fields because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints. They are often referred to as [...] "the living tractor of the East". It probably is possible to plough deeper with buffalo than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the sheaves during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as pack animals, and in India and Pakistan also for heavy haulage. In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used buffalo for hauling heavy battering rams. Their dung is used as a fertilizer, and as a fuel when dried.|$|E

We surveyed risk perceptions of Campylobacter contamination of broiler meat, avian influenza introduction in laying hens, and altered dioxin levels in eggs for the most commonly used broiler and laying hen <b>husbandry</b> <b>systems</b> in Dutch citizens (n = 2, 259), poultry farmers (n = 100), and poultry veterinarians (n = 41). Citizens perceived the risks of the three hazards in the indoor systems higher and in the outdoor systems lower than did the professionals. Citizens reported higher concerns regarding aspects reflecting underlying psychological factors of risk perception compared to professionals. Professionals indicated a relatively low level of personal control, which might imply risk denial. Of the socio-demographic characteristics, gender and childhood residence were associated with risk perceptions. The influence of other factors of risks perception are discussed. It is suggested that risk perceptions of all stakeholder groups are influenced by affect, stigma, and underlying values. To adapt current or new <b>husbandry</b> <b>systems</b> that can count on societal support, views of key stakeholders and multiple aspects such as animal welfare, public health, food safety, and underlying values should be considered integrally.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, then-President Boris Yeltsin issued a number of decrees, which obliged all state-run enterprises, including sovkhozes, to re-organize themselves as joint-stock companies or private farms.

Initially, the locality was designed to provide assistance to up to ten reindeer herding brigades, each with herds in excess of 2,000 animals; however, by 1997 only two herds and less than 20% the original number of reindeer remained.|$|E

Our analysis showed that framing is changing. Via interaction the various actors got acquainted with each others’ frames.

On the basis of ethnographic fieldwork performed among six different <b>husbandry</b> <b>systems</b> throughout North Asia, we challenge this interpretation by showing that indigenous techniques tend to rely preferentially on animal autonomy and a herd’s capacity to feed and protect itself. In defining five modes of herding, in each of which the proportions of human and animal agencies differ, we explore {{the issue of the}} stability of the herder-livestock bond in a nomadic context with loose human intervention. Our argument is that the shared nomadic landscape is the common ground that enables a balance between animal autonomy and human-animal engagement in cooperative activities. We propose the notion of intermittent coexistence to describe the particular kind of human-animal relationship built and maintained in North Asian <b>husbandry</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Characteristics of HHS were as follows. Firstly, land utilization was highly intensive with three crops a year, and the typical combination was naked barley - soiling soybeans - rice. Secondly, popularity of horse plowing was the highest in Japan at the time. Thirdly, drainage technique was highly developed, which promoted the popularization of horse plowing. Fourthly, excellent short landslide plow called higosuki was introduced. Agricultural technology was remarkably developed after the late 19 th century.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of <b>husbandry</b> <b>system</b> and season on the grass intake and egg quality in laying hens considering that characteristics of organic eggs obtained in a system with no grass in the external area are similar conventional ones. RESULTS Three hundred and sixty Ancona hens were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group (C), with the hens kept in cages under standard housing conditions; the organic group (O), with the hens kept under an organic production system (4 m 2 per hen) and the organic-plus group (OP), with the hens maintained under organic conditions but with a larger grass paddock availability (10 m 2 per hen). The estimated intake of forage, carotenoids and flavonoids of the OP hens was very high as the amounts deposited in eggs, mainly in the spring season. The fatty acid composition of the yolk was significantly affected by pasture. The OP eggs showed lower concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) n- 6 and a higher percentage of PUFA n- 3.

30|$|The {{proportional}} circle imageries {{served as}} visualized descriptive augmentations to the estimated sero-positivity in the herds. The survey has shown variable spatial distribution burdens {{of the disease}} in the agro-geographical zones. This suggests that risk factors for the disease are spatially distributed and varied from one agro-geographical zone to another. On visualization, densities of CBPP sero-geospatial burdens were high across AGZs C and A in both pastoral production systems compared to AGZ B. These distribution patterns may have occurred due to high cattle population densities and many trans-boundary stock routes that traverse through the zones (MLFD 2013), contagiousness of CBPP, and many point exposures at watering and grazing available in the zones (Alhaji 2011). The high sero-geospatial burden distribution patterns obtained in the two production systems, which are invariably extensive in nature, are {{in agreement with the}} previous reports that the extensive nature of the <b>husbandry</b> <b>systems</b> exposed stocks to different geographical factors, which exacerbate CBPP occurrence (Nawathe 1992; Nwanta and Umoh 1992; Jiuqing et al. 2011). The higher CBPP sero-geospatial burden in the nomadic system than in the sedentary system is in consonance with previous findings that burden of CBPP varies according to the cattle management system and tends to be higher in more extensive cattle <b>husbandry</b> <b>systems</b> (Windsor 2000).|$|R
