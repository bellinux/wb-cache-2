2500|$|Although {{there has}} been a {{settlement}} in Midhurst since at least the early Norman period, and probably from Saxon times, the buildings in the Old Town, centred on the Market Square, are principally Tudor in origin. Almost every house {{in this part of the}} town dates back to the 16th Century, and parts of a few buildings, such as the old coaching inn that is now the Spread Eagle Hotel, date to the 15th century. Even the apparently more modern North Street is lined with Tudor buildings behind classical and Georgian façades that were added during the 17th and 18th centuries, a time of prosperity for the town. There are also several actual 18th century buildings scattered throughout the town, and distinctive Victorian and Edwardian developments of terraced housing along the main routes out of Midhurst. [...] During the mid and late 20th Century there was significant housing development to the south of the town, in the Little Midhurst, Holmbush and <b>Fairway</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

50|$|By the 1960s a {{new road}} and housing estate {{had been built}} north of the {{original}} village : Elveley Drive and The <b>Fairway,</b> in the <b>area</b> of plantation known as Long Drive Wood; {{by the beginning of}} the 1970s this had been extended connecting northwards to Riplingham Road.

5000|$|Because {{they can}} {{tolerate}} wide variations in temperature, sunlight, and water, zoysia {{are widely used}} for lawns in temperate climates. They are used on golf courses to create <b>fairways</b> and teeing <b>areas.</b> Zoysia grasses stop erosion on slopes, and are excellent at repelling weeds throughout the year. They resist disease and hold up well under traffic. Zoysia will go brown (dormant) with frost or freeze and will remain that way until above 70 + air temps return in spring which can be as late as May in the more Northern areas. That makes it brown (dormant) about 6 months in these Northern areas.{12} ...|$|R
40|$|Published September 2002. Facts and {{recommendations}} in this publication {{may no longer}} be valid. Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.), also known as roughstalk bluegrass, is commonly used in the southern United States to overseed golf course greens, <b>fairways,</b> and landscape <b>areas</b> in the winter. Warm-season grasses go dormant and turn brown during the cool season, and rough bluegrass generally is mixed with ryegrass to maintain a lush, green color through the winter. As temperatures rise in the spring, the rough bluegrass mix dies, and the warm-season grasses come out of dormancy and become green again...|$|R
