5|$|In 1991, {{the cattle}} station {{was taken over}} by the Muckaty Aboriginal Corporation. The Corporation focused on rehabilitating the land, which had been {{degraded}} by excessive numbers of cattle, and by late 1993 Muckaty had been destocked of cattle for several seasons. On 20December 1991, the Northern Land Council lodged a claim over Muckaty on behalf of traditional owners under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. The claim was made by members of the seven groups that each has responsibility for different sites and dreamings in the area. In 1997, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner recommended that Muckaty Station be handed back to the traditional owners, and in February 1999, title to the land was returned. At the time there were about 400formal traditional owners, among 1,000people with traditional attachments to the land; some lived on the station, but others were elsewhere in the region, including in the nearby towns of Tennant Creek and Elliott. As Aboriginal Freehold land it is inalienable communal title, and cannot be bought or sold. The pastoral lease <b>holder</b> <b>and</b> manager of the station since 1997 has been Ray Aylett. The Adelaide–Darwin railway, which passes through the western part of Muckaty Station, was completed in early 2004.|$|E
