5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E

5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
5|$|Chris angrily demands Leslie {{bring the}} {{painting}} to city hall {{the next day to}} be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> happen.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E

5|$|The inner {{boundary}} of the debris disk was estimated at 11″±2″, or 70–100AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production {{of the amount of}} dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter. Hence it is {{more likely to have been}} produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.|$|E

25|$|For a {{plant to}} grow, it must photosynthesise {{more than it}} respires. Otherwise, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> exhaust its biomass and die. The {{potential}} for plant growth is net photosynthesis, the total gross gain of biomass by photosynthesis, minus the biomass lost by respiration. Understanding carnivory requires a cost-benefit analysis of these factors.|$|E
25|$|Kuhn {{illustrates}} how {{a paradigm shift}} later became possible when Galileo Galilei introduced his new ideas concerning motion. Intuitively, when an object is set in motion, it soon comes to a halt. A well-made cart may travel a long distance before it stops, but unless something keeps pushing it, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> stop moving. Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of nature: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Brain Project is {{an attempt}} to create a {{synthetic}} brain by reverse-engineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level. The aim of this project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the École Polytechnique in Lausanne, Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles. The project is headed by the Institute's director, Henry Markram. Using a Blue Gene supercomputer running Michael Hines's NEURON software, the simulation does not consist simply of an artificial neural network, but involves a partially biologically realistic model of neurons. It is hoped by its proponents that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> shed light on the nature of consciousness.|$|E

25|$|This {{region is}} home to the Maracanã stadium (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest {{capacity}} football venue, able to hold nearly 199,000 people, as it did for the World Cup final of 1950. More recently its capacity has been reduced to conform with modern safety regulations and the stadium has introduced seating for all fans. Currently undergoing reconstruction, it has now the capacity for 90,000; <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> hold around 80,000 people.

25|$|In July 2013, Uber started {{services}} in Taiwan. However, {{as the company}} registered as an information service firm, {{it did not have}} any permission to operate transportation services. This led to protests from taxi drivers and fines in millions of dollars from the government. Refusing to pay the penalties, Uber was banned in February 2017. In April 2017, the company resumed services after constructive talks with authorities and partnered with licensed car rental companies. The service can only operate within Taipei, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> expand to other cities. However, Ho Chen Tan, Minister of Transportation and Communications, said that Uber is not welcome if the fines aren't paid to the government; the company must switch its business registration as well in order to operate legally.|$|E
25|$|As {{the column}} rises into less dense {{surrounding}} air, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> reach an altitude where the hot, rising air {{is of the}} same density as the surrounding cooler air. In this neutral buoyancy region, the erupted material will then no longer rise through convection, but solely through any upward momentum which it has. This is called the umbrella region, and is usually marked by the column spreading out sideways. The eruptive material and the surrounding cool air has the same density {{at the base of}} the umbrella region, and the top is marked by the maximum height which momentum carries the material upward. Because the speeds are very low or negligible in this region it is often distorted by stratospheric winds.|$|E

25|$|The Grimsby Ice Factory is {{a former}} ice factory located in Grimsby, England that was {{constructed}} from 1898–1901 to provide crushed ice to preserve fish stored in ships at Grimsby's seaport. The Grimsby Ice Factory engaged in operations up to 1990. The buildings still contain some of the original historic machinery from times of the operations' origins. During its time of prime operations, it produced 1,200 tonnes of ice daily. The building is 4,350 square metres in size, and at one time {{it was the largest}} ice factory in the world. The building is deteriorating, and it has been stated that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> crumble if restoration efforts are not undertaken. Furthermore, historic machinery at the site is at risk from exposure to the elements, because the roof is not watertight.|$|E
25|$|In Xenopus oocytes, β-catenin is {{initially}} equally localized to all {{regions of the}} egg, but it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the β-catenin destruction complex. Fertilization of the egg causes a rotation of the outer cortical layers, moving clusters of the Frizzled and Dsh proteins closer to the equatorial region. β-catenin will be enriched locally {{under the influence of}} Wnt signaling pathway in the cells that inherit this portion of the cytoplasm. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>eventually</b> translocate to the nucleus to bind TCF3 in order to activate several genes that induce dorsal cell characteristics. This signaling results in a region of cells known as the grey crescent, which is a classical organizer of embryonic development. If this region is surgically removed from the embryo, gastrulation does not occur at all. β-Catenin also plays {{a crucial role in the}} induction of the blastopore lip, which in turn initiates gastrulation. Inhibition of GSK-3 translation by injection of antisense mRNA may cause a second blastopore and a superfluous body axis to form. A similar effect can result from the overexpression of β-catenin.|$|E
