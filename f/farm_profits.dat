40|$|The {{economic}} value of pasture improvement in a farming {{system in a}} Mediterranean-type environment is assessed using farm modelling. Bioeconomic modelling combined with sensitivity analysis is used to explore how new annual legume species may impact on <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> and land use. If introduced on all suitable soils the new pastures lead to a 26 % increase in <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> with an additional 12 % of farm area being switched into pasture to support more livestock. However, stocking rates decline slightly, the enterprise mix becomes less diversified and several rotational changes are required. If the new pastures are only introduced on particular soils then <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> increases by a lesser percentage and the pathways to additional profit vary, with both the pasture area and stocking rate either increasing or decreasing. To extract maximum profit from pasture improvement on any particular land management unit often requires management changes on other land management units, apart from those on which pasture improvement initially takes place. The {{economic value}} of pasture improvement is found {{to depend on the}} portfolio of pastures available for improvement and the nature and mix of the farm's land management units.

40|$|Direct {{policies}} {{for the management}} of nonpoint source pollution are difficult to apply given asymmetric information, spatial and temporal variability, and uncertainty. There is increasing awareness that these limitations may be overcome where profitable mitigation practices are broadly adopted by polluters. Nitrification inhibitors (chemicals applied to paddocks that retard the nitrification process in soils) are a rare example of a mitigation practice that reduces pollutant loads and potentially increases <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> through promoting pasture production. This study investigates their capacity to achieve both goals to inform policy makers and producers of their potential for simultaneously improving <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> and water quality. With an assumed 10 percent increase in pasture production in response to nitrification inhibitor application, nitrification inhibitors are a profitable innovation because greater pasture production supports higher stocking rates. Nonetheless, their overall impact on <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> is low, even when the cost of inhibitors or their impact on subsequent pasture production is substantially altered. However, inhibitors are found to be a critical mitigation practice for farmers posed with decreasing leaching loads to satisfy regulatory requirements. These findings suggest that, despite their shortcomings for nonpoint pollution regulation, direct policies appear to {{be the only way to}} motivate producers to account for their impact on environmental values given the current lack of profitable mitigations...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical and {{computerized}} {{models are}} developed {{to design and}} optimize furrow irrigation systems. The optimization process starts with land grading design, if any is needed, followed by a prediction of maximum non-erosive furrow stream size allowed on a given soil and the associated furrow-advance function. An average depth of application per irrigation is then assumed from which the wetting pattern along the furrow and the amounts of runoff water are predicted. A design of an Irrigation Runoff Recovery System, IRRS, is then executed, if desired, and system cost is determined. Using the predicted wetting pattern and the appropriate Crop Production Function, the gross return and the net <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> associated with that particular average depth of application per irrigation are determined. The iterative procedure is continued by changing the average depth of application per irrigation and evaluating net <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> until a depth and the associated system design and management program which yield the highest net profit are found. A Fortran IV detailed computer program is developed to perform the above procedure.

40|$|Abstract. Natural {{resource}} {{indicators are}} used by catchment management organisations as targets for land use management. However, {{the nature of the}} trade-off function between natural resource management (NRM) outcomes and whole-farm profit is ill-defined, and varies between regions and according to the particular NRM indicator considered. Defining this function will assist catchment management organisations and farmers to evaluate the achievability of particular targets, and help determine the size of economic incentives required to offset any expected loss in <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> associated with meeting targets. We addressed this issue by modelling representative farm businesses in two mixed farming regions (southern New South Wales and the central wheatbelt of Western Australia). The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and GRAZPLAN farming systems models were linked and used to generate values of four NRM indicators (water leakage, nitrate leaching, groundcover and soil organic carbon change) {{for a wide range of}} cropâ€“pasture rotations. The NRM indicator values were then incorporated into the Model of an Integrated Dryland System (MIDAS) whole-farm economic model to define the relationship with <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> and <b>farm</b> cropping percentage. For some circumstances and indicators, the resulting trade-off functions were relatively flat; a wide range of enterprise mixes can lead to the same NRM outcomes but significant gains in the indicators may not be possible using current rotation options. For others, significant improvements could be achieved but at a substantial loss in whole-farm profit (through the selection of less profitable rotations). There were also examples where simultaneous gains in indicators and <b>farm</b> <b>profit</b> wer...|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, {{the most}} disconcerting {{economic}} issue was declining <b>farm</b> <b>profits.</b> From 1900-1920, American farmers had prospered while European agriculture suffered serious disruption due to World War I, therefore prices soared. Beginning in 1919, Europeans closed their markets by implementing tariff barriers. This period of American agricultural prosperity due to rising demand concluded {{by the early}} 1920s. While American farms continued to grow due to previous wartime price and technological advances, European demand for American farm products declined and prices plummeted. Wheat price fell from $2.50 to under a dollar a bushel by late 1921. Many farmers found themselves unable to meet their loan repayments. Additionally, overproduction was depressing the profitability of the agriculture industry. With falling prices (due to low demand) and overproduction, farmers faced a serious problem.The Emergency Tariff raised duties on most imported agricultural products, such as corn, wheat, sugar, wool, meat and more.|$|E

50|$|The {{first stage}} of land reform was {{characterized}} by mutual aid teams. The mutual aid system was kept simple at first, involving only the temporary sharing of labor and some capital; individual households remained the basic unit of ownership and production. In 1954 mutual aid teams were organized with increasing rapidity into agricultural producers' cooperatives, which differed from mutual aid teams in that tools, draft animals, and labor were shared on a permanent basis. Cooperative members retained ownership of their land but secured {{a share in the}} cooperative by staking their plots along with those of other members in the common land pool. By 1956 the transformation of mutual aid teams into agricultural cooperatives was nearly complete. By the end of that year, moreover, the great majority of cooperatives had moved to a still higher stage of collectivization, having become advanced producers' cooperatives. These cooperatives contrasted with those of the earlier stage in that members no longer earned income based on shares of land owned. Instead, collective <b>farm</b> <b>profits</b> were distributed to members primarily on the basis of labor contributions. The average cooperative was made up of 170 families and more than 700 people. Although small private plots were permitted, most of the land was owned collectively by the cooperative.

The results show that when CC biomass is sold as forage instead of keeping it in the soil, greater profit and less leaching of nitrates are achieved than in the baseline scenario. While the fertilizer saving will be lower if CC is sold than if it is kept in the soil, the revenue obtained from the sale of the CC compensates for the reduced fertilizer savings. The results show that CC would perhaps provide a double dividend of greater profit and reduced nitrate leaching in intensive irrigated cropping systems in Mediterranean regions...|$|R
