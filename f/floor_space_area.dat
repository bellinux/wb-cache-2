5000|$|Another fire {{occurred}} on 30 July 2006. The fire occurred just after production ended on the Bond film Casino Royale while the Venetian piazza set was being dismantled. Eight fire engines took 90 minutes {{to bring the}} fire under control; {{a spokesman for the}} local fire brigade said gas canisters may have exploded inside the building. Filming had been completed on the stage several days before and it was being dismantled, so it did not delay production or release of the film. The damage to the building was extensive causing the roof of the building to collapse. On 31 July 2006, Pinewood issued a statement indicating that the stage [...] "will need to be demolished and rebuilt" [...] and that there had been no casualties in the incident. The fire-damaged stage was demolished on 13-14 September. Construction on the new stage began on 18 September and was completed in under 6 months. The new stage was redesigned and included a number of new features including an increased working <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> <b>area,</b> enclosed stairwells to the gantry, a vehicle ramp into the tank, aircraft hangar-style loading doors, increased electrical power and better insulation. The new stage is 374 ft long, 158 ft wide and 41 to 50 ft high (114 x 48 x 12-15 m). The stage is the biggest in Europe around 59000 sq ft.|$|E
40|$|The paper fits a hedonic {{regression}} {{model to the}} sales of condominium units in Tokyo over the period 2000 - 2015. The problem {{is complicated by the}} need to decompose the selling price of a unit into a component that {{can be attributed to the}} structure area of the unit and another component that can be attributed to the unit's share of land value. There is very little information on the value of condominium land and so this paper develops a methodology for reducing this knowledge gap. The paper extends the builder's model which was developed in Eurostat (2013) [11]. Characteristics which prove to be important in explaining condominium prices are: the <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> <b>area</b> of the unit, the total land area of the building, the number of units in the building, the total number of stories in the building, the height of the sold unit, the age of the structure and the amount of excess land. The paper also derives an estimate for the annual geometric structure depreciation rate for condominiums in Tokyo. 基盤研究(S) = Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{urbanisation}} due {{to global}} economic development and population growth necessitate the expansion of cities and towns with new buildings and associated energy requirements. The <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> <b>area</b> and volumetric dimension of modern residential houses are increasing at a constant rate in most developed countries including Australia. Therefore, the energy consumption for ongoing heating and cooling is also increasing. The increasing energy consumption leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions. In household consumption, around 40 % of the total energy is used for space heating and cooling. Hence, the reduction of energy use for space heating and cooling is paramount for energy conservation, energy security and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. A {{substantial amount of energy}} required for heating and cooling is lost through the house wall systems. Despite the importance of house wall systems for energy efficiency, little research has been undertaken on energy efficient house wall systems made of combined thermal masses and insulation materials that can be used and adapted for variable climate conditions with minimal design changes and cost. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to undertake a thermal performance study of two house wall systems (one conventional and the other a new design) with single and double glazed windows for variable climate conditions in order to develop an optimal energy efficient house wall system with minimal material modification and cost. Additionally, a thermal performance model for the optimal house wall systems is also to be developed for use in variable climate conditions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Payment for Insufficient Density (PID) {{which is}} a rough {{translation}} for the French term 'Versement pour Sous Densité' (VSD) is a measure that has made its entry into French law recently and {{is part of a}} larger reform of urbanism codes. Its aim is to mitigate urban sprawl by requiring that real estate developers settle a certain amount of money in the case where housing density upon construction does not meet a defined Minimum Density Threshold (MDT). In this study, we investigate the potential impacts of such a policy, and analyze how it can be best used to gain efficiency, while keeping social costs low. We carry out this study by using a dynamic urban model (NEDUM 2 D) calibrated on Paris urban area. NEDUM 2 D (Viguié and Hallegatte 2011) is a land-use transport interaction model, based on standard urban economic modeling (Alonso 1964; Mills 1967; Muth 1969). It provides a comprehensive framework which seeks to capture the variation in the real estate prices, in the rents, in housing and population density as well as in housing size across an urban area. Using this model we assess the spatial consequences of the implementation of the PID in 2040 in the Paris urban area relatively to an unconstrained baseline. It is found that the PID is a tax on construction that leads to an increase in built <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> <b>area.</b> If appropriately implemented, it limits urban sprawl and associated greenhouse gases emissions. It is also found to increase overall housing supply and contributes to decrease average rent levels. However, the choice of the MDT conditions the efficiency of the policy. If it is too low it can even have counter-productive effects such as an increase in urbanised area. The most efficient MDT depends on the criteria chosen. A political discussion must take place so as to decide which objective should be pursued in priority (housing costs reduction, GHG mitigation etc [...] .). Our results however show that limiting urban sprawl through a tax on construction does not necessarily translate into higher housing costs...|$|E

On January 17, 2000, three years after the appropriate municipal council resolution, the construction stage was put into action.

These enriched the current surrounding areas of Wiehre, Oberau, Waldsee and [...] Littenweiler, including 180 new residences and a huge shopping centre (Zentrum Oberwiehre).|$|R

Both studies were conducted as randomized complete block designs (blocking factor = day of start of test) with 5 <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> treatment levels (0. 21, 0. 27, 0. 33, 0. 39, and 0. 44 m 2 /pig in Study 1; 0. 35, 0. 45, 0. 54, 0. 64, and 0. 73 m 2 /pig in Study 2). Treatment levels were selected to cover the range likely to be used under commercial conditions and were calculated to provide the same k values in both studies (i. e., 0. 019, 0. 025, 0. 030, 0. 035, and 0. 041 m 2 /BW 0. 67). The estimated weight at the midpoint of the <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> evaluation period (end of week 8 in Study 1 and week 14 in Study 2) was used to calculate the respective k values. All adjustment gates were moved to the back of the pens during the subsequent period, resulting in <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> of 0. 53 and 0. 73 m 2 /pig in Study 1 and 2, respectively.
