40|$|Current {{treatments}} of cultural heritage {{as an object}} of moral concern (whether it be the heritage of mankind or of some particular group of people) have tended to treat it as a means to ensure human wellbeing: either as ‘cultural property’ or ‘cultural patrimony’, suggesting concomitant rights of possession and exclusion, or otherwise as something which, gaining its ethical significance from the roles it plays in people’s lives and the formation of their identities, is the beneficiary at most of indirect moral obligations. In contrast, I argue that cultural heritage, as something whose existence can go well or badly, can itself qualify as a moral patient towards which we may have obligations which need not be accounted for in terms of subsequent benefits to human beings. Drawing inspiration from environmental ethics and suggesting that heritage, like an ecosystem, is a complex network of interrelations which invites a holistic understanding, I develop a framework for thinking about cultural heritage which shows how such a thing can feature in our ethical reflections as intrinsically worthy of respect in spite of its most obvious differences from the ‘natural’ world: the very human origins of cultural heritage and its involvement with human life in all its forms. As part of the development of this framework I consider the epistemic difficulties which arise when for all our holistic sophistication we do find ourselves in the predicament of having to judge the moral worth of some <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritage,</b> possibly someone else’s heritage and possibly something which we find ourselves disposed to value more because of than despite any mysteries surrounding it. I conclude by offering some tentative illustrations of how such a framework might operate in the practical course of normative moral reasoning about what should be done with items of cultural heritage.

[...] Among its cultural heritage possessions, one is truly unique. It is the only wooden pagoda in Korea that has preserved its original appearance, named Palsangjeon (National Treasure No. 55). Originally there were two such structures in Korea, but when the Main Buddha Hall at Ssangbongsa Temple burnt down in 1984, Palsangjeon became the only surviving wooden pagoda designated a cultural heritage. In a hall open on four sides, the Huigyeon Bosal (The Beautiful Bodhisattva, Sudarsana) (Treasure No. 1417) is enshrined. This bodhisattva stands on a foundation stone and carries an incense burner on his head to fulfill his vow to offer incense to the Buddha for eternity.|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. ArchitectureThe {{design of}} a digital, genealogical archival {{repository}} in Pretoria West {{for the preservation of}} South African family histories, that will inter alia, provide free public access to such archived material, is proposed. Oppression brought about by colonialism and apartheid in South Africa ultimately led to domination by one racial group, resulting in the inadequate documentation of the personal histories {{of the majority of the}} population; an omission which may be remediated by the archiving of family histories. Archival buildings are custodians <b>of</b> the valuable <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritage</b> for future generations. However, due to the strenuous and time intensive nature of the genealogical research process, the National Archives and Records Service does not, currently, effectively address this lack, which has led to this field of research being privately practiced. An archive of family history to be housed in Pretoria West, an industrial area characterised by vacant and abandoned buildings in need of intervention, is proposed. The design seeks to adapt a grain silo which forms a part of an old flour mill complex on Charlotte Maxeke Street. An exploration into the building's past as a place which stores, secures and protects the contents within it, led to its selection as a suitable host for an archive which will utilise the preservative functional logic of the silo as a place of storage and security...|$|R
30|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{techniques}} available for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>items</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>heritage.</b> However, the use of traditional techniques to investigate valuable artworks is sometimes impossible, since profuse sampling procedures are forbidden. Fortunately, in recent years, non-destructive/non-invasive techniques such as diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy have been demonstrated to be important techniques for the characterisation <b>of</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> samples, establishing new analytical protocols [1]. The versatility and adaptability of portable/hand-held Raman spectrometers have been demonstrated by studies carried out on rock paintings in caves and rock-shelters [2 – 4], mural paintings [5], plasterworks [6] or valuable collections in museums [7]. Together with portable Raman spectroscopy, portable/hand-held energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF) has become a very valuable technique in the field <b>of</b> cultural <b>heritage,</b> for example, in the studies of pottery [8], cave art [9], bronzes [10], wall paintings [11], etc.|$|R
