5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 {{went into}} {{development}} in July 2004. This sequel was designed with the Aurora Engine, also used by its predecessor, and the game's toolset {{was included in}} the game's release for players to use in designing their own adventures. The game's design team drew upon older role-playing video games, and decided that the player character would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> the respect of others by the things the character does. The game was also designed to be playable with other players online in a cooperative fashion. The game was released in October and November 2006. Official multiplayer support for the game was suspended in December 2012. In response, the Neverwinter Nights 2 community developed several initiatives by which players can continue to play the game online.|$|E

The build-up to the match began on July 31, 2003 on {{an episode of}} SmackDown!. During an interview promotion in the ring, Lesnar challenged Angle to a rematch of their bout at Vengeance, WWE's previous pay-per-view event. The WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon, decided that Lesnar would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> his rematch by competing in a steel cage match against McMahon himself, and would take place on SmackDown! the following week, with Angle officiating as a special guest referee. The Steel Cage match resulted in neither wrestler winning the match, after McMahon and Lesnar attacked Angle.

500|$|During the off-season, Canucks centre Ryan Kesler {{underwent}} hip surgery, sidelining him for {{the start}} of the 2011–12 campaign. With the centre position on the second line vacant, Hodgson competed with the newly acquired Andrew Ebbett to temporarily replace Kesler. After being cut in his previous three training camps with the team, Hodgson emerged with the second-line position to start the season. After wearing 39 on his jersey the previous season as a rookie, Hodgson switched to 9, a number historically associated in the NHL with high-profile players. He had previously spoken to team trainers regarding the number, but decided having the number is [...] "something you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> [...] mak the team first." [...] When Kesler returned to the team's line-up six games into the season, Hodgson was moved to the right wing to remain on the second line, before settling in as the team's third-line centre. On December 10, 2011, Hodgson left a game against the Ottawa Senators after a hit from opposing forward Nick Foligno left him unsteadily skating back to the bench. Hodgson was reportedly uninjured, as Vigneault told media he was kept out of the contest for precautionary measures.|$|E

500|$|Koppel {{announced}} Wimbledon Football Club's {{intent to}} move to Milton Keynes on 2 August 2001 with {{a letter to the}} Football League chief executive David Burns requesting approval. The letter stated that Wimbledon had already signed an agreement to relocate and [...] "subject to the necessary planning and regulatory consents being obtained" [...] intended to be playing home games at a newly built stadium in Milton Keynes by the start of the 2003–04 season. The proposed move was opposed in most quarters: along with most of Wimbledon's fans and many football supporters generally, the League, the Football Association (the FA), Merton Council, most football writers in the national press and a 150-man Parliamentary All-Party Committee voiced disapproval. Two similar club relocations had occurred in the Scottish professional ranks during the 1990s, but the permanent relocation of an English League club to another conurbation was unprecedented. A group of Wimbledon fans decided to boycott club merchandise in protest against the plans, and launched an [...] "alternative matchday programme for both home and away fans", Yellow and Blue, to compete against the official publication. The League board unanimously rejected Wimbledon's proposed move on 16 August 2001, stating that any Milton Keynes club would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> membership by progressing through the pyramid and that [...] "franchised football" [...] would be [...] "disastrous".|$|E

Beavers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>earn</b> six Challenge Badges to Gain the Bronze Chief Scout's Award, Cubs seven for the Silver and Scouts nine for the Gold. The final three awards, The Chief Scout's Platinum and Diamond Awards and the Queen's Scout Award are available in the Explorer Scout and Scout Network sections. The awards mirror the requirements of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award at Bronze, Silver and Gold level respectively, consisting of a period of time volunteering in the local community, a prolonged physical activity, the advancement of a skill and the undertaking an expedition, allowing a participant to achieve both the DofE and the Scout award at the same time. In addition, these three awards {{do not have to be}} completed in order, and participants can skip straight to a specific award, although additional work is involved. Achieving the Queen's Scout Award is seen as a significant event on a national scale; recipients of the award are invited to join the St George's Day service at Windsor Castle the year after completing the scheme, and parade before the Queen or her representative.|$|E
