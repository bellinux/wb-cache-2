5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E

40|$|Smart {{features}} such as self-healing and selfcooling require bathing the entire volume with a coolant or/and healing agent. Bathing the entire volume {{is an example of}} point to area (or volume) flows. Point to area flows cover all the distributing and collecting kinds of flows, i. e. inhaling and exhaling, mining, river deltas, energy distribution, distribution of products on the landscape and so on. The <b>flow</b> <b>resistances</b> of a point to area flow can be decreased by changing the design with the guidance of the constructal law, which is the law of the design evolution in time. In this paper, how the <b>flow</b> <b>resistances</b> (heat, fluid and stress) can be decreased by using the constructal law is shown with examples. First, the validity of two assumptions is surveyed: using temperature independent Hess-Murray rule and using constant diameter ducts where the duct discharges fluid along its edge. Then, point to area types of flows are explained by illustrating the results of two examples: fluid networks and heating an area. Last, how the structures should be vascularized for cooling and mechanical strength is documented. This paper shows that <b>flow</b> <b>resistances</b> can be decreased by morphing the shape freely without any restrictions or generic algorithms...|$|R

25|$|The {{throttling}} {{process is}} commonly exploited in thermal machines such as generators, air conditioners, heat pumps, and liquefiers. Throttling is a fundamentally irreversible process.

25|$|A {{non-return}} valve is usually fitted to the breathing hoses where they {{connect to the}} mouthpiece. This prevents any water that gets into the mouthpiece from going into the inhalation hose, and ensures that once it is blown into the exhalation hose that it cannot flow back. This slightly increases the <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> of air, but makes the regulator easier to clear.|$|E
25|$|The design {{challenge}} for a Stirling engine regenerator {{is to provide}} sufficient heat transfer capacity without introducing too much additional internal volume ('dead space') or <b>flow</b> <b>resistance.</b> These inherent design conflicts are one of many factors that limit the efficiency of practical Stirling engines. A typical design is a stack of fine metal wire meshes, with low porosity to reduce dead space, and with the wire axes perpendicular to the gas flow to reduce conduction in that direction and to maximize convective heat transfer.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms include {{jaundice}} (yellowing), liver enlargement, {{and pain}} and tenderness from the structural changes in damaged liver architecture. Without total abstinence from alcohol use, cirrhosis will {{eventually lead to}} liver failure. Late complications of cirrhosis or liver failure include portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the portal vein due to the increased <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> through the damaged liver), coagulation disorders (due to impaired production of coagulation factors), ascites (heavy abdominal swelling due to buildup of fluids in the tissues) and other complications, including hepatic encephalopathy and the hepatorenal syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A {{pressure}} reduction regulator {{is used to}} control the delivery pressure of the gas supplied to a free-flow helmet, in which the flow is continuous, to maintain the downstream pressure which {{is provided by the}} ambient pressure of the exhaust and the <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> of the delivery system - mainly the umbilical - and not influenced by the breathing of the diver. Gas reclaim systems use a third kind of regulator to control the flow of exhaled gas to the return hose. Rebreather systems may also use regulators to control the flow of fresh gas, and demand valves, known as automatic diluent valves, to maintain the volume in the breathing loop during descent.|$|E

25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, cracking pressure and <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> of the exhaust valve, or intentional overpressure in a full-face mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the exhaust valve. A consistent variation in delivered pressure difference does not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but the effort required for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled exhaust flow, but not necessarily to the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative pressure breathing, as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{configuration}} is the flared fin heat sink; its fins are not {{parallel to}} each other, {{as shown in}} figure 5. Flaring the fins decreases <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> and makes more air go through the heat sink fin channel; otherwise, more air would bypass the fins. Slanting them keeps the overall dimensions the same, but offers longer fins. Forghan, et al. have published data on tests conducted on pin fin, straight fin and flared fin heat sinks. They found that for low approach air velocity, typically around 1m/s, the thermal performance is at least 20% better than straight fin heat sinks. Lasance and Eggink also found that for the bypass configurations that they tested, the flared heat sink performed better than the other heat sinks tested.|$|E
2500|$|The {{demand valve}} adds a little {{respiratory}} dead space to the airway, and there is added [...] due to hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the depth of the}} demand valve and the lungs, and due to cracking pressure and <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> in the demand valve. These factors make breathing from a demand valve more effort than normal breathing out of the water, and the additional work of breathing at depth due to increased density and viscosity of the compressed gas, make a slow deep breathing cycle more energy efficient and more effective at carbon dioxide elimination. The diver learns to breathe more slowly and deeply with practice, and this usually improves endurance on a given quantity of gas. Part of the skill is learning to relax under water, and part is to minimize effort by learning good buoyancy, trim, maneuvering and propulsion skills. The breathing rate should not be slowed down too much, or there is a risk of hypercapnia (carbon dioxide buildup).|$|E

2500|$|In {{comment on}} the Komatsu analysis, Atwater’s team {{observed}} that there is substantial evidence for multiple large floods, including evidence of mud cracks and animal burrows in lower layers which were filled by sediment from later floods. Further, evidence for multiple flood flows up side arms of Glacial Lake Columbia spread over many centuries have been found. [...] They {{also pointed out that}} the discharge point from Lake Columbia varied with time, originally flowing across the Waterville Plateau into Moses Coulee but later, when the Okanagon lobe blocked that route, eroding the Grand Coulee to discharge there as a substantially lower outlet. The Komatsu analysis does not evaluate the impact of the considerable erosion observed in this basin during the flood (or floods) – hence the assumption that the flood hydraulics can be modeled using modern-day topography is an area which warrants further consideration – earlier narrower constrictions at places such as Wallula Gap and through the Columbia Gorge could be expected to produce higher <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> and correspondingly higher floods.|$|E
2500|$|Fish are {{probably}} the best-known inhabitants of lotic systems. [...] The ability of a fish species to live in flowing waters depends upon {{the speed at which}} it can swim and the duration that its speed can be maintained. [...] This ability can vary greatly between species and is tied to the habitat in which it can survive. [...] Continuous swimming expends a tremendous amount of energy and, therefore, fishes spend only short periods in full current. [...] Instead, individuals remain close to the bottom or the banks, behind obstacles, and sheltered from the current, swimming in the current only to feed or change locations. Some species have adapted to living only on the system bottom, never venturing into the open water flow. [...] These fishes are dorso-ventrally flattened to reduce <b>flow</b> <b>resistance</b> and often have eyes on top of their heads to observe what is happening above them. [...] Some also have sensory barrels positioned under the head to assist in the testing of substratum (Brown 1987).|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{thermodynamic}} model {{for an open}} inverse Brayton cycle (refrigeration or heat pump cycle) with pressure drop irreversibilities is established. There are seven <b>flow</b> <b>resistances</b> (or pressure drops) encountered by the working fluid stream for the inverse Brayton cycle. Two of these, the friction through the blades and vanes of the compressor and the expander, {{are related to the}} isentropic efficiencies. The remaining <b>flow</b> <b>resistances</b> are always present because of the changes in flow cross-section at the compressor inlet and outlet, heat exchanger inlets and outlets and expander inlet and outlet. The analytical formulae about the cooling load of refrigeration cycle, the heating load of heat pump cycle and other coefficients are derived, which indicate that the thermodynamic performance for open inverse Brayton cycle can be optimized by adjusting the mass flow rate (or the distribution of pressure losses along the flow path). It is shown that there are optimal air mass flow rates (or the distribution of pressure losses along the flow path) which maximize the cooling load of refrigeration cycle, and the optimal air mass flow rates are smaller than the one at the maximum power output of the direct Brayton cycle...|$|R
