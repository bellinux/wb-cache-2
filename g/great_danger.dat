5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a <b>great</b> <b>danger</b> for bulkers. The {{problem is}} even more pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} temples within Phlan, each {{dedicated}} to different gods. Each temple can heal {{those who are}} wounded, poisoned, or afflicted, and can fully restore deceased comrades for a high price. The party can also visit the hiring hall and hire an experienced NPC adventurer to accompany the party. Encounters with NPCs in shops and taverns offer valuable information. Listening to gossip in taverns can be helpful to characters, although some tavern tales are false and lead characters into <b>great</b> <b>danger.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alexius Slav's {{marriage}} to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a <b>great</b> <b>danger</b> to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though {{it is more likely that}} the union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E

5|$|During a {{field trip}} to an archeological dig, Cartman discovers a mysterious stone triangle, which he {{promptly}} throws away without interest. Shortly after Kyle picks it up, the guide identifies the writing on the triangle as Anasazi. Kyle appears on television to discuss the find, resulting in a jealous Cartman wanting the triangle back. Cartman constantly pesters Kyle until he returns the triangle to him. Meanwhile, Leonard Maltin comes to South Park and asks Chef whether he has seen Barbra Streisand. Maltin, having seen Kyle and the triangle on television, tells Chef the boys are in <b>great</b> <b>danger.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the game's introduction, {{the ghost}} of Garamon haunts the Avatar's dreams with {{warnings}} of a <b>great</b> <b>danger</b> in Britannia. The Avatar allows Garamon to take him there, where he watches Tyball kidnap Arial. Tyball escapes, leaving the Avatar to be caught by the Baron's guards. The guards {{take him to the}} Baron, who banishes him to the Great Stygian Abyss to rescue Arial. After the introduction, the Avatar explores the dungeon and finds remnants of Cabirus's colony. A few possible scenarios include deciding the fate of two warring goblin tribes, learning a language, and playing an instrument to complete a quest. The Avatar eventually defeats Tyball and frees Arial.|$|E
5|$|The Balts {{were largely}} driven to unite by {{external}} threats from aggressive German religious orders. In 1202, the Order of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword {{was established by}} Albert, the Bishop of Riga, to promote the Christianization and conquest of the Livonians, Curonians, Semigallians, and Estonians near the Gulf of Riga. The Order waged a number of successful campaigns and posed a <b>great</b> <b>danger</b> to the Lithuanian territories. The Order's progress was halted by its defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, after which it almost collapsed. The following year, it merged into the Teutonic Knights.|$|E

5|$|Before Cyrus and {{his army}} crossed the Aras River to {{battle with the}} Armenians, he {{installed}} his son Cambyses II as king in case he should not return from battle. However, once Cyrus had crossed the Aras River, he had a vision in which Darius had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon the confines of Europe and Asia (the known world). When Cyrus awoke from the dream, he inferred it as a <b>great</b> <b>danger</b> to the future security of the empire, as it meant that Darius would one day rule the whole world. However, his son Cambyses was {{the heir to the}} throne, not Darius, causing Cyrus to wonder if Darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs. This led Cyrus to order Hystaspes to go back to Persis and watch over his son strictly, until Cyrus himself returned. Darius did not seem to have any treasonous thoughts as Cambyses II ascended the throne peacefully; and, through promotion, Darius was eventually elevated to be Cambyses's personal lancer.|$|E
5|$|England's {{opponents in}} the final were West Germany. It was England who {{dominated}} the final but it was Banks who was beaten first. A weak header from Ray Wilson handed a chance to Helmut Haller, who sent an accurate but relatively weak shot {{into the corner of}} the net; Banks had been unsighted by Jack Charlton, and he failed to adjust his position in time to reach the ball. England equalised through a Geoff Hurst header within six minutes and went ahead late in the second half through Martin Peters. With seconds left in the game, Lothar Emmerich sent a free kick into the England penalty area, and the ball fell to Wolfgang Weber, who guided the ball over a lunging Ray Wilson and an outstretched Banks into the net to take the game into extra-time. In extra-time, the Germans sent shots in at the England goal which Banks managed to catch and control without any <b>great</b> <b>danger.</b> Hurst scored two goals to complete his hat-trick, and though many claimed his second goal never crossed the line Banks always maintained his belief that the officials called the decision correctly. Between these goals Banks had to deal with a fiery shot from Sigfried Held, and was later exposed only for Uwe Seeler to come just centimetres away from connecting with the ball.|$|E
5|$|With {{his three}} {{divisions}} reunited on 7 September 1812, Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps saw {{action at the}} Battle of Borodino. He {{was placed on the}} French right, in second line, behind the Corps of Marshal Davout and, after Murat managed to take two of the redoubts on the Russian left, Nansouty placed his men on the right of this position and then supported the advance of {{the right wing of the}} army. With the Russians making an offensive comeback, Nansouty placed himself at the head of the heavy divisions of Saint-Germain and Valence and charged and while doing so a bullet pierced one of his knees. This was Nansouty's first battle wound and it was serious enough to end his active role during this campaign. He was transported to Moscow following the battle and although still wounded, on 10 October, he was entrusted with the mission of commanding the convoy that was to take the wounded generals and colonels, as well as the main trophies captured, behind the lines. During this mission, he was exposed to <b>great</b> <b>danger,</b> to famine and extreme cold, which impacted his already frail health. He was then allowed to return to France and recover from his injury.|$|E

5|$|Smith made {{a return}} to {{management}} with Oxford on 10 September 1993, and the following day led them to a 4–2 victory over his former club Bristol City. A victory over another former club, Stoke, took Oxford off {{the bottom of the}} Second Division, but a sequence of just 2 wins in 17 matches left them in <b>great</b> <b>danger</b> of relegation. He signed goalkeeper Phil Whitehead on loan from Barnsley, signed striker John Byrne (£50,000 from Millwall) {{for the third time in}} his career, and then made what he later said was the best signing of his career by bringing in defender Matt Elliott from Scunthorpe United for £170,000. Oxford were boosted by these arrivals and briefly exited the relegation zone, also claiming an FA Cup giant-killing over Leeds at Elland Road after Jim Magilton scored the winning goal in extra time. However, after the match Magilton moved to Southampton for a £600,000 fee. Oxford had struggled in the league during their FA Cup run and were 15 points short of safety with 16 matches to play, but were aided by £60,000 signing Paul Moody, who, despite arriving in February 1994, managed to finish as the club's top-scorer with 12 goals in 15 appearances. His arrival kick-started the club's fightback, and Oxford closed the 15 points gap in just 9 matches. However, a difficult run-in left Oxford needing to beat Notts County on the last day of the season and hope results elsewhere went their way, and though they beat County their relegation rivals also claimed victories and Oxford were relegated.|$|E

PT X has not have Occupational Safety and Health Management System, so {{the numbers of}} accidents tends to increase. This thesis was conducted to design Occupational Safety and Health Management System for production area. The design includes fire and flood prevention, health service, personal protective equipment (PPE), safety signs, and B 3 spills. Firstly, hazard identification and risk assessment were conducted to determine the level of danger based on Risk Priority Number (RPN). The greater the RPN, the more dangerous. Hazard identification and risk assessment were {{carried out in the}} production area namely Plant- 1, Plant- 2, and Plant- 3. Source of the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> at Plant- 1 (RPN= 108) is the open conveyor.

Source of the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> at Plant- 3 extraction (RPN= 64) is hexane tank. Source of the <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> at Plant- 3 pelletizing (RPN= 96) is dusty work area and workers negligent in use of PPE.
