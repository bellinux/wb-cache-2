5|$|This section {{establishes}} the fact that, although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan, the individual federal <b>grants</b> <b>are</b> awarded for a specified time period, usually one year. Federal regulations prohibit {{the use of}} funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency, and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only. For example, a surplus from a federal award that starts on January 1, 2006 and ends on December 31, 2006 cannot be used after December 31, because its lifespan has terminated. This surplus must {{be returned to the}} federal agency unless otherwise authorized.|$|E

25|$|Artwork is {{generally}} {{viewed as a}} freely given gift made by the artist to the community {{at his or her}} own expense. Art <b>grants</b> <b>are,</b> however, available to participants via a system of curation and oversight, with application deadlines early in the year. <b>Grants</b> <b>are</b> intended to help artists produce work beyond the scope of their own means, and are generally intended to cover only a portion of the costs associated with creation of the pieces, usually requiring considerable reliance on an artist's community resources. Aggregate funding for all grants varies depending on the number and quality of the submissions (usually well over 100) but amounts to several percent (on the order of $500,000 in recent years) of the gross receipts from ticket sales. In 2006, 29 pieces were funded.|$|E

2500|$|Initially {{there was}} {{disagreement}} about whether <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> handcuffed {{before he was}} shot.

Mehserle voiced his fear that <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> [...] "going for his waistband." [...] The day after the shooting, BART spokesman Jim Allison said that <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> not restrained when he was shot, and multiple witnesses testified that Grant refused to give up his hands for handcuffing prior to the shooting. [...] The family's claim against BART stated that <b>Grant</b> <b>was</b> handcuffed only after he was shot.|$|R

25|$|According to the U.S. National Science Foundation, {{the college}} {{received}} $1.15 million in grants, fellowships, and R stipends for research.

25|$|Income <b>grants</b> <b>are</b> argued to be {{vastly more}} {{efficient}} in extending basic needs {{to the poor}} than subsidizing supplies whose effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. With cars and other appliances, the wealthiest 20% of Egypt uses about 93% of the country's fuel subsidies. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education. A 2008 study concluded that {{the money spent on}} in-kind transfers in India in a year could lift all India's poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly. The primary obstacle argued against direct cash transfers is the impractically for poor countries of such large and direct transfers. In practice, payments determined by complex iris scanning are used by war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan, while India is phasing out its fuel subsidies in favor of direct transfers. Additionally, in aid models, the famine relief model increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving cash or cash vouchers to the hungry to pay local farmers instead of buying food from donor countries, often required by law, as it wastes money on transport costs.|$|E
25|$|The grant signed between Damarla Venkatadri and the English {{had to be}} {{authenticated}} or {{confirmed by}} the Raja of Chandragiri - Venkatapathy Rayulu. The Raja, Venkatapathy Rayulu, was succeeded by his nephew Sri Rangarayulu in 1642, and Sir Francis Day was succeeded by Thomas Ivy. The grant expired, and Ivy sent Factor Greenhill {{on a mission to}} Chandragiri to meet the new Raja and to get the grant renewed. A new grant was issued, copies of which are still available. It is dated October - November 1645. This new grant is important regarding the legal and civic development of the English settlement. Because the Raja operated an arbitrary and capricious legal code which fundamentally discriminated against private property, trade, and merchandising in general, and against non-Indians in particular, the new grant signed in 1645 expanded the rights of the English by empowering them to administer English Common Law amongst their colonists and Civil Law between the colonists and the other European, Muslim, and Hindu nationalities. Furthermore, it expanded the Company property by attaching an additional piece of land known as the Narimedu (or 'Jackal-ground') which lay {{to the west of the}} village of Madraspatnam. This new grant laid the foundation for the expansion of Madras into its present form. All three <b>grants</b> <b>are</b> said to have been engraved on gold plates which were later reported to have been plundered, disappearing during one of the genocides of the English colony. However, there are city records of their existence long afterwards, and it has been suggested that the present government may still hold them.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{sizeable}} Malay community in Sri Lanka, descended from soldiers, convicts, and political exiles brought from Dutch and British colonies of East Indies and Malaya. The Sri Lankan Creole Malay varieties spoken by the community, are currently endangered {{as they are}} no longer spoken by the younger generation. However, in recent years, there are efforts in sharpening the sense of Malay identity by promoting the usage of 'standard Malay' language. This move was ideologically favoured by the urban segment of the community as it enables them to feel linked to the larger Malay groups in Southeast Asia. The community's effort to teach standard Malay to its members is largely aided by the Malaysian government through its high commission in Colombo. The high commission conducted courses in standard Malay, exclusively for members of the Malay community, and those who fared best were trained as language teachers in Malaysia. They were then expected to teach 'standard' Malay to their respective communities in Sri Lanka. These initiatives were welcomed and appreciated by the community. The language programmes and trips to Malaysia were made possible through the offices of the Gabungan Persatuan Penulis Nasional (GAPENA - the Federation of National Writers' Association of Malaysia). The Malays of Sri Lanka are constantly wooed by the Malaysian government, which chose to conduct the second GAPENA conference in Colombo in 1985, arranges periodic visits by representatives of the Malaysian government to the Malay Club in Colombo where <b>grants</b> <b>are</b> given for various community projects, and finances occasional trips to Malaysia for members of the community to attend conferences and seminars {{at the expense of the}} Malaysian state. The Indonesian government, however, does not seem to have similar aggressive efforts through its embassy in Colombo. As a result, although the Sri Lankan Malays are predominantly of Indonesian origins (especially Javanese), an attempt by a Sri Lanka 'Indonesian' Organization to reconstitute them as 'Indonesians', was declined.|$|E
