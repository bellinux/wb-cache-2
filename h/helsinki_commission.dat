500|$|In February 1997, a United States {{immigration}} {{court judge}} granted asylum to a German Scientologist who claimed {{she would be}} subject to religious persecution in her homeland. In April 1997, John Travolta met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia. Travolta later said Clinton assured him that he would [...] "really love to help" [...] with the [...] "issue over in Germany with Scientology". According to Travolta, Clinton recalled that [...] "he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him, and respected his views on it", stating that Scientologists [...] "were given an unfair hand in [...] and that he wanted to fix it". In September 1997, John Travolta, Chick Corea and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE, also known as the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Commission),</b> voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, and had a briefing with United States National Security Advisor Sandy Berger, whom Clinton had assigned to be [...] "the administration's Scientology point person".

500|$|It was {{initially}} {{announced that the}} Republican Party {{would go to the}} parliamentary election alone and would seek [...] "qualitative majority" [...] in the parliament, and that their goal was the fairness of the electoral process.

It {{came to be known as}} the Unity bloc («Միասնություն» դաշինք), often referred to as Miasnutyun. Vazgen Sargsyan claimed the bloc was a [...] "genuine" [...] alliance and that the two parties had come together to lead Armenia [...] "from a turning point to progress." [...] When asked about the reasons why he joined Demirchyan, Sargsyan said that, [...] "there is no other way out." [...] According to the U.S. <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Commission,</b> Sargsyan [...] "obviously concluded it was better to have the popular Demirchyan as an ally than an opponent," [...] and that [...] "in forming Unity bloc, Sargsyan and Demirchyan overcame whatever ideological differences they may have had, and said they had joined forces to overcome the difficult problems facing Armenia while promoting tolerance in the country’'s political life." [...] In analyst Richard Giragosian's words, the bloc was [...] "an odd mix," [...] however he admitted that it [...] "effectively marginalized the electoral threat" [...] of other parties. Sociologist Levon Baghdasaryan described it as [...] "unification of the new and old nomenklaturas." [...] The British Helsinki Human Rights Group wrote of the Unity bloc that it [...] "aimed to appeal to the electorate by being all things to all men." [...] The ODIHR suggested that the [...] "alliance was not only created for electoral purposes, but that a strategic political agreement had been reached while overcoming ideological differences." ...|$|E
