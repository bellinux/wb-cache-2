25|$|Because {{they depend}} on the human host for part of their life-cycle, {{diseases}} such as African schistosomiasis, river blindness, and <b>elephantiasis</b> are not defined as zoonotic, {{even though they may}} depend on transmission by insects or other vectors.|$|E

25|$|Lymphedema is the {{swelling}} {{caused by the}} accumulation of lymph, which may occur if the lymphatic system is damaged or has malformations. It usually affects limbs, though the face, neck and abdomen may also be affected.

25|$|In antiquity, {{pitches and}} resins were used {{commonly}} as medicines. Pliny mentions {{a variety of}} tar-like substances being used as medicine, including cedria and pissinum. Cedria was the pitch and resin of the cedar tree, being equivalent to the oil of tar and pyroligneous acid which {{are used in the}} first stage of distilling creosote. He recommends cedria to ease the pain in a toothache, as an injection in the ear in case of hardness of hearing, to kill parasitic worms, as a preventative for impregnation, as a treatment for phthiriasis and porrigo, as an antidote for the poison of the sea hare, as a liniment for <b>elephantiasis,</b> and as an ointment to treat ulcers both on the skin and in the lungs. He further speaks of cedria being used as the embalming agent for preparing mummies. Pissinum was a tar water that was made by boiling cedria, spreading wool fleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them out.|$|E

Both books were also based on personal experience: there is evidence about a surgery he performed in Mayagüez on a Spanish government official with an <b>elephantiasis</b> lesion of the scrotum {{the size of a}} grapefruit for which the costs were paid for by the local government; another patient he operated upon had a lesion that weighed [...] He also wrote an article on urethral obstructions in male patients (see above).|$|E
500|$|Author Yvonne Tasker, in {{her book}} Working Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Popular Cinema (2002), notes that Cher's film roles often mirrors her public image as a rebellious, sexually autonomous, and self-made woman. In her films, she recurrently serves as a social {{intermediary}} to disenfranchised male characters, such as Eric Stoltz's <b>elephantiasis</b> victim in Mask (1985), Liam Neeson's mute homeless veteran in Suspect (1987), and Nicolas Cage's socially isolated baker with a wooden hand in Moonstruck (1987). Film critic Kathleen Rowe wrote of Moonstruck that the depiction of Cher's character as [...] "a 'woman on top' [...] enhanced by the unruly star persona Cher brings to the part'. Jeff Yarbrough of The Advocate wrote that Cher was [...] "one of the first superstars to 'play gay' with compassion and {{without a hint of}} stereotyping", as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film Silkwood.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 October Darwin {{finished}} the proofs, suffering from fits of vomiting. He then went {{off for a}} two-month stay at Ilkley Wells House, a spa {{in the town of}} Ilkley. He was joined by his family for a time of [...] "frozen misery" [...] in the unusually early winter. Darwin wrote [...] "I have been very bad lately, having had an awful 'crisis' one leg swelled like <b>elephantiasis</b> – eyes almost closed up – covered with a rash & fiery Boils; but they tell me it will surely do me much good – it was like living in Hell." [...] On 2 November he was pleased to receive from Murray a specimen copy bound in royal green cloth, priced at fifteen shillings.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{parasitology}} {{developed in}} the 19th century with accurate observations by several researchers and clinicians. In 1828, James Annersley described amoebiasis, protozoal infections of the intestines and the liver, though the pathogen, Entamoeba histolytica, was not discovered until 1873 by Friedrich Lösch. James Paget discovered the intestinal nematode Trichinella spiralis in humans in 1835. [...] James McConnell described the human liver fluke in 1875. Patrick Manson discovered {{the life cycle of}} <b>elephantiasis,</b> caused by nematode worms transmitted by mosquitoes, in 1877. Manson further predicted that the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, had a mosquito vector, and persuaded Ronald Ross to investigate. Ross confirmed that the prediction was correct in 1897–1898. At the same time, Giovanni Battista Grassi and others described the malaria parasite's life cycle stages in Anopheles mosquitoes. Ross was controversially awarded the 1902 Nobel prize for his work, while Grassi was not.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{peripheral}} organs, the lymphatic system performs important immune functions, and runs {{parallel to the}} blood circulatory system to provide a secondary circulation that transports excess interstitial fluid, proteins and metabolic waste products from the systemic tissues back into the blood. The efficient removal of soluble proteins from the interstitial fluid {{is critical to the}} regulation of both colloidal osmotic pressure and homeostatic regulation of the body's fluid volume. The importance of lymphatic flow is especially evident when the lymphatic system becomes obstructed. [...] In lymphatic associated diseases such as <b>elephantiasis</b> (where parasites occupying the lymphatic vessels block the flow of lymph), the impact of such an obstruction can be dramatic. The resulting chronic edema is due to the breakdown of lymphatic clearance and the accumulation of interstitial solutes. [...] In 2015, the presence of a meningeal lymphatic system was first identified by two independent studies by Louveau et al. and Aspelund et al..|$|E
2500|$|Biologist Olivia Judson has {{advocated}} the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying mosquito species. In a September 25, 2003 New York Times article, she advocated [...] "specicide" [...] of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create recessive [...] "knockout genes". She {{says that the}} Anopheles mosquitoes (which spread malaria) and Aedes mosquitoes (which spread dengue fever, yellow fever, <b>elephantiasis,</b> and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, {{at a cost of}} reducing the genetic diversity of the family Culicidae by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct [...] "all the time" [...] the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem: [...] "We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other species—but different need not mean worse." [...] In addition, anti-malarial and mosquito control programs offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in developing nations who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: [...] "We should consider the ultimate swatting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pellagra {{was first}} {{described}} for its dermatological effect in Spain in 1735 by Gaspar Casal. He {{explained that the}} disease causes dermatitis in exposed skin areas such as hands, feet and neck and that {{the origin of the}} disease is poor diet and atmospheric influences. His work published in 1762 by his friend Juan Sevillano was titled ‘Historia Natural y Medicina del Principado de Asturias’ or Natural and Medical History of the Principality of Asturias (1762). This led to the disease being known as [...] "Asturian leprosy", and it is recognized as the first modern pathological description of a syndrome. It was an endemic disease in northern Italy, where it was named pelle agra (pelle = skin; agra = rough) by Francesco Frapolli of Milan. With pellagra affecting over 100,000 people in Italy by the 1880s, debates raged as to how to classify the disease (as a form of scurvy, <b>elephantiasis</b> or as something new), and over its causation. In the 19th century Roussel started a campaign in France to restrict consumption of maize and eradicated the disease in France, but it remained endemic in many rural areas of Europe. Because pellagra outbreaks occurred in regions where maize was a dominant food crop, the most convincing hypothesis during the late nineteenth century, as espoused by Cesare Lombroso, was that the maize either carried a toxic substance or was a carrier of disease. Louis Sambon, an Anglo-Italian doctor working at the London School of Tropical Medicine, was convinced that pellagra was carried by an insect, along the lines of malaria. Later, the lack of pellagra outbreaks in Mesoamerica, where maize is a major food crop, led researchers to investigate processing techniques in that region.|$|E

60|$|No {{one seems}} really {{to know the}} cause of the South Sea <b>elephantiasis.</b> One theory is that it is caused by the {{drinking}} of polluted water. Another theory attributes it to inoculation through mosquito bites. A third theory charges it to predisposition plus the process of acclimatization. On the other hand, no one that stands in finicky dread of it and similar diseases can afford to travel in the South Seas. There will be occasions when such a one must drink water. There may be also occasions when the mosquitoes let up biting. But every precaution of the finicky one will be useless. If he runs barefoot across the beach to have a swim, he will tread where an <b>elephantiasis</b> case trod a few minutes before. If he closets himself in his own house, yet every bit of fresh food on his table will have been subjected to the contamination, be it flesh, fish, fowl, or vegetable. In the public market at Papeete two known lepers run stalls, and heaven alone knows through what channels arrive at that market the daily supplies of fish, fruit, meat, and vegetables. The only happy way to go through the South Seas is with a careless poise, without apprehension, and with a Christian Science-like faith in the resplendent fortune of your own particular star. When you see a woman, afflicted with <b>elephantiasis</b> wringing out cream from cocoanut meat with her naked hands, drink and reflect how good is the cream, forgetting the hands that pressed it out. Also, remember that diseases such as <b>elephantiasis</b> and leprosy {{do not seem to be}} caught by contact.|$|E
60|$|As I {{remember}} him, he was {{a rather}} large man with <b>elephantiasis</b> of the temper. I distinctly recalled one occasion when I was spending a school vacation at his home, and he found me trying to shave old Duggie, then a kid of fourteen, with his razor.|$|E

60|$|The boy, {{still fresh}} {{from the loss of}} his natural protector, kept a wary eye on the house as he approached. Then all {{expression}} died out of his face, and he passed the gate, blankly ignoring the small girl who was leaning over it and apparently suffering from <b>elephantiasis</b> of the tongue. He went by quietly, and Miss Nugent, raging inwardly that she had misbehaved to no purpose, withdrew her tongue for more legitimate uses.|$|E
6000|$|He was conscious, {{as was his}} custom in her presence, of a warm, prickly {{sensation}} in the small of the back.

60|$|I {{should have}} to {{stipulate}} that the Spanish people wash more and endeavour {{to get along with}} less quarantine. Do you know, Spain keeps her ports fast locked against foreign traffic three-fourths of each year, because one day she is scared about the cholera, and the next about the plague, and next the measles, next the hooping cough, the hives, and the rash? but she does not mind leonine leprosy and <b>elephantiasis</b> any more than a great and enlightened civilisation minds freckles. Soap would soon remove her anxious distress about foreign distempers. The reason arable land is so scarce in Spain is because the people squander so much of it on their persons, and then when they die it is improvidently buried with them.|$|E
60|$|And now {{all this}} {{strength}} and beauty has departed, and {{the valley of}} Typee is the abode of some dozen wretched creatures, afflicted by leprosy, <b>elephantiasis,</b> and tuberculosis. Melville estimated the population at two thousand, not taking into consideration the small adjoining valley of Ho-o-u-mi. Life has rotted away in this wonderful garden spot, where the climate is as delightful and healthful as any {{to be found in}} the world. Not alone were the Typeans physically magnificent; they were pure. Their air did not contain the bacilli and germs and microbes of disease that fill our own air. And when the white men imported in their ships these various micro-organisms or disease, the Typeans crumpled up and went down before them.|$|E

There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.|$|E
60|$|We {{went down}} a zigzag trail under overarching, matted jungle, where great {{butterflies}} drifted {{by in the}} silence. No tattooed savage with club and javelin guarded the path; and when we forded the stream, we were free to roam where we pleased. No longer did the taboo, sacred and merciless, reign in that sweet vale. Nay, the taboo still did reign, a new taboo, for when we approached too near the several wretched native women, the taboo was uttered warningly. And it was well. They were lepers. The man who warned us was afflicted horribly with <b>elephantiasis.</b> All were suffering from lung trouble. The valley of Typee was the abode of death, and the dozen survivors of the tribe were gasping feebly the last painful breaths of the race.|$|E
60|$|Archie found Reggie van Tuyl {{brooding}} in {{a window}} of his club that looked over Fifth Avenue. Reggie was a rather melancholy young man who suffered from <b>elephantiasis</b> of the bank-roll and the other evils that arise from that complaint. Gentle and sentimental by nature, his sensibilities had been much wounded by contact with a sordid world; {{and the thing that}} had first endeared Archie to him {{was the fact that the}} latter, though chronically hard-up, had never made any attempt to borrow money from him. Reggie would have parted with it on demand, but it had delighted him to find that Archie seemed to take a pleasure in his society without having any ulterior motives. He was fond of Archie, and also of Lucille; and their happy marriage was a constant source of gratification to him.|$|E
60|$|At 3 p.m., the {{temperature}} was 54 degrees, and the air deliciously cool and pleasant. I tried to reach the western peak (perhaps 300 feet above the saddle), by keeping along the ridge, but was cut off by precipices, and ere I could retrace my steps {{it was time to}} descend. This I was glad to do in a doolie, and I was carried to the bottom, with only one short rest, in an hour and three quarters. The descent was very steep the whole way, partly down steps of sharp rock, where one of the men cut his foot severely. The pathway at the bottom was lined for nearly {{a quarter of a mile}} with sick, halt, maimed, lame, and blind beggars, awaiting our descent. It was truly a fearful sight, especially the lepers, and numerous unhappy victims to <b>elephantiasis.</b>|$|E
60|$|High up the Rewa, at {{the village}} of a chief, Mongondro by name, John Starhurst rested {{at the end of}} the second day of the journey. In the morning, {{attended}} by Narau, he expected to start on foot for the smoky mountains that were now green and velvety with nearness. Mongondro was a sweet-tempered, mild-mannered little old chief, short-sighted and afflicted with <b>elephantiasis,</b> and no longer inclined toward the turbulence of war. He received the missionary with warm hospitality, gave him food from his own table, and even discussed religious matters with him. Mongondro was of an inquiring bent of mind, and pleased John Starhurst greatly by asking him to account for the existence and beginning of things. When the missionary had finished his summary of the Creation according to Genesis, he saw that Mongondro was deeply affected. The little old chief smoked silently for some time. Then he took the pipe from his mouth and shook his head sadly.|$|E
60|$|We sat on {{the cool}} porch, on Bihaura's best mats while dinner was preparing, {{and at the same}} time met the villagers. In twos and threes and groups they strayed along, shaking hands and uttering the Tahitian word of greeting--Ioarana, {{pronounced}} yo-rah-nah. The men, big strapping fellows, were in loin-cloths, with here and there no shirt, while the women wore the universal ahu, a sort of adult pinafore that flows in graceful lines from the shoulders to the ground. Sad to see was the <b>elephantiasis</b> that afflicted some of them. Here would be a comely woman of magnificent proportions, with the port of a queen, yet marred by one arm four times--or a dozen times--the size of the other. Beside her might stand a six-foot man, erect, mighty-muscled, bronzed, with the body of a god, yet with feet and calves so swollen that they ran together, forming legs, shapeless, monstrous, that were for all the world like elephant legs.|$|E
6000|$|But {{surely this}} point of view is the very {{converse}} of the teachings of common sense. [...] "Consumption goods" [...] are the very things that we do want. All else is but a means to them. One admits, as per exception, the queer acquisitiveness of the miser-millionaire, playing the game for his own sake. Undoubtedly he exists. Undoubtedly his existence {{is a product of the}} system, a pathological product, a kind of <b>elephantiasis</b> of individualism. But speaking broadly, consumption goods, present or future, are the end in sight of the industrial struggle. Give me the houses and the gardens, the yachts, the motor cars and the champagne and I do not care who owns the gravel crusher and the steam plow. And if under a socialist commonwealth a man can vote to himself or gain by the votes of his adherents, a vast income of consumption goods and leave to his unhappy fellow a narrow minimum of subsistence, then the resulting evil of inequality is worse, far worse than it could even be to-day.|$|E
6000|$|While {{on the way}} to {{the cutter}} we met the only white man on Tahaa, and of all men, George Lufkin, a native of New England! Eighty-six years of age he was, sixty-odd of which, he said, he had spent in the Society Islands, with {{occasional}} absences, such as the gold rush to Eldorado in 'forty-nine and a short period of ranching in California near Tulare. Given no more than three months by the doctors to live, he had returned to his South Seas and lived to eighty-six and to chuckle over the doctors aforesaid, who were all in their graves. Fee-fee he had, which is the native for <b>elephantiasis</b> and which is pronounced fay-fay. A quarter of a century before, the disease had fastened upon him, and it would remain with him until he died. We asked him about kith and kin. Beside him sat a sprightly damsel of sixty, his daughter. [...] "She is all I have," [...] he murmured plaintively, [...] "and she has no children living." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{we came to}} Ponta do Sol, {{the only}} {{remarkable}} site on the trip, famous for bodice-making and infamous for <b>elephantiasis.</b> Here a huge column of curiously contorted basalt has been connected by a solid high-arched causeway with the cliff, which is equally remarkable, showing a central boss of stone with lines radiating quaquaversally. There are outer steps and an inner flight leading under a blind archway, the latter supplied with a crane. The landing in the levadia, or surf, is abominable and a life-boat waits accidents outside. It works with the heavy Madeiran oars, square near the grip and provided with a board into whose hole the pin fits. The townlet, capital of the 'comarca,' fronted by its little Alameda and a strip of beach upon which I should prefer to debark, shows a tall factory-chimney, noting the sugar-works of Wilhabram Bros. There is a still larger establishment at the Serra d'Agoa in the Arco [Footnote: Arco (bow, arch) is locally applied to a ridge or to the district bounded by it.] da Calheta (Arch of the Creeklet), a property of the Visconde de Calçada. The guide-books mention iron pyrites and specular iron in small quantities behind Ponta do Sol.|$|E
6000|$|This {{part of the}} {{negotiations}} ended with presenting some [...] "satin stripe" [...] and rum to the Nchinu and Manbuku Prata, and with shaking hands--a dangerous operation. The people are cleanly; they wash when rising, and before as well as after every meal; they are always bathing, yet from prince to pauper, from baby to grey beard, they are affected with a psora known by its Portuguese name, [...] "sarnas." [...] The Congo [...] "fiddle" [...] appears first between the articulations of the fingers, and bleaches the hands and wrists {{as if it were}} leprosy. Yet I did not see a single case of true lepra Arabum, or its modifications, the huge Barbadoes leg (<b>elephantiasis),</b> and the sarcoma scrotale and sarcocele of Zanzibar and East Africa. From the extremities the gale extends over the body, especially the shins, and the people, who appear in the perpetual practice of scalpturigo, attribute it to the immoderate use of palm wine. I observed, however, that Europeans, in the river, who avoid the liquor, are hardly ever free from this foul blood-poison, and a jar of sulphur mixture is a common article upon the table. Hydrocele is not unfrequent, but hardly so general as in the Eastern Island; one manner of white man, a half caste from Macáo, was suffering with serpigo, and boasted of it.|$|E
