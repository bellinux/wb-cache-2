500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. <b>It</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E
500|$|An {{enthusiastic}} review {{came from}} The Wire, which felt that: [...] "In the end, Vespertine commits its magic by daring to go places more obvious and more human than {{one would have}} ever expected." [...] Calling it [...] "one {{of the most impressive}} and cohesive" [...] albums of the year, Tiny Mix Tapes found Vespertine to be Björk's most effective use of the studio as an instrument. Simon Reynolds, praised it in Uncut saying [...] "Her best yet, <b>it</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jackfrost wonderland of Cocteau Twins circa In The Gold Dust Rush, of the bejewelled coldness of Siouxsie and the Banshees circa A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The glittering sound fits the album's idea of inner riches, the treasure people keep hidden inside." [...] Katy Widder, writer for PopMatters, believed the album was a masterpiece, stating that it challenged the predominant theories of rock music and gender, particularly a statement made by Simon Reynolds and Joy Press in the acclaimed book, The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll: [...] "Women have seized rock 'n' roll and usurped it for their own expressive purposes, but we've yet to see a radical feminization of rock itself." [...] Chris Smith of Stylus Magazine praised the album for its nuance and delicacy, describing its sonic palette as [...] "a breath of fresh air." [...] Noting that Vespertine showed a more mature side of the singer, musicOMH's Michael Hubbard wrote that [...] "It sounds like Björk has grown up while that would be a pity, it is also fascinating for anyone who loves her music. She is a legend in her time." ...|$|E

I can drop in anywhere in his works, read a few pages, and go, Oh yeah, language. It's almost like if you were tuning a guitar and you heard a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that's what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear. <b>It</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difference between an OK sentence and a really masterful sentence. Babel does it for me." ...|$|E
