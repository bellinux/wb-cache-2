Site wind speeds have been measured, together with the <b>foundation</b> <b>loads</b> {{at the base of}} each of the four legs. The results show good correlation between the wind speeds and leg strains (loads) for a given wind direction, as expected for wind speeds in excess of 10 m/s. Comparisons between the measured strains and those determined from the UK Code of Practice for lattice towers (BS 8100), for the same wind speed and direction show that the Code over-estimates most of the measured <b>foundation</b> <b>loads</b> by a moderate amount of about 14 % at the higher wind speeds.

30|$|This paper {{discussed}} the liquefaction-induced {{damage to buildings}} {{that occurred during the}} Meinong earthquake. From site investigations, we determined that the formations of the liquefied sites always exhibit a very soft clay layer below the saturated sandy soils. The <b>foundation</b> <b>load</b> is mainly supported by the sandy soils and a preshear (deviatoric) stress existing in the foundation soil of the footing before earthquake. The soil is easier to reach the failure state due to the additional shear force and the generation of the excess pore water pressure triggered by the earthquake excitation and cause large settlement and deformation. During the shaking of the earthquake, the excess pore water pressure is generated and decreased the strength of the saturated sandy soils. When the softened sandy soils beneath the spread foundation cannot bear the deviatoric stress induced by the loading of the surface building as well as the additional shear force due to the seismic <b>loading,</b> the <b>foundation</b> bearing layer will be squeezed out laterally and upward. Then, the <b>foundation</b> <b>load</b> is transferred to the soft clay beneath the saturated sandy soils, which induces more settlement of the building. Note that if the weight of the surface building is uneven like the case shown in Fig.  4, the differential settlement can be observed in case of the foundation bearing layer being liquefied during earthquakes.|$|R

40|$|The {{calculation}} of stresses induced inside the soil mass by the <b>foundation</b> <b>loads</b> forms an essential step {{in most of}} the geotechnical engineering problems dealing with the probable behaviour of foundations. The distribution of stresses on horizontal planes containing reinforcements at various depths is required in the analysis and design of reinforced soil foundations. An accurate evaluation of contact pressure distribution at the interface is a prerequisite for the computation of stresses inside the soil mass. Of the several approaches the elastic-plastic approach of computing the contact pressure distribution appears to be reasonable. Using this approach non-dimensional equations have been derived for calculating the contact pressure distribution beneath rigid circular foundations on sands. The contact pressure distribution so derived has been used for computing the stresses at various points using elastic theory. The results have been graphically presented and are compared with Boussinesq's distribution for uniform contact pressure. ...|$|E

The {{aim of the research}} is to investigate and segregate the three settlement stages of a raft and an isolated foundation, supported by soft clay improved by granular columns. For convenience, the programme of work is divided into two parts, in which : Part 1 examines the long term settlement performance of a smooth, rigid raft underlain by soft clay without granular columns, and with granular columns, under single and multiple configurations, at an area replacement ratio, As of 15 %; and Part 2 examines the long term settlement performance of an isolated footing underlain by soft clay without granular column and with a single granular column at an As of 33 %. The results obtained from Part 1 (raft <b>foundation</b> <b>loading)</b> of the experimental investigations challenge the effectiveness of granular columns to control foundation settlement over a prolonged period, when installed in soft clay under a range of loadings.

However, the value of the pressure along the dam is often hard to measure due to the limited number of piezometers available (Bernstone et al., 2009). Furthermore, uplift pressure can oscillate substantially in a single hole both with time and also spatially under the dam due to the combination of rock mass characteristics in the <b>foundation,</b> <b>loads</b> and temperature variations.
