5|$|In The Ethnostate, Robertson {{declares}} polyethnicity as an <b>ideal</b> <b>that</b> only lessens each culture. He believes that, {{within a}} polyethnic culture, the nation or {{region as a}} whole is less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make it up. Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture.|$|E

He embraced {{equality}} between Indians and criollos, an <b>ideal</b> <b>that</b> was ignored during the future processes of independence. He also favored women's rights but did not really develop these ideas. He had an advanced understanding of science, considering {{the circumstances in which}} he lived. He never traveled abroad but nonetheless understood the relation between microorganisms and the spreading of disease.|$|E

25|$|He goes on {{to criticize}} women's social {{activity}} {{in public and private}} venues in Paris and Geneva, suggesting women produce the only gossip, and the moral decay of men, women and children. He states that though men have their vices, like drinking, they are far less harmful to society than women's vices. He argues that the presence and authority of women in public spaces corrupts the male youth, turning them effeminate and void of patriotic passion. Once again, the morality of Ancient Rome and Greece is frequently referenced as an <b>ideal</b> <b>that</b> should be aspired to.|$|E
25|$|Many of Kierkegaard's earlier {{writings}} from 1843 to 1846 {{were written}} pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous The Point of View of My Work as an Author, {{he explained that}} the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is Anti-Climacus, a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of The Point of View: Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so <b>ideal</b> <b>that</b> Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.|$|E
