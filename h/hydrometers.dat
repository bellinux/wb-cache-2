Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant {{by the end of}} the 19th century.

40|$|Abstract: The {{particle}} size distribution of soils, including clay content is of utmost importance {{in the field of}} Geotechnical Engineering. The <b>hydrometer</b> analysis is the most widely used technique for analyzing the {{particle size}} distribution of the fine grained fraction of soil. The various <b>hydrometer</b> test methods (internationally) generally vary mainly {{in the use of the}} prescribed dispersing agent. In addition, certain methods vary with the use of the prescribed <b>hydrometer.</b> The purpose of this study was to establish the optimum concentration and volume of the three dispersing agents (calgon, sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate and sodium tetra pyrophosphate) using the ASTM <b>Hydrometer</b> 152 H: E 100 (instead of the Bouyoucos <b>hydrometer</b> 152 H) for three soil classes, selected for their varying activity. The results indicated that the ASTM <b>hydrometer</b> 152 H: E 100 generally yielded lower results than <b>hydrometer</b> 152 H in terms of percentage fines, with the differences varying from 38 % to - 65 % for all the soils and the dispersing agents...|$|R

60|$|At length {{it would}} seem that the interests, not of the fishes only, but of the men of Wayland, of Sudbury, of Concord, demand the {{levelling}} of that dam. Innumerable acres of meadow are waiting to be made dry land, wild native grass to give place to English. The farmers stand with scythes whet, waiting the subsiding of the waters, by gravitation, by evaporation or otherwise, but sometimes their eyes do not rest, their wheels do not roll, on the quaking meadow ground during the haying season at all. So many sources of wealth inaccessible. They rate the loss hereby incurred in the single town of Wayland alone as equal to the expense of keeping a hundred yoke of oxen the year round. One year, as I learn, not long ago, the farmers standing ready to drive their teams afield as usual, the water gave no signs of falling; without new attraction in the heavens, without freshet or visible cause, still standing stagnant at an unprecedented height. All <b>hydrometers</b> were at fault; some trembled for their English even. But speedy emissaries revealed the unnatural secret, in the new float-board, wholly a foot in width, added to their already too high privileges by the dam proprietors. The hundred yoke of oxen, meanwhile, standing patient, gazing wishfully meadowward, at that inaccessible waving native grass, uncut but by the great mower Time, who cuts so broad a swathe, without so much as a wisp to wind about their horns.|$|E

50|$|The Fahrenheit <b>hydrometer</b> is a constant-volume {{device that}} will float in water. In the figure shown here, the <b>hydrometer</b> is {{floating}} vertically in a cylinder containing a liquid. At {{the bottom of}} the <b>hydrometer</b> is a weighted bulb and at the top is a pan for small weights. To use the <b>hydrometer,</b> one first accurately determines its weight (W) while it is dry. Next, the device is placed in water, and a weight (w) sufficient to sink a marked point on the rod to the water-line is placed on the pan. At that point, the weight of water displaced by the instrument equals W + w. The <b>hydrometer</b> is then removed, wiped dry, and placed in the liquid whose density is to be determined. A weight (x) sufficient to sink the <b>hydrometer</b> to the same marked point is placed in the pan. The density (D) of the second liquid is then given by D = (W + x) / (W + w).|$|R
5000|$|The {{elevator}} paradox {{relates to}} a <b>hydrometer</b> placed on an [...] "elevator" [...] or vertical conveyor that, by moving to different elevations, changes the atmospheric pressure. In this classic demonstration, the floating <b>hydrometer</b> remains at an [...] equilibrium position. Essentially, a <b>hydrometer</b> measures specific gravity of liquids independent of barometric pressure. This {{is because the}} change in air pressure {{is applied to the}} entire <b>hydrometer</b> flask. The submerged portion of the flask receives a transmitted force through the liquid, thus no portion of the apparatus receives a net force resulting from a change in air pressure.|$|R
25|$|The {{classification}} of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand, is determined primarily by their Atterberg limits, not by their grain size. If {{it is important}} to determine the grain size distribution of fine-grained soils, the <b>hydrometer</b> test may be performed. In the <b>hydrometer</b> tests, the soil particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a glass cylinder, and then the cylinder is left to sit. A <b>hydrometer</b> is used to measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. Clay particles may take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the <b>hydrometer.</b> Sand particles may take less than a second. Stoke's law provides the theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the <b>Hydrometer</b> test.|$|R

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} sieving {{method is}} a new and useful tool for grainsize analysis of fine-grained muddy sediments. The new method was compared with the traditional <b>hydrometer</b> method. The ultrasonic sieving method shows a little wide variation. Ultrasonic vibration {{is often used to}} disperse the sample before the <b>hydrometer</b> analysis. It decreasea the grainsize of muddy sediments, but the sediments attains a "terminal distribution" in grain size after about 30 minutes of vibration. The weigted mean of the analysis by ultrasonic sieving method is smaller than the analysis of unvibrated sample by the <b>hydrometer</b> method, and is concordant with the analysis of sample in terminal distribution by the <b>hydrometer</b> method. ...|$|R
