25|$|In {{the field}} of {{verification}} and design of timed and <b>hybrid</b> <b>systems,</b> the system behaviour is called Zeno if it includes {{an infinite number of}} discrete steps in a finite amount of time.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a {{technique}} to extend the simulation of a Zeno <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> beyond its Zeno time point. A Zeno <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> model is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> with an execution that takes an infinite number of discrete transitions during a finite time interval. We argue that the presence of Zeno behavior indicates that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> model is incomplete by considering some classical Zeno models that incompletely describe the dynamics of the system being modeled. This motivates the systematic development of a method for completing <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> models through the introduction of new post-Zeno states, where the completed <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> transitions to these post-Zeno states at the Zeno time point. In practice, simulating a Zeno <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> is challenging in that simulation effectively halts near the Zeno time point. Moreover, due to unavoidable numerical errors, it is not practical to exactly simulate a Zeno <b>hybrid</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, we propose a method for constructing approximations of Zeno models by leveraging the completed <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> model. Using these approximation, we can simulate a Zeno <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> model beyond its Zeno point and reveal the complete dynamics of the system being modeled. ...|$|R
