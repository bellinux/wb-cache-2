40|$|Satellite-based {{estimates}} of primary productivity by size classes, {{and a more}} complete food web relative to earlier approaches, were used to estimate marine ecosystem productivity. Including microbial, benthic, and microplankton components of production resulted in an overall <b>fishery</b> <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> of 180 million metric tonnes and an additional 50 million metric tonnes of benthos. Great caution is needed in interpreting these figures as exploitable biomass. Increased exploitation of large components of this production such as mesopelagic fishes or benthic organisms {{is likely to have}} serious ecosystem wide negative consequences and other problems. The <b>fishery</b> <b>production</b> <b>potential</b> estimates can be used in concert with observed catch data to estimate ecosystem exploitation rates for major ecosystem components including benthos, benthivores, planktivores, and piscivores. Ecosystem exploitation rates for the benthos are uniformly low, reflecting the generally low level of landings reported relative to other ecosystem components. Benthivores and planktivores exhibit generally low to moderate ecosystem exploitation rates, typically < 20 %. Relatively high exploitation rates were observed for piscivores, in some cases, exceeding the estimated level of available production. JRC. D. 2 -Water and Marine Resource...|$|E

Nowadays, trophic levels are used in order to develop ecosystem based fisheries management strategies. For this purpose, diet composition of the {{round sardinella}} was investigated. Samples were obtained from commercial fishermen, who generally use purse seine and gill nets in Izmir Bay concerned during October 2010 - September 2011. A total of 434 S. aurita were collected all year round, with total lengths ranging 12. 1 to 27. 1 cm. Fish were dissected immediately after capture, stomachs removed and stored in formalin (10 %) until the contents were analysed. Stomach contents examined using a SZX 7 Olympus stereo microscope. Prey items were identified to the lowest possible taxon. Forty eight species were identified, belonging to six major groups: Polychaeta, Crustacea, Mollusca, Chaetognatha, Tunicate and Teleostei. Finally crustaceans were the most important food item in terms of index of relative importance. At least 31 copepod species were identified, where Calanoida, Oithona nana, Oncaea media and Oithona plumifera appeared all year round with %IRI ≥ 10.

It shoreline is approximately 560 km long {{with an estimated}} 4, 837. 8 km 2 of wetlands and some 500, 000 ha of mangrove swamps that fringe the coastline. However, not much of these available natural resources has been put to judicious use. The fisheries sector contributes about 9. 4 % to the GDP in Sierra Leone. The Inland Freshwater Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector is small and poorly developed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{tradeoffs}} between floodplain agriculture and <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> in the Brahmaputra river basin of Bangladesh, where both sectors are simultaneously affected by floodplain development policies. Current policies primarily include structural {{changes in the}} floodplain {{in the form of}} flood control, drainage and irrigation projects. Such development programs typically ignore the effects on floodplain fisheries, which is an important natural resource sector and a source of subsistence for the rural poor. This paper develops a floodplain land-use model, where net returns to agriculture and fisheries are jointly maximized. Special attention is paid to the tradeoffs between agriculture and <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> and the dynamics of the fishery. The model accounts explicitly for the effect of floodplain area on <b>fisheries</b> <b>production.</b> Productivity {{is a function of the}} flood land type, which is based on the average monthly depth of flooding. Numerical results from solving a simple version of the model are presented. These early results show that a combination of agriculture and <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> in the floodplain provides higher returns than agriculture production alone. This has implications for floodplain management policies, which to date have the stated goal of increasing agricultural productivity only. The effects of floodplain development policies on both agriculture and fisheries need to be studied in further detail to understand the long-term implications of such policies...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater flow profoundly {{influences}} <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> in estuarine {{and coastal}} systems. Although connections between freshwater flow and <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> are well established, underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Investigating relationships between freshwater flow and <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> {{is essential to}} ensure that the interests of commercial fishers are represented in debates over environmental flows. This thesis examines the impacts of freshwater flow on the production and profitability of estuarine and coastal fisheries. Chapter 1 outlines relationships between freshwater flow and <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> in estuarine and coastal systems. Chapter 2 presents a literature review which indicates that freshwater flow influences <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> by regulating habitat availability, trophic interactions and fishers&# 146; harvesting behaviour. Chapter 3 examines relationships between hydrological variation and the commercial catch rates of five estuarine-associated fish species from nine estuaries in New South Wales (NSW), eastern Australia. Freshwater enhancement of <b>fisheries</b> <b>production</b> was evident, with increased catch rates in months with higher flow. Freshwater flow per se, however, was not as important in influencing catch rates as episodic flow events. Chapter 4 explores the impacts of episodic flow events on estuarine and coastal fisheries by examining multivariate patterns in landings, effort and revenue between periods of flood and drought. Results indicate that flood and drought events influence the bio-economic productivity of commercial fisheries by modifying landings composition, fishers&# 146; harvesting behaviour and revenue generation. Chapter 5 presents a multi-species, multi-method bio-economic analysis that was used to evaluate the economic performance of fishers&# 146; harvesting strategies between non-drought and drought conditions. Projections from the model indicate that droughts redistribute revenue and profit among fishing methods, modifying the economic performance of commercial fisheries. Although diversified harvesting behaviour increased revenue generation, this marginal economic benefit was compromised by higher costs which lowered profitability. Results indicate that the commercial fishing sector is a drought-affected industry in coastal NSW. Chapter 6 summarises the findings of the research presented in this thesis and suggests directions for future work. The research described here provides empirical evidence that freshwater flow regulates the availability of fisheries resources, fishers&# 146; harvesting behaviour and the economic performance of commercial fisheries in estuarine and coastal systems...|$|R
