2500|$|In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, set 1,000 Narnian {{years after}} the events of The Magician's Nephew, Jadis has usurped power over Narnia after the tree that kept her at bay had died. Now known as the White Witch, she is served by various races {{including}} Wolves (who make up her secret police), Black Dwarves, Giants, Werewolves, Tree Spirits that are on her side, Ghouls, Boggles, Ogres, Minotaurs, Cruels, Hags, Spectres, People of the Toadstools, Incubi, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Orknies, Sprites, Wooses, Ettins, Poisonous Plant Spirits, Evil Apes, Giant Bats, Vultures, and creatures that according to C. S. Lewis are [...] "so horrible that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you, your parents probably wouldn't let you read this book." [...] Her magic is now powerful, and she has acquired a wand with which she can turn enemies to stone if they displease or attempt to challenge her in any way.|$|E
2500|$|Some years later, at the Leveson Inquiry in February 2012, Dacre {{rejected}} {{the idea that he}} imposes his will on the paper. He commented that some issues contain opinions which [...] "make my hair go white" [...] and asserted that some journalists [...] "would resign <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> them what to write". He once suggested in general terms to a new employee, sports' columnist Des Kelly, the best way to write for readers: [...] "Make them laugh, make them cry, or make them angry". Peter Preston noted: [...] "He can hire leading voices from the Guardian or the Observer and let them say exactly what they'd have said in their old homes." [...] James Chapman, in an interview with GQ magazine defending Dacre, pointed to his newspaper's campaign to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and opposition to Kenneth Clarke's proposal for secret courts. The astrologer Jonathan Cainer was first taken on for a Mail horoscope column in December 1992. Given to an unconventional dress code Dacre found objectionable, his contract had a clause insisting he wore a suit. Cainer, who spent the bulk of his career at the Mail although he [...] "never once agreed with an editorial they have published", was the highest paid journalist of his era.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have given}} it all up," [...] she whispered, [...] "for you! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> the truth, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> them that you knew, it would have meant death! You must forget, you must swear to forget." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Terrible. But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told,</b> {{it would}} have spoiled the whole morning for you; you couldn't have thought of {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
50|$|The song {{starts with}} a guitar strumming, the riff and an organ and then Barry starts to sing the line Come a bit close to me, let me be kissed, Come on and give to me what I have missed, I love you women, I know that I'll get you somehow. And then Robin and Maurice sing harmony on the chorus: You wouldn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>told</b> you so, You wouldn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>told</b> you so, oh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{she went}} on, a little drearily, [...] "that even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you upon my honour, of my certain knowledge, that the due {{delivery}} of that packet might {{save the lives}} of thousands of your countrymen, might save hearts from breaking, homes from becoming destitute--even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you all this, would it help me in my prayer?" ...|$|E
60|$|CONJURER. Because {{all this}} would not avail. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you the lie I told Morris Carleon about how I did that trick....|$|E
6000|$|... "'But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> the {{officers}} who I was, wouldn't that make a difference?' says she. 'Wouldn't they go down an' open the bank?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{that was}} the end of my adventure, Mr. Holmes. I do not know where I was, nor whom I spoke with, nor {{anything}} save what <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> you. But <b>I</b> know that there is foul play going on, and I want to help that unhappy man <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> the whole story to Mr. Mycroft Holmes next morning, and subsequently to the police." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost thirty years. I shipped as {{cabin boy}} on a South America brig when I was fifteen. I'd be at it yet <b>if,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you, Betty hadn't {{anchored}} me ashore." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS P.--It {{is for me}} to ask pardon for hiding {{what you}} know now: but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> you--you--you never would have taken me into your house--your wife never would.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] she began, as {{they turned}} {{out of the white}} gates, [...] "whether you would mind very much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you something?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Eliz. But was she holy?--Died she in the Lord? Isen [weeps]. O God! my child! And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> thee all, How couldst thou mend it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘I {{thought that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her everything,’ Davidson {{explained}} to me, ‘she {{would never have}} a moment’s peace while I was away on my trips.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{he was at}} school. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> {{him that}} he and I would stand by each other--but he looked so foolish, and began to cry! I am sorry now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said I {{never saw}} him in the house," [...] said Rose with a shudder; [...] "but they said <b>if</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>told</b> they would give me to the lions in the Zoological Gardens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't you {{see that}} if you didn't let me know he was here it would look to him as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't wish to meet him--as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> you {{that you were not}} to {{introduce}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so I told her," [...] {{added the}} fat young lady--or the lean one grown stouter, [...] "a dozen times <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her once. But there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never knew, but {{suspect it}} was {{something}} against the laws of his country. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> my story properly, you would understand that both were buccaneers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} say, Harry, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you that I had murdered Basil?" [...] said the younger man. He watched him intently {{after he had}} spoken.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was foolish}} {{of me to}} {{withhold}} it--foolish and inconsequent. Yet <b>I</b> believe that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> you <b>I</b> {{should not have been}} here now. So, after all, I have no regrets.|$|R
60|$|I looked {{round at}} the little room, scantily furnished, with a sofa-bed at one side. Then I thought of the great, bare house, and the {{sinister}} door with the discoloured red seal upon it. There was something queer and grotesque in the situation, which made me long {{to know a little}} more. Perhaps <b>I</b> should, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> waited. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him that <b>I</b> should be very happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever {{they might}} do," [...] he replied, a little wearily, [...] "I must obey orders. My orders are to remain here, but even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were <b>told</b> that <b>I</b> might go, I should find it hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{you mention}} 'the case' everywhere," [...] said I, [...] "perhaps {{you would not}} be {{offended}} with me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you I should like to hear it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} say, Dick Gale, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you that you're {{the one man}} I'd rather have had come along than any other at this crisis of my life?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’It’s no good, I tell you,’ ses the carpenter, ’it’s {{the most}} lasting black I know. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{you how much}} that stuff is a can, you wouldn’t believe me.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{you already}} that I went to Aldborough {{to try and}} find a clew to your whereabouts? I can't be at the trouble of looking back to see; so, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> you, <b>I</b> tell you again. The truth is, I made an {{acquaintance}} at Aldborough of whom you know something--at least by report.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what variety {{would you}} pick out, I'd like to know?" [...] said Jone, {{just a little}} red in the face, and looking as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> him he didn't know timothy hay from oat straw.|$|R
5000|$|JP [...] "Well, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>told</b> {{you it was}} happening, {{the fact}} that we supply highly {{effective}} equipment to a regime like that is not a consideration, as far as you're concerned. It's not a personal consideration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True to myself," [...] {{repeated}} Nostromo. [...] "How do {{you know}} that I would not be true to myself <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you to go to the devil with your propositions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Louise laughed joyously. [...] "Well, you wouldn't {{understand}} what a triumph it was <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you. I suppose, papa, you've no idea how Philistine you are. But you're nothing to mamma!" ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Everybody {{would call}} me a brute <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Ann the truth about herself {{in terms of her}} own moral code. To begin with, Ann says things that are not {{strictly}} true.|$|E
6000|$|... "George wasn't effusive; he was {{the kind}} of man you like better the longer you know him. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> were <b>told</b> that he ever did a mean thing, I wouldn't believe it. His last action--sending the others on--was characteristic." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{put that}} {{extraordinary}} question {{without the slightest}} change in her voice, her face, or her manner. She could not have appeared more perfectly unconcerned <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> her {{of the death of}} the goat in the enclosure outside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I didn’t want {{to spoil}} a bargain," [...] said the seaman carelessly. [...] "Maybe, you wouldn’t have bought the stone <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> you. Mind that thing don’t go off; I don’t want to rob you. Point {{it the other}} way." ...|$|R
