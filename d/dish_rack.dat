Already as a student, he designed a <b>dish</b> <b>rack</b> {{which consisted of}} plastic coated metal wires. <b>Dish</b> <b>rack,</b> which was named elfa (not {{to be confused with}} electronics company ELFA), became very popular and was then starting {{when he and his wife}} created the famous String shelf.|$|E
50|$|Hand dishwashing {{detergents}} utilize surfactants to {{play the}} primary role in cleaning. The reduced surface tension of dishwashing water, and increasing solubility of modern surfactant mixtures, allows the water to run off the dishes in a <b>dish</b> <b>rack</b> very quickly. However, most people also rinse the dishes with pure water to make sure {{to get rid of}} any soap residue that could affect the taste of the food.|$|E
50|$|European {{dishwasher}}s {{almost universally}} use {{two or three}} spray arms which are fed from the bottom and {{back wall of the}} dishwasher leaving both racks unimpeded and also such models tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for exposed elements in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use more basic and old fashioned water distribution and exposed elements in the base of the dishwasher. Some North American machines use a large cone or similar structure in the bottom <b>dish</b> <b>rack</b> to prevent placement of dishes {{in the center of the}} rack. The dishwasher directs water from the bottom of the dishwasher up through this structure to the upper wash arm to spray water on the top <b>dish</b> <b>rack.</b> Some dishwashers, including many models from Whirlpool and Kitchenaid, use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher, which allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model Frigidaire dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).|$|E
50|$|Exhaust hoods {{almost always}} include {{built-in}} lighting {{to illuminate the}} cooking surface. In addition, some manufacturers offer matching accessories, such as backsplash panels, pot racks, shelf units, or <b>dish</b> <b>racks.</b> The main advantage of an extractor hood {{is that it can}} easily filter the airflow, without harming the edible materials and can be easily installed if it is semi-automatic.|$|R

50|$|The term Galley {{kitchen is}} also used to refer to the design of {{household}} kitchen wherein the units are fitted into a continuous array with no kitchen table, allowing maximum use of a restricted space, and work with the minimum of required movement between units. Such kitchens increase storage space by working vertically, with hanging pots, <b>dish</b> <b>racks,</b> and ceiling-hung cabinets common. Strictly, the term refers to a kitchen with the units in two facing lines, but is often used to refer to U-shaped kitchens as well.|$|R
5000|$|Built {{entirely of}} ashlar, it {{actually}} {{consists of two}} or three rooms. The front room, about 5 metres square, serves as a living room and therefore contains tables and benches, some benches being fixed to the walls with storage chests underneath and others that are movable. It also acts as a kitchen because there is a very comprehensive cooking stove as well as a <b>dish</b> <b>rack</b> with all the utensils needed in a kitchen. The slightly higher, second room behind it is the length of a tall man and contains 3 large straw mattresses with woollen blankets, and can comfortably sleep 9 men. The third room is above the front room and offers accommodation that can take 12 men very comfortably on straw bedding. This room is actually intended for the leaders, but can be used by tourists who are not able to have the key to the hut... easily and by means of a ladder leaning against the hut.|$|E
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} living room, the second floor {{consists}} of two bedrooms, kitchen, and dining area, or comedor. A passageway, leading towards the bedrooms, or the zaguan, contains some of the memorabilia from Gen. Baldomero Aguinaldo, books of the municipal library, a history exhibit, and an arrangement of early to mid-20th century household items such as an upright piano. The bedrooms have iron bedsteads from the 1930s. The dining area, or comedor, could accommodate ten guests. It features pieces of furniture such as bentwood Thonet [...] "Vienna" [...] chairs, a <b>dish</b> <b>rack,</b> or vajillera, for china and glass wares, and a stuffed deer head on the wall. Built outside the comedor is a long outside shelf, or banguerra used for drying table ware. The flooring of the kitchen {{is made out of}} bamboo slats which is useful for both ventilation and easy cleaning. The bathroom and toilet are off a porch at the rear side of the house.|$|E
40|$|Sweden has {{the highest}} number of single {{households}} in the world, yet the majority of household appliances are targeted towards other groups. In a society where single households and compact living are becoming increasingly present, the need for targeted products has become more relevant. The purpose of this project was to design a product which addresses these problems, and eases the everyday life of the intended users. The project was executed using several design methods, such as analytical, observational and practical ones, including interviews with a focus group consisting of 15 people. The use of these design methods identified that the biggest sources of concern amongst the target group were those related to the drying of dishes washed by hand, which {{led to the development of}} a <b>dish</b> <b>rack</b> with built in dryers. The design of this product was based on the testing of potential technical solutions and feedback from the focus group, resulting in a kitchen appliance that is uniquely adapted to the needs of single households with limited kitchen space. This design was then presented through sketches, virtual 3 D models, and a physical prototype...|$|E

5000|$|The {{exterior}} and interior shapes echoed prior Newson designs for round-cornered rectangular <b>dish</b> <b>racks,</b> furniture and spoke-and-hub lamps. The concept also incorporated many innovations in the interior such as four seats, with the front two seats swiveling on pedestals; a jewel-like dashboard that moved vertically to accommodate drivers of differing heights; and, when the light was switched on, an electro-luminescent film glowed snowy white across the ceiling. The dashboard dials were built by Newson's Ikepod watch company and the steering wheel was reminiscent of his 1997 Alessi coat hook.|$|R
50|$|WaterAid {{is working}} with the {{government}} to help extend access to safe water, sanitation and improved hygiene for rural communities in Monze District. Sichiyanda is one such village in the Monze district where efforts are in progress. Projects in the village began in 2001 and the community worked together to dig a well with dedicated bucket and windlass. Hygiene education is also taking place, where villagers are taught to keep areas clean by building <b>dish</b> <b>racks</b> and rubbish pits and ensuring that there are no stagnant pools of water where mosquitoes can breed. In addition, 28 latrines have already been constructed with more underway.|$|R
40|$|Organometallic (OM) {{crystals}} are {{studied in}} fields ranging from spintronics to photovoltaics. This thesis focuses on studying a particular class of OM crystals known as transition metal-phthalocyanines (TM-Pc) - a molecular crystal composed of chains of planar OM molecules with {{a transition metal}} center and four coordinated pyrrole-aromatic rings joined by nitrogen atoms, similar to porphyrin. The structure resembles a <b>dish</b> <b>rack</b> pattern where the planar TM-Pcs of adjacent chains are oriented nearly perpendicular to each other. While TM-Pcs have been studied for decades due to their interesting optical properties and applications as dyes, there has been recent interest in understanding the magnetic properties with various transition metals. Due to crystal arrangement, inter-chain interactions among TM-Pcs are relatively weak when compared to intra-chain interactions. This property allows the chains of TM-Pcs to be isolated and approximated as a pseudo 1 D system. The electronic structure and spin exchange are computationally examined along chains of CuPc when they have been diluted with the metal-free variant, H 2 Pc. Density functional theory is employed with the Hubbard U correction to account for electron interactions on the copper d-orbitals. Since the diluted systems are effectively 1 D with narrow bands along their stacking axis, a 1 D Heisenberg model is applied where the exchange coefficient is determined through the Broken Symmetry method. Additionally, the effect of non-local corrections, used to determine structural features, on the Hubbard U and Heisenberg exchange coefficient, J, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Slowly, purposefully, {{my mother}} unbuttons her blouse. It is blue with small white flowers, and the tail is tucked firmly into the elastic {{waistband}} of her salmon-pink pants. Beginning {{at the top}} and moving down, she works carefully at each of the small plastic buttons. “Mother, ” I plead with her, “you don’t need to do that. ” She smiles at me and continues unfastening buttons. Her padded cotton and elastic bra begins to appear. Her breasts swell pallidly above it. The room is not well lit. The curtains are drawn, as they always are, against the sun. But I can see more of my mother than I wish to. My father, sitting here with me, says nothing. My wife, Gina, and two other women in the room also sit silently as my mother undresses herself. I smell her perfume as she works at her blouse, her perfume and the lotion she lathers herself with every morning. I see the wrinkles beneath her arms, the flaps of skin at the elbows. She pulls off the blouse and stands before us with it in her right hand. Her gray hair sprays in every direction. Her back is littered with small brown moles, her skin like ice over an old pond. And her dark eyes, fallen far back in the sockets of her skull, flutter from face to face like moths. This is not, of course, my mother. My mother would never have bared this much of herself in front of strangers and certainly never in front of her son. My mother was quiet, shy, prudent. And this is, of course, my mother, her face, her hands, her dried out, fungus-ruined feet. But things have changed. The nondescript, nappy, brown carpet is just as it always has been. The counters are still lined with the detritus of middle-class life. The cheap fan still chops at the air overhead, and the draining board with its plastic <b>dish</b> <b>rack</b> still drips dishwater into the same stainless steel sink. The clock with its three golden balls spools out the hours like kites, just as it always has. But my mother is mad. And the six of us have gathered today to evaluate her for custodial care. Custodial care! It sounds as though we might turn her over to the janitors at the university where I work. As though they might {{know what to do with}} her since w...|$|E

40|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} step {{in the preparation of}} a well stained fecal smear is good fixation. If this has not been done, the protozoa may be distorted or shrunk, may not be stained, or may exhibit an overall pink or red color with poor internal morphology. 2. Slides should always be drained between solutions. Touch the end of the slide to a paper towel for two seconds to remove excess fluid before proceeding to the next step. You can also pull the slide from the fluid, allow the excess fluid to run back into the container, and then move the slide to the next reagent container. This will maintain the staining solution for a longer period. If you are using staining <b>dishes</b> and <b>racks,</b> lift the rack from the fluid, rest the <b>rack</b> against the <b>dish</b> to allow excess fluid to run back into the dish, and then move the rack to the next dish of reagent. 3. Incomplete removal of mercuric chloride (liquid Schaudinn’s fixative and liquid Schaudinn’s fixative with PVA) may cause smear to contain highly refractive crystals or granules, which may prevent detection or identification of any organisms present. The 70 % ethanol-iodine solution removes the mercury from the slide; the subsequent alcohol rinses then removes the iodine (should be strong-tea color). Thus, when the slide is ready for trichrome staining, both the mercury and iodine have been removed. A few minutes (3 - 5 min) are usually sufficient to keep the slides in the iodine-alcohol; too long a time in this solution may also adversely affect the staining of the organisms.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the diversity and}} distribution of fungi in nine different sites inside 30 residential dishwashers. In total, 503 fungal strains were isolated, which belong to 10 genera and 84 species. Irrespective of the sampled site, 83 % of the dishwashers were positive for fungi. The most frequent opportunistic pathogenic species were Exophiala dermatitidis, Candida parapsilosis sensu stricto, Exophiala phaeomuriformis, Fusarium dimerum, and the Saprochaete/Magnusiomyces clade. The black yeast E. dermatitidis was detected in 47 % of the dishwashers, primarily at the dishwasher rubber seals, at up to 106 CFU/cm 2; the other fungi detected were {{in the range of}} 102 to 105 CFU/cm 2. The other most heavily contaminated dishwasher sites were side nozzles, doors and drains. Only F. dimerum was isolated from washed dishes, while dishwasher waste water contained E. dermatitidis, Exophiala oligosperma and Sarocladium killiense. Plumbing systems supplying water to household appliances represent the most probable route for contamination of dishwashers, as the fungi that represented the core dishwasher mycobiota were also detected in the tap water. Hot aerosols from dishwashers contained the human opportunistic yeast C. parapsilosis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and E. dermatitidis (as well as common air-borne genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma and Cladosporium). Comparison of fungal contamination of kitchens without and with dishwashers revealed that virtually all were contaminated with fungi. In both cases, the most contaminated sites were the kitchen drain and the <b>dish</b> drying <b>rack.</b> The most important difference was higher prevalence of black yeasts (E. dermatitidis in particular) in kitchens with dishwashers. In kitchens without dishwashers, C. parapsilosis strongly prevailed with negligible occurrence of E. dermatitidis. F. dimerum was isolated only from kitchens with dishwashers, while Saprochaete/Magnusiomyces isolates were only found within dishwashers. We conclude that dishwashers represent a reservoir of enriched opportunistic pathogenic species that can spread from the dishwasher into the indoor biome...|$|R
