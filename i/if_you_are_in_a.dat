60|$|I don't {{mean that}} he and Mr. Pupkin lived a mere routine of studious evenings. That would be untrue. Quite often their time was spent in much less commendable ways than that, and there were poker parties in their sitting-room that didn't break up till nearly midnight. Card-playing, after all, is a slow business, unless you put money on it, and, besides, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bank and are {{handling}} money all day, gambling has a fascination.|$|E

60|$|It {{is a good}} plan, too, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great hurry, to talk very loudly to {{each other}} about how you don’t need any tea, and {{are not going to have}} any. You get near the kettle, so that it can overhear you, and then you shout out, “I don’t want any tea; do you, George?” to which George shouts back, “Oh, no, I don’t like tea; we’ll have {{lemonade}} instead—tea’s so indigestible.” Upon which the kettle boils over, and puts the stove out.|$|E

Then when you are walking you can stop so easily any minute, and look around. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> carriage, it makes a fuss and trouble to be calling continually upon the coachman to stop; and then, besides, half of the time, before he gets the carriage stopped you have got by the place you wanted to see." ...|$|E

[...] "My children," [...] said he, [...] "I will save you from committing a great sin.

And yet, if it be true, what terrible things {{there are in the}} world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 tonight from Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear tonight. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come to breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not too early for you? You can get away, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you to Paddington by 2:35.

6000|$|It is {{all very}} well to talk of death as [...] "a {{pleasant}} potion of immortality"; but the most of us, I suspect, are of [...] "queasy stomachs," [...] and find it none of the sweetest.[34] The graveyard may be cloak-room to Heaven; but we must admit {{that it is a}} very ugly and offensive vestibule in itself, however fair may be the life to which it leads. And though Enoch and Elias went into the temple through a gate which certainly may be called Beautiful, the rest of us have to find our way to it through Ezekiel's low-bowed door and the vault full of creeping things and all manner of abominable beasts. Nevertheless, there is a certain frame of mind to which a cemetery is, if not an antidote, at least an alleviation. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fit of the blues, go nowhere else. It was in obedience to this wise regulation that the other morning found me lighting my pipe at the entrance to Old Greyfriars', thoroughly sick of the town, the country, and myself.|$|E

First, [...] "Son of the Charm", <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tight place. Perhaps that may help you--perhaps not. Then what I have told you about the tarkeean, if you want to transact offeecial business with a strange man. Of course, at present, you have no offeecial business. You are--ah ha!--supernumerary on probation. Quite unique specimen. If you were Asiatic of birth you might be employed right off; but this half-year of leave is to make you de-Englishized, you see? The lama he expects you, because I have demi-offeecially informed him you have passed all your examinations, and will soon obtain Government appointment. Oh ho! You are on acting-allowance, you see: so if you are called upon to help Sons of the Charm mind you jolly-well try. Now I shall say good-bye, my dear fellow, and I hope you--ah--will come out top-side all raight.' ...|$|E

60|$|I do not know, now, {{what all}} the edifices are, but there are churches, more than one, and palaces, and the reader can find their names {{in any of the}} guidebooks. If I were buying piazzas in Rome I should begin with the Navona, but there are enough to suit all purses and tastes. The fountains would be thrown in, I suppose, along with the churches and palaces; but I really never inquired, and, in fact, not having carried out my plan of visiting them all, I am in no {{position}} to advise intending purchasers. What I can say is that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hurry to inspect, that kind of property, and in immediate need of a piazza, you cannot do better than take the wagon for touring Rome. In two days you can visit every piazza worth having, including the Piazza di Spagna, where there is a fountain {{in the form of a}} marble galley in which you can embark for any fairyland you like, through the Via del Babuino and the Piazza del Popolo. Come to think of it, I am not so sure but I would as soon have the Piazza del Popolo as the Piazza Navona. If the fountains are not so fine, they are still very fine, and the Pincian Hill overtops one side of the place, with foliaged drives and gardened walks descending into it.|$|E
60|$|Take another instance, {{which is}} only too common: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crowded room, with plenty of fire and lights and company, doors and windows all shut tight, how often you feel faint--so faint that you may require smelling-salts or some other stimulant. The cause of your faintness is {{just the same as}} that of the mouse's fainting in the box; you and your friends, and, as I shall show you presently, the fire and the candles likewise, having been all {{breathing}} each other's breaths, over and over again, till the air has become unfit to support life. You are doing your best to enact over again the Highland tragedy, of which Sir James Simpson tells in his lectures to the working-classes of Edinburgh, when at a Christmas meeting thirty-six persons danced all night in a small room with a low ceiling, keeping the doors and windows shut. The atmosphere of the room was noxious beyond description; and the effect was, that seven of the party were soon after seized with typhus fever, of which two died. You are inflicting on yourselves the torments of the poor dog, who is kept at the Grotto del Cane, near Naples, to be stupefied, for the amusement of visitors, by the carbonic acid gas of the Grotto, and brought to life again by being dragged into the fresh air; nay, you are inflicting upon yourselves the torments of the famous Black Hole of Calcutta: and, if there was no chimney in the room, by which some fresh air could enter, the candles would soon burn blue, as they do, you know, when ghosts appear; your brains become disturbed; and you yourselves ran the risk of becoming ghosts, and the candles of actually going out.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they walked}} to the shooting-point, Jerry showed the lad how to hold the rifle, {{instructed}} him as to the backsight, and showed him how to get the foresight exactly on the nick of the backsight. [...] "You must just see the bead as if it were resting in the nick, and the object you aim at must just show above the top point of the bead." [...] He showed him how to load, and then told him to lie down, as he had done, on his chest, and to steady the rifle with the left arm, the elbow being on the ground. [...] "You must be quite comfortable," [...] he said; [...] "it is of no use trying to shoot <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cramped position. Now, take a steady aim, and the moment you have got the two sights in a line on the rock, press the trigger steadily. Press pretty hard; it is only a pull of about two pounds, but it is wonderful how stiff a trigger feels the first time you pull at it. You need not be at all afraid of the kick. If you press the butt tightly against your shoulder you will hardly feel it, for there is plenty of weight in the barr'l, and it carries but a small charge of powder. You won't want to shoot at anything much beyond this range, but sometimes you may have to try at four or five hundred yards when you are in want of a dinner. In that case you can put in a charge and a half of powder. Now, are you comfortable? You need not grip so hard with your left hand, the gun only wants to rest between your thumb and fingers. That is better. Now take a steady aim, and the moment you have got it press the trigger. Well done! that is a good shot for a first. You hit the dust an inch or two {{to the right of the}} stone. If it had been a red-skin you would have hit him in the shoulder. You will do, lad, and by the time we get to Fort Bridger I guess you will bring down a stag as clean as nine out of ten hunters." ...|$|E
