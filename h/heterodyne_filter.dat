Education and background, first studies I started my studies at the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, in 1938 and graduated {{with a degree in}} Electrical Engineering in 1945. My studies were interrupted by three years of military service of which two as a reserve officer in the Swedish Coast Artillery. An intermediate degree of licentiate was received in 1952 with a thesis on "The <b>heterodyne</b> <b>filter</b> " which allowed continuously variable band-pass filtering with very steep filter skirts. Following Swedish tradition my mai...|$|E
40|$|The term vocoder, {{which refers}} to the coding of a voiceâ€™s {{features}} in order to reproduce it synthetically, was introduced in a work by Dudley [Dud 39]: there, a first system of speech analysis and re-synthesis was presented, together with the first technical implementation of sound models that have been later improved and largely exploited (see section 2. 1). Then, the phase vocoder was originally introduced in 1966 by Flanagan [FG 66], working at the Bell Labs. This technique {{is based on the}} STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform, see section 1) : it began to be widely exploited when the dedicated algorithms were made computationally fast enough (see [CT 65] for the Fast Fourier Transform original algorithm, and [Por 76] for an implementation of STFT taking advantage of the FFT). The input of the STFT is a generic sound, the output is a set of coefficients that allow a perfect reconstruction of the original sound in terms of atomic signals, which are weighted modulated sinusoids. A main advantage, in relation to previous techniques such as the <b>Heterodyne</b> <b>filter</b> (see the dedicated chapter in [Moo 75]), is that no knowledge about the fundamental frequency is nee...|$|E
40|$|Any Band-Pass filter may be {{converted}} into a tunable filter with a single tuning parameter {{through the use of}} a new Tunable <b>Heterodyne</b> Band-Pass <b>Filter</b> concept in which the frequency of the heterodyne signal is adjusted thereby translating the entire filter transfer function in frequency. If the fixed filter is selected to be a narrow-band band-pass filter, the new Tunable <b>Heterodyne</b> Band-Pass <b>Filter</b> concept can be used very effectively in the elimination of narrow band interference in wide-band communications or control systems. A single-chip version of this tunable filter can be constructed using a Xilinx Virtex XCV 800 chip. The resulting filter is a flexible tunable band-pass filter that can be varied from DC to p/ 2 or from p/ 2 to p depending on the parameters of the fixed output low-pass filter...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{sensitivity of}} the output field of an optical cavity to small quantum-scale displacements has led to breakthroughs such as the first detection of gravitational waves LIGO,LIGODC and of the motions of quantum ground-state cooled mechanical oscillators Teufel 2011,Chan 2011. While heterodyne detection of the cavity field preserves asymmetries which provide a key signature that mechanical oscillators has attained the quantum regime, detection of a rotating quadrature of the light averages out important quantum correlations, yielding a weaker signal and lower sensitivity than homodyne detection. In turn, homodyning, detects a single optical quadrature, but loses the important quantum sideband asymmetries. In the present work we present and experimentally demonstrate a technique, involving judicious construction of the autocorrelators of the output current using filter functions, which can restore the lost correlations (whether classical or quantum), drastically augmenting the useful information extracted: the filtering adjusts for moderate errors in the locking phase of the local oscillator, allowing efficient single-shot measurement of hundreds of different field quadratures and rapid mapping of detailed features from a simple heterodyne trace. One may also control whether the correlations are recovered in isolation or interfere with the usual stationary heterodyne sidebands. In the latter case we obtain a spectrum of hybrid homodyne-heterodyne character, with motional sidebands of combined amplitudes comparable to homodyne. We term such recovery of lost <b>heterodyne</b> correlations with <b>filter</b> functions r-heterodyning: although investigated here in a thermal regime, its robustness and generality represents a promising new approach to sensing of quantum-scale displacements.
