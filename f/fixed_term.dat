40|$|The use of {{the mass}} term of the gauge field as a gauge <b>fixing</b> <b>term,</b> which was {{discussed}} by Zwanziger, Parrinello and Jona-Lasinio in a large mass limit, {{is related to the}} non-linear gauge by Dirac and Nambu. We have recently shown that this {{use of the}} mass term as a gauge <b>fixing</b> <b>term</b> is in fact identical to the conventional local Faddeev-Popov formula without taking a large mass limit, if one takes into account the variation of the gauge field along the entire gauge orbit. This suggests that the classical massive vector theory, for example, could be re-interpreted as a gauge invariant theory with a gauge <b>fixing</b> <b>term</b> added in suitably quantized theory. As for massive gauge particles, the Higgs mechanics, where the mass term is gauge invariant, has a more intrinsic meaning. We comment on several implications of this observation. ...|$|R

Augustus could not transfer his powers to a successor upon his death, as they were given to specifically to him for some <b>fixed</b> <b>term</b> or during his life. Thus, any successor would need to have his own authority and influence. In 6BC Augustus granted tribunician powers to his stepson Tiberius and recognised Tiberius as his heir. In AD13, a law was passed which made Tiberius' legal powers equivalent to and independent from those of Augustus.|$|E

25|$|Low {{introductory}} {{credit card}} rates {{are limited to}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>term,</b> usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged. As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to bankruptcy. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed. In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases universal default may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This {{can lead to a}} snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. First Premier Bank at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate; however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.|$|E

Her initial appointment as a lecturer was for a <b>fixed</b> <b>term</b> of five years, in view of her background as an archaeologist and art historian rather than the more traditional foundation of classical philology. She published ten books and {{more than two hundred}} articles, and is credited with changing the face of classical archaeology in the Netherlands. She is also credited with stimulating the still nascent discipline of formal numismatic study in the Netherlands, particularly the work of Wim van Es. Her work inspired the publication of a Festschrift on the occasion of her 70th birthday, with a foreword and praise of Zadoks' work by Elizabeth Visser (1908–1987), the first female professor of ancient history in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Augustus' final {{goal was}} {{to figure out a}} method to ensure an orderly succession. Under Augustus' constitution, the Senate and the People of Rome held the supreme power, and all of his special powers were granted for either a <b>fixed</b> <b>term,</b> or for life. Therefore, Augustus could not {{transfer}} his powers to a successor upon his death. Any successor needed to have powers that were independent of Augustus' own powers. During his illness in 23 BC, he had chosen Agrippa to be his successor. He had considered the possibility of making his nephew Marcellus his successor, but had ultimately decided that Marcellus was too young. In 21 BC Marcellus died and Augustus married Agrippa to his daughter Julia, and in 18 BC Augustus enacted a law that granted Agrippa tribunician powers for a period of five years. Agrippa and Julia had two sons, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, and Augustus designated them as possible heirs by granting upon both tribunician powers. In 12 BC Agrippa died, and in 6 BC Augustus granted these tribunician powers to his stepson Tiberius. Gaius and Lucius Caesar soon died, and Augustus realized that {{he had no choice but}} to recognize Tiberius as his heir. In 13 AD, the point was settled beyond question. A law was passed (the lex consularis) which linked Augustus' powers over the provinces to those of Tiberius, so that now Tiberius' legal powers were equivalent to, and independent from, those of Augustus. Within a year, Augustus was dead.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they left}} home these armies and fleets {{had to be}} supplied, not only with food and {{clothing}} for the men but also forage for the horses which gave them mobility and were fitting to their Station. Yet if armies of the seventh and eighth centuries were accompanied by servants and a supply train of lesser free men, Alfred found these arrangements insufficient to defeat the Vikings. One of his reforms, if {{he was responsible for}} them, was to divide his military resources into three. One part manned the burhs and found the permanent garrisons which would make it impossible for the Danes to overrun Wessex, although they would also take to the field when extra soldiers were needed. The remaining two would take it in turns to serve. They were allocated a <b>fixed</b> <b>term</b> of Service and brought the necessary provisions with them. This arrangement did not always function perfectly. On one occasion a division on Service went home in the middle of blockading a Danish army on Thorney Island, its provisions consumed and its term expired, before the king came to relieve them. This method of division and rotation remained in force right up to 1066. In 917, when armies from Wessex and Mercia were in the field from early April until November, one division went home and another took over. Again, in 1052 when Edward's fleet was waiting at Sandwich to intercept Godwine's return, the ships returned to London to take on new earls and crews. The importance of supply, vital to military success, was appreciated even if it was taken for granted and features only incidentally in the sources.|$|E

After the appointment of William Wordsworth in 1843 the duties settled into an expectation, not requirement, for major court and national occasions. Alfred, Lord Tennyson held the post between November 1850 and October 1892. According to Andrew Motion and Hilary Laurie, Tennyson [...] "gave the poet laureateship new status and significance" [...] with works such as [...] "Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington" [...] and [...] "The Charge of the Light Brigade".
