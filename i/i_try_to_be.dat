After arriving at Port Vale in June 2011, Vale manager Micky Adams stated, [...] "Ryan is a creative central midfielder and will bring plenty of quality on the ball, but he is also a very hard-working individual". Neil Duncanson, the Glenn Hoddle Academy's commercial director said: [...] "Ryan is very strong, powerful and suited to the front of a diamond in central midfield. He's a creative player who can take an excellent dead ball". Burge has said of himself that [...] "I'm a midfield player who likes to put my foot in, as well as to get on the ball and create things. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an all-round midfield player and do a bit of everything".|$|E
500|$|Kapoor's {{role in the}} Anand L. Rai-directed romantic drama Raanjhanaa (2013) {{marked a}} turning point in her career; Geety Sahgal called it her best {{performance}} to date in The Indian Express. Kapoor's role was that of Zoya Haider, a young Muslim student from Varanasi who is drawn into politics after the murder of her Sikh lover. To prepare for her part, Kapoor interacted with students, attended workshops and practiced with theatre groups associated with Jawaharlal Nehru University. She also studied Jaya Bachchan's work in Guddi (1971), which she felt was [...] "perfect" [...] for her role. Discussing her character in the film, Kapoor described her approach to acting: [...] "I have always tried to do different films and … <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different for every character. I like doing different things to challenge myself in every way and don't like to repeat myself." [...] Although Raanjhanaa received mixed reviews, her performance was praised; Rajeev Masand wrote that she [...] "does some of her best work here, going smoothly from innocent to manipulative to cynical, without ever losing Zoya's inherent vulnerability". With worldwide earnings of over , Raanjhanaa was a commercial success and Kapoor received her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.|$|E

New vocalist La Torre said in a late March 2013 interview that Tate always was [...] "a huge inspiration" [...] to him as a fan of the band, and he always tries to honor what Tate did vocally: [...] "I try to represent [...] {{to the best of my}} ability, but I also do put [...] a little bit of my flavor, which is a little edgier and a little grittier at times, and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> authentic but me at the same time." [...] La Torre especially sought to provide a [...] "common thread" [...] in the vocals, that he felt was missing from the previous few records released by Queensrÿche.|$|E

2500|$|The verb [...] "Wyatting" [...] {{appeared}} in some blogs and music magazines {{to describe the}} practice of playing unusual tracks, in particular songs from Wyatt's album Dondestan, on a pub jukebox to annoy the other pub goers. Wyatt was quoted in 2006 in The Guardian as saying [...] "I think it's really funny" [...] and [...] "I'm very honoured {{at the idea of}} becoming a verb." [...] When asked if he would ever try it himself, he said: [...] "I don't really like disconcerting people, but even when <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> normal I disconcert anyway." [...] However, Alfreda Benge said it made her angry [...] "that Robert should be used as a means of clever dicks asserting their superiority in pubs ... It's so unlike Robert, because he's so appreciative of the strengths of pop music. So that, I think, is a real unfairness. The man who coined it, I should like to punch him in the nose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Children of Bodom's {{first world}} tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E
