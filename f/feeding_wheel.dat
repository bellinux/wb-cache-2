40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{fertilizers}} and solid amendments in agriculture generates special interest for {{their effect on}} crop productivity, {{as well as for}} their environmental impact. The efficient use of these products demands knowing their physical and mechanical properties, the storing conditions effect and the operational characteristics of the metering systems used in the fertilizing equipment. In this context, the present study was developed with the purpose of evaluating the operational characteristics of different fertilizing metering systems and to determine the adequate metering system-product operational parameters, using powder lime, powder gypsum, granular 10 - 30 - 10 (N-P-K), and granular urea. Operational differences were established among four types of commercial fertilizer metering systems, including wire auger, star-shaped <b>feed</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>feed</b> screw and ridged traction wheel. The study found that the unloading rate depends directly on the fertilizer metering system’s rotating speed and is affected by particle size, repose angle, bulk density and moisture content of the applied product. The wire auger and star-shaped <b>feed</b> <b>wheel</b> metering systems were adequate for the distribution of powder products and the feed screw for granulated fertilizers...|$|R

Provisions for interfacing the antenna with the space shuttle orbiter are presented and discussed. A program plan for hardware development and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost are also included. The conceptual design of the antenna is presented. It consists of a four-meter diameter parabolic torus main reflector, which is a graphite/epoxy shell supported by a graphite/epoxy truss. A rotating <b>feed</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly supports six Gregorian subreflectors covering the upper eight frequency channels from 6. 6 GHz through 118. 7 GHz, and two three-channel prime forms feed assemblies for 0. 6, 1. 4, and 2. 7 GHz. The <b>feed</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly also holds the radiometers and power supplies, and a drive system using a 400 Hz synchronous motor is described. The RF analysis of the antenna is performed using physical optics procedures for both the dual reflector Gregorian concept and the single reflector prime focus concept. A unique aberration correcting feed for 2. 7 GHz is analyzed. A structural analysis is also included. The analyses indicate that the antenna will meet system requirements...|$|R

The first such opener was patented in 1931 by the Bunker Clancey Company of Kansas City, Missouri and was, therefore, called the [...] "Bunker". It featured the now standard pliers-type handles, when squeezed would tightly grip the can rim, while turning the key would rotate the cutting wheel, progressively cutting the lid along the rim. The cutting wheel is coupled to a serrated <b>feed</b> <b>wheel</b> via a set of gears, as in the Star design.

50|$|Types A-E {{share the}} same common {{features}} that contributed to their success; they all have a stamp <b>feed</b> <b>wheel</b> with pins which accurately interlock with the stamp perforations and they all derive the energy needed to operate the mechanism from the raising of a weight through the insertion of a coin. Type F machines are different in that the coin releases a “Pull” bar which when pulled, forces the next booklet in a stack out through the vend slot. Such mechanisms as Type F and Type G {{are said to be}} “coin-freed”.

40|$|Anorexia nervosa (AN) is {{a complex}} eating {{disorder}} with severe dysregulation of appetitive behavior. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm is an animal model in which rodents exposed to both running <b>wheels</b> and scheduled <b>feeding</b> develop aspects of AN including paradoxical hypophagia, dramatic weight loss, and hyperactivity, while animals exposed to only one condition maintain normal body weight. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an activity-dependent modulator of neuronal plasticity, is reduced in the serum of AN patients, and is a known regulator of feeding and weight maintenance. We assessed the effects of scheduled <b>feeding,</b> running <b>wheel</b> access, or both on the expression of BDNF transcripts within the mesocorticolimbic pathway. We also assessed the expression of neuronal cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM 1) to explore the specificity of effects on BDNF within the mesocorticolimbic pathway. Scheduled feeding increased the levels of both transcripts in the hippocampus (HPC), increased NCAM 1 mRNA expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and decreased BDNF mRNA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In addition, wheel running increased BDNF mRNA expression in the VTA. No changes in either transcript were observed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Furthermore, no changes in either transcript were induced by the combined scheduled <b>feeding</b> and <b>wheel</b> access condition. These data indicate that scheduled <b>feeding</b> or <b>wheel</b> running alter BDNF and NCAM 1 expression levels in specific regions of the mesocorticolimbic pathway. These findings contribute to our current knowledge of the molecular alterations induced by ABA and may help elucidate possible mechanisms of AN pathology...|$|R

40|$|The {{depth and}} {{morphology}} of subsurface damage (SSD) in fused silica samples ground with diamond grinding wheels were investigated. The factors possibly influencing the SSD depth of ground samples were examined. The results {{demonstrate that the}} SSD depth is most responsive to diamond grit size while the processing parameters (i. e. depth of cut, <b>feed</b> rate, and <b>wheel</b> peripheral speed) have marginal effects on the SSD depth. The SSD depth decreases with the abrasive/grit size of diamond wheels and slightly diminishes with the decrease of cutting depth but little influenced by <b>feeding</b> rate and <b>wheel</b> speed. The morphology inspection shows that the density of subsurface cracks in ground fused silica samples decays exponentially with the depth from the ground surface into the bulk and the cracks vanish at a certain depth {{that depends on the}} mechanical and physical properties of samples and diamond abrasives/grits.

50|$|In {{the food}} sector, moving or {{transporting}} fluids is achieved {{with the aid}} of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, {{depending on the type of}} filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported {{with the aid of}} a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing. This is basically a volumetric feed principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems, also known as rotary vane pumps, there are also screw feed systems with <b>feed</b> augers, toothed <b>wheel</b> <b>feed</b> systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum.Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors. They can also be found in some non-food sectors. Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be used for filling pasty and compressible products.|$|R

40|$|International audienceService life of {{machined}} {{brittle material}} and particularly glass workpieces, used in technology {{fields such as}} civil engineering, transports or optics, could be shortened by local irregularities. Indeed, grooves or sub-surface damage (SSD) can lead to cracks and fracture in operation [1, 2]. Therefore, manufacturers tend to smoothen the surface finish by achieving a long and costly polishing phase. In a materal removal context, reducing damage during rough machining could also be considered since it could limit the polishing operation and eventually limit SSD. This study focuses on this proposal. Since roughness depends on the manufacturing process, material removal process must be carefully defined to obtain a surface finish that could match a service life criterion. Grinding process involves numerous parameters that can be classified in three categories : tool parameters (wheel shape, dimensions, bond material, abrasive nature and size [...] .), machining parameters (depth of cut <b>feed</b> rate, <b>wheel</b> speed, grinding direction [...] .) and contact parameters (temperature, lubricant type and flow, [...] .). As for roughness, main normalized parameters used remains Ra, the average roughness [3, 4] and Rq, the {{root mean square roughness}} [5]. However, these parameters provide information on the global surface finish only and especially not on local damage which could lead to crack propagation and fracture [6]. As this study aims at optimizing the rough grinding process on a local damage point of view, the roughness parameters that would characterize the most pertinently the rough ground surface of a brittle material workpiece need to be defined. Using appropriate roughness parameters, the grinding process can be improved by the understanding and optimization {{of the relationship between the}} surface finish and machining parameters. For this purpose, depth of cut, <b>feed</b> rate, <b>wheel</b> speed and grinding direction influence on the surface finish of ground window glass samples will be investigated through a central composite design of experiments. Based on the response surface methodology (RSM) [7], it allows to evaluate every parameter influence simultaneously. Even if some of these parameters influence has already been studied [8, 9], it has always been partially (one parameter alone) and mainly in a polishing context...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects on}} feeding of moving animals from individual- to pair-housing were {{explored}} {{in the present}} three experiments. Wheel access is known {{to result in a}} temporary suppression of feeding. The move to pair-housing was compared with the effect of wheel access. In Experiment l, a group of rats was moved from individual to pair-housing (IP group) and compared to a group of individually-housed rats (IND group) and a group of chronically pair-housed rats (PAIR group). The animals in the IP group showed a temporary (three days) suppression in feeding (initially 23 %). When half of the IND and PAIR group animals were moved between individual- and pair-housing on alternate days (IND-ALT and PAIR-ALT groups, respectively) (Experiment 2), only the rats in the IND-ALT group showed a three day feeding suppression (initially 40 %). Experiment 3 examined the effect of the simultaneous introduction of wheels and transfer of housing conditions. The feeding suppression induced by the transfer from individual- to pair-housing was evident prior to, and of a shorter duration than, the feeding suppression induced by wheel access. These results indicate that the feeding suppression, induced by a housing shift, {{is not the same as}} that evident when rats are given wheel access.

Two rope-worked inclined planes allowed the tramway to negotiate the difference in level between the mill and the Ffestiniog Railway. The connection of the final incline to the railway was deemed to be dangerous by a Board of Trade inspector in 1864, as there were no trap points to prevent runaway wagons running onto the main line.

However, there are no reports on high temperature pulse-mediated entrainment on the phase-shift of peripheral clocks in vivo. Here we show that temperature treatment of mice for two days at 41 °C, instead of 37 °C, for 1 - 2 h during the inactive period, using a temperature controlled water bath stimulated phase-advance of peripheral clocks in the kidney, liver, and submandibular gland of PER 2 ::LUCIFERASE mice. On the other hand, treatment for 2 days at 35 °C ambient room temperature for 2 h did not cause a phase-advance. Maintenance of mice at 41 °C in a water bath, sustained the core body temperature at 40 - 41 °C. However, the use of 37 °C water bath or the 35 °C ambient room temperature elevated the core body temperature to 38. 5 °C, suggesting that at least a core body temperature of 40 - 41 °C is necessary to cause phase-advance under light-dark cycle conditions. The temperature pulse stimulation at 41 °C, instead of 37 °C water bath for 2 h led to the elevated expression of Per 1 and Hsp 70 in {{the peripheral}} tissue of mice. In summary, the present study demonstrates that transient high temperature pulse using water bath during daytime causes phase-advance in mouse peripheral clocks in vivo.
