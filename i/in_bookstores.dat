Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold <b>in</b> <b>bookstores.</b>|$|E

25|$|The communists' {{selective}} permissiveness took {{a toll on}} Aderca's legacy. During the 1950s, {{only his}} biography of Christopher Columbus was available <b>in</b> <b>bookstores,</b> with younger readers seemingly convinced that Aderca was a one-book author. After his death, other works were published individually or collectively: Murmurul cuvintelor ("The Murmur of Words", collected poems, 1971), Răzvrătirea lui Prometeu ("Prometheus' Rebellion", 1974), Teatru ("Drama", 1974), Contribuții critice ("Contributions to Criticism", 1983 and 1988), Oameni și idei ("Men and Ideas", 1983).

It arrived <b>in</b> <b>bookstores</b> in October 2007, in both English and French, but the promotional tour was delayed due to heart surgery.

25|$|Paul Martin {{replaced}} Jean Chrétien as Liberal Party {{leader and}} prime minister in late 2003. Shortly before he was sworn in, Plamondon published a short book entitled Le mythe Paul Martin. As its title implies, the work was highly critical of its subject: Plamondon accused Martin of damaging Quebec's interests during {{his time in the}} Chrétien cabinet. He also argued that Martin would become an ally of United States president George W. Bush, neglect the low-income citizens of Canada and Quebec, and favour the interests of English Canada. The Bloc distributed one thousand free copies of the book, and a further fifteen hundred copies were put on sale <b>in</b> <b>bookstores.</b> Martin's supporters dismissed the work as a negative campaign ploy lacking any progressive vision, and Liberal MP Don Boudria asked the speaker of the House of Commons to investigate whether Plamondon had broken parliamentary rules by using publicly funded research staff to help compile the book.|$|E

500|$|Early reviews were mixed. Some critics {{found the}} novel too preachy; others, {{including}} Leonard Woolf, {{thought it was}} poorly structured, or complained of sloppiness in style. There was praise for its sincerity and artistry, and some expressed sympathy with Hall's moral argument. In the {{three weeks after the}} book appeared <b>in</b> <b>bookstores,</b> no reviewer called for its suppression or suggested that it should not have been published. A review in T.P.'s & Cassell's Weekly foresaw no difficulties for The Well: [...] "One cannot say what effect this book will have on the public attitude of silence or derision, but every reader will agree with Mr. Havelock Ellis in the preface, that 'the poignant situations are set forth with a complete absence of offence.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The book found a large audience, {{partly because}} of its {{distribution}} through bookstores rather than the direct market comic shops where comic books were normally sold. [...] Maus was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to know on which shelves to place it. [...] Though Pantheon pushed for the term [...] "graphic novel", Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as [...] "graphic novels" [...] {{whether or not they}} had novelistic qualities. [...] He suspected the term's use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books. [...] Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with Drawn and Quarterly publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the Book Industry Study Group in the early 2000s to include [...] "graphic novel" [...] as a category <b>in</b> <b>bookstores.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{published}} work, Abraham Lincoln: A History, alternates {{parts in}} which Lincoln is at center [...] with discussions of contextual matters, such as legislative events or battles. The first serial installment, published in November 1886, received positive reviews. When the ten-volume set emerged in 1890, {{it was not}} sold <b>in</b> <b>bookstores,</b> but instead door-to-door, then a common practice. Despite a price of $50, {{and the fact that}} {{a good part of the}} work had been serialized, five thousand copies were quickly sold. The books helped forge the modern view of Lincoln as great war leader, against competing narratives that gave more credit to subordinates such as Seward. According to historian Joshua Zeitz, [...] "it is easy to forget how widely underrated Lincoln the president and Lincoln the man were at the time of his death and how successful Hay and Nicolay were in elevating his place in the nation's collective historical memory." ...|$|E

[...] "I'd pictured my first novels being published as paperback originals," [...] he recalled, [...] "and instead a prestigious house was doing the book in cloth....I was in heaven." [...] The novel was released to little initial fanfare, but an enthusiastic review in Newsweek, which declared Gun an [...] "audaciously assured first novel", catapulted the book to wider commercial success.
