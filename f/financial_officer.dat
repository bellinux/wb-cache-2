This thesis evaluates {{the adequacy of}} the current training programs provided to Marine Corps <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> with the primary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 3404. Using the responses from a financial training questionnaire which was distributed to Marine <b>financial</b> <b>officers,</b> and interviews with selected senior <b>financial</b> <b>officers.</b> The thesis explores how training programs can be enhanced to best prepare these officers for the 1990 's. This research concludes that: (1) <b>Financial</b> <b>officers</b> will need to be versatile to deal with the changing financial systems in the 1990 's.

(3) The Marine Corps Practical Comptrollership Course should be targeted at officers with approximately three years experience and an advanced course should be developed. (4) More intra-MOS training should be encouraged. Captain, United States Marine Corp...|$|R

Chief <b>Financial</b> <b>Officer</b> David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton {{to see what}} can be done to stem the losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present because he had been Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E

This leads Andy to seek help from David Wallace (Andy Buckley), the former Chief <b>Financial</b> <b>Officer</b> of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi-millionaire.

5|$|D Charitable Foundation was {{established}} by Borislow in 1997 with a $21 million stock donation. In the first two years, he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a tract of land in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This venture failed in 1998 when the property owner declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in Clearwater, Florida until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two yeshivas and $173,450 to a West Palm Beach, Florida private school. Tax records indicate that Borislow and George Farley, the chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> of the non-profit, split approximately $2.1 million in profits from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Enron {{established}} {{a joint venture}} in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI). In 1997, Skilling, serving as Chief Operating Officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment.

However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet.

40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} females are less sensitive than males to condi-tions of salary underpayment and have coined the term paradoxical female. To test the hypothesis addressing the paradoxical female and to examine reactions of females and males within competing models for pay satisfaction, {{a random sample of}} chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> was selected and assessed. Results indicate that female chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers,</b> unlike male chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers,</b> receiving less than their entitled salaries enjoyed the same level of pay satisfaction as both female and male chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> receiving more than their entitled salaries. Pay satisfaction, as defined by a referent source, was found to vary by gender of chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> and to follow a linear, as opposed to a curvilinear, model. Employment has been conceptualized as an exchange relationship between organizations as employers and individuals as employees (Rous-seau, 1990). “At the core of the employment exchange between organizations and individuals ” is compensation (Gerhart & Milkovich, 1992, p. 481). “Taken literally, compensation means to counterbalance, to offset, to make up for. So compensation makes up for the effort an employee exerts on the employer’s behalf ” (Milkovich & Newman, 1996, p. 9). Compensation is provided by organizations and received by employees, and has instrumental value “to purchase desired goods and services, for status and prestige, and for self validation ” (Rice, Phillips, & McFarlin, 1990, p. 387). If the employment exchange relationship is to be sustained between organizations and individuals, then both parties expect a certain level of justice to prevail. Justice, as it relates to compensation within the employment exchange relationship, involves some general notion of equal pay for equal work...|$|R
