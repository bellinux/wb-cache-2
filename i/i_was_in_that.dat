25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E
25|$|I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, {{to one of}} his long-necked women, {{with their}} piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{suggested}} Betsy Andreu {{may have}} been confused by possible mention of his post-operative treatment which included steroids and EPO that are taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell-destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy. The Andreus' allegation was not supported {{by any of the}} eight other people present, including Armstrong's doctor Craig Nichols, or his medical history. According to Greg LeMond (who has been embroiled with his own disputes with Armstrong), he (LeMond) had a recorded conversation, the transcript of which was reviewed by National Public Radio (NPR), with Stephanie McIlvain (Armstrong's contact at Oakley Inc.) in which she said of Armstrong's alleged admission 'You know, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> room. I heard it.' However, McIlvain has contradicted LeMond's allegations on the issue and denied under oath that the incident in question ever occurred in her sworn testimony.|$|E

500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera {{for every one of}} those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whedon always {{intended}} for the character to become an icon, claiming [...] "I {{wanted her to be}} a hero that existed in people's minds the way Wonder Woman or Spider-Man does, you know? I wanted her to be a doll or an action figure. I wanted Barbie with Kung Fu grip! I wanted her to enter the mass consciousness and the imaginations of growing kids because I think she's a cool character, and that was always the plan. I wanted Buffy to be a cultural phenomenon, period." [...] In developing Buffy, Whedon was greatly inspired by Kitty Pryde, a character from the pages of the superhero comic X-Men. He admits, [...] "If there's a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty, I don't know what it was... She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it." [...] In a 2009 interview, Whedon revealed he only recently realised how much he saw of himself in Buffy. After years of relating more to Xander, he says, [...] "Buffy was always the person that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> story because I'm not in every way." [...] Whedon openly wonders why his identification figure is a woman, but describes it as [...] "a real autobiographical kind of therapy for me" [...] to be writing a strong female character like Buffy.|$|E

40|$|In Japanese {{language}} education, {{communication skills}} {{have tended to}} be discussed from an aspect of either “other people and relationships” or “logicality and thinking abilities”. In order to integrate the two aspects, our study focused on the argumentation theory. Based on this theory, four elements are essentiol for bringing discussions to a successful conclusion: claim, evidence, reasoning, and rebuttal. We believe <b>in</b> particular <b>that</b> integration of the two aspects <b>in</b> communications will <b>be</b> materialized by extracting experiences of the learners through reasoning. Therefore, the objective of this study is clarification of the process of required interactions in discussions between the learners, and between the learner and a teacher, in order to achieve increased quality of reasoning, which utilize analogies based on the learner’s own experiences. As a result of an analysis of practices, it was revealed there <b>were</b> two phases <b>in</b> the interaction, which extracts high-quality reasoning through discussions. In the first phase, evidence is reanalyzed after encountering “evidence from a new viewpoint”, or an “rebuttal that denies the learner’s own opinion”. In the next phase, the learner sympathizes with the other opininons through “reasoning from a standpoint of the other person”. Through these phases, the learners begin to consider “if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation”. “Questioning and asking explanation for reasoning” at this point leads to extraction of high-quality reasoning. 本稿では、中学 2 年生を対象とした実験授業を分析し、生活経験から類推した質の高い理由づけが引き出されるためには、議論の中でどのような教師と学習者及び学習者間の相互作用が必要となるのか、その過程を明らかにすることを目的とする...|$|R
