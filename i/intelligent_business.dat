40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the measuring performance of artificially <b>business</b> <b>intelligent</b> systems. Thousands of persons-years have {{been devoted to}} {{the research and development}} in the vari¬ous aspects of artificially intelligent systems. Much progress has been attained. However, there has been no means of evaluating the progress of the field. How can we assess the cur¬rent state of the science? Most of <b>business</b> <b>intelligent</b> systems are beginning to be deployed commercially. How can a commercial buyer evaluate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the intelligent candidate and decide which system will perform best for their business applica¬tion? If constructing a system from existing components, how does one select the one that is most appropriate within the desired <b>business</b> <b>intelligent</b> systems? The ability to measure the capabilities of <b>business</b> <b>intelligent</b> systems or components is more that an exercise in satisfy¬ing intellectual or philosophical curiosity. Without measurements and subsequent quantitative evaluation, it is difficult to gauge progress. It is both in a spirit of scientific enquiry and for pragmatic motivations that we embark on the quest for metrics for performance and intelli¬gence of <b>business</b> <b>intelligent</b> systems. ...|$|R

These are including venture capital, financial funding, training, physical infrastructure such as entrepreneur incubator and laboratory, business consultant, an organization of National Women Entrepreneurs, USAHANITA's, and so on. However, contribution of Malay women entrepreneur is still not really discussed intensively and to the best of knowledge, the improvement of business performance has not tested well because of some issues and challenges in the marketplace.

5000|$|Collaborative {{intelligence}} {{is a term}} used in several disciplines. In business it describes heterogeneous networks of people interacting to produce intelligent outcomes. It can also denote non-anonymous multi-agent problem-solving systems. The term was used in 1999 to describe the behavior of an <b>intelligent</b> <b>business</b> ecosystem where Collaborative Intelligence, or CQ, is [...] "the ability to build, contribute to and manage power found in networks of people." [...] When the computer science community adopted the term collective intelligence and gave that term a specific technical denotation, a complementary term was needed to distinguish between anonymous homogeneity in collective prediction systems and non-anonymous heterogeneity in collaborative problem-solving systems. Anonymous collective intelligence was then complemented by collaborative intelligence, which acknowledged identity, viewing social networks {{as the foundation for}} next generation problem-solving ecosystems, modeled on evolutionary adaptation in nature's ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Half court {{shots are}} widely {{considered}} to be the lowest percentage shot in basketball. Collectively, NBA players try shots from beyond half-court a few hundred times each season; approximately 1 in 100 of those shots are made. A half-court shot is attempted roughly 25 percent of the time to finish the first, second or third quarter; though, its much rarer in the fourth. In some instances, NBA players will intentionally avoid shooting a half court shot before the buzzer. Such players are more interested in protecting their field goal percentage than providing an opportunity (though unlikely) for the team to acquire 3 more points. Since field goal percentage is accounted for during contract negotiations, some players think it is an <b>intelligent</b> <b>business</b> decision to refuse to toss a low percentage shot at the rim. As a result, some believe that half court shots should not be included in field goal percentage.|$|E

50|$|Very few Jews live in East Asian countries, but Jews {{are viewed}} in an {{especially}} positive light {{in some of}} them, partly owing to their shared wartime experiences during the Second World War.
