5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), {{and the space}} group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E

Each site <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> charge, and the site corresponding to the oxygen atom also has the Lennard-Jones parameters. Since 3-site models achieve a high computational efficiency, these are widely used for many applications of molecular dynamics simulations. Most of models use a rigid geometry matching that of actual water molecules. An exception is the SPC model, which assumes an ideal tetrahedral shape (HOH angle of 109.47°) instead of the observed angle of 104.5°.|$|E

25|$|The center trace is a {{straight}} line, {{which is what}} Raoult's law predicts for an ideal mixture. The top trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a positive deviation from Raoult's law, where the total combined vapor pressure of constituents, X and Y, is greater than what is predicted by Raoult's law. The top trace deviates sufficiently {{that there is a}} point on the curve where its tangent is horizontal. Whenever a mixture has a positive deviation and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> at which the tangent is horizontal, the composition at that point is a positive azeotrope. At that point the total vapor pressure is at a maximum. Likewise the bottom trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a negative deviation from Raoult's law, and at the composition where tangent to the trace is horizontal there is a negative azeotrope. This is also the point where total vapor pressure is minimum.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason of}} the {{interest}} for Diophantine equations, in the elliptic curve case, is that K may not be algebraically closed. There can exist curves C that have no point defined over K, and which become isomorphic over a larger field to E, which by definition <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> over K to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish C that have genus 1, from elliptic curves E that have a K-point (or, in other words, provide a Diophantine equation that has a solution in K). The curves C {{turn out to be}} torsors over E, and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that K is a number field (the theory of the Selmer group). In fact a typical plane cubic curve C over Q has no particular reason to have a rational point; the standard Weierstrass model always does, namely the point at infinity, but you need a point over K to put C into that form over K.|$|E
500|$|Through its {{treatment}} of locative technology, the novel revisits notions of virtual reality and cyberspace prominent in Gibson's early cyberpunk fiction. One character proposes that cyberspace is everting; becoming an integral and indistinguishable element {{of the physical world}} rather than a domain to be visited. During the book tour for the novel, Gibson elaborated on this theme, proposing that the ubiquity of connectivity meant that what had been called [...] "cyberspace" [...] is no longer a discrete sphere of activity separate from and secondary to normal human activity, but that those increasingly less common parts of normal life free from connectivity were the exception. [...] "If the book <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to make where we are now with cyberspace", he commented, it was that cyberspace [...] "has colonized our everyday life and continues to colonize everyday life." ...|$|E

Derek Elley of American magazine Variety said that with [...] "an unattractive palette of cold, blue-green hues, pic does little to build sympathy for its protagonist {{or any of the}} other characters, and flashy visual effects for Neto's mental dislocation add to the viewer's own alienation." [...] The Hindus Gautaman Bhaskaran dubbed it [...] "extremely gripping", [...] "disturbing"; ultimately, he declared it has a [...] "morbidity" [...] and a [...] "sense of truth, bitter and brutal". Writing for Indian magazine Outlook, Namrata Joshi praised it as [...] "stylishly shot, alternating between a cinema verite view of the Brazilian family life and MTV images of the underground [...] youth culture." [...] Joshi, however, criticized it for its [...] "excessive in the portrayal of the traumas of Neto which are evoked in the fashion of a radical, nihilistic music video," [...] and the fact he found the reason to intern Neto [...] "never convincingly grounded in the narrative." [...] Similarly, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, a Swiss newspaper, criticized it for relying too much on special effects and for not presenting a deeper insight in the emotional conflict. The World Socialist Web Site stated the film <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> in its subject [...] "but the simplistic and outraged tone spoils the film" [...] as [...] "Anyone not already convinced that such institutions are monstrous will legitimately dismiss the work as intemperate propaganda." ...|$|E

The pilot episode reveals that Haley grew up in a large family, but often spent her time with Lucas and Karen because she felt that they needed her more. Working as a waitress at Karen's Café and as a tutor at Tree Hill High presents her with opportunities, as well as obstacles. She finds herself in a predicament when Lucas's half-brother Nathan asks her to tutor him. Risking her relationship with Lucas, Haley agrees, but on the condition that her best friend is no longer tormented by Nathan and his friends. This arrangement changes the Scott family dynamic forever and allows a romance between Nathan and Haley to flourish. They experience many ups and downs together throughout the series and find themselves having to deal with the consequences of each other's actions.|$|E
