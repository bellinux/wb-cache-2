5|$|Alexander Godley {{was born}} in Chatham, Kent, England, on 4 February 1867, the eldest son of William Godley, a British Army captain of Irish heritage. His father's brother was John Robert Godley, the founder of Canterbury, New Zealand. When Godley was 13, his father died leaving the family in dire <b>financial</b> <b>straits.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4, their financial status was a different story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. They were in dire <b>financial</b> <b>straits</b> until the eleventh game of the season, when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered {{the history of the}} franchise.|$|E
5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in <b>financial</b> <b>straits,</b> his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E

50|$|FC Spartak Shchyolkovo (ФК Спартак Щёлково) is a Russian {{football}} club from Shchyolkovo, founded in 1992. It first {{played on the}} professional level in 1993. It came second in the division twice, just missing the promotion into the Russian First Division, in 1998 and 1999. In 2009, it was playing in the Russian Second Division, but on July 17 the team resigned from the Division (due to <b>financial</b> <b>strait)</b> after playing 18 games.|$|R
50|$|FC MVD Rossii (ФК МВД России Москва) is a Russian {{football}} club from Moscow, founded in 2007. It represents the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Historically the ministry {{was represented by}} FC Dynamo Moscow, but Dynamo is now not directly dependent on MVD. Still, several players on the 2008 FC MVD roster played for Dynamo or its youth teams in the past. In 2008, FC MVD won the West zone of the Russian Second Division and advanced to the Russian First Division. On July 17, 2009, the team resigned from the Russian First Division (due to <b>financial</b> <b>strait)</b> after playing 19 games.|$|R
5|$|Tiring of {{the back}} and forth, fair leaders demanded a meeting with Mint {{officials}} to settle {{the matter of the}} design. The Company was in severe <b>financial</b> <b>straits,</b> and money from the sale of the coins was needed. Leech agreed to send Barber to Chicago, where he met with the Finance Committee on September 23, 1892. It was agreed that the obverse would be based on the badges, and the reverse on Warner's caravel concept.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{left behind}} $15,000 in debts, {{and with the}} nation still {{in the throes of}} the Panic of 1819, his assets were not enough to pay off the obligations. His wife, who also fell ill and was {{pregnant}} with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent <b>financial</b> <b>straits</b> that she suffered a miscarriage. She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale. For several years, she was dependent upon her in-laws for survival; Breckinridge's brother, Robert, assumed Cabell's debts, which he paid in full in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Coupled {{with his}} {{interest}} on cars, Lee's project of building SMI {{as a global}} automotive company started out with technical assistance from Nissan, a company {{which at the time}} of SMI's early stages was in dire <b>financial</b> <b>straits.</b> SMI's affiliation with Nissan could {{have been one of the}} reasons for Renault buying a major share of the company, as Renault had become a major shareholder of Nissan by then. One of the very early planners for SMI has stated that technical affiliations for SMI were initially considered with Volkswagen, BMW or Honda. From 1998, Renault Samsung Motors sold cars in Chile with the introduction of the SQ5 (the current SM5).|$|E

5|$|In 1755, Kościuszko began {{attending}} school in Lyubeshiv, but never finished {{due to his}} family's <b>financial</b> <b>straits</b> after his father's death in 1758. Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski established a Corps of Cadets (Korpus Kadetów) in 1765, at what is now Warsaw University, to educate military officers and government officials. Kościuszko enrolled in the Corps on December 18, 1765, likely thanks to the patronage of the Czartoryski family. The school emphasized military subjects and the liberal arts, and after graduating on December 20, 1766, Kościuszko was promoted to chorąży (a military rank roughly equivalent to modern lieutenant); he stayed on as a student instructor and by 1768 had attained the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would {{find it hard to}} maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into <b>financial</b> <b>straits,</b> and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, it was hard for the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, he {{remained}} at his alma mater, Minnesota, for one season {{as an assistant}} coach in 1914. Tulane University selected Shaughnessy as head football coach in 1915 over potential candidates Dana X. Bible and Charley Moran, among others. Notre Dame assistant coach Knute Rockne and Ray Morrison were both unable to travel to New Orleans for an interview, and Tulane officials required a face-to-face meeting with the applicants. The school offered Shaughnessy $1,875 ($ adjusted for inflation) to be its football, basketball, and track coach, and athletic director. When he arrived, he found the football field in a state of disrepair and the equipment to be woefully inadequate. Because the athletic department was in dire <b>financial</b> <b>straits,</b> Shaughnessy paid to purchase new equipment for the team. With only one opponent scheduled in the upcoming season, he wrote letters to sixty schools to secure additional games.|$|E
50|$|The <b>financial</b> dire <b>straits</b> {{continued}} into the 2012-13 season, when Oviedo called on supporters to buy shares in the club. A few footballers, notably Santi Cazorla, Juan Mata, Michu and Adrián who all started their careers there, offered their financial support {{in an attempt to}} save the club from bankruptcy - the club had until 17 November to raise €2 million in order to prevent closure.|$|R
50|$|A {{fall in the}} {{oil price}} had {{resulted}} in a reduced willingness for the oil companies to pay higher prices to Lufttransport in order to entice competition.The three-year contract with Statoil and Norsk Hydro was not extended, leaving the company in <b>financial</b> dire <b>straits.</b> Lufttransport therefore contacted Helikopter Service, resulting in a merger from 1 January 1987. Helikopter Service took over all offshore operations, while land-based services continued in the subsidiary Lufttransport.|$|R

The Trust's first fundraising event was a match between the Millennium Allstars and the Wembley Wizards which saw former Latics players take to the Boundary Park pitch. The event raised over £100,000.|$|R
5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire <b>financial</b> <b>straits.</b> Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing a law of replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|Despite its severe <b>financial</b> <b>straits,</b> by 1953, DuMont {{appeared}} to be {{on its way to}} establishing itself as the third national network. DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, but it could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned-and-operated stations ("O"), plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) in Denver and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio. In contrast, ABC had a full complement of five O, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network (it was descended from NBC's Blue Network) from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty and a profit stream to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off {{as a result of the}} United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. antitrust decision), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger.|$|E
5|$|Kelley {{was named}} Orioles' captain and {{received}} some {{stock in the}} team. McGraw, player-manager of the Orioles, resigned from the team to take over as manager of the New York Giants on July 7, 1902. In his absence, Kelley and Wilbert Robinson took over in the interim. Under indefinite suspension by Ban Johnson by July 1902 for fighting with umpires, Kelley entertained the idea of leaving the Orioles with McGraw, who was becoming frustrated with Johnson, and had begun negotiating to join the New York Giants of the NL. With the team in <b>financial</b> <b>straits,</b> Kelley sold his shares of the Orioles to Mahon, who had purchased McGraw's shares when he left for New York, becoming principal shareholder of the Orioles. Mahon then sold controlling interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, on July 17. On the day they owned the franchise, they released the best players on the Orioles from their contracts {{so that they could}} be signed by National League teams: Kelley and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds, while McGinnity, Roger Bresnahan, Dan McGann, and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants. Johnson, along with Orioles minority owners, took control of the Orioles franchise, which had to forfeit their game that day as they did not have enough players. Kelley stated that the Orioles owed $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and that selling his shares was the only way Mahon could pay the team's debts.|$|E
50|$|July 27 - A U.S. Federal {{bankruptcy}} judge in New York dismisses claims by foreign investors {{that the bank}} knew the Italian company was in <b>financial</b> dire <b>straits</b> and profited from that information. This decision effectively limits the lawsuits to Parmalat investors who reside in the United States. This verdict also is extensible to Citigroup Inc., Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Grant Thornton. The $10B suit brought by former Parmalat CEO Enrico Bondi is still being disputed at this time.|$|R

5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire <b>financial</b> <b>straits</b> even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

5000|$|Within the ABA {{there was}} a growing disaffection with the {{leadership}} of ABA. The disaffected ABA members believed that Merl Mennenga, the {{founder and president of}} the ABA, led the ABA into <b>financial</b> dire <b>straits</b> like the ill-fated Bicycles and Dirt magazine affair and focused too much on nationals at the expense of local districts and tracks, thereby neglecting the sport's roots and potential new members. Mr. Mennenga's treatment of employees, the departure of former ABA Vice-President, Gene Roden, the BMX Action magazine and professional boycotts of the ABA of the early 1980s and his attitude toward local track operators was the genesis of the revolt.
