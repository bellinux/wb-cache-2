50|$|A {{common cause}} of {{brinelling}} {{is the use of}} improper installation procedures. Brinelling often occurs when pressing bearings into holes or onto shafts. Care must usually be taken to ensure that pressure is applied to the proper bearing race to avoid transferring the pressure from one race to the other through the balls or rollers. If pressing force is applied to the wrong race, brinelling can occur to either or both of the races. The act of pressing or clamping can also leave brinell marks, especially if the vise or press has serrated jaws or roughened surfaces. <b>Flat</b> <b>pressing</b> plates are often used in the pressing of bearings, while soft copper, brass, or aluminum jaw covers are often used in vises to help avoid brinell marks from being forced into the workpiece.|$|E

Reciprocative sliding experiments were performed under unlubricated conditions using a small-scale pin-on-plate tribometer. The worn surfaces of the investigated composites were analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and surface topography. Post-mortem obtained wear volume loss was compared to online measured wear depth. Wear rates were correlated to sliding distance and material parameters and microstructural characteristics. The experimental results revealed a significant dependence of the wear resistance of the ZrO 2 -based composites on loading conditions {{and the nature of the}} secondary phase. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Introduction. In sport {{technique}} studies, motion features can {{be useful}} as they have a certain defined measure [1]. In this work, we examined the following three features: {{the structure of the}} movement (all the characteristics of the movement), the fluency of the movement, and the rhythm of the movement. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the usefulness of the selected movement features in the evaluation of the flat bench press. The protocol of the study included a flat bench press with free weights and a “touch-and-go” technique. Material and methods. The study involved twenty healthy men; however, only two were selected for analysis. The first subject was a 25 -year-old powerlifter (body mass = 95 kg; body height = 182 cm; 1 -RM in flat bench press = 145 kg). The second one was a 25 -year-old bodybuilder (body mass = 77 kg; body height = 175 cm; 1 -RM in flat bench press = 100 kg). The subjects performed consecutive sets of a single repetition of <b>flat</b> bench <b>pressing</b> with an increasing load (70, 80, 90, and 100 % 1 -RM, with the anticipated maximum weight), until the completion of one repetition maximum. Multidimensional movement analysis was made with the measuring system Smart-E (BTS, Italy), which consisted of six infrared cameras (120 Hz) and a wireless module to measure muscle bioelectric activity (Pocket EMG). Results. It was demonstrated that the internal structure of the bench press performed by the bodybuilder and the powerlifter was different. As the time-history of barbell kinematics (the acceleration-time curve) showed, with increased loading of the barbell, the rhythm of the flat bench press changed, and the fluidity of the movement worsened...|$|R
40|$|In this study, four {{kinds of}} {{lignocellulosic}} fibers (LFs), namely, those from Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), Taiwan red pine (Pinus taiwanensis), India-charcoal trema (Trema orientalis) and makino bamboo (Phyllostachys makinoi), were selected as reinforcements and incorporated into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to manufacture wood-plastic composites (WPCs) by a <b>flat</b> platen <b>pressing</b> process. In addition to comparing {{the differences in}} the physico-mechanical properties of these composites, their chemical compositions were evaluated and their thermal decomposition kinetics were analyzed to investigate the effects of the lignocellulosic species on the properties of the WPCs. The results showed that the WPC made with Chinese fir displayed a typical M-shaped vertical density profile due to the high aspect ratio of its LFs, while a flat vertical density profile was observed for the WPCs made with other LFs. Thus, the WPC made with Chinese fir exhibited higher flexural properties and lower internal bond strength (IB) than other WPCs. In addition, the Taiwan red pine contained the lowest holocellulose content and the highest extractives and α-cellulose contents, which gave the resulting WPC lower water absorption and flexural properties. On the other hand, consistent with the flexural properties, the results of thermal decomposition kinetic analysis showed that the activation energy of the LFs at 10 % of the conversion rate increased in the order of Taiwan red pine (146 – 161 kJ/mol), makino bamboo (158 – 175 kJ/mol), India-charcoal trema (185 – 194 kJ/mol) and Chinese fir (194 – 202 kJ/mol). These results indicate that the morphology, chemical composition and thermal stability of the LFs can have a substantial impact on the physico-mechanical properties of the resulting WPCs...|$|R
40|$|Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) {{process is}} capable of {{developing}} the submicron grain structures in metallic alloys and to improve the Mechanical properties. Constrained groove pressing is a processing method in which a metal is subjected to an intense plastic deformation through repeated dominant shearing and <b>pressing</b> (<b>flatting)</b> of plate. This method comprises bending of straight billet with corrugated tools and the restoring the straight shape of the slab with flat tools. The repetition of the process is required to obtain a large strain and desired structural changes.

5000|$|Camper's {{main points}} {{in his first}} lecture were that {{classical}} drawing lessons {{from the time of}} Vitruvius, including the teachings of Dürer and Perreault, were based on an incorrect assumption that the human head was oval at all ages, and he proceeded to prove this with his dimensions of the skulls. He also remarked that none of the various humans of modern [...] "nations" [...] such as Europeans, Moors or Kalmyk people adhere to the classic form of head so remarkable in Grecian sculpture. The travelogues of Plinius and de Buffon made mention of practises in infancy which caused these national characteristics, such as Chinese women pulling their eye lids to the sides, or African Moors <b>pressing</b> their noses <b>flat,</b> or Europeans <b>pressing</b> their ears <b>flat</b> with caps tied tight. Camper claimed this was all nonsense and the forms of people's faces (and their skulls) were related to their living environments. He then proceeded to demonstrate on his sketches, by shortening the chin he could transform a likeness of a man to an old man, and by adjusting the facial angle, he changed a Moor into a European, and he was so successful in this demonstration with a few lines of chalk, that the hall cheered.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{two problems}} in medical imaging, {{the development of}} a system for 3 D imaging with ultrasound and a system for making titanium prostheses for cranioplasty. Central to both problems is the construction and depiction of surfaces from volume data where the data is not acquired on a regular grid or is incomplete. A system for acquiring 3 D pulse-echo ultrasound data using a conventional 2 D ultrasound scanner equipped with an electro-magnetic spatial locator is described. The non-parallel nature of 2 D B-scan slices acquired by the system requires the development of new visualisation algorithms to depict three dimensional structures. Two methods for visualising iso-valued surfaces from the ultrasound data are presented. One forms an intermediate volume reconstruction suitable for conventional ray-casting while the second method renders surfaces directly from the slice data. In vivo imaging of human anatomy is used to demonstrate reconstructions of tissue surfaces. Filtering and spatial compounding of scan data is used to reduce speckle. The manifestation of 2 D artefacts in 3 D surface reconstructions is also illustrated. Pulse-echo ultrasound primarily depicts tissue boundaries. These are characterised by incomplete acoustic interfaces contaminated by noise. The problem of reconstructing tissue interfaces from ultrasound data is viewed {{as an example of the}} general problem of reconstructing an object's shape from unorganised surface data. A novel method for reconstructing surfaces in the absence of a priori knowledge of the object's shape, is described and applied to 3 D ultrasound data. The method uses projections through the surface data taken from many viewpoints to reconstruct surfaces. Aspects of the method are similar to work in computer vision concerning the determination of the shape of 3 D objects from their silhouettes. This work is extended significantly in this thesis by considering the reconstruction of incomplete objects in the presence of noise and through the development of practical algorithms for pixel and voxel data. Furthermore, the reconstruction of realistic, non-convex objects is considered rather than simple geometric objects. 2 D and 3 D ultrasound data derived from phantoms, as well as artificial data, are used to demonstrate reconstructions. The second problem studied in this thesis concerns designing cranial implants to repair defects in the skull. Skull surfaces are extracted from X-ray CT data by ray-casting iso-valued surfaces. A tensor product B-spline interpolant is used in the ray-caster to reduce ripples in the surface data due to partial voluming and the large spacing between CT slices. The associated surface depth-maps are characterised by large irregular holes which correspond to the defect regions requiring repair. Defects are graphically identified by a user in surface-rendered images. Radial basis function approximation is introduced as a method of interpolating the surface of the skull across these defect regions. The fitted surface is used to produce CNC milling instructions to machine a mould in the shape of the surface from a block of hard plastic resin. A cranial implant is then formed by <b>pressing</b> <b>flat</b> titanium plate into the mould under high pressure in a hydraulic press. The system improves upon current treatment procedures by avoiding the manual aspects of fashioning an implant. It is also suitable when other techniques which use symmetry to reconstruct the skull are inadequate or not possible. The system has been successfully used to treat patients at Christchurch Hospital. Radial basis function (RBF) approximation has previously been restricted to problems where the number of interpolation centres is small. The use of newly developed fast methods for evaluating radial basis interpolants in the surface interpolation software results in a computationally efficient system for designing cranial implants and demonstrates that RBFs are potentially of wide interest in medical imaging and engineering problems where data does not lie on a regular grid...|$|R
