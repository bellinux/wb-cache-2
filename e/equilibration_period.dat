The empyreal part of the reservoir was covered with Saran Wrap®, and the liquid surface of the reservoir was separated from the air. The pulmonary arterial and left atrial cannula were both opened to the atmosphere, resulting in an intravascular pressure of 0  mmHg during ischemia. The isolated lungs were reperfused and reventilated for 60  min after ischemia. The flow velocity at the start of reperfusion was increased slowly to 30  ml/kg/min, so that the PPA did not exceed 20  mmHg.

40|$|AbstractThe redox and {{spectral}} {{characteristics of}} the 4 -heme cytochrome c unit of the photochemical reaction center from Rhodopseudomonas viridis were studied {{by a combination of}} protein electrochemistry and spectroscopy using an ultra thin-layer spectroelectrochemical cell. Quantitative and reversible reduction of the high-potential and the low-potential hemes was performed in cyclic titrations to record the optical difference spectra in the α-band region. The titration of the absorbance from the high-potential hemes can be approximated with a sum of 2 Nernst functions with Em = 0. 113 V and Em = 0. 175 V. The corresponding titration of the absorbance from the low-potential hemes yielded Em = − 0. 257 V and Em = − 0. 175 V (all potentials quoted vs. Ag/AgCl/ 3 M KCl; add 0. 208 V for potentials vs. standard hydrogen electrode). The high-potential hemes equilibrate rapidly and titrate identically for oxidative and reductive titrations. Under identical conditions, the low-potential hemes exhibit a hysteresis, thus indicating much slower equilibration with the applied potential. Cyclic titrations with increasing <b>equilibration</b> <b>periods,</b> however, indicate the disappearance of the hysteresis for <b>equilibration</b> <b>periods</b> approximately twice as long as for the high-potential hemes. We take this as evidence for a slower internal equilibration, but against a cooperativity of the low-potential hemes as observed for other multi-heme cytochromes...|$|R

It is therefore important to investigate ways to shorten the tests without affecting the quality of results. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of decreasing testing time by increasing flow rate and decreasing equilibration time compared to the conditions specified in ISO/TS 21268 - 3, with <b>equilibration</b> <b>periods</b> of 48 h and flow rate of 12 mL/h. We tested three <b>equilibration</b> <b>periods</b> (0, 12 ⿿ 16, and 48 h) and two flow rates (12 and 36 mL/h) on four different soils and compared the inorganic constituent releases. For soils A and D, we observed similar values for all conditions except for the 0 h⿿ 36 mL/h case. For soil B, we observed no appreciable differences between the tested conditions, while for soil C there were no consistent trends {{probably due to the}} difference in ongoing oxidation reactions between soil samples.

Since the SPRf of the soils calculated from the Freundlich equation (Table  3) is an estimate of P sorption potential (Wang et al. 2000) and an adequate external P requirement for most crops (Afif et al. 1993), diverse crop varieties in the study area could require different amount of P fertilizer.

To break the crystalline structure, a 20 -ps high-temperature pulse of 510 K (but not 450 or 480 K) was effective. The system finally obtained is an all-atom model, with Ewald summation to evaluate Coulombic interactions and a constant surface tension of 35 dynes/cm/water-membrane interface, equilibrated for 12 ns (over 50 ns total calculation time), which reproduces all of the experimentally observed parameters examined in this work.

40|$|Abstract — Implicit {{methods for}} {{reacting}} flow systems are considered efficient when {{expressed in terms}} of a time step length. A drawback of these methods is the additional work required at each time step for solving the sparse matrix of algebraic equations, which degrades their efficiency. Explicit methods are easy to implement but require excessively small steps. Predictor-corrector methods are another option, which utilise the concepts of both implicit and explicit methods. A recently proposed α-QSS (quasi steady state) method {{is an example of a}} second order predictor-corrector A-stable method. In the present study we carry out integration of a one dimensional laminar methane flame. During the integration of the methane mechanism the method requires small time steps where concentrations are rapidly varying. In the pre-heat and <b>equilibration</b> <b>periods,</b> the method is not efficient and unnecessarily takes smaller steps. An alteration is proposed in the convergence criteria which improves the efficiency of the method in the pre-heat and equilibration zones, and which results in a reduction in the computation time by a factor of 15. Due to the small time step, the temperature change at each step is also small, so an additional time saving can be achieved if rate coefficients are calculated only after a predetermined change in temperature...|$|R

Fertility of both processed-unfrozen and frozen-thawed semen was depressed with dilution rates of 0, 1 : 1, or 1 : 7. Fertility was highest with unfrozen (76 and 83 %) and frozen (14 and 15 %) semen with dilution rates of 1 : 3 or 1 : 5. When semen {{was held at}} 5 C for. 25, 1, 4, 6, or 8 hr before DMSO was added, fertility of frozen-thawed sperm was lowered to levels of less than 11 %, whereas the level of fertility (16 %) was highest with a holding time of 2 hr. Fertility of processed-unfrozen semen was lowered with a holding time of 6 hr; holding times of. 25, 1, or 2 hr {{had no effect on}} semen fertility. The DMSO levels of 4 or 6 % (v/v) significantly depressed fertility of processed-unfrozen semen, whereas DMSO levels of 0, 2, or 6 % provided less cryoprotection than the 4 % level in which fertility was highest at 22 %. Equilibration time of semen and 4 % DMSO resulted in decreased fertility levels from 82 % and 33 %, respectively, for periods of 4 or 6 hr for processed-unfrozen samples.

One ejaculate of 17 bulls was collected and divided into three equal aliquots and diluted, respectively, with the three extenders. Each aliquot was again divided into five parts and equilibrated for 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours before freezing in an automatic freezer. Sperm motility, plasma membrane and acrosome integrity (PMAI), and DNA fragmentation index (% DFI) were measured during equilibration. In addition to the parameters measured during equilibration, the percentage of viable sperm cells with high mitochondrial membrane potential (HMMP) was measured immediately after thawing, and after 3 hours of incubation at 37 °C. Sperm motility was assessed using CASA, and PMAI, HMMP, and % DFI were measured using flow cytometry. Equilibration time did affect all parameters before freezing (P 0. 05). In conclusion, extension of the equilibration time from 4 hours to 24 - 72 hours can improve motility and viability of cryopreserved semen after thawing.

40|$|Phosphonate antiscalants are {{commonly}} used in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis water treatment to prevent membrane fouling by mineral scale. In many circumstances it is desirable to remove these phosphonate compounds before concentrate disposal or further treatment. This research investigated the removal of phosphonate compounds from simulated membrane concentrate solutions using ferric hydroxide adsorbents. Two phosphonate antiscalants were investigated, Permatreat 191 ® (PT 191) and nitrilotrimethylphosphonic acid (NTMP). Batch adsorption isotherms and column breakthrough and regeneration experiments were performed on two commercial adsorbents and a ferric hydroxide loaded polyacrylonitrile fiber adsorbent prepared in our laboratory. The best performing adsorbent was Granular Ferric Hydroxide® (GFH) obtained from GEH Wasserchemie. Adsorption isotherms measured after 24 -hour <b>equilibration</b> <b>periods</b> showed initial concentration effects, whereby the isotherms were dependent on the initial adsorbate concentration in solution. Significant differences in adsorption behavior were observed between the PT 191 and the NTMP adsorbates. Differences in adsorption behavior between NTMP and PT 191 are all consistent with the PT 191 containing fewer phosphonate functional groups per molecule than NTMP. Desorption rates were bimodal, with 40 - 50 % of the adsorbed phosphonate being released on a time scale of 10 - 24 hours, while the remaining fraction was released approximately one order of magnitude more slowly. The slow desorbing fraction primarily resulted from equilibrium effects resulting from significant phosphonate adsorption, even in 1. 0 mol/L NaOH solutions. Complete regeneration could not be achieved, even after eluting the adsorbent columns with more than 300 bed volumes of 1. 0 mol/L NaOH. However, the incomplete regeneration had only a minor effect on phosphonate uptake in subsequent column breakthrough experiments...|$|R

To characterize the early proteome events induced by this trauma we compared proteome in muscle dialysate collected during the <b>equilibration</b> <b>period</b> with two hours later in "post-trauma". Samples were collected from healthy females using a 100 kDa MW cut off membrane and analyzed by high sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Proteins involved in stress response, immune system processes, inflammatory responses and nociception from extracellular and intracellular fluid spaces were identified. Sixteen proteins were found to be differentially abundant in samples collected during first two hours in comparison to "post-trauma".

40|$|Purpose Using {{reactive}} industrial by-products (IBPs) {{to reduce}} phosphorus (P) losses associated with diffuse water pollution is a potentially cost-effective mitigation strategy. However, IBPs must be screened {{to assess their}} effectiveness and optimum application rates. This requires accurate estimates of parameters such as the maximum P sorption capacity. Traditionally, these parameters have been derived from the Langmuir model applied to data from batch sorption experiments following a 24 -h <b>equilibration</b> <b>period.</b> In this paper, we examined (i) how equilibration time can influence estimates of the maximum P sorption capacity for IBPs and (ii) the relative P sorption characteristics {{of a range of}} IBPs available in the UK. Materials and methods Four IBPs containing different reactive components including ochre, aluminium (Al) -based water treatment residual (WTR), iron (Fe) -based WTR and Fe-lime (CaO) -based WTR were selected for this study. The maximum P sorption capacities of these IBPs were determined using a linearized Langmuir model applied to batch sorption data collected at different equilibration times of 24 h, 5 days and 10 days. Results and discussion The maximum P sorption capacity of ochre, Al-based WTR, Fe-based WTR and Fe-CaO-based WTR estimated from the linearized Langmuir model following a 24 -h <b>equilibration</b> <b>period</b> was 10. 1, 13. 7, 2. 4 and 9. 3 mg P g− 1, respectively. However, extending the equilibration time from 24 h to 5 days increased the estimated maximum P sorption capacity for these IBPs by factors of 2. 2, 2. 1, 6. 8 and 2. 3, respectively. No significant increase was found in estimates of the maximum P sorption capacity when further extending the equilibration time to 10 days. Conclusions A minimum <b>equilibration</b> <b>period</b> of 5 days is recommended to avoid underestimating the maximum P sorption capacity of the IBPs examined in this paper. Each of the IBPs we evaluated was able to sorb P from solution, although with variable capacity (maximum sorption capacity after 5 days of equilibration ranged from 16. 3 – 28. 5 mg P g− 1).

Gene banking of non-human primate sperm {{is still in its}} infancy. The objective {{of the present study was}} to initiate a systematic approach to optimize the process of sperm cryopreservation for rhesus macaques, specifically, factors related to pre-freezing conditions (eg. straw freezing position, sperm concentration, sperm washing, equilibration methods, and <b>equilibration</b> time <b>periods).</b> Straw position had no effect on post-thaw motility (P = 0. 193). Sperm concentration was tested in a range from 5 × 106 /mL to 5 × 108 /mL; post-thaw motility of sperm samples frozen at 5 × 107 cell/mL (51. 0 ± 10. 6 %; mean ± SD) and 5 × 108 cell/mL (48. 1 ± 7. 3 %) were higher than samples frozen at 5 × 106 cells/mL (33. 0 ± 12. 0 %, P = 0. 003). Comparison of motility immediately after thawing between samples with (51. 2 ± 6. 2 %) and without washing (53. 9 ± 6. 8 %) revealed no differences (P> 0. 05). However, washing improved sperm forward progression within 1 h after thawing, whereas unwashed sperm retained higher post-thaw motility and progression during extended incubation (4 h) after thawing (P 0. 05), and the most effective equilibration time was the duration required for samples to acclimate to 4 °C prior to freezing. Evaluation and optimization of these pre-freezing conditions will help to minimize sources of injury, maximize survival, and contribute to the development of an optimized cryopreservation protocol for rhesus macaque sperm...|$|R
40|$|Deuterium nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to study the partitioning behaviour of 1 -hexanol specifically deuterated in the alpha-position into model lipid bilayers. In all systems studied, the observed deuterium NMR lineshapes were time-dependent. Initially, 1 -hexanol-d 2 gave rise to an isotropic deuterium resonance with a different chemical shift from that of aqueous 1 -hexanol-d 2. After <b>equilibration</b> over a <b>period</b> of days, a broader spectral component characteristic of a spherically-averaged powder-pattern was observed. The quadrupole anisotropy of the 1 -hexanol-d 2 giving rise to the broad spectrum depended upon the cholesterol content of the membrane. From quantitation of the anisotropic to isotropic deuterium NMR spectra, the partition coefficients of 1 -hexanol-d 2 {{in a number of}} bilayer systems (asolectin and phosphatidylcholine bilayers (the latter with and without cholesterol] were determined. The partitioning of 1 -hexanol-d 2 into red blood cell membranes, and a suspension of lipids extracted from red blood cell membranes, was also examined. It is suggested that 1 -hexanol, and probably other lipophiles, can partition to either the bilayer surface or the bilayer interior in a time-dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|For {{geological}} {{storage of}} CO 2 to be successful, maintaining caprock and fault integrity is crucial. Anhydrite rock occurs commonly as sealing formation and it forms the caprock at {{several of the}} trial CO 2 injection sites being considered in the Netherlands. However, anhydrite can react with CO 2 and water under in-situ conditions, leading to anhydrite-calcite replacement. This {{is associated with a}} solid volume decrease of about 20 % and thus potentially yields porosity increase. An understanding of the role of these coupled chemical-mechanical processes is therefore essential to assess sealing capacity. Anhydrite dissolution forms a key aspect in controlling such phenomena. However, very little data on the nature and rate of the anhydrite dissolution process exist. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the dissolution behaviour of anhydrite, with emphasis on the reaction rates, controlling mechanisms, microstructural evolution and the implications for sealing capacity. A multi-experiment approach was adopted. First, batch-reactor dissolution experiments were performed at 25 to 80 °C and pH values of 3 to 6, measuring solid mass loss and fluid composition as a function of time. Second, dissolution rate experiments were conducted in a flow-through reactor at 25 °C to reach surface reaction controlled dissolution. Third, samples were analysed by reflected light microscopy to assess whether a significant increase in permeability is to be expected. Last, the effects of calcite precipitation on the dissolution behaviour were studied, simulating the presence of high pCO 2 during dissolution using NaCO 3 solutions. Anhydrite dissolution was transport controlled in all batch-experiments, even those conducted at high stirring rates, and accelerates with decreasing pH and increasing temperature (Ea of about 22 kJ/mol). In the flow-through experiments, average flow velocities orders of magnitude higher than occurring in natural groundwaters were needed to reach surface reaction control. The rate of surface reaction controlled anhydrite dissolution is very fast, occurring at rates ranging 2 – 4 • 10 - 4 mol m- 2 s- 1 at 25 °C, and is characterized by a rather high apparent activation energy (Ea) of about 80 kJ/mol. Under reservoir conditions, anhydrite dissolution is probably diffusion controlled. Anhydrite-calcite replacement was achieved in analogue experiments. Calcite precipitates as encrustations at the reaction interface and microstructural analysis suggest dissolution is less penetrative. Slightly decreasing dissolution rates were observed over the course of 10 consecutive experiments, indicating the reaction can slow down dissolution effectively. Anhydrite dissolution is slow in absence of significant convective transport. Simple diffusion models show that only about 20 to 35 % of the equilibrium concentration will be attained in periods of 10, 000 to 50, 000 years. Complete <b>equilibration</b> would take <b>periods</b> in the order 1 Myr, much longer than timescales over which subsurface CO 2 storage is considered. Advective transport could accelerate dissolution. However, this is unlikely as it would be destructive for anhydrite prior to CO 2 injection. This limits anhydrite caprock dissolution to further solubility introduced by the build-up of pCO 2 upon injection. When dissolution is complete and occurs along the entire caprock surface, models yield retreat distances of less than 50 cm before equilibrium is reached. Given the nature of anhydrite dissolution and the typical thickness of Zechstein caprock of about 50 m this would therefore not constitute a significant decrease. For reservoirs where the caprock is less than 10 meter thick, maintenance of sealing capacity will depend on the local hydrological conditions. It is uncertain whether anhydrite-calcite replacement will occur on the reservoir scale, as preliminary reaction models and experiments contradict. However, most indications are that occurrence of this reaction would rather slow than enhance anhydrite caprock dissolution. Concluding, the results obtained in this study corroborate that no significant chemical degradation effects are to be expected from CO 2 storage. However, further work on the penetration of anhydrite by CO 2 -H 2 O solutions and the resulting microstructures, as well as on anhydrite-calcite replacement is desirable to assess this in a more quantitative way. Also, the effects of CO 2 on the solubility of anhydrite need to be defined in order to constrain the effects of subsurface CO 2 storage in anhydrite capped reservoirs where dissolution up to length-scales of 1 m would be hazardous...|$|R

40|$|Pseudo-ternary phase {{diagrams}} of {{the polar}} lipids Quil A, cholesterol (Chol) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) in aqueous mixtures prepared by the lipid film hydration method (where dried lipid film of phospholipids and cholesterol are hydrated by an aqueous solution of Quil A) were investigated {{in terms of the}} types of particulate structures formed therein. Negative staining transmission electron microscopy and polarized light microscopy were used to characterize the colloidal and coarse dispersed particles present in the systems. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were established for lipid mixtures hydrated in water and in Tris buffer (pH 7. 4). The effect of equilibration time was also studied with respect to systems hydrated in water where the samples were stored for 2 months at 4 degreesC. Depending on the mass ratio of Quil A, Chol and PC in the systems, various colloidal particles including ISCOM matrices, liposomes, ring-like micelles and worm-like micelles were observed. Other colloidal particles were also observed as minor structures in the presence of these predominant colloids including helices, layered structures and lamellae (hexagonal pattern of ring-like micelles). In terms of the conditions which appeared to promote the formation of ISCOM matrices, the area of the phase diagrams associated with systems containing these structures increased in the order: hydrated in water/short <b>equilibration</b> <b>period</b> < hydrated in buffer/short <b>equilibration</b> <b>period</b> < hydrated in water/prolonged <b>equilibration</b> <b>period.</b> ISCOM matrices appeared to form over time from samples, which initially contained a high concentration of ring-like micelles suggesting that these colloidal structures may be precursors to ISCOM matrix formation. Helices were also frequently found in samples containing ISCOM matrices as a minor colloidal structure. Equilibration time and presence of buffer salts also promoted the formation of liposomes in systems not containing Quil A. These parameters however, did not appear to significantly affect the occurrence and predominance of other structures present in the pseudo-binary systems containing Quil A. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams of PC, Chol and Quil A are important to identify combinations which will produce different colloidal structures, particularly ISCOM matrices, by the method of lipid film hydration. Colloidal structures comprising these three components are readily prepared by hydration of dried lipid films and may have application in vaccine delivery where the functionality of ISCOMs has clearly been demonstrated.
