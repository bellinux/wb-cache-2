25|$|To make typographic apostrophes {{easier to}} enter, word {{processing}} and publishing software often converts typewriter apostrophes to typographic apostrophes during text entry (at {{the same time}} converting opening and closing single and double quotes to their correct left-handed or right-handed forms). A similar facility may be offered on web servers after submitting text in a <b>form</b> <b>field,</b> e.g. on weblogs or free encyclopedias. This {{is known as the}} smart quotes feature; apostrophes and quotation marks that are not automatically altered by computer programs are known as dumb quotes.|$|E
25|$|Another cross-site {{vulnerability}} is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser {{into taking}} actions the user didn't intend at a target site (like transferring {{money at a}} bank). It works because, if the target site relies only on cookies to authenticate requests, then requests initiated by code on the attacker's site will carry the same legitimate login credentials as requests initiated by the user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden <b>form</b> <b>field,</b> and {{not only in the}} cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} after recalling the Schouten and de Rham {{definition}} of impair and pair differential <b>form</b> <b>fields</b> (not {{to be confused}} with differential <b>form</b> <b>fields</b> of even and odd grades) we prove that in a relativistic spacetime it is possible (despite claims in contrary) to coherently formulate electromagnetism (and we believe any other physical theory) using only pair <b>form</b> <b>fields</b> or if one wishes, using pair and impair <b>form</b> <b>fields</b> together, in an appropriate way. Those two distinct descriptions involve only a mathematical choice and do not seem to lead to any observable physical consequence if due care is taken. Moreover, we show in details that a formulation of electromagnetic theory in the Clifford bundle formalism of differential forms is compatible with both formulations of electromagnetism just mentioned above. We recall also a formulation of the engineering version of Maxwell equations using electric and magnetic fields as objects of the same nature, i. e., without using polar and axial vectors. ...|$|R
