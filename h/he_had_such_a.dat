25|$|His highest score, coincidentally, was 30 in both {{forms of}} the game. By {{the end of his}} career, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{reputation}} for poor batting that the crowd would cheer every ball he faced. Whether this was in appreciation of his batting or an attempt to wind up the bowling side is open to interpretation. Walsh is a much loved and respected cricketer and the West Indies have arguably yet to find a fast bowler with anything approaching his talents.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1882 {{and brought}} up at Hurlditch Court, near Tavistock near the Devon–Cornwall border, Henry Morshead was the eldest son of Reginald Morshead, a banker, and Ella Mary Morshead, née Sperling. He was educated at Winchester College where he did {{reasonably}} well and at a second attempt passed the exams to enter the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, to become {{an officer in the}} Royal Engineers in 1901. At the Chatham Royal School of Military Engineering <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> distinguished record that in 1904 he was posted to the Indian Army in the Royal Engineers' Military Works Services at Agra.|$|E
500|$|In another {{interview}} he added, [...] "It was exciting {{to work for}} him [...] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people.

500|$|Boswell and Johnson {{discussed}} the subject during their 1773 {{tour of the}} Hebrides. Boswell wrote: [...] "After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange’s being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M’Leod would {{let it be known}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{biography}} Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness, written by journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli, the pop singer had shown an early {{attachment to the}} story of E.T. After a publicity photo shoot for the soundtrack album in which an animatronic robot of the extraterrestrial character hugged Jackson, the singer stated with wonderment, [...] "He was so real that I was talking to him. I kissed him before I left. The next day, I missed him." [...] Jackson later revealed in the December 1982 issue of Ebony magazine—in which both he and E.T. appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> strong connection to the character: ...|$|E
500|$|Balotelli {{has been}} the subject of {{numerous}} newspaper stories since joining Manchester City; some have been confirmed as true while others have turned out to be erroneous. Within days of joining Manchester City, Balotelli was involved in a car crash. It was reported that Balotelli was carrying £5,000 cash at the time – and that when a police officer asked why <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large sum of cash Balotelli replied: [...] "Because I am rich". Off-field activities involving Balotelli have included driving into a women's prison in Italy to [...] "have a look round", and throwing darts at a youth team player during a training ground 'prank' – all of which have been confirmed to be true. Balotelli has also been subjected to tabloid rumours about him confronting a bully in a school after querying why a young Manchester City fan was not attending classes, and giving £1,000 to a homeless man on the streets of Manchester. Both of these reports turned out to be false.|$|E

500|$|Being very {{handsome}} in his person, {{and of a}} tall stature, his lordship one day attended King William's court, and being admitted into the presence-chamber, asserted the privilege of being covered before his majesty, by walking to and fro with his hat on his head. The king observing him, sent one of his attendants to inquire the reason of his appearance before him with his head covered; to whom he replied, he knew very well in whose presence he stood, {{and the reason why}} he wore his hat that day was, because he stood before the king of England. This answer being told the king, and his lordship approaching nearer the throne, was required by his majesty to explain himself, which he did to this effect: [...] "May it please your majesty, my name is Courcy, and I am Lord of Kingsale in your kingdom of Ireland: the reason of my appearing covered in your majesty's presence is, to assert the ancient privilege of my family, granted to sir John de Courcy, earl of Ulster, and his heirs, by John, king of England, for him and his successors for ever." [...] The king replied, he remembered <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> nobleman, and believed the privilege he asserted to be his right, and giving him his hand to kiss, his lordship paid his obeisance, and remained covered.|$|E
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> [...] "clean record {{they have got to}} try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Artist Leslie Jencel {{was quoted}} as saying I'm wearing my black leather cape today because De Hirsh would have wanted me to.

2500|$|In 2002 Navetta and Lombardo joined Stevenson for {{a reunion}} {{performance}} by the Descendents' original power trio lineup at Stevenson's Stockage festival in Fort Collins, Colorado. According to Lombardo, they also recorded some songs for a potential future release: [...] "We recorded some of my songs in 2006 at The Blasting Room. In 2002 we recorded {{a whole bunch of}} songs, mostly Frank's songs. He was a great songwriter. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> unique EQ out of his amp. When we recorded later in 2008, we did some more of my songs, but Frank wasn't there for that. We tried to recreate that unique Frank sound. I'd like to think of these as songs that if the Descendents had stayed together, this is what we would have sounded like. Those are in Bill's hands. Milo has said from the get-go that he would record it, but he hasn't yet." ...|$|E
