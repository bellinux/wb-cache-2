5|$|As the BBC {{broadcasting}} {{unit was}} about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} the supplier had modified the <b>drive</b> <b>units,</b> meaning the LS3/5 design had to be fundamentally revised. The BBC's Designs Department was called upon to adapt the product in light of the supply changes. Modifications were made to adapt to the new <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> and deal with the altered resonance pattern, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A.|$|E
5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E
5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual <b>drive</b> <b>units,</b> each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
50|$|Since the Tactic <b>Drive</b> <b>Unit,</b> Wilson Benesch has {{introduced}} the Wide Bandwidth One <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> with {{the launch of}} the Wide Bandwidth Collection in 2007. And following this the Tactic II <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> which the company refers to as the third iteration of the original Tactic.|$|R

50|$|A {{loudspeaker}} <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> (typically a woofer or subwoofer <b>drive</b> <b>unit)</b> may be approximated as {{a series}} connection of a zero-impedance voltage source, a resistor, a capacitor and an inductor. The values depend on the specifications of the unit and the wavelength of interest.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the speaker}} uses bought-in drivers, {{they have been}} rebuilt using {{stronger}} materials. Drivers' metal baskets are treated to reduce the effects of vibration, and the enclosure designed and constructed to control energy. The <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from KEF in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet. However, Linn found the T27 tweeter too fragile {{and replaced it with}} the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak after a very short run; the Scan-Speak tweeter was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark. The midrange KEF B110, known for its use in the LS3/5A BBC monitor, is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping. The woofer is a KEF B139.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} <b>drive</b> <b>units.</b> However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E
5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, particular the woofer. Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Wilson Benesch {{was awarded}} a second DTi Grant under the SMART Award scheme. Wilson Benesch were awarded £250,000 for an {{application}} that outlined a proposal {{to develop a new}} dynamic <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> based around materials technology previously not used in <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> design. The project was code named 'The Bishop Project' by Wilson Benesch. The outcome was the company's Tactic Multirole <b>Drive</b> <b>Unit.</b> The <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> features a Neodymium Rare Earth Magnet and an Isotactic Polypropylene cone that was developed through collaborative research with the University of Leeds and Professor Ian Ward. The first product which used this drive technology was the Bishop loudspeaker in 1999. The drive technology was also subsequently used in the company's Odyssey Range and the Square Series.|$|R
40|$|During the {{placement}} of components in micro-assembly, high impact forces occur. The current approach is to reduce these impact forces by coupling the gripper to the <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> of {{the placement}} device with 5 DOF, wherein the gripper that contacts the component has a relatively low mass. To prevent the gripper from bouncing back {{at the end of}} the placement collision a force must be exerted between gripper and <b>drive</b> <b>unit,</b> which can significantly increase the impact forces. A solution has been found to realise an adequate force build-up between gripper and <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> such that a rebounce of the gripper is prevented without significantly increasing the impact forces. This solution can be implemented relatively easily by placing a spring between gripper and <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> combined with a force limiter...|$|R

500|$|Upon {{obtaining a}} BBC licence to produce legacy 11-ohm LS3/5A, Stirling Broadcast {{commissioned}} KEF to produce new T27 and B110 <b>drive</b> <b>units.</b> Stirling had {{to rethink the}} product when KEF finally ceased manufacturing the <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> in about 2000. Working with drivers from SEAS and Scanspeak, Derek Hughes developed for Stirling a new crossover that enabled the new proprietary drivers to mimic {{the response of the}} original KEF drivers they replaced. Specifically, the T27 was replaced by a 19mm doped fabric dome tweeter. The mid–bass unit is a formed polypropylene co-polymer cone to which a damping coating has been applied and given a synthetic rubber roll surround. The crossover has three settings of relative high frequency level, in steps of 0.5dB. Each crossover is tuned to the specific pairs of <b>drive</b> <b>units.</b> While Stirling's revision deviates technically from the specification, the company took steps to research and test to ensure the LS3/5A sound was preserved, [...] "warts and all". Stirling added a [...] "V2" [...] to the designation when the product was launched in 2005 in an act of transparency, even though the broadcaster has endorsed it.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{not being}} a [...] "commercial product" [...] at the outset, the LS3/5A was commercially {{successful}} in its twenty-something-year life, from 1975 until approximately 2000, when the availability of KEF <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> came to an end. The speaker has amassed an [...] "enthusiastic, focused, and loyal [...] following, and none so large or vocal", according to Paul Seydor in The Absolute Sound.|$|E

500|$|Preceding the 3/5A, KEF's Cresta (1967), KEFKIT4 (1969), Cresta II (1970), Coda (1971) {{were all}} 2-way {{loudspeakers}} that used the B110/T27 combination. KEF released its CS1 constructor kit (1981) {{to tap the}} home-build market.

The Kan was discontinued in 1990.|$|E
500|$|An {{electrostatic}} speaker {{has only a}} frame to support the charged diaphragm. It uses ultra-thin stretched Mylar (Biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate) film as {{the main component of}} its <b>drive</b> <b>units.</b> There are two perforated plates with a potential difference of up to 10,000 volts, between which a very thin film, coated with a mildly electrically conductive substance, is sandwiched. Sound is produced when the audio signal [...] amplified by a step-up transformer [...] sets the film diaphragm into motion. The different charge between the two plates allows the diaphragm to be alternately attracted and repelled by each plate. In the original QUAD, two bass panels flank one treble panel to provide full range sound.|$|E

500|$|Since {{even the}} early days of {{stereophonic}} sound, designers were faced with the issue of directionality and the listener who was not located exactly in between the two speaker units. Col. Richard R.

500|$|Hilliard's {{continued}} {{contact with}} Lansing and Blackburn {{led to a}} conversation about the poor state of loudspeakers in movie theaters.

Hilliard was made responsible for the concept and design of the project. Lansing Manufacturing was tapped to develop the <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> while Hilliard worked to improve the electronic components.

500|$|Falcon Acoustics {{was granted}} a licence by the BBC for the 15 ohm version of the LS3/5a in 2013 and {{commenced}} production in 2014 using <b>drive</b> <b>units</b> produced in-house by Falcon Acoustics. The Falcon F B110 bass unit is a re-engineered version using the same components of the original KEF B110 SP1003 with a doped Bextrene cone and a neoprene surround. The Falcon F T27 tweeter again uses the same components as the original KEF T27 SP1032 and has a 19mm mylar dome fitted. Both Falcon units were designed by Malcolm Jones who while employed at KEF between 1962 and 1974 {{was responsible for the}} design of the KEF B110 and T27 units originally used in the LS3/5 and LS3/5a. Both units are graded/selected to meet the BBC specification.

50|$|An {{intermediate}} development {{between the}} Bendix drive {{developed in the}} 1930s and the overrunning-clutch designs introduced in the 1960s was the Bendix Folo-Thru drive. The standard Bendix drive would disengage from the ring gear {{as soon as the}} engine fired, even if it did not continue to run. The Folo-Thru drive contains a latching mechanism and a set of flyweights {{in the body of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>unit.</b> When the starter motor begins turning and the <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is forced forward on the helical shaft by inertia, it is latched into the engaged position. Only once the <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> is spun at a speed higher than that attained by the starter motor itself (i.e., it is backdriven by the running engine) will the flyweights pull radially outward, releasing the latch and permitting the overdriven <b>drive</b> <b>unit</b> to be spun out of engagement. In this manner, unwanted starter disengagement is avoided before a successful engine start.|$|R
