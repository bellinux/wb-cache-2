5|$|Stela 8 is a well-preserved {{monument}} on {{the south}} side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and <b>feet,</b> <b>together</b> with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K'iche' people.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim is to}} land on, or ideally surpass, a line marked {{across the}} hill called the 'K-point', 'critical point', or 'calculation line'. In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead of landing with simply both <b>feet</b> <b>together</b> (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly {{in front of the}} other (without sliding the skis), both feet held no more than four ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose must be maintained until the 'outrun' – a line at the very end of the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement of landing is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a Telemark landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins to flatten out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a Telemark landing.|$|E

25|$|Flips {{such as a}} salto or layout may be {{performed}} after a handspring; these may twist as well as flip. Similarly, a handspring may be preceded by another rotational move, such as a cartwheel landing with the <b>feet</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is a basic}} {{standing}} asana in most {{forms of}} yoga with <b>feet</b> <b>together</b> and hands {{at the sides of}} the body. There is some contention between different styles of yoga regarding the details of the asana which results in some variations.|$|E

25|$|Another type of urbanlining is streetlining, which {{combines}} street workout power moves with the slackline's dynamic, shaky, bouncy feeling. Main focus are static handstands, super splits— hands and <b>feet</b> <b>together,</b> planche, front lever, back lever, one arm handstand and other interesting extreme moves that are evolving in street workout culture.|$|E
25|$|Parade Rest: {{the command}} {{that tells the}} band to put their feet {{shoulder}} wide and join both hands {{in the front of}} their body or to put both <b>feet</b> <b>together</b> or in a V-formation and roll their elbows out and put both hands in fists resting on the hip (the upper-body portion is usually only utilized when marching without instruments, sometimes the second option's lower body form and the first option's upper-body form is used).|$|E
25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your <b>feet</b> <b>together</b> and place your hands, palm down, on the ground in a straight line with your body by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when knees are bent. However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Cautionary Tales", Elle {{comes back}} to the United States. Former Company {{employee}} Noah Bennet captures Elle for collateral, as Bob had captured his daughter, Claire. He ties Elle's hands to a chair and ties her bare <b>feet</b> <b>together</b> and puts them in a metal dog bath which is full with water. Elle tries to use her abilities while in the dog bath, but she shocks herself. During this time, Noah tells Elle that Bob allowed the Company to perform tests on her which had begun as early as the age of seven. This included subjecting her to high doses of electricity, which scarred her emotionally for life. Elle has no recollection of the tests, and Noah suggests the Haitian had a role in causing Elle to forget her experiences. After an agreement is made, she is reunited with Bob and Claire momentarily reunited with Noah. However, Elle attacks Claire and West as they leave. She tries to attack Noah, but he shoots Elle in the arm before she can hurt him or anyone else. As it seems Noah is going to kill Bob, Mohinder Suresh, a scientist working with Noah and the Company, shoots and kills Noah. Elle leaves with Bob and Mohinder, giving Bob a look of distrust.|$|E

2500|$|Calf roping, {{also called}} [...] "tie-down roping," [...] {{is an event}} where a calf is roped around the neck by a lariat, the horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws {{it to the ground}} and ties three <b>feet</b> <b>together.</b> (If the horse throws the calf, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work.

2500|$|Calf Roping, {{also called}} Tie-down roping, {{is based on}} ranch work in which calves are roped for branding, medical treatment, or other purposes. It is the oldest of rodeo's timed events. The cowboy ropes a running calf around the neck with a lariat, and his horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws {{it to the ground}} and ties three <b>feet</b> <b>together.</b> (If the calf falls when roped, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work.) The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope. [...] A well-trained calf-roping horse will slowly back up while the cowboy ties the calf, to help keep the lariat snug.|$|E
2500|$|When {{his son is}} born, {{the king}} consults an oracle as to his fortune. [...] To his horror, the oracle reveals that Laius [...] "is doomed to perish by the hand of his own son". [...] Laius binds the infant's <b>feet</b> <b>together</b> with a pin, and orders Jocasta to kill him. [...] Unable to kill her own son, Jocasta orders a servant to slay the infant for her. [...] The servant then exposes the infant on a mountaintop, where he is found and rescued by a {{shepherd}} (in some versions, the servant gives the infant to the shepherd). [...] The shepherd names the child Oedipus, [...] "swollen feet", as his feet had been tightly bound by Laius. [...] The shepherd brings the infant to Corinth, and presents him to the childless king Polybus, who raises Oedipus as his own son.|$|E
