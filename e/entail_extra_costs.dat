50|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of incorporating peace-building and state-building in the same model, applicational limitations should be recognised. In practice, foreign and security policy making still largely treat them as separate issues. Moreover, academics often approach the subjects from different angles. Heathershaw and Lambach caution that in practice, interventions that attempt the ambitious goals that Paris (amongst others) sets out may be coercive and driven by a 'the end justifies the means' outlook. This concern is acute in United Nations peacekeeping missions for there have been instances where peace-builders aspire not only to {{go a step further}} and eradicate the causes of violence, which are oftentimes not agree upon by the parties to the conflict, but also to invest 'post-conflict societies with various qualities, including democracy {{in order to reduce the}} tendency toward arbitrary power and give voice to all segments of society; the rule of law in order to reduce human rights violations; a market economy free from corruption in order to discourage individuals from believing that the surest path to fortune is by capturing the state; conflict management tools; and a culture of tolerance and respect'. Such ambitious goals are questionable when the United Nations has been seen to struggle in high-profile conflict-ridden situations such as Darfur and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Where it has accomplished a degree of stability such as in Haiti and Liberia, it endures pressure 'to transition from heavy and costly security-oriented peacekeeping operations to lighter, peace-building-oriented missions'. Introducing state-building to mandates is controversial not only because this would <b>entail</b> <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> and commitments but also because 'the expansion of peacekeeping into these areas has de facto extended the authority of the Security Council, with political, financial, institutional, and bureaucratic implications that have yet to be fully addressed'.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundType 2 endoleaks after {{endovascular}} aortic repair (EVAR) still {{represent a}} problematic issue for vascular surgeon {{to stop the}} aneurysmal degeneration of the unsuccessfully excluded aneurysm. This {{study was designed to}} assess the efficacy of secondary interventions performed on continuing expanding abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) after EVAR with an identified type 2 endoleak. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed patients treated by EVAR for AAA, in which follow-up data of more than 1 year were available. Endoleak incidences, sac diameters, and secondary procedures were collected. Patients with type 2 endoleaks and continuing expanding AAA were identified. Primary endpoint was the efficacy of these reinterventions on the postoperative AAA diameter course. Secondary endpoints were the aneurysm-related morbidity and mortality, and the cost effectiveness of these complementary procedures. ResultsOut of 232 reviewed patients treated by EVAR for AAA, with a mean follow-up of 3 years (37 ± 30 months), 15 type 1 (6. 5 %), 94 type 2 (40. 5 %), and 8 type 3 (3. 5 %) endoleaks were identified. Among the 94 AAA with a type 2 endoleak, 21 presented a sac regression (22. 5 %), 46 were stable (49. 5 %), and 27 presented a sac enlargement (28 %). Eight of these last subgroup of patients had another type of endoleak associated that required particular treatments. Among the 19 patients presenting a type II endoleak responsible for sac enlargement, 15 were indicated for embolisation procedures, 1 was treated by immediate open repair, and 3 are still under surveillance. Among the 15 patients treated by embolisation, 9 (60 %) had still an aortic sac enlargement postoperatively, requiring finally 6 open repairs with one postoperative death. The mean extra cost by patient induced by secondary procedures for type 2 endoleak was 27110 ± 3098 Euros. ConclusionIn our experience, endovascular reinterventions for type 2 endoleaks associated with an aortic sac enlargement after EVAR have a poor efficiency on the stabilization of AAA diameter.

40|$|Abstract — Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) is {{introduced}} {{to shorten the}} software development time, produce better quality of code and promote the reuse of software artifacts.

Here we follow historic intuition that all physical information processing systems will share key organizational properties, such as modularity, that generally confer adaptivity of function. It {{has long been}} observed that modular VLSI circuits demonstrate an isometric scaling relationship {{between the number of}} processing elements and the number of connections, known as Rent’s rule, which is related to the dimensionality of the circuit’s interconnect topology and its logical capacity. We show that human brain structural networks, and the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans, also obey Rent’s rule, and exhibit some degree of hierarchical modularity. We further show that the estimated Rent exponent of human brain networks, derived from MRI data, can explain the allometric scaling relations between gray and white matter volumes across a wide range of mammalian species, again suggesting that these principles of nervous system design are highly conserved. For each of these fractal modular networks, the dimensionality of the interconnect topology was greater than the 2 or 3 Euclidean dimensions of the space in which it was embedded.

Produced by Bettcher Manufacturing Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, Panelblocs are applicable to industrial or other facilities which have ceilings more than 12 feet high, such as those pictured: at left the Bare Hills Tennis Club, Baltimore, Maryland and at right, CVA Lincoln- Mercury, Gaithersburg, Maryland. The heaters are mounted high above the floor and they radiate infrared energy downward. Panelblocs do not waste energy by warming the surrounding air. Instead, they beam invisible heat rays directly to objects which absorb the radiation- people, floors, machinery and other plant equipment. All these objects in turn re-radiate the energy to the air. A key element in the Panelbloc design is a coating applied to the aluminized steel outer surface of the heater. This coating must be corrosion resistant at high temperatures and it must have high "emissivity"-the ability of a surface to emit radiant energy.

Such a decision involves trade-offs between expected strategic and financial {{benefits and costs}} of managing and financing a portfolio of ventures, which {{are influenced by the}} institutions and regulations that affect innovation-oriented entrepreneurship. We determine that companies are more likely to run a program if they are based in countries in which the market for early-stage investments is well-developed and innovation-related resources are more widely available. Moreover, companies based in countries with costly personal bankruptcy regulations are less likely to run a VC program, which is consistent with the prediction that these regulations discourage entrepreneurial initiatives. These findings emphasize the importance of favorable local conditions for an affiliated VC program.

During eight 1 -day trials we successfully manipulated {{the extent to which the}} five red knots were (1) actively probing and walking (i. e. foraging) and (2) actually ingesting prey (i. e. processing food) that was (3) either hard-shelled or not (i. e. crushing). Energy expenditures, estimated by the doubly labelled water (DLW) method, calibrated for use in this particular condition, varied between 1. 5 and 4 W. A hierarchical analysis of variance indicated that the crushing of hard-shelled prey <b>entailed</b> no <b>extra</b> <b>cost.</b> We arrived at the following breakdown of cost components under the thermoneutral conditions of the experiment: a cost of active rest/maintenance of 1. 665 W, an additional cost of foraging of 0. 602 W and an additional digestive processing cost of 1. 082 W. These cost levels are all well within the range of expectation and are consistent with the results of a separate outdoor aviary experiment in which the thermostatic costs needed separate estimation. On the basis of the cost and performance functions of gizzards of different mass, it was shown that under the conditions of this experiment the red knots expended the bare minimum for a balanced budget, maintaining the smallest possible gizzard. Under field conditions a larger gizzard would be required. ...|$|R

40|$|In Malaysia, the {{processing}} of sago starch predates that of cassava, having been established before 1416. With its introduction, cassava, which is a much shorter term crop, quickly replaced sago palm as the preferred raw material among starch processors. Hence, except for a small amount serving the fresh food market, cassava is planted in Malaysia mainly for starch processing. The cassava area in Peninsular Malaysia has declined steadily to 1, 631 ha in 1997 after peaking in 1976 at 20, 913 ha. This decline {{is due to the}} curbing of illegal cultivation; land alienation policy with a bias against cassava; switching from cassava to more lucrative crops; rising costs of production; low prevailing price for cassava roots; and competition for land for agricultural and non-agricultural activities during the economic boom prior to July 1997. Of the eight starch factories reported in Perak in 1984, only two are still in operation. Recently, in Sabah, a starch factory opened to process roots supplied through contract farming from an area of more than 3, 000 ha. In trade, cassava starch takes the form of flour, flakes, pearls and starch powder. There is a growing demand for starch with imports amounting to 88, 210 tonnes in 1997. Most of this starch is used in food industries, particularly for making monosodium glutamate (using about 3, 000 tonnes of starch per month). Other significant users are manufacturers of glucose, bakery and biscuit products, textiles and paper. There is also increasing interest in growing edible varieties of cassava for processing into snacks. The future potential in terms of domestic demand for cassava starch is very good. Since the onset of the economic downturn faced by Southeast Asia, the Malaysian government has actively encouraged agriculture (to offset the country’s huge food import bill amounting to almost US$ 2. 9 billion a year) by providing easier access to farmland. There is recent renewed enthusiasm for planting cassava for production of starch, dried chips for livestock feed and sweeteners (high fructose glucose syrup or HFGS). For large-scale mechanized cassava production, certain prerequisites of soil type, terrain, climate and farm size matching the factory’s capacity, must be satisfied. While land is hard to come by in Peninsular Malaysia, more than 80, 000 ha of land are still available in Sabah. Starch is the most likely product to be feasible and profitable in the immediate future compared to dried chips and HFGS production, because of a high demand in the local market, and a well-established technology for starch processing. Stable, high-yielding varieties with intermediate to high starch content to ensure higher starch recovery are required; better still if they can be harvested early. The potential of using cassava as a carbohydrate-rich animal feedstuff is promising, but being low in protein compared to maize, additional protein is required from another source, <b>entailing</b> <b>extra</b> <b>costs.</b> Also, it is costly to dry cassava by artificial means. Although it is technically possible to produce HFGS from cassava, it involves converting starch by enzymatic processes – a complicated and expensive procedure. This does not seem economically feasible in the immediate future, given the current low world price for sugar. Instead, modified starches and their products have very good future potential as profitable agro-based industries. Modification of starches not only expands their scope of utilization by altering their physico-chemical characteristics, but also increases their value as compared to native starch. An alternative use of cassava, which has some prospects, is the production of snack foods. Although oil-fried crisps and crackers are traditional snacks produced by cottage industries, only recently have attempts been made by larger food processors to improve their quality and packaging, and to target the more up-market urban consumer and overseas market. Preliminary work at MARDI has shown that cassava makes a very good raw material for extruded snacks...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} comprehension of indirect requests (IRs). Focusing on English and French, it proposes that IRs such as Can you + verbal phrase (for short, Can you VP?) achieve an optimal communicative efficiency because, while they <b>entail</b> <b>extra</b> processing <b>costs,</b> they match the expected level of politeness in many contexts. The approach taken combines Talmy’s force dynamic semantics {{with a traditional}} perspective in philosophy of language drawing on speech act theory. First, I sketch a theoretically viable and empirically plausible definition of directive speech acts, and provide a naturalistic explanation of why directives result in obligations for addressees. According to this definition, a directive speech act consists in a force exerted by a speaker towards an addressee’s performance of some action, with a prima facie obligation created for the addressee as a result. Consistently with this definition, I propose that imperative sentences are a convenient means to perform directives insofar as they encode a force dynamic pattern that is compatible with, but distinct from, the force exertion pattern that characterizes directives. I develop a similar analysis for You should/must VP declarative sentences. By contrast, I argue that, if interrogative sentences {{can be used in}} the performance of directives such as questioning, they do so by virtue of their incompleteness. To satisfactorily account for the variety of utterances that can be used as directives, I propose a typology based on the formal criterion of (in) directness and on the processing criterion of primariness/secondariness. Three factors are furthermore predicted to influence the processing of IRs: conventionality of means, degree of standardization, and degree of illocutionary force salience. This typology underpins an exhaustive review of experimental work on the comprehension of directives, in which I conclude that further investigation into the processing of IRs is necessary. In particular, the influence of these three factors on the processing, and, in particular, on the primariness/secondariness of IRs is left unexplored. In three eye-tracking experiments with native speakers of French, I put to the test four hypotheses. First, I hypothesize that the more an expression is standardized for the performance of IRs, the more likely it will be understood as an IR, and the more likely the IR will be primary rather than secondary. Second, because expressions such as Can you VP? used as IRs also have a direct interpretation, they should <b>entail</b> <b>extra</b> processing <b>costs</b> relative to their imperative and interrogative direct counterparts. Third, assuming they are direct, You must VP requests should be understood like imperatives requests, and they should not activate the assertive force. Fourth, the high degree of directive illocutionary force salience contributed by the adverb please should increase the likelihood of an IR interpretation and the likelihood that the IR will be primary. In Experiment 1, I show that IR interpretations tend to be more frequent for highly standardized IRs relative to their less standardized counterparts. I also demonstrate that interpreting the highly standardized Can you VP? and the less standardized Is it possible to VP? as IRs does not activate their “ability question” illocutionary meaning. The same finding holds, in Experiment 2, for the declaratives You can VP and It is possible to VP. The data of Experiment 2 indicate that, like imperative sentences, You must VP does not activate the assertive illocutionary force. Another finding of Experiment 1 is that Can you VP? and Is it possible to VP? can be understood as primary IRs, but these expressions nonetheless impose <b>extra</b> processing <b>costs</b> when they are interpreted as direct questions. In Experiment 3, I find that the high degree of directive force salience contributed by please increases the likelihood of an IR interpretation regardless of the degree of standardization of the expression. However, the presence of please has no significant influence on the processing of IRs. Turning to the production of directives, I address the issue of why speakers use IRs despite the <b>extra</b> processing <b>costs</b> <b>entailed</b> by these expressions. In a production task experiment where addressee status is manipulated, I test the hypothesis that Can you VP? IRs are used to trigger extra politeness effects absent in imperatives. A second hypothesis is that speakers should avoid imperatives and obligation declaratives such as You should/must VP because these request forms are directly compatible with force exertion at the pragmatic level. Rather, they should prefer indirect request forms such as ability interrogatives. Third, Can you VP? it should be more frequent than Is it possible to VP? in the data. A first important finding is that higher addressee status does not increase the frequency of Can you VP? interrogatives relative to other request forms. Instead of using Can you VP? more often when they address higher status people, speakers use specific politeness markers, which disconfirms the hypothesis that Can you VP? is used to convey extra politeness effects. The second hypothesis is confirmed, insofar as the data collected with this production task contain a vast majority of ability interrogatives, and imperatives and obligation declaratives are absent. Third, in line with the standardization hypothesis, Can you VP? occur much more often in the data than Is it possible to VP?.

30|$|In addition, the {{implementation}} of cooperative solutions may face many challenges due to the large scale nature of wireless systems. Cooperation comes along with costs such as power expenditure that may limit or reduce the system’s performance. Moreover, if cooperation between the users is regulated by a centralized entity, {{a significant amount of}} wireless signaling overhead is required between the users and the network. Furthermore, {{it is well known that}} the use of centralized techniques <b>entails</b> <b>extra</b> implementation <b>costs</b> and an increase in system’s complexity [1, 20, 21]. Thus, the design of effective techniques that allow the single antenna devices to autonomously decide when and with whom to cooperate with the aim of obtaining power savings in the reverse link is a matter of vital importance in communication systems [22, 23]. In this regard, game theory provides a powerful mathematical tool for the design of distributed solutions in cooperative communications [5, 10, 13, 22]. Through the use of coalitional game theory, the authors in [22] propose a merge and split distributed algorithm to form multi-antenna coalitions among single antenna devices. The aim of their work is to maximize the users’ rate while accounting for the cost of cooperation in terms of power. The main difference between the merge and split scheme and our proposal is that splitting may involve finding all the possible partitions of the set formed by the users in a coalition, which increases significantly the complexity of the method when compared to the scheme presented in this paper. The authors in [24] propose a relay selection method to improve the spatial diversity in the system by using the concept of amplify and forward. They model the cooperation in wireless networks as a Stackelberg game. Moreover, they consider as optimization parameters the transmitted power and the user rate. The proposal is quite novel and interesting; however, they take into account the transmitted power rather than the overall power consumption. In addition, the communication overhead and the complexity of the method due to the use of the Stackelberg game may add an extra limitation to the system. In [5], we propose an energy-efficient solution for virtual MIMO coalition formation, where cooperation is modeled as a game theoretical approach derived for the concept of stable marriage with incomplete lists. An optimal relay is selected to jointly minimize the reverse link power expenditure. Furthermore, we show that the communication overhead may be significantly reduced by using distributed techniques. Nevertheless, a major drawback of the framework proposed in [5] is that the number of elements able to join the coalition is constrained to a limited number, typically two.|$|R

This study argues that offshore outsourcing involves a number of <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> for the client organization that account for the economic failure of offshore projects. The objective is to disaggregate these <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> into its constituent parts and to explain why they differ between offshored software projects. The focus is set on software development and maintenance projects that are offshored to Indian vendors. A theoretical framework is developed a priori based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view of the firm, complemented by factors that acknowledge the specific offshore context. The framework is empirically explored using a multiple case study design including six offshored software projects in a large German Financial Service institution. The results of our analysis indicate that the client incurs post contractual <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> for four types of activities: (1) requirements specification and design, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) control, and (4) coordination. In projects that require a high level of client-specific knowledge about idiosyncratic business processes and software systems, these <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> were found to be substantially higher than in projects were more general knowledge was needed. Notably, these costs most often arose independently from the threat of opportunistic behavior, challenging the predominant TCE logic of market failure. Rather, the client <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> were particularly high in client-specific projects because the effort for managing the consequences of the knowledge asymmetries between client and vendor were particularly high in these projects. Prior experiences of the vendor with related client projects were found to reduce the level of <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> but could not fully offset the increase in <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> in highly client-specific projects.
