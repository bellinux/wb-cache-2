5|$|Many {{chemical}} reactions involving hydrochloric acid are {{applied in the}} production of food, food ingredients, and food additives. Typical products include aspartame, fructose, citric acid, lysine, hydrolyzed vegetable protein as food enhancer, and in gelatin production. <b>Food-grade</b> (extra-pure) hydrochloric acid can be applied when needed for the final product.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (<b>food-grade</b> salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E

25|$|Digestion of the {{phosphate}} ore using {{sulfuric acid}} yields the insoluble calcium sulfate (gypsum), which is filtered and removed as phosphogypsum. Wet-process acid {{can be further}} purified by removing fluorine to produce animal-grade phosphoric acid, or by solvent extraction and arsenic removal to produce <b>food-grade</b> phosphoric acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Food-grade</b> {{rapeseed}} oil (also known as canola oil, rapeseed 00 oil, low erucic acid {{rapeseed oil}}, LEAR oil, and rapeseed canola-equivalent oil) is regulated {{to a maximum}} of 2% erucic acid by weight in the USA and 5% in the EU, with special regulations for infant food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Food-grade</b> {{phosphoric acid}} (additive E338) {{is used to}} acidify foods and {{beverages}} such as various colas and jams. It provides a tangy or sour taste.

25|$|Japan is the world's largest sesame importer. Sesame oil, {{particularly}} from roasted seed, {{is an important}} component of Japanese cooking and traditionally the principal use of the seed. China is the second-largest importer of sesame, mostly oil-grade. China exports lower-priced <b>food-grade</b> sesame seeds, particularly to southeast Asia. Other major importers are the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Turkey, and France.|$|E
25|$|Very pure {{phosphoric acid}} is {{obtained}} by burning elemental phosphorus to produce phosphorus pentoxide, which is subsequently dissolved in dilute phosphoric acid. This route produces a very pure phosphoric acid, since most impurities {{present in the}} rock have been removed when extracting phosphorus from the rock in a furnace. The end result is <b>food-grade,</b> thermal phosphoric acid; however, for critical applications, additional processing to remove arsenic compounds may be needed.|$|E
25|$|The first {{industrial}} process involved {{the reaction of}} benzotrichloride (trichloromethyl benzene) with calcium hydroxide in water, using iron or iron salts as catalyst. The resulting calcium benzoate is converted to benzoic acid with hydrochloric acid. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum benzoin. <b>Food-grade</b> benzoic acid is now produced synthetically.|$|E
25|$|Diesel fuel is {{also often}} used as the main {{ingredient}} in oil-base mud drilling fluid. The advantage of using diesel is its low cost and that it delivers excellent results when drilling {{a wide variety of}} difficult strata including shale, salt and gypsum formations. Diesel-oil mud is typically mixed with up to 40% brine water. Due to health, safety and environmental concerns, Diesel-oil mud is often replaced with vegetable, mineral, or synthetic <b>food-grade</b> oil-base drilling fluids, although diesel-oil mud is still in widespread use in certain regions.|$|E
25|$|The unsized {{oat groats}} {{pass through a}} heat and {{moisture}} treatment to balance moisture, but mainly to stabilize them. Oat groats are high in fat (lipids) and once removed from their protective hulls and exposed to air, enzymatic (lipase) activity begins {{to break down the}} fat into free fatty acids, ultimately causing an off-flavour or rancidity. Oats begin to show signs of enzymatic rancidity within four days of being dehulled if not stabilized. This process is primarily done in <b>food-grade</b> plants, not in feed-grade plants. Groats are not considered raw if they have gone through this process; the heat disrupts the germ and they cannot sprout.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Institute of Science collaborates {{with various}} {{government}} organisations like the DRDO, the ISRO, Bharat Electronics Limited, Aeronautical Development Agency, National Aerospace Laboratories, CSIR, Department of IT (Government of India), etc. IISc also works {{in collaboration with}} private industry and research labs like the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Google Inc, General Motors, Microsoft Research, IBM Research, Boeing, Robert Bosch Foundation, Pratt & Whitney and more. A few organisations have been incubated by the Society for Innovation and Development (SID) on campus, including Morphing Machines and SandI, while Gamma Porite is currently under incubation. IISc actively promotes and supports ventures by the faculty, the students and alumni. Strand Life Sciences and Ittiam are some success stories of this initiative. In March 2016, a science start-up, incubated at the IISc, has built the world's first <b>food-grade</b> DNA/RNA stain. This might cut the time taken to diagnose conditions such as HIV to a day, from 45 days at present.|$|E
25|$|However, all {{groundwater}} entering New York City's {{distribution system}} is treated with chlorine, fluoride, <b>food-grade</b> phosphoric acid, and, in some cases, sodium hydroxide. New York City uses chlorine {{to meet the}} New York State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water Act disinfection requirements. Fluoride, at a concentration of one part per million, is added to help prevent tooth decay and has been added since 1966 {{in accordance with the}} New York City Health Code. Phosphoric acid is added to create a protective film on pipes that reduces the release of metals such as lead and copper from household plumbing. Additionally, a sequestering phosphate is applied at several wells to prevent the precipitation of naturally occurring minerals, mostly iron and manganese, in the distribution mains and customers' household piping. Air stripper facilities can be operated at several wells to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The only well in operation in 2007 had an air stripper in operation.|$|E
25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, oregano and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% reduction in yield. The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into <b>food-grade</b> polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, lead is {{prohibited}} in solder and flux in plumbing applications for drinking water use, per the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Historically, {{a higher proportion}} of lead was used, commonly 50/50. This had the advantage of making the alloy solidify more slowly. With the pipes being physically fitted together before soldering, the solder could be wiped over the joint to ensure water tightness. Although lead water pipes were displaced by copper when the significance of lead poisoning began to be fully appreciated, lead solder was still used until the 1980s because it was thought that the amount of lead that could leach into water from the solder was negligible from a properly soldered joint. The electrochemical couple of copper and lead promotes corrosion of the lead and tin. [...] Tin, however, is protected by insoluble oxide. Since even small amounts of lead have been found detrimental to health, lead in plumbing solder was replaced by silver (<b>food-grade</b> applications) or antimony, with copper often added, and the proportion of tin was increased (see Lead-free solder.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Paintballs (pellets): Paintballs, the {{ammunition}} {{used in the}} marker, are spherical gelatin capsules containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs {{is dependent on the}} brittleness of the ball's shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. The highest-grade paintballs incorporate cornstarch and metallic flake into the fill to leave a thick glittery [...] "splat" [...] that is very obvious against any background color, and hard to wipe off. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradeable. All ingredients used in the making of a paintball are <b>food-grade</b> quality and are harmless to the participants and environment.

2500|$|Mannitol {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Fermentation by microorganisms is an alternative to the traditional industrial synthesis. A fructose to mannitol metabolic pathway, known as the mannitol cycle in fungi, has been discovered in a type of red algae (Caloglossa leprieurii), and it is highly possible that other microorganisms employ similar such pathways. A class of lactic acid bacteria, labeled heterofermentive because of their multiple fermentation pathways, convert either three fructose molecules or two fructose and one glucose molecule into two mannitol molecules, and one molecule each of lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Feedstock syrups containing medium to large concentrations of fructose (for example, cashew apple juice, containing 55% fructose: 45% glucose) can produce yields [...] mannitol per liter of feedstock. Further research is being conducted, studying ways to engineer even more efficient mannitol pathways in lactic acid bacteria, as well as the use of other microorganisms such as yeast and E. coli in mannitol production. When <b>food-grade</b> strains of any of the aforementioned microorganisms are used, the mannitol and the organism itself are directly applicable to food products, avoiding the need for careful separation of microorganism and mannitol crystals. Although this is a promising method, steps are needed to scale it up to industrially needed quantities.|$|E
