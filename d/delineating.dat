After failing to find hard evidence to support his theory, Vogel abandoned it in 2005. Vogel's website was remounted in 2009 under a different URL.|$|E
5|$|If one {{of these}} tests shows a {{deficiency}} of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary {{is the first step}} in identifying an underlying cause. MRI may show various tumors and may assist in <b>delineating</b> other causes. Tumors smaller than 1cm are referred to as microadenomas, and larger lesions are called macroadenomas. Computed tomography with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available. Formal visual field testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of optic nerve compression by a tumor.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as <b>delineating</b> mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
40|$|Much {{effort has}} been spent on the {{automatic}} detection and delineation of individual trees from high spatial resolution images. However, delineation errors may lead to an inaccurate crown size when compared with ground measurements. Thus, it is problematic to use <b>delineated</b> crowns to derive information on tree variables, e. g. crown diameter, tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), stand volume, stem volume or stand competition index. In this study, we investigated two indicators - the mean digital number (MDN) within each <b>delineated</b> crown {{and the difference between}} MDNs (DMDNs) for 0. 6 m buffer zones outside and inside the boundary of each <b>delineated</b> crown - to separate poorly <b>delineated</b> crowns from well-delineated ones. We modelled the relationships between <b>delineated</b> crowns and field-based crown size, between <b>delineated</b> crowns and tree height, and between <b>delineated</b> crowns and DBH observations in a Norway spruce (Picea abies) stand, separately considering models based on all <b>delineated</b> results and crowns identified as being well <b>delineated.</b> Our results showed that the capability of the two indicators in separating poorly and well-delineated crowns varied under different thresholds. The results also indicated that models considering only well-delineated crowns were more robust and effective in estimating and predicting tree crown diameter, DBH and tree height than models that considered all <b>delineated</b> results. ⓒ 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. close 1...|$|R

5|$|Least weasels {{from various}} parts of its range vary greatly in size. The body is slender and {{elongated}} and the legs and tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and tail of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line <b>delineating</b> {{the boundary between the}} two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and {{in the northern part of}} its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.|$|E
5|$|The Gita {{consists}} of 18 chapters and 700 shlokas (verses), with each chapter named as a different yoga, thus <b>delineating</b> eighteen different yogas. Some scholars divide the Gita into three sections, {{with the first}} six chapters with 280 shlokas dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six containing 209 shlokas with Bhakti yoga, and the last six chapters with 211 shlokas as Jnana yoga; however, this is rough because elements of karma, bhakti and jnana are found in all chapters.|$|E

The most notable form of art unique to the pipeline are pipeline maps—portions of scrap pipe cut {{into the shape of}} Alaska with a piece of metal <b>delineating</b> the path of the pipeline through the map. Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on the pipeline, and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began <b>delineating</b> two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of labor and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia. Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E

5|$|As king, Edward's main {{interests}} lay in {{the fields}} of foreign affairs and naval and military matters. Fluent in French and German, he reinvented royal diplomacy by numerous state visits across Europe. He took annual holidays in Biarritz and Marienbad. One of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in May 1903 as the guest of President Émile Loubet. Following a visit to the Pope in Rome, this trip helped create the atmosphere for the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale, an agreement <b>delineating</b> British and French colonies in North Africa, and ruling out any future war between the two countries. The Entente was negotiated in 1904 between the French foreign minister, Théophile Delcassé, and the British foreign secretary, Lord Lansdowne. It marked the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry and Britain's splendid isolation from Continental affairs, and attempted to counterbalance the growing dominance of the German Empire and its ally, Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in <b>delineating</b> a {{connection}} between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E
5|$|The Priory's {{principal}} church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, was reconfigured {{after the}} dissolution of the monasteries losing the western third of its nave. Reformed as an Anglican parish church, its parish boundaries were limited {{to the site of the}} ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane. The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty, responsible for the upkeep and security of its fabric and the land within its boundaries. With the advent of street lighting, mains water and sewerage during the Victorian era, maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution. Thus, in 1910, it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security. Great St Barts' present parish boundary includes just 10 feet (3.048 m) of Smithfield — possibly <b>delineating</b> a former right of way.|$|E
30|$|The {{correlations}} of 62 fully <b>delineated</b> ICVs with {{four types of}} ICV estimates were calculated.

For methods 2 – 4, the fully <b>delineated</b> ICVs were randomly separated into an evaluation and a validation set of equal size. Method 1 was validated against all of the fully <b>delineated</b> ICVs.|$|R

5|$|The {{primary role}} of the lipid bilayer in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier <b>delineating</b> “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater was {{classified}} in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011. <b>Delineating</b> the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling confirmed previous findings that Lichenostomus is not monophyletic. While five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, studies using the mitochondrial DNA identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most {{closely related to the}} black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were therefore grouped into the genus Caligavis. The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as Bolemoreus. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.|$|E
