25|$|The {{power plant}} is {{connected}} to the 330kV and 750kV electrical grid. The block has two electrical generators connected to the 750kV grid by a single <b>generator</b> <b>transformer.</b> The generators are connected to their common transformer by two switches in series. Between them, the unit transformers are connected to supply power to the power plant's own systems; each generator can therefore be connected to the unit transformer to power the plant, or to the unit transformer and the <b>generator</b> <b>transformer</b> to also feed power to the grid. The 330kV line is normally not used, and serves as an external power supply, connected by a station transformer to the power plant's electrical systems. The plant can be powered by its own generators, or get power from the 750kV grid through the <b>generator</b> <b>transformer,</b> or from the 330kV grid via the station transformer, or from the other power plant block via two reserve busbars. In case of total external power loss, the essential systems can be powered by diesel generators. Each unit transformer {{is connected to}} two 6kV main power boards, A and B (e.g. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B for generators 7 and 8), powering principal non-essential drivers and connected to transformers for the 4kV main power and the 4kV reserve busbar. The 7A, 7B, and 8B boards are also connected to the three essential power lines (namely for the coolant pumps), each also having its own diesel generator. In case of a coolant circuit failure with simultaneous loss of external power, the essential power can be supplied by the spinning down turbogenerators for about 45â€“50 seconds, during which time the diesel generators should start up. The generators are started automatically within 15 seconds at loss of off-site power.|$|E
