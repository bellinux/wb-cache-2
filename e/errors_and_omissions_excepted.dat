50|$|Such {{codes of}} best {{practices}} have permitted communities of practice {{to make more}} informed risk assessments in employing fair use in their daily practice. For instance, broadcasters, cablecasters, and distributors typically require filmmakers to obtain <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions</b> insurance before the distributor will take on the film. Such insurance protects against <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions</b> made during the copyright clearance of material in the film. Before the Documentary Filmmakers' Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use was created in 2005, it was nearly impossible to obtain <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions</b> insurance for copyright clearance work that relied in part on fair use. This meant documentarians had either to obtain a license for the material or to cut it from their films. In many cases, {{it was impossible to}} license the material because the filmmaker sought to use it in a critical way. Soon after the best practices statement was released, all <b>errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>omissions</b> insurers in the U.S. shifted to begin offering routine fair use coverage.|$|R
