50|$|The {{communication}} protocol describes {{two sets of}} instructions. The Display Command Set (DCS) {{is a set of}} common commands <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> device, and their format is specified by the DSI standard. It defines registers that can be addressed and what their operation is. It includes basic commands such as sleep, enable, and invert display. The Manufacturer Command Set (MCS) is a device-specific command space whose definition is up to the device manufacturer. It often includes commands required to program non-volatile memory, set specific device registers (such as Gamma correction), or perform other actions not described in the DSI standard. The packet format of both sets is specified by the DSI standard. There are Short and Long Packets, Short Packet is 4 bytes long; Long Packet can be of any length up to 216 bytes. Packets are composed of a DataID, Word count, Error Correction Code (ECC), Payload and Checksum (CRC). Commands that require reading data back from the device trigger a BTA event, which allows the device to reply with the requested data. A device cannot initiate a transfer; it can only reply to host requests.|$|E

40|$|When {{displays}} {{of different sizes}} and shapes are required, a modular display system {{seems to be a}} good solution. Many systems offer only a limited freedom of shapes. The display can be scaled, but no irregular shapes can be created. If those shapes can be created, the configuration is often manual. A more intelligent modular system allows all shapes to be created and configures automatically. This paper presents two drivers {{that can be used in}} such a modular system. The first driver ensures that the data finds its way to every module and is displayed, even if there are some “holes” in the display due to missing modules. The second driver adds some extra functionality. The precise display configuration can be detected, and in the graphical user interface (used <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>display)</b> the user sees an updated view of the display configuration when modules are added or removed.

40|$|Epps, Thomas H., IIISullivan, Millicent O. Analogous {{to small}} {{molecule}} lipids and surfactants, amphiphilic block polymers self-assemble into well-defined nanostructures in aqueous solutions such as spherical micelles, cylindrical micelles, and vesicles. Their macromolecular architecture leads to several advantages compared to small molecule amphiphiles, including increased chemical versatility, explicit {{control over the}} size and structure of solution assemblies, extremely low critical aggregation concentrations, and exceptionally slow chain exchange. These attractive advantages have motivated significant research efforts towards developing polymeric surfactants for emerging nanotechnologies including aqueous nanoreactors and drug delivery vehicles. To {{take full advantage of}} block polymer materials in these applications, a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence self-assembly behavior as well as robust methods for controlling the chemical functionality of polymeric assemblies must continue to be developed. Accordingly, this dissertation demonstrates the synthesis, solution assembly, and characterization of amphiphilic block polymers towards the goal of creating well-defined nanoassemblies. The first objective of this dissertation was to systematically investigate the effects of common processing conditions on the structure, dynamics, and long-term stability of block polymer micelles. The pronounced effects of organic cosolvent addition and subsequent removal were studied using a combination of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering. Notably, solution agitation was found to have unexpected consequences on the dynamics and stability of the resulting assemblies. A growing number of works indicate that in addition to the structure, the chemical functionality of polymeric assemblies plays a critical role in determining the in vivo fate of drug delivery vehicles. Thus, the second objective of this research was to establish a tunable method <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> of peptide groups within polymeric assemblies to target specific diseased tissues. A modular synthetic strategy was developed for creating well-defined polymer-peptide conjugates that allowed control over both the peptide sequence and peptide location within the polymer backbone. Together, the efforts in this dissertation provide the foundation for the rational design of novel materials by enabling greater control over both the structure and functionality of polymer-based nanoassemblies.

40|$|Both {{coherent}} perspective jitter {{and explicit}} changing-size cues {{have been shown}} to improve the vection induced by radially expanding optic flow. The current study examined whether these stimulus-based vection advantages could be modified by altering cognitions/expectations about both the likelihood of self-motion perception and the purpose of the experiment. In the main experiment, participants were randomly assigned into two groups – one where the cognitive conditions biased participants towards self-motion perception and another where the cognitive conditions biased them towards object motion perception. Contrary to earlier findings by Lepecq et al (1995), we found that identical visual displays were less likely to induce vection in ‘object motion bias’ conditions than in ‘self-motion bias’ conditions. However, significant jitter and size advantages for vection were still found in both cognitive conditions (cognitive bias effects were greatest <b>for</b> non-jittering-same-size <b>control</b> <b>displays).</b> <b>The</b> current results suggest that if a sufficiently large vection advantage can be produced when participants are expecting to experience self-motion, it is likely to persist in object motion bias conditions...|$|R

40|$|Grip force {{feedback}} {{is not available}} in modern myoelectric upper-limb prostheses, yet its benefits are well known in object manipulation tasks performed through cable-driven body-powered prostheses. To evaluate the efficacy of grip {{force feedback}} in a myoelectric prosthesis, direct head-to-head comparisons should be made with body-powered prostheses, {{as well as with}} proposed designs that provide grip force feedback through haptic displays such as vibrotactile arrays. Direct comparisons, however, are difficult because myoelectric <b>control</b> <b>for</b> a trans-radial amputee uses residual muscles in the forearm, body-power generally refers interaction to the shoulder, and haptic displays often involve additional information encoding transformations. Currently, no unifying theory exists to cover both information encoding as well as the body part used <b>for</b> <b>control</b> or <b>display.</b> <b>The</b> work developed in this dissertation presents a systematic hypothesis-driven approach to evaluating both information encoding and body part used in <b>the</b> <b>display</b> of grip force feedback. Drawing upon principles from psychophysics, teleoperation, and sensory substitution, we use a series of human subject experiments to quantify the value of grip force feedback for an amputee wearing a trans-radial myoelectric prosthesis.

The early part of the thesis analyses the reasons for the increased pilot compensation task during the approach, and why current operational control and display systems do not permit a full instrument approach. The constraints imposed on the type of approach profile due to aircraft characteristics and external factors are next assessed, and preliminary conclusions drawn on the type of profile most suited to the handling qualities of V/STOL aircraft.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 Nanotechnology {{has given}} {{scientists}} new tools {{for the development}} of advanced materials for the detection, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in particular have been extensively investigated as novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents due to a combination of favorable superparamagnetic properties, biodegradability, and surface properties that allow modification for improved in vivo kinetics and multifunctionality. SPIONs favorable characteristics have further led to their investigation as promising theranostic agents, which combine imaging and therapeutic capabilities in a single nanovector. The combination of imaging and therapy could allow for real-time monitoring of drug delivery and the tailoring of treatment for individual patients with the promise of improved clinical outcomes for patients suffering from cancers such as glioblastoma (GBM). This dissertation is intended to address limitation of conventional clinical cancer treatment including current cancer targeting limitations and poor pharmacokinetic of hydrophobic chemotherapeutics that lead to unacceptable side effects. First, SPIONs were coated with cross-linked, redox-responsive copolymers composed of chitosan and polyethylene glycol (PEG), functionalized with cancer targeting agent chlorotoxin (CTX), and modified with O 6 -benzylguanine (BG), an O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) inhibitor to improve temozolomide based treatments of GBMs. It was found that CED of the BG loaded SPION were more tolerable than free drug and increased survival 3 -fold over untreated animals in an intracranial GBM mouse model. Next, analogs of BG were evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy and modified to allow for polymerization on the SPION surface via hydrazone linkages to facilitate improved drug loading and controlled drug release. Finally, a new synthesis and functionalization strategy for theranostic agents is presented that demonstrated streamlined production, allowed <b>for</b> great <b>control</b> over <b>the</b> <b>display</b> of functional moieties on the SPION surface, increased batch to batch consistency, and provided improved magnetic properties...|$|R
40|$|Brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) technology {{provides a}} means of communication that allows individuals with severely impaired movement to communicate with assistive devices using the electroencephalogram (EEG) or other brain signals. Dealing with the unknown embedded noise within the raw EEG and the inherent lower bandwidth of BCI are still two of the major challenges in making BC! practical for day-to-day use. The raw EEG signal recorded non-invasively during motor i ~~~y (MI) is intrinsically ". " embedded with non-Gaussian noise while the actual noise-free EEG has {{so far not been}} attained. Therefore, a filtering approach is needed to remove noise. A novel quantum mechanics motivated alternative neural information processing architecture using the Schrodinger wave equation (SWE) is proposed to filter and thereby enhance the information from the otherwise noisy EEG signals. This novel filtering approach is constructed using a layer of neurons within the neural network framework, referred to as the Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN) that recurrently computes a time-varying probability density function (pdf) for the measurement of the observed signal. The raw EEG sample is encoded in terms of a particle-like wave packet {{that can be used to}} accurately filter noise from the EEG using an unsupervised learning scheme without making any assumption about the underlying distribution. The RQNN enhanced EEG signal is more easily classified than the raw signal. Another major challenge in two-class BC! systems is also addressed in this thesis, namely the inherent lower bandwidth of the communication channel that may lead to a sluggish response in suitably controlling a mobile robotic device. An intelligent and adaptive user interface, which plays a very important role as a front-end <b>display</b> for <b>the</b> BCI user is proposed. The framework of the proposed intelligent Adaptive User Interface (iAUI) i. e., the brain-robot interface is consistent for a range of applications e. g., <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> either a mobile robot or a robotic arm. The iAUI for mobile robot offers a real-time prioritized list of all the options for selection by the user. Prioritized update ofthe iAUI is possible by utilizing information obtained from the sonar sensors mounted on the mobile robot. Through iAUI the user is always offered the most likely choice, thereby improving the information transfer rate. Similarly, <b>the</b> interface <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> robot arm <b>displays</b> <b>the</b> list of available objects for user selection depending on the real-time information from the camera view of the robot arm. Results on multiple participants show that both the main contributions, the RQNN filtering and the iAUI address to a large extent the issues of dealing with unknown embedded noise within the raw EEG and the inherent lower bandwidth of BCI. xv AbstractEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
