50|$|The {{main purpose}} of these radars is the {{investigation}} of cloud properties and evolution. They typically operate at 35 GHz in the Ka band and at 94 GHz in the W band, where the atmospheric transmission is maximum. These frequencies correspond to wavelengths around 8 and 3 mm. Millimeter cloud radars have a high temporal and range resolution: temporal resolution is adjustable and typically ranges from 1 to 10 seconds, while the range resolution ranges from a few meters for cloud radars using frequency modulation of the transmitted signal (e.g. 4 m for the Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) 94 GHz cloud radar operating at UK Met Office), to several meters for magnetron based cloud radars (e.g. from 15 to 60 m for MIRA systems). The maximum detection range is between 14 and 20 km and the Doppler velocity resolution is of few cm/s. Most of the cloud radars are polarimetric, being able to measure the particles irregularity {{by means of the}} linear depolarization ratio (LDR). Usually they operate pointing to the zenith, but an increasing number of them have nowadays scanning units, that allow to retrieve additional information such as volume information when performing various Range <b>Height</b> <b>Indicator</b> (RHI) scans at different angles and at a relatively high speed, and vertical wind profiles, when performing Plan Position Indicator (PPI) at few degrees from the zenith.|$|E

40|$|Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) {{images and}} Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) {{data on the}} Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) {{spacecraft}} show evidence for three catastrophic outflow channels around the Cerberus Plains region, Mars. The morphologies seen in MOC images located within channels seen in gridded MOLA topography {{are similar to those}} found in catastrophic flood terrains on Earth, such as the Channeled Scabland. Thus, they indicate the channels' formation by catastrophic flood flow. The morphologies and topography also counterindicate the channels' formation by lava, glaciers or CO₂-charged density flows. Crater counting on lineated terrain, interpreted as diluvially eroded, gives model ages for the channels of extreme Upper Amazonian, ranging from 2 - 8 Ma for the youngest to 35 - 140 Ma for the oldest. The distinct age ranges, as well as the geographic/geologic relationships, indicate that the last flood flows down each of the channels were not contemporaneous. Two, and possibly all three, of the channels originate at the Cerberus Fossae volcano-tectonic fissures, although lack of erosion around the channels' origin at the fissures suggests the fissures have been recently reactivated. Neither magmatic melting of ground ice nor gravity-driven groundwater flow can produce a volumetric discharge at a rate commensurate with that estimated from the surface topography. Geomorphic evidence suggests floodwater ponded temporarily in Athabasca Vallis. Two paleoflood <b>height</b> <b>indicators,</b> which are separated by thirty-five kilometers along channel, have very similar heights. This may be explained by temporary ponding of floodwater behind a large crater in the channel, and consequent deposition of sediment in this slower flow. An additional factor contributing to the similar heights of the paleoflood indicators may be post-eruption subsidence near the origin of the channel, although this possibility, without the hypothesized ponding, cannot explain the preferential location of the streamlined forms up slope of the crater...|$|R
