5|$|President Richard Nixon {{reestablished}} the AMSA {{program after}} taking office, keeping with his administration's <b>flexible</b> <b>response</b> strategy {{that required a}} broad range of options short of general nuclear war. Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated. In April 1969, the program officially became the B-1A. This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series, first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.|$|E
5|$|The dwindling {{credibility}} of the massive retaliation strategy caused NATO to shift to the <b>flexible</b> <b>response</b> strategy. This increased the importance of Banak, {{as it would be}} used to fly in reinforcements in a war situation. In 1962, both RNoAF and NATO proposed that Banak be expanded to full NATO standards. RNoAF planned that Banak should host a detachment of up to six fighters or fighter-bombers and act as a stopover for fighters, transports and helicopters. The airfield was to stockpile supplies, including fuel and ammunition, for one month of war efforts. NATO saw need, in case of a Soviet attack on Finnmark, to deploy two brigades consisting of 10,000 men {{in the course of a}} week and simultaneously host a squadron of tactical aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} all {{consumer}} goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion rubles ($530 billion). The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, is considered by several economists {{to be the worst}} financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the economy grew, the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, labour productivity decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the free communication and <b>flexible</b> <b>response</b> required at the enterprise level to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers and suppliers. The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. Data falsification became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E

The transition from massive retaliation to <b>flexible</b> <b>response</b> and the shift from nuclear to conventional weapons remained incomplete.|$|E
25|$|McNamara {{became a}} close adviser to Kennedy and {{advocated}} {{the use of}} a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of <b>flexible</b> <b>response,</b> which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up in U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, it {{appeared}} increasingly problematic to {{find room for}} a nuclear weapons program in the defense economy; secondly, the situation was proving that future wars would be likely waged with conventional weapons (especially, after studying the NATO's <b>flexible</b> <b>response</b> doctrine); thirdly, it was decided (yet unclear how) that Sweden was covered by the US nuclear umbrella. Just before the Government's position became known, the Defense Ministry announced that Sweden's security would be undermined if the country joined the non-proliferation agreement, because the treaty addressed small countries that hadn't acquired any nuclear weapons yet, while the US and the Soviet Union's nuclear possessions remained untouched. Thus, Sweden was under risk to yield its Freedom of action to nothing in return, while the nuclear threat against the country would remain.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the basic}} {{policies}} outlined by President Kennedy in {{a message to}} Congress on March 28, 1961, guided McNamara in the reorientation of the defense program. Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be [...] "designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war." [...] The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with allies, was [...] "to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of <b>flexible</b> <b>response.</b> The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than [...] "inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation", as the president put it. Out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the U.S. initiated by McNamara in 1961 came a decision to increase the nation's [...] "limited warfare" [...] capabilities. These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of massive retaliation {{in favor of a}} <b>flexible</b> <b>response</b> strategy that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.|$|E
2500|$|To {{meet these}} needs, Schlesinger built on {{existing}} ideas {{in developing a}} <b>flexible</b> <b>response</b> nuclear strategy, which, with the President's approval, he made public by early 1974. The United States, Schlesinger said, needed the ability, {{in the event of}} a nuclear attack, to respond so as to [...] "limit the chances of uncontrolled escalation" [...] and [...] "hit meaningful targets" [...] without causing widespread collateral damage. The nation's assured destruction force would be withheld in the hope that the enemy would not attack U.S. cities. In rejecting assured destruction, Schlesinger quoted President Nixon: [...] "Should a President, {{in the event of a}} nuclear attack, be left with the single option of ordering the mass destruction of enemy civilians, in the face of the certainty that it would be followed by the mass slaughter of Americans?" ...|$|E

30|$|With the {{emergence}} of mood stabilizers, and when behaviorism gradually declined as a leading force, a new paradigm started to take place, in which mood—the color of the subjective experience—is seen as {{a rich source of}} information with a rather complex regulation.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} perform {{accurate}} movements, {{the nervous system}} must transform sensory feedback into motor commands that compensate for errors caused by motor variability and external disturbances. Recent studies focusing {{on the importance of}} sensory feedback in motor control have illustrated that the brain generates highly <b>flexible</b> <b>responses</b> to visual perturbations (hand-cursor or target jumps), or following mechanical loads applied to the limb. These parallel approaches have emphasized sophisticated, goal-directed feedback control, but also reveal that <b>flexible</b> perturbation <b>responses</b> are expressed at different latencies depending on what sensory system is engaged by the perturbation. Across studies, goal-directed visuomotor responses consistently emerge in muscle activity ∼ 100 ms after a perturbation, while mechanical perturbations evoke goal-directed muscle responses in as little as ∼ 60 ms (long-latency responses). We discuss the limitation of current models of multisensory integration in light of these asynchronous processing delays, and suggest that understanding how the brain performs real-time multisensory integration is an open question for future studies...|$|R
50|$|The {{strategic}} doctrine for Kennedy’s <b>Flexible</b> <b>response</b> was Assured destruction. <b>Flexible</b> <b>response</b> made {{second strike}} capability its guiding principle of deterrence. In {{the event of}} Soviet nuclear aggression, the Soviets would know that enough U.S. nuclear capability would survive their strike to destroy their cities and industry. Robert McNamara argued for the definition of what was “unacceptable” to the enemy as the destruction of 50% of industry and 25% of the population. Deterrence depended on influence to show that violence and aggression did not pay, and being explicit {{about the level of}} destruction the US was willing to inflict on the enemy was one way to illustrate this point. Assured Destruction relied on deterrence by punishment, precision, and credibility.|$|E
5000|$|... "Flexible Response" [...] was {{a defense}} {{strategy}} executed by John F. Kennedy in 1961. Its {{aim was to}} address the Kennedy administration's skepticism of Eisenhower's new look and its policy of Massive Retaliation. <b>Flexible</b> <b>response</b> requires mutually assured destruction (MAD) at tactical, strategic and conventional levels, bestowing upon the United States the {{ability to respond to}} aggression across the spectrum of warfare. <b>Flexible</b> <b>response</b> required the continuous presence of substantial conventional forces. The forces were to serve two purposes; acting as a deterrent and fighting limited wars. Kennedy hoped to deter all wars regardless of their nature. Although both Eisenhower and Dulles wanted to achieve goals similar to those of Kennedy, they were rather the more concerned with cost. In order to avoid both escalation and humiliation, Kennedy highlighted the importance of adequate flexibility and disregarded cost. Prior to nuclear war, Kennedy wished to increase the range of available options. He also believed that the European allies should be contributing more to their own defense. Fundamentally, the notion of <b>flexible</b> <b>response</b> was to [...] "increase the ability to confine the response to non-nuclear weapons".|$|E

50|$|President Kennedy's {{foreign policy}} was {{dominated}} by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the Cold War. President Eisenhower had adopted the New Look policy, which emphasized {{the use of nuclear}} weapons to deter the threat of Soviet aggression. Eisenhower believed that this policy could be effective, but it also appealed to him as it allowed him to avoid an expensive build-up of conventional forces. Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as <b>flexible</b> <b>response.</b> This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals. As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces, elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts.
