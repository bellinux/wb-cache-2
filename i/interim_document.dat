40|$|Waste {{management}} strategy based on recycling and clearance already applied to SEAFP- 2 Plant Models is {{implemented in the}} following way: - For each activated component (or part of a component), the most appropriate {{management strategy}} is recommended, indicating the adequate cooling time, taken {{to be less than}} 100 years, required for the compliance with the limits. In some cases, two management options are suggested for the same material either allowing recycling or clearance, depending on different cooling times. - Clearance includes two possible paths: disposal as non-active waste, NAW, as for SEAFP- 2, and recycling outside the nuclear industry or non-active recyclable material, NARM. For the former option, SEAFP- 2 clearance levels are adopted, which are given in an IAEA <b>interim</b> <b>document.</b> For the latter option, different clearance levels defined in recent E. C. Recommendations are adopted. - An additional analysis concerns the possibility to attain conditions for clearance as non-active waste for the in-vessel V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti structures of PM- 1. In this alloy most of the long-term activity arises from the impurities. It is shown that such conditions could be reached by: a) reduction of the impurities concentration in the alloy to extremely low levels, also below the actual detection limit, and b) reprocessing of the irradiated material to eliminate noxious nuclides deriving from the components of the alloy.

40|$|The Surveyors Board of Queensland has {{recently}} {{become aware of}} some issues {{with the use of}} GNSS/GPS, particularly Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), on cadastral surveys. This document is designed to provide a summary of overarching principles that should govern how surveyors go about this task. It is not exhaustive: rather it is essentially an <b>interim</b> <b>document</b> designed to bring attention to some common errors in practice and will be later supplemented by more detailed guidelines. It is also designed to be read in conjunction with best practice guidelines such as SP# 1 (refer to References). In this document RTK refers to the use of good quality geodetic receivers and antennas and not hand held mapping grade receivers, nor DGPS systems. Although this guideline primarily covers cadastral surveys where some aspects of the work will be carried out using RTK GNSS, these principles may be also applicable to engineering, topographic, and other surveys, particularly where local ground-based coordinates and dimensions are required. For completeness and clarity, parts of the document also may refer to GNSS observational techniques other than RTK. Logically, this guideline is not applicable when using conventional measurement techniques only. The document does not cover • legal traceability of measurement and survey integration – you should refer to requirements of the appropriate verifying authority for details on that aspect. • the general operational aspects of RTK GNSS – you should refer to manufacturers' specifications and other guidelines. ...|$|E
