The claim by <b>Foresee</b> alleges that several Lodsys patents are invalid.

[...] "..this Court has personal jurisdiction over Lodsys because Lodsys' chief executive officer and sole employee resides in, and conducts business from, this judicial district." [...] Michael Shanahan of McDermott says that the patents at issue (the same as the iPhone lawsuits) are actually invalid. <b>Foresee</b> Results published a press release on November 23, 2011 stating that they had reached a settlement with Lodsys that resolves all outstanding litigation claims between <b>ForeSee</b> and Lodsys and terminates all pending litigation with Lodsys related to <b>ForeSee's</b> products and services, including all such claims against <b>ForeSee's</b> customers.|$|R

40|$|Increasing market {{pressure}} is forcing manufacturing companies to improve product lead times and quality at reduced cost. An important approach aimed at tackling these problems is to generate manufacturing/assembly system models concurrently {{with the design}} solutions of a component. A designer can therefore make product design decisions while having access to, and interacting with, the evolving 'virtual' manufacturing system models. This allows designers to <b>foresee</b> any potential manufacturing problems caused by design decisions. This paper presents an approach that proactively supports designers in making informed design decisions, through the timely revelation of knowledge about manufacturing and assembly processes. Such knowledge, when provided early in the design process, allows designers to avoid negative implications and to use positive ones. Based on this approach, a knowledge-intensive computer aided design (KICAD) prototype tool, named <b>FORESEE,</b> has been developed. <b>FORESEE</b> is a proof-of-concept system and allows designers to <b>foresee</b> and explore manufacturing and assembly consequences caused by design decisions, as {{the design of a}} mechanical component evolves. The paper presents an outline of the KICAD approach, together with a brief description of <b>FORESEE's</b> architecture and implementation. The application of <b>FORESEE</b> is demonstrated through a thermoplastic component design case study. <b>FORESEE</b> has been evaluated by practising designers. Evaluation results indicate that the approach has the potential proactively to support component design...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, the intended use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a <b>foreseen</b> attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although never intended for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E
