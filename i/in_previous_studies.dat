5|$|As {{was common}} at the time, Joaquim Inácio began his {{education}} {{at home and}} was later enrolled in Seminário de São José (Saint Joseph School) and after that, in Seminário São Joaquim (Saint Joachim School), which became PedroII School in 1837. His teachers included Januário da Cunha Barbosa, who later {{became one of the}} leading figures in the Brazilian independence movement. Joaquim Inácio chose to follow his father, a naval officer who achieved the rank of second lieutenant, in his choice of a career. On 20 November 1822 at the age of 14, Joaquim Inácio was admitted as aspirante a guarda-marinha (aspiring midshipman or naval cadet) at the Navy Academy. On 11 December 1823, he graduated from the academy, majoring in mathematics, with the rank of guarda-marinha (midshipman). As he had <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> at other schools, Joaquim Inácio proved to be a brilliant student. Among his colleagues at the academy was Francisco Manuel Barroso da Silva (later Baron of Amazonas) whom he befriended.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme {{replacement}} therapy techniques {{have been investigated}} for lysosomal storage disorders, and could potentially be used to treat Tay–Sachs as well. The goal would be to replace the nonfunctional enzyme, a process similar to insulin injections for diabetes. However, <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> the HEXA enzyme itself has been thought to be too large {{to pass through the}} specialized cell layer in the blood vessels that forms the blood–brain barrier in humans.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} to examine the E. coli O157:H7 bactericidal efficacies on 25 different copper alloys to identify those alloys that provide the best combination of antimicrobial activity, corrosion/oxidation resistance, and fabrication properties. Copper's antibacterial effect {{was found to be}} intrinsic in all of the copper alloys tested. As <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> no antibacterial properties were observed on stainless steel (UNS S30400). Also, in confirmation with earlier studies the rate of drop-off of E. coli O157:H7 on the copper alloys is faster at room temperature than at chill temperature.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who start having sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies)</b> associated with earlier sex: having an increased number of sexual partners or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
25|$|Festinger’s other {{well-known}} {{theory of}} cognitive dissonance, proposed in 1957 offers further evidence for {{why such a}} process might occur. Because emotional experiences are unexpected, they can affect one’s self-concept and thus challenge one’s system of beliefs. According to Festinger, when people’s expectations do not manifest themselves, a cognitive dissonance is created between the expectations and reality and people seek to reduce this dissonance by rationalizing the discrepancy. So after experiencing an emotion, people {{would be expected to}} communicate the event with others in order to help reduce their cognitive dissonance. An article by Thoits emphasizes the importance of the ability of others to assist in the process of coping. Other people are able to offer new perspectives on interpretations of the emotional event. <b>In</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> Rimé concluded that emotions necessitate “cognitive articulation” because of their dense, complex nature. By using language to express an experience, people are forced to classify and organize the contents of the emotions, and furthermore can concretize and objectivize the experience into a script that can be more easily understood.|$|E
25|$|A.×gravesii {{differs from}} Trudell's spleenwort (A.×trudellii), another {{descendant}} of A.pinnatifidum, {{by having a}} blade broadest at the middle or between the middle and the base, {{rather than at the}} base itself, and by the presence of brown color throughout the stipe and sometimes into the rachis. In contrast to Boydston's spleenwort (A.×boydstoniae), A.×gravesii has fewer than fifteen pairs of pinnae, which are not sessile, and when dark color is present in the rachis, it covers less than seven-eights of that structure. The most similar hybrid to A.×gravesii is probably Kentucky spleenwort (A.×kentuckiense), a hybrid of A.pinnatifidum and ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron). In A.×kentuckiense, the blade tapers at the base, the second and third pairs of pinnae being shorter than the fourth and fifth; in A.×gravesii, all these pairs are approximately equal inside. A.×kentuckiense takes on a somewhat papery textures when dried, while A.×gravesii is more leathery. Finally, the guard cells of the latter average 49micrometers, slightly larger than the 46micrometers of the former. As this character can only be examined by microscope, and the ranges of individual guard cell size overlap, some care is required in its use; 30 measurements from a single pinna were used to obtain an average length <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> It is particularly useful in determining the identity of dried material.|$|E

25|$|The genus Wollemia shares {{morphological}} characteristics {{with the}} genera Araucaria and Agathis. Wollemia and Araucaria both have closely crowned sessile and amphistomatic leaves, and aristate bract scales, while Wollemia and Agathis both have fully fused bracts, ovuliferous scales, and winged seeds. Scrutiny of {{the fossil record}} likewise does not clarify Wollemia’s relationship to Araucaria or Agathis, since the former has similarly disparate leaf characters in its adult and juvenile forms, and the latter has similar cone characters. Further, the recent description of several extinct genera within the Araucariaceae points to complex relationships within the family and a significant loss of diversity since the Cretaceous. An early study of the rbcL gene sequence places Wollemia in the basal position of the Araucariaceae and as the sister group to Agathis and Araucaria. In contrast, another study of the rbcL sequence shows that Wollemia is the sister group to Agathis and Araucaria is basal. The different outgroup selection and genes used <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> are the reasons behind the discrepancy over the groupings of the three genera. Later genetic studies corroborate Wollemias placement in the Araucariaceae as sister to Agathis {{based on data from}} the 28s rRNA gene, a combination of rbcL and matK genes, and a comprehensive study encompassing nuclear ribosomal 18S and 26S rRNA, chloroplast 16S rRNA, rbcL, matK and rps4, and mitochondrial coxl and atp1 genes.|$|E

When the study's research subjects were statistically equated for parents' level of education, birth order, residence and gender, it found that adolescents who had watched Sesame Street as preschoolers were positively influenced by it.

The effects were stronger in adolescent boys than in adolescent girls.|$|E

500|$|Bell et al. {{considered}} their sample of homosexual adults more representative than those used <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> {{and argued that}} the fact that they examined blacks separately from whites, and men separately from women, helped them {{to determine the extent to}} which patterns of homosexual and heterosexual development depend on race and sex. They wrote that while Bell, a psychologist and therapist, was [...] "relatively supportive of psychodynamic theory", Weinberg and Hammersmith were sociologists with a different theoretical perspective. They argued that their varying outlooks counteracted any bias due to their respective backgrounds. Bell et al. did not believe that completing their study earlier would have altered their findings. Believing that familiarity with scientific theories about homosexuality might bias their respondents′ answers, Bell et al. did not report results that could be explained through exposure to books, articles or scientific lectures about homosexuality. They used path analysis, a statistical technique originally developed for use in the biological sciences, to try to establish which factors were most important. Path analysis required dividing [...] "the independent variables into sequential stages, according to the time when their influences are most likely to occur." [...] The dependent variable Bell et al. wanted to explain, adult sexual preference, went at the final stage.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the British {{palaeontologist}} Mark P. Witton {{reported the}} [...] "rediscovery" [...] of a jaw-piece {{that belonged to}} specimen NHMUK R3877, but which had been neglected in a drawer for a century, perhaps removed shortly after Hooley's 1913 article. Though Hooley included an illustration of this piece, it was not incorporated into his reconstruction of the skull, and the skull length he proposed was repeated by workers until Witton's report. Witton concluded that the jaw-piece represented almost the entire missing portion of the skull, and suggested that the skull {{would have been much}} shorter than previously assumed, making I. latidens very distinct from other istiodactylids. Witton's updated skull reconstruction was different enough from the skull of I. sinensis for him to conclude they did not belong in the same genus, but he advised against placing I. sinensis in its own genus. Witton pointed out that the two Istiodactylus species had been grouped with Liaoxipterus brachyognathus <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> and that I. sinensis may instead have been a species in the genus Liaoxipterus, or even the same species, since they were found in the same formation and had few differences.
