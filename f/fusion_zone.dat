40|$|Archaea of {{the genus}} Sulfolobus have a single-circular {{chromosome}} with three replication origins. All three origins fire in every cell in every cell cycle. Thus, three pairs of replication forks converge and terminate in each replication cycle. Here, we report 2 D gel analyses of the replication fork <b>fusion</b> <b>zones</b> located between origins. These indicate that replication termination involves stochastic fork collision. In bacteria, replication termination is linked to chromosome dimer resolution, a process that requires the XerC and D recombinases, FtsK and the chromosomal dif site. Sulfolobus encodes a single-Xer homologue and its deletion gave rise to cells with aberrant DNA contents and increased volumes. Identification of the chromosomal dif site that binds Xer in vivo, and biochemical characterization of Xer/dif recombination revealed that, in contrast to bacteria, dif is located outside the fork <b>fusion</b> <b>zones.</b> Therefore, it appears that replication termination and dimer resolution are temporally and spatially distinct processes in Sulfolobus...|$|R

To diminish the probability {{of this type of}} cracking, excess material restraint should be avoided, and a proper filler material should be utilized. Other causes include too high welding current, poor joint design that does not diffuse heat, impurities (such as sulfur and phosphorus), preheating, speed is too fast, and long arcs.|$|E

Conventional welding produced extremely coarse columnar <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> grains (an average linear dimension of 530 micrometers) while welds produced with a magnetically oscillated arc contained equiaxed <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> grains averaging 115 micrometers in diameter. Slow strain rate tensile tests were conducted in varying water vapor atmospheres, on weldments with average <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> grain sizes ranging between 115 and 530 micrometers. Fracture strength and percent strain to fracture were measured for each <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> microstructure. The fracture strength increased {{in proportion to the}} inverse square root of the mean grain diameter, and decreased with increasing water vapor concentration. The results of the tensile tests showed that finer, equiaxed fusion zones were less susceptible to hydrogen cracking and more tolerant of high hydrogen concentrations than coarse <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> grain structures.

The experimental results indicated that the grain refinement was very obvious in the second and third pass <b>fusion</b> <b>zones</b> (304 - 1 and 304 - 2) when the welding pass was increased from 1 to 3. This refining phenomenon was attributed to the higher cooling rate and the degree of supercooling. The delta phase precipitated in the secondary and the tertiary dendrite arms of the delta-ferrite and it was able to grow on the dendrite arms along the [1 (1) over bar 1] crystallographic in a 45 degrees angle.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels have been extensively used in parts that {{are subject to}} corrosive environments and that have high mechanical strength requirements. Welding usually distorts the well-balanced austenite-ferrite ratio, and can produce brittle intermetallic phases; therefore, post-welding heat treatments are usually required. For applications where post-welding treatments are not possible, low heat input methods, such as micro-tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) and laser beam welding (LBW), can be used. The present investigation analyzed the microstructure, mechanical, and corrosion properties of 2507 -classduplex steel tubes after welding. The microstructures of the heat-affected <b>zones</b> and the <b>fusion</b> <b>zones</b> contained variable amounts of ferrite and austenite. In the heat-affected and <b>fusion</b> <b>zones</b> in the TIG samples, the microstructures were primarily composed of ferrite grains with allotriomorphic austenite at the grain boundaries, intragranular Widmanstätten needles and plate-like precipitates. The LBW samples showed much finer microstructures, which contained austenite in the grain boundaries and fine austenite precipitates in the ferrite grains. Deleterious intermetallic phases, such as &# 963;-phases, were not observed using X-ray diffraction. The tensile strength properties were very similar for the TIG and LBWsamples, reaching tensile strengths of approximately 840 MPa and total elongations between 61 and 87 %. The heat-affected zone of the TIG welds were particularly susceptible to corrosion (0. 05 mm/year) compared to the base metal (0. 007 mm/year) and the laser welds (0. 01 mm/year). Therefore, laser welding is a promising technique for the welding of 2507 -class duplex tubes...|$|R

40|$|Although {{laser welding}} is {{probably}} the most used joining technique for NiTi shape memory alloys there is still alack of understanding about the effects of laser welding parameters on the microstructural induced changes: inboth the heat affected and <b>fusion</b> <b>zones</b> martensite may be present, while the base material is fully austenitic. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction was used for fine probing laser welded NiTi joints. Through Rietveld refinementthe martensite and austenite phase fractions were determined and it was observed that the martensite contentincreases towards the weld centreline. This is related to a change of the local transformation temperatures onthese regions, which occurs due to compositional variation in those regions.

The fusion zones of as welded specimens contained fine gamma' and isolated MC carbides. The hardness profile of laser welds in wrought Waspaloy peaked at the <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> and heat affected zone (HAZ) boundaries, owing to fine gamma' precipitation and MC carbides in the <b>fusion</b> <b>zone,</b> and gamma' and M 23 C 6 precipitates at the HAZ boundaries.

In case of as welds condition, fracture occurred in base metal unrelated to the laser source. It could be explained that tensile strength of <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> composed of martensite and bainite is {{higher than that of}} base metal that contains a lot of ferrite despite dilution of Al and Si from coating layer to <b>fusion</b> <b>zone.</b> In case of hot-stamping condition, the fracture occurred in <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> irrelevant to laser source and the tensile strength was lower than hot stamped base metal. In the CO 2 laser welds, Fe 3 (Al,Si) formed near the bond line was transformed into ferrite during hot-stamping. Therefore tensile strength of bond line is lower than that of base metal and center of <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> and the fracture occurred in the bond line. On the other hand, in the Nd:YAG laser welds, the higher concentration of Al formed the ferrite in the <b>fusion</b> <b>zone</b> during hot-stamping treatment.

40|$|Fusion welding {{is common}} in steel {{pipeline}} construction in fossil-fuel power generation plants. Steel pipes in service carry steam at high temperature and pressure, undergoing creep during years of service; their integrity is critical for the safe operation of a plant. The high-grade martensitic P 92 steel is suitable for plant pipes for its enhanced creep strength. P 92 steel pipes are usually joined together with a similar weld metal. Martensitic pipes are sometimes joined to austenitic steel pipes using nickel based weld consumables. Welding involves severe thermal cycles, inducing residual stresses in the welded structure, which, without {{post weld heat treatment}} (PWHT), can be detrimental to the integrity of the pipes. Welding residual stresses can be numerically simulated by applying the finite element (FE) method in Abaqus. The simulation consists of a thermal analysis, determining the temperature history of the FE model, followed by a sequentially-coupled structural analysis, predicting residual stresses from the temperature history. In this paper, the FE thermal analysis of the arc welding of a typical P 92 pipe is presented. The two parts of the P 92 steel pipe are joined together using a dissimilar material, made of Inconel weld consumables, producing a multi-pass butt weld from 36 circumferential weld beads. Following the generation of the FE model, the FE mesh is controlled using Model Change in Abaqus to activate the weld elements for each bead at a time corresponding to weld deposition. The thermal analysis is simulated by applying a distributed heat flux to the model, the accuracy of which is judged by considering the <b>fusion</b> <b>zones</b> in both the parent pipe as well as the deposited weld metal.
