40|$|ABSTRACT Biomass {{is one of}} {{renewable}} energy with great potency in Indonesia. Based on Indonesian Energy Statistic, potential of biomass energy of Indonesia achieved 434. 08 GWh. Gasification {{is a process of}} thermochemical conversion of solid fuel into gas to produce inflammable gas such as CH 4, H 2, CO and compounds with impurity such as H 2 S, CO 2 and TAR. The research examines biomass wastes of bamboo chips and straws in order to know their combustion temperatures and effective flames by using glass wool isolator. <b>Gasification</b> <b>furnace</b> of up-draft type was used to examine fuel combustion. The fuel was put into combustion chamber of the <b>gasification</b> <b>furnace.</b> One process of combustion needed mass of 1. 2 kg. The combustion process was conducted four times for bamboo chips and four times for straws with variation of different air velocities, namely 7. 6, 6. 9, 5. 6, and 4. 7 m/s. Thermoreader was used to read temperature of combustion, then temperature produced from gasification process was read by using thermocouple installed above of the gasification reactor. Based on results of testing, bamboo chips produced higher temperature than that of straws, and the bamboo chips had better flame effectiveness than that of straws. The differences were affected by different characters and nature of the fuels, and also, different air supply into the combustion chamber...|$|E

But in everyday life only rice husks used as an ingredient to help the process of burning bricks or simply dumped without further utilized, therefore the further processing of rice husk to be more efficient. One {{of them is the}} method of gasification. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of air temperature on the combustion temperature, ignition time and time effective flame-fired furnace gasification of rice husk. This study uses a type of downdraft <b>gasification</b> <b>furnace</b> which means the direction of air flow and the direction of gas gasification is down. The study was conducted by varying the temperature of the incoming air into the <b>gasification</b> <b>furnace</b> with variations in air temperature 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C and then retrieve data that includes combustion temperatures, ignition timing and effective burning time. The results showed variations in air temperature affect the combustion temperature, ignition time and time effective flame furnace produced. At an air temperature of 40 °C on average the highest combustion temperature of 547, 1 °C Ignition time 7 minutes and time effective flame for 53 minutes.

40|$|Cement {{industry}} is energy intensive. Global cement production, requiring {{significant amounts of}} energy and materials, is responsible for 5 % of global CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, municipal solid waste (MSW) generation is greatly increasing globally and causing environmental burden. Using RDF as an alternative fuel in cement kilns saves fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum coke and reduces GHG emissions. The fly ash and bottom ash from incineration of RDF {{can be used as}} alternative raw materials for cement production. China has some policies to promote and regulate co-processing of MSW in cement kilns. “Notice on carrying out the pilot work of co-processing of MSW in cement kilns” (Joint section of Industry and Information Office No. 28, 2015) aims to develop available technologies through study on six pilot projects in China before co-processing of MSW in cement kilns is promoted in the whole country. Later Guizhou province was selected as the pilot province for co-processing of MSW in cement kilns and eight projects in Guizhou were chosen to be pilot projects. In “Technical policy for pollution control on co-processing of solid waste in cement kilns” (Ministry of Environmental Protection, Notice No. 72, 2016), co-processing of MSW is seen as an important supplementary technology for incineration and landfill. In China, Conch, Jinyu and Huaxin are primary leading companies in co-processing of MSW in cement kilns. Conch’s technology treats shredded MSW in <b>gasification</b> <b>furnace</b> and transports flammable gases from the furnace to the cement kiln for further incineration. Huaxin produces RDF in pretreatment plants and uses RDF in cement kilns. Jinyu uses RDF for direct incineration in cement kilns or gasifies RDF and uses gases in cement kilns according to its heating value. A case study is done in a Huaxin’s cement plant which has a RDF plant. The example plant uses 45 000 tonnes of RDF and 50 000 tonnes of coal per year. 46 144 tonnes of CO 2 eq emissions are reduced per year in the example plant. If all cement plants in China use RDF and the share of heat provided by RDF is similar to that in the example plant, 307 million tonnes of MSW per year would be directed from landfills to RDF production and 138 million tonnes of RDF would be used in cement kilns. Annual reduction of GHG emissions would be 142 million tonnes CO 2 eq...|$|E

40|$|With {{the current}} trend of CO 2 {{mitigation}} in process industries, {{the primary goal of}} this thesis is to promote biomass as an energy and reduction agent source to substitute fossil sources in the steel industry. The criteria for this substitution are that the steel process retains the same function and the integrated energy efficiency is as high as possible. This work focuses on advanced gasification of biomass and waste for substitution of fossil fuels in steel industry heat treatment furnaces. To achieve this, two approaches are included in this work. The first investigates the gasification performance of pretreated biomass and waste experimentally using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a pilot plant gasifier. The second assesses the integration of the advanced gasification system with a steel heat treatment furnace. First, the pyrolysis and char gasification characteristics of several pretreated biomass and waste types (unpretreated biomass, steam-exploded biomass, and hydrothermal carbonized biomass) were analyzed with TGA. The important aspects of pyrolysis and char gasification of pretreated biomass were identified. Then, with the objective of studying the gasification performance of pretreated biomass, unpretreated biomass pellets (gray pellets), steam-exploded biomass pellets (black pellets), and two types of hydrothermal carbonized biomass pellets (spent grain biocoal and horse manure biocoal) were gasified in a fixed bed updraft gasifier with high-temperature air/steam as the gasifying agent. The gasification performance was analyzed in terms of syngas composition, lower heating value (LHV), gas yield, cold gas efficiency (CGE), tar content and composition, and particle content and size distribution. Moreover, the effects on the reactions occurring in the gasifier were identified with the aid of temperature profiles and gas ratios. Further, the interaction between fuel residence time in the bed (bed height), conversion, conversion rate/specific gasification rate, and superficial velocity (hearth load) was revealed. Due to the effect of bed height on the gasification performance, the bed pressure drop is an important parameter related to the operation of a fixed bed gasifier. Considering the limited studies on this relationship, an available pressure drop prediction correlation for turbulent flow in a bed with cylindrical pellets was extended to a gasifier bed with shrinking cylindrical pellets under any flow condition. Moreover, simplified graphical representations based on the developed correlation, which could be used as an effective guide for selecting a suitable pellet size and designing a grate, were introduced. Then, with the identified positive effects of pretreated biomass on the gasification performance, the possibility of fuel switching in a steel industry heat treatment furnace was evaluated by effective integration with a multi-stage gasification system. The performance was evaluated in terms of gasifier system efficiency, furnace efficiency, and overall system efficiency with various heat integration options. The heat integration performance was identified based on pinch analysis. Finally, the efficiency of the co-production of bio-coke and bio-H 2 was analyzed to increase the added value of the whole process. It was found that 1) the steam gasification of pretreated biomass is more beneficial in terms of the energy value of the syngas, 2) diluting the gasifying agent and/or lowering the agent temperature compensates for the ash slagging problem in biocoal <b>gasification,</b> 3) the <b>furnace</b> efficiency can be improved by switching the fuel from natural gas (NG) to syngas, 4) the gasifier system efficiency can be improved by recovering the furnace flue gas heat for the pretreatment, and 5) the co-production of bio-coke and bio-H 2 significantly improves the system efficiency.
