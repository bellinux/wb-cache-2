40|$|The use of {{multipurpose}} {{solutions for}} {{cleaning and disinfecting}} rigid gas permeable lenses has replaced single purpose solutions, {{but there are no}} reports of the efficacy of these multipurpose solutions, or of the effects of storage conditions on their disinfecting capacities. This study investigated activity against four bacterial and two fungal species, and the effects of storage in a refrigerator, at room temperature, at elevated temperature in both dry and humid conditions and with exposure to sunlight. The disinfecting solutions were challenged with the micro-organisms initially upon opening and then at 2 -weekly intervals up to 12 weeks after being stored under the different conditions. Solutions were opened daily to simulate use. One solution failed to meet Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria to reduce numbers of bacteria by three log dilutions and of fungi by one log dilution.

40|$|The {{objective}} was {{to evaluate the use}} of ractopamine (RAC) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diet for pacu (Piaractus mesopotaminus) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finishing phase on some quality parameters of the fillets. Thirty-five animals weighing 0. 868 ± 0. 168 kg were distributed in a completely randomised design with five treatments (0. 0 - control; 11. 25, 22. 50, 33. 75 and 45 ppm of RAC) and seven replicates with two fillets obtained from the same animal. The diets were isocaloric and isoprotein and experimental time was 90 days. RAC did not affect (P> 0. 05) the initial pH or ph after 24 hours of the fillets. Compared to the control, RAC increased (P< 0. 05) the moisture content of <b>the</b> fillets <b>in</b> natura and lipid oxidation of samples stored <b>for</b> 12 days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> or freezer <b>for</b> 60 days. <b>The</b> RAC <b>in</b> 11. 25 ppm reduced (P< 0. 05) the lipid content, while 45 ppm reduced (P< 0. 05) <b>the</b> crude protein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fillets. Considering only RAC, there was a linear increase (P< 0. 05) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lipid content (P< 0. 05) and a linear reduction in crude protein and weight loss after cooking the fillets. There was a quadratic effect (P< 0. 05) on the ash content, weight loss and lipid oxidation in fillets stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> or freezer. A RAC dose of 33. 75 ppm resulted in a lower lipid oxidation index. In conclusion, ractopamine at 11. 25 ppm is effective for reducing <b>the</b> fat content <b>in</b> fillets of pacu, although it increases the formation of peroxides in samples kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> freezer for longer than 60 days.

40|$|MAINTENANCE of {{bacterial}} strains by repeated subcultivation is both expensive, laborious and time-consuming; moreover, {{there is always}} the possibility of contamination or of differential selection of sub-strains with specific properties. In consequence, several methods, such as freeze-drying or storage at low temperatures, have been introduced by which bacterial cultures can be kept alive for long periods with their reproductive and metabolic activity at an extremely low level. However, information is rather sparse on such methods for the storage of tubercle bacilli. For instance, Corper and Gauss (1923) found that tubercle bacilli remained viable in Petroff's egg medium or glycerol agar after storage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> incubator or <b>refrigerator</b> <b>for</b> 4 to 8 months.

40|$|Forensic {{entomology}} (FE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important tools for estimating the time since death by analyzing the species composition and age of the necrophagous fauna on the dead body. Sampling, transferring and killing/storing of this insect evidence is a very important task in forensic entomology because different methods can influence survival and further rearing of <b>the</b> living samples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory or bias the morphological examination of the dead specimens. The majority of “Best Practices” and “Guidelines” in forensic entomology recommend that fly larvae, the most important group in FE, should kept under controlled or at least known conditions, most suitable at 2 - 6 °C. They suggest in addition that larvae should be stored in vials with an air-permeable lid and that these vials should be equipped with coarse sawdust or paper for taking e. g. excretion liquids. Living samples should be then transport to an expert within 24 hours. While keeping the latter window of time is a realistic approach, cooling the samples or catering them during storage can be a difficult task for crime scene technicians or forensic pathologists. But neglecting guidelines or best practice recommendations could lead to a weakening of the entomological evidence at court or even its exclusion. However, so far it is not always clear whether and which of these recommendations are based on experiences, opinions or scientific proofed evidence. What happens if there was no ventilation or no appropriate cooling and catering? Is there any unusual mortality or altered development when reared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory for estimating their age?

A control group was created for every treatment. Results showed that the mortality rate is higher in room temperature groups vs fridge groups and L 2 -L 3 vs L 1 and they could suggest that if it is strongly necessary storing alive samplings without air conditions or food, they should be stored in fridge instead of room temperature and the latter is recommended only for larvae with size L 1 -L 2 stages (~ 1 cm) ...|$|R
