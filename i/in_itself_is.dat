5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> {{an indication of}} the peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being a threat to the Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as {{an indication of the}} second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E

25|$|Bogor City is {{surrounded}} by the Bogor Regency (kabupaten) but <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> a separate municipality (cat). The city is divided into six districts (kecamatan), which contain 68 low-level administrative units, 31 of which have the status of settlement and 37 are villages.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{socially}} and politically Jämtland {{has been a}} special territory between Norway and Sweden. This <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> symbolized in the province's coat of arms where Jämtland, the silver moose, is threatened from the east and from the west. During the unrest period in Jämtland's history (1563–1677) it shifted alignment between the two states no less than 13 times.|$|E
25|$|From various {{accounts}} of Ado history, Ado-Ekiti with her farm settlements {{was the largest}} kingdom in the Ekiti Confederation, though Ado <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> an amalgam of three constituent sectors largely brought together after the Ewi’s conquest of Ilesun as OKE EWI, ODO ADO, and OGBON META (three coordinate and equal settlements of Oke Ila, Odo Ora and Oke Efon).|$|E
25|$|In Buddhist practice, humility {{is practiced}} {{in a variety}} of ways. For example, Japanese Soto Zen monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves to remind them of the {{connection}} of the monk's robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> a practice of humility.|$|E

25|$|The issues {{involved}} in raw feeding may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi. It {{is interesting to note}} that the Hortaya Borzaya, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.|$|E
25|$|About {{half of all}} 'marker' {{chromosomes}} are idic(15) but idic(15) <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the rare}} chromosome abnormalities. Incidence at birth appears to be 1 in 30,000 with a sex ratio of almost 1:1; however, since dysmorphic features are absent or subtle and major malformations are rare, chromosome analysis may not be thought to be indicated, and some individuals, particularly in the older age groups, probably remain undiagnosed. There are organizations for families with idic(15) children that offer extensive information and support.|$|E

Generals must learn to do and stick to their job of strategists and planners, leaving tactics where they belong; platoon commanders must learn to take their own growing share of responsibility to conduct actions that concur with the intent indicated by generals, without minute by minute directions.|$|E

25|$|Many Jewish {{scholars}} such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi have elaborated on {{the issues}} of idolatry. One of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) on idolatry. According to the Maimonidean interpretation, idolatry <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> not a fundamental sin, but the grave sin is the belief that God can be corporeal. In the Jewish belief, the only image of God is man, one who lives and thinks; God has no visible shape, and it is absurd to make or worship images; instead man must worship the invisible God alone.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was fond}} of {{comparing}} {{the form of the}} archetype to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given a priori. The representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond to the instincts. The existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.|$|E
25|$|In {{his talk}} to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences upon {{receiving}} a prize, Shafarevich presented {{his view of the}} relationship between mathematics and religion. He notes the multiple discoveries in mathematics, such as that of non-Euclidean geometry to suggest that pure mathematics reflects an objective reality, not a set of conventional definitions or a formalism. He claimed that mathematics' growth <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> not directed or organic. In order to have a unity and direction mathematics needs a goal. This goal can either be set by practical applications or by God as the source of the direction of development. Shafarevich opted for the latter, as pure mathematics is not in itself driven by practical applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{information}} on his Ethics is scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|Achieving city {{status in}} 1484, Galway celebrated its quincentenary in 1984. Galway <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> <b>is</b> not {{particularly}} {{known for its}} attractions, but rather for its lively atmosphere and entertainment scene. This is partly because 25% {{of the population of}} Galway (75,529 in 2011) is made up of students primarily from NUI Galway and GMIT, two third level institutes in the city. Galway is particularly popular with American tourists as Galway {{is said to be the}} most 'Irish' of Ireland's cities, and is one of the few urban areas where you are likely to hear Irish spoken, due to the fact the Gaeltacht area of Connemara is only a few kilometres away. The biggest lake in the country, Lough Corrib, is situated north of the city. The ferry to the Aran Islands is located about 40 minutes away and departs from the village of Rossaveal regularly. The Aran Islands are located in Galway Bay, and the Irish Language is by far the most used language on the islands, with the vast majority using the language regularly. As the islands are quite a bit from the mainland, cars are quite rare and the main form of transport is the bicycle.|$|E
