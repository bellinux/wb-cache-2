The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush.

One of the things that could go wrong would be people blaming us for things that people said on The Well. And the way <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>you</b> get around that was to put the responsibility on the individual.

5000|$|... "The Apostrophe to Vincentine" [...] is a poem from Wallace Stevens's {{first book}} of poetry, Harmonium (1923).

It made you seem so small and lean And nameless, Heavenly vincentine. II I saw you then, as warm as flesh, Brunette, But yet not too brunette, As warm, as clean. Your dress was green, Was whited green, Green vincentine. III Then you came walking, In a group Of human others, Voluble. Yes: you came walking, Vincentine. Yes: you came talking. IV And what I knew you felt came then. monotonous earth I saw become illimitable sphere of you, and that white animal, so lean, turned vincentine, and that white animal, so lean, turned heavenly, heavenly Vincentine. Stevens's conflicted idealization of women in poems like [...] "Vincentine" [...] may not be to everyone's taste, but the poem can be appreciated as a remarkable kind of love poem as well as a study about his recurrent theme of transforming the world through imagination: the animal Vincentine, turned heavenly. She is Stevens's [...] "unaccommodated object of desire before she has been clothed in the beauty of fantasy", according to Vendler.|$|E
