5|$|A {{direct grant}} grammar {{school was a}} type of {{selective}} secondary school in England and Wales that existed between 1945 and 1976. One quarter of the places in these schools were directly funded by central government, while the remainder attracted fees, some paid by the Local <b>Education</b> <b>Authority</b> and some by private pupils. On average, the schools received just over half of their income from the state.|$|E
50|$|CLEAPSS {{first started}} in 1963 as CLEAPSE (Consortium of Local <b>Education</b> <b>Authorities</b> for the Provision of Science Equipment). In 1988 {{the name was}} changed to CLEAPSS (Consortium of Local <b>Education</b> <b>Authorities</b> for the Provision of Science Services) to reflect a change of {{emphasis}} from equipment {{to a range of}} services. Since then, Local <b>Education</b> <b>Authorities</b> became Local Authorities (LAs) and CLEAPSS' services expanded to include D&T, so CLEAPSS was registered as a Trade Mark. CLEAPSS is now simply a name and not an acronym.|$|R

Other attractions include the Cuming Museum, Newington Reference Library and John Smith House, a former Labour Party headquarters which is now used by the local <b>education</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to merge}} the grammar {{school with the}} two {{secondary}} modern establishments to form a comprehensive school were resisted by the Grammar School's governors; in a voluntary-aided school, the local <b>education</b> <b>authority</b> was responsible for its finances, but the governors and headmaster had autonomy over all other school policy. As {{a result of the}} governors' refusal, the LEA ceased to maintain the school, which became legally independent on 1 September 1983. The separate Queen's Schools, meanwhile, were merged to become a co-educational comprehensive school, now named Thomas Clarkson Academy.|$|E

5|$|On 7 May, Livingstone {{called a}} caucus of his supporters; announcing his intent to {{challenge}} McIntosh's leadership, he invited those assembled {{to stand for}} other GLC posts. The meeting ended at 4:45pm having agreed on a full slate of candidates. At 5 o'clock, McIntosh held a GLC Labour meeting; the attendees called an immediate leadership election, in which Livingstone defeated him by 30 votes to 20. The entire left caucus slate was then elected. The next day, a leftist coup deposed Sir Ashley Bramall on the Inner London <b>Education</b> <b>Authority</b> (ILEA), replacing him with Bryn Davies; the left group now controlled both the GLC and the ILEA.|$|E
5|$|Two of Benn's {{children}} have been active in Labour Party politics. His eldest son Stephen was an elected Member of the Inner London <b>Education</b> <b>Authority</b> from 1986 to 1990. His second son Hilary was a councillor in London, stood for Parliament in 1983 and 1987, and becoming Labour MP for Leeds Central in 1999. He was Secretary of State for International Development from 2003 to 2007, and then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until 2010, later serving as Shadow Foreign Secretary (2015–16). This makes him the third generation of his family {{to have been a}} member of the Cabinet, a rare distinction for a modern political family in Britain. Benn's granddaughter Emily Benn was the Labour Party's youngest-ever candidate when she failed to win East Worthing and Shoreham in 2010. Benn was a first cousin once removed of the actress Margaret Rutherford.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility {{for state}} schools in Dorset is divided between three local {{education}} authorities: Dorset County Council, which covers {{the majority of}} the county, and Bournemouth and Poole unitary authorities. Most of the Dorset County Council area operates a two-tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend a primary school before completing their education at secondary school. Only Dorchester, Ferndown, Wimborne and Purbeck maintain a three-tier system (first, middle and high school), although Purbeck is expected to switch to a two-tier system by 2013 because of an excess of unfilled places. Bournemouth operates a two-tier system; Poole operates a three-tier system but will switch to two tiers from September 2013. Poole and Bournemouth are two of a minority of local authorities in England to maintain selective education, each containing two single-sex grammar schools which select pupils on the basis of an eleven-plus examination. Some of the county's schools are academies—self-governing state schools which have become independent of their local <b>education</b> <b>authority</b> and are maintained directly by the Department for Education. In 2010, 59.4% of pupils attending schools in the county council area gained at least five GCSEs at A*–C grades including English and maths, above the national average of 53.4%. Bournemouth and Poole also recorded above average results at 56.5% and 55.3% respectively. However, most non-selective schools in the two unitary authorities fell below the national average.|$|E
