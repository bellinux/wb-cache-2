Depletion in small semiconductor crystals {{is characterized by the}} occurrence of new type depletion (volume depletion) after conventional one (regional depletion), and inclusion of both types makes it possible to formulate the receptor function and response to oxygen (air base), oxidizing gas (nitrogen dioxide), and reducing gas (hydrogen). The equations derived theoretically using physical parameters of the semiconductor side and chemical parameters of the <b>gases</b> <b>side</b> appear to reproduce satisfactorily the sensing behavior to the aforementioned gases as well as the influence of changes in physical parameters such as grain size and donor density.

50|$|Nevertheless, {{particularly}} in larger engines, a high speed combustion oscillation is easily triggered, {{and these are}} not well understood. These high speed oscillations tend to disrupt the <b>gas</b> <b>side</b> boundary layer of the engine, and this can cause the cooling system to rapidly fail, destroying the engine. These kinds of oscillations are much more common on large engines, and plagued {{the development of the}} Saturn V, but were finally overcome.|$|E

40|$|Active {{materials}} and corrosion layers in positive plates of nonantimonial lead/acid batteries, {{at different stages}} of charge/discharge cycling, have been characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the initial stages of cycling, it has been found that the observed overcharging of cells is responsible for the formation of an underlayer of PbO in the grid corrosion layer, and this blocks the transfer of charge to the current collecting grid, causing rapid capacity loss. In the later stages of cycling at a ratio of capacities for charge and discharge (i. e., C/D) of close to unity, the grid corrosion layer does not possess an underlayer of PbO; however, the active material becomes progressively enriched with respect to insulating lead sulfate. It is suggested that initial overcharging is symbolic of grid corrosion as the rate of <b>gassing</b> <b>side</b> reactions is kept to a minimum by restricting the top-of-charge-voltage (TOCV) to 2. 55 V, while sulfation of active material occurring at CID values of about unity is probably attributable to stratification of the electrolyte and its concomitant effect on sulfation of active material...|$|R
50|$|A {{membrane}} oxygenator is {{a device}} used to add oxygen to, and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. It {{can be used}} in two principal modes: to imitate the function of the lungs in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and to oxygenate blood in longer term life support, termed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ECMO. A membrane oxygenator consists of a thin gas permeable membrane separating the blood and gas flows in the CPB circuit; oxygen diffuses from the <b>gas</b> <b>side</b> into the blood, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the gas for disposal.|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} {{controlled}} by a cylindrical cell rotor driven by the engine crankshaft via a belt or chain. Individual cells alternately open and close the exhaust gas and fresh air apertures. When the aperture on the exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>side</b> is reached, pressurized exhaust gas flows into the cell and compresses the fresh air there. As the cell rotor continues to rotate and reaches the aperture on the inlet side, the compressed air flows to the engine. Before the exhaust gas can flow, the aperture is closed again and the exhaust gas column is reflected before entering the engine. The exhaust gas exits at high speed, sucking further intake air into the cell behind it, repeating the process.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{hardware}} unit, the FOEP, was a pressure-tight canister {{containing a}} water-filled centrifuge {{that housed the}} two frogs. The centrifuge was a cylindrical structure that rotated the frogs' heads at scheduled intervals. The FOEP also contained a life support system which could maintain a regulated environment for the frogs. This system consisted of two closed loops, one containing liquid and the other containing gas. The interface between the two loops was a selectively permeable silicone rubber that acted as an artificial lung. Oxygen passed through the membrane from the gas to the liquid side, and carbon dioxide from the liquid to the <b>gas</b> <b>side.</b> The frogs were immersed in the liquid loop. A pump circulated oxygen through the gas-containing loop. Carbon dioxide entering the gas loop was removed by an absorbent and the purified oxygen returned to the pump for recirculation. A water evaporator and an electric heater maintained the water temperature at about 60 °F (15 °C). An amplifier system in the FOEP increased voltage output from the microelectrodes implanted in the animals to the level required by the telemetry apparatus.|$|E

30|$|Hydrogen is most {{commonly}} produced from fossil fuel sources (approx. 95  %), which is neither sustainable (depletion of fossil fuel resources) and environmentally friendly (produces greenhouse <b>gases</b> as <b>side</b> products) [1, 2, 3, 4]. Water electrolysis represents only 4  % of current hydrogen production, {{but is a}} growing area of research {{and the beginning of}} commercialisation of water electrolysers has started. The high cost can be attributed to electrical energy prices and the use of platinum group metals (PGMs) as catalysts to improve the efficiency for hydrogen generation [1, 3, 4, 5, 6].|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one way {{to determine}} the best operating conditions would be creating a mathematical model or process model using software to simulate the vibrating fluidized bed for the desired process.The effects of gas velocity and temperature were modelled. One optimal operating condition would be increasing the drying rate. This is because with increased drying rate, the drying process in the vibrating fluidized bed will be shorter giving the vibrating fluidized bed an overall better efficiency. There are 3 major mechanisms which determine the drying rate. The mechanisms are the heat & mass transfer in the <b>gas</b> <b>side,</b> the thermodynamic equilibrium in between the two phases during contact and the heat & mass transfer within the wet solid. These three mechanisms will increase with the increase in gas velocity as well as the heat & mass transfer coefficient. This will then cause the drying rate to increase because of the increase in gas temperature which causes the gas humidity to decrease.The effects of particle size were modelled as well. It was found that. Larger particle need longer time to dry to reach the same moisture content due to increase in resistance within the particles against heat and mass transfer. Since the resistance against heat transfer within the particle is lower than the resistance against mass transfer; the convection heat not used to vaporize water is used to elevate the material temperature which will lead to higher moisture transfer coefficients within the particles and will cause higher drying rate. Therefore, it was concluded that for optimum operating conditions to be achieved, the particles which are fed into the vibratory fluidized bed should be decreased. Usually the particle size of the feed material is not a controlled parameter unless methods such as grinding are used but doing so would involve extra operating cost which should be avoided. Hence, another option would be by increasing the intensity of the vibrations in the vibrating fluidized bed.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{mathematical}} models {{has been developed}} to predict the heat and mass transfer behavior of moisture transport in air dehumidification applications, with rotary desiccant wheels. A complete model would account for the following mechanisms of transport. 1. convective transport of heat and moisture between {{the air and the}} desiccant surface (<b>gas</b> <b>side</b> resistances) 2. diffusion of moisture and conduction of heat through the solid desiccant layer (solid side resistances) The differential equations, that represent these transport mechanisms, will generally be set up to describe a single desiccant coated flow channel, traversing through the respective supply and regeneration air streams in a 360 degree circular path. Symmetry would suggest that the differential equations be solved in two directions (axial and radial). However, many authors have found that a simple one dimensional (axial) model with <b>gas</b> <b>side</b> resistances only, adequately predicts the experimental performance of air dehumidification in rotary desiccant wheels. In this paper, a heat and mass transfer model is presented incorporating <b>gas</b> <b>side</b> resistances. The model shows reasonable agreement with experimental data.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{system for}} the transcritical CO 2 residential air-conditioning with an internal heat exchanger was built. The effects of working conditions on system performance were experimentally studied. Based on the experimental dada, the second law analysis on the transcritical CO 2 system was performed. The effects of working conditions on the total exergetic efficiency of the system were investigated. The results show that in the studied parameter ranges, the exergetic efficiency of the system increases with the increases of <b>gas</b> cooler <b>side</b> air inlet temperature, <b>gas</b> cooler <b>side</b> air inlet velocity and evaporating temperature. And it will decrease with the increases of evaporator side air inlet temperature and velocity. Then, a complete exergetic analysis was performed for the entire CO 2 transcritical cycle including compressor, gas cooler, expansion valve, evaporator and internal heat exchanger under different working conditions. The average exergy loss in gas cooler is the highest one under all working conditions which is about 30. 7 % of the total exergy loss in the system. The second is the average exergy loss in expansion valve which is about 24. 9 % of the total exergy loss, followed by the exergy losses in evaporator and compressor, which account for 21. 9 % and 19. 5 %, respectively.
