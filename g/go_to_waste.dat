5|$|This was {{a blow to}} the {{short-range}} committee, who {{had made}} good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with portability in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL to overturn the resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the bell-making, the skomorokh {{from the}} first {{sequence}} makes a reappearance amongst the crowds {{who have come to}} watch the bell being raised up and he threatens to kill Andrei, whom he mistakes for the man who denounced him years earlier and therefore led to his arrest, torture and prison sentence. Kirill intervenes on behalf of the silent Andrei and later privately confesses that his sinful envy of Andrei’s talent dissipated once he heard Andrei had abandoned painting and that it was he, Kirill, who had denounced the skomorokh. Kirill then criticises Andrei for allowing his God-given talent for painting to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> and pleads with him to resume his artistry, to no response.|$|E

5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> as only their respective creators {{knew how to}} use them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E

The tournament is paid just under $1 per pound for 5-8 tons of fish.|$|E

25|$|Festive meals {{were held}} to mark {{significant}} occasions, entertain important guests, or as sacrificial or ritual meals. The meal was prepared by both men and women. Meat was always served at these meals and many people participated so {{that there would be}} no leftovers that would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste.</b> Ritual feasts and banquets in ancient Israel, and the ancient Near East in general, were important for building social relationships and demonstrating status, transacting business and concluding agreements, enlisting divine help, or showing thanks, devotion or propitiation to a deity, and for conveying social instruction. These meals were imbued with significance by the occasion and were a time for entertainment and enjoyment.|$|E
25|$|All of {{this would}} <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> however, when Henry VI died of a fever in Messina on 28 September 1197. Following his death many of the higher ranking nobles {{abandoned}} the crusade to protect their interests in the Holy Roman Empire. When civil war broke out shortly after, the crusade found itself leaderless and in 1198 the crusaders retreated back to Tyre and sailed for home. The result was that the crusade had the detrimental effect of destroying Byzantium's dignity and wealth whilst failing to assist her against the Turks. It must be said however that the Byzantines after 1180 entertained no serious plans to reclaim Anatolia from the Turks, so how much territory Henry VI or his predecessor Frederick I seized may have been of little consequence in the long run.|$|E

Crosetti's fascination with the Lincoln assassination was based on Tom Fontana's real-life obsession with it.

[...] He continued, [...] "Such vivid contrasts in the film's approach to its subject lead to its downfall. Any effect the disgustingly boring and extremely brutal murder scenes have <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> seconds later when director Charles B. Pierce leads the picture {{into some of the}} type of poor comedy relief that one is used to seeing in budget pictures of the '60s. As a result, the film is unable to conjure up any mood or suspense." [...] He concludes with, [...] "All in all, the picture is an unpleasant little film and Pierce, after going overboard on the blood and gore scenes, never seems to be able to decide as to how serious the picture should be," [...] and that [...] "both mature and immature minds should avoid the film." [...] A reporter in El Paso, Texas, gave it a mixed review, writing that [...] "this mixture of humor with fact saved 'The Town...' as it wakes the audience when things begin to lag."

2500|$|Soon {{after its}} {{introduction}} to the Old World, tobacco came under frequent criticism from state and religious leaders. Murad IV, sultan of the Ottoman Empire 1623-40 {{was among the first}} to attempt a smoking ban by claiming it was a threat to public morality and health. The Chongzhen Emperor of China issued an edict banning smoking two years before his death and the overthrow of the Ming dynasty. Later, the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty, would proclaim smoking [...] "a more heinous crime than that even of neglecting archery". In Edo period Japan, some of the earliest tobacco plantations were scorned by the shogun as being a threat to the military economy by letting valuable farmland <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> for the use of a recreational drug instead of being used to plant food crops.|$|E
2500|$|The Cottrell {{homestead}} is {{a landmark}} in Old Bridge. It {{was built in}} 1831 and still stands today on {{the northeast corner of}} County Route 516 and Cottrell Road. The Cottrells owned a [...] apple orchard that was located across the street from their home. Apples that could not be used because of their size or quality did not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste.</b> Across from the cold-storage building on the southwest corner of Cottrell Road and Route 516 (where Rite Aid is now located), the family built the New Jersey Apple Growers Inc. distillery. It was at this distillery that they pressed the apples into cider and distilled the brandy in large vats. The brandy would age in barrels in a government warehouse that was located on the Cottrells' property. The Cottrells produced apple brandy for twenty years on the farm and sold it wholesale to distributors under the name Browntown.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{moratorium}} {{applies only to}} commercial whaling, whaling under the scientific-research and aboriginal-subsistence provisions of the ICRW is still allowed. However, environmental groups dispute the claim of research [...] "as a disguise for commercial whaling, which is banned." [...] Since 1994, Norway, has been whaling commercially and Iceland began hunting commercially in September 2006. Since 1986, Japan has been whaling under scientific research permits. The US and several other nations are whaling under aboriginal whaling auspices. Norway lodged a protest to the zero catch limits in 1992 and is not bound by them. Anti-whaling countries and lobbies accuse Japan's scientific whaling of being a front for commercial whaling. The Japanese government argues that the refusal of anti-whaling nations to accept simple head counts of whale population {{as a measure of}} recovery of whale species justifies its continuing studies on sex and age of population distributions, and further points out that IWC regulations specifically require that whale meat obtained by scientific whaling not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste.</b> Japan, on the other hand, has raised objections to U.S. aboriginal subsistence whaling, generally seen to be in retaliation to anti-whaling nations' (including the United States') objections to aboriginal subsistence whaling for several Japanese fishing communities, which traditionally hunted whales until the imposition of {{the moratorium}}.|$|E
