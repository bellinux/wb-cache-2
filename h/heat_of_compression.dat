2500|$|Near {{isothermal}} compression (and expansion) {{is a process}} in which air is compressed in very close proximity to a large incompressible thermal mass such as a heat absorbing and releasing structure (HARS) or a water spray. A HARS is usually made up of a series of parallel fins. As the air is compressed the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> is rapidly transferred to the thermal mass, so the gas temperature is stabilised. An external cooling circuit is then used to maintain the temperature of the thermal mass.|$|E
2500|$|One {{implementation}} of isothermal CAES uses high, medium and low pressure pistons in series, with each stage {{followed by an}} airblast venturi pump that draws ambient air over an air-to-air (or air-to-seawater) heat exchanger between each expansion stage. Early compressed air torpedo designs used a similar approach, substituting seawater for air. The venturi warms the exhaust of the preceding stage and admits this preheated air to the following stage. This approach was widely adopted in various compressed air vehicles such as H. K. Porter, Inc.'s mining locomotives and trams. [...] Here the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> is effectively stored in the atmosphere (or sea) and returned later on.|$|E
2500|$|Diabatic storage dissipates {{much of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> with {{intercoolers}} (thus approaching isothermal compression) {{into the}} atmosphere as waste; essentially wasting, thereby, the renewable energy used to perform the work of compression. [...] Upon removal from storage, the temperature of this compressed air is the one indicator {{of the amount of}} stored energy that remains in this air. Consequently, if the air temperature is low for the energy recovery process, the air must be substantially re-heated prior to expansion in the turbine to power a generator. This reheating can be accomplished with a natural gas fired burner for utility grade storage or with a heated metal mass. As recovery is often most needed when renewable sources are quiescent, fuel must be burned {{to make up for the}} wasted heat. [...] This degrades the efficiency of the storage-recovery cycle; and while this approach is relatively simple, the burning of fuel adds to the cost of the recovered electrical energy and compromises the ecological benefits associated with most renewable energy sources. [...] Nevertheless, this is thus far the only system which has been implemented commercially.|$|E

40|$|Closed lipid vesicles act as osmometers {{increasing}} or decreasing their volume {{under the}} influence of osmotic gradients. The enthalpy changes accompanying membrane compression or expansion have not been measured yet, and first results obtained with high-sensitivity titration calorimetry are reported here. Phospholipid vesicles suspended in and in equilibrium with an electrolyte or nonelectrolyte with a defined initial concentration of c(i), were injected into a solution with a final concentration of c(f), and the heat changes were monitored with a titration microcalorimeter. Osmotic compression (delta c = c(f) â€“ c(i) 0) an endothermic heat change with deltaH approximately 1000 +/- 200 cal/mol; both results normalized to a concentration gradient of delta c = 1 M NaCl. The <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>compression</b> and expansion varied linearly with the lipid content {{and the size of the}} osmotic gradient but were independent of the vesicle size. The cubic thermal expansion coefficient alpha(v) which equals (1 /V) (deltaV/deltaT) p could be derived and was found to be 1. 25 x 10 (- 3) and 2. 5 x 10 (- 3) K(- 1) for the compressed and expanded bilayer vesicles, respectively. The entropy changes associated with compression and expansion could be estimated. <b>Compression</b> <b>of</b> the membrane led to a negative entropy change and increased the hydrocarbon chain order. Expansion of the membrane was accompanied by a positive entropy change which can be explained, in part, by more disordered hydrocarbon chains.

40|$|In {{very low}} ambient {{temperature}} regions, both heating capacity and {{coefficient of performance}} (COP) of traditional air-source vapor compression heat pumps drop significantly with a decrease in outdoor air temperature. The current study investigates two alternative technologies for improving the efficiency <b>of</b> vapor <b>compression</b> cycles especially at very low ambient temperatures. The first method is liquid flooded compression with regeneration in which {{a significant amount of}} non-volatile liquid is mixed into the stream of refrigerant vapor entering the compressor in order to approach an isothermal compression process. The second method is multi-port refrigerant injection during compression and economizing which is similar to multi-stage compression in providing refrigerant cooling between compressor stages and a lower refrigerant quality entering the evaporator. ^ Both technology improvements address the thermodynamic inefficiencies that are inherent within the simple vapor compression cycle that is employed in most heat pumping equipment. The benefits of oil flooding and saturated vapor injection are evaluated using experimental testing of an oil flooded R 410 A scroll compressor and a 2 port saturated vapor injection R 410 A scroll compressor and simulation. The results show that the performance of the compressor increases with oil flooding and saturated vapor injection especially at very low evaporation temperatures. The experimental compressor results were used for system analysis <b>of</b> liquid flooded <b>compression</b> with regeneration and saturated vapor injection. At - 10 °C ambient temperature, estimated COP (<b>heating)</b> <b>of</b> the flooded <b>compression</b> with regeneration cycle was 25 % higher while that of the vapor injection cycle was 12. 5 % higher than the standard vapor compression cycle. For Minneapolis, the seasonal efficiency (<b>heating)</b> <b>of</b> a flooded <b>compression</b> with regeneration cycle was estimated to be 34 % higher while that of the vapor injection cycle was 21 % higher than the standard vapor compression cycle. Both technologies lead to higher energy efficiency and less degradation in heating capacity at low ambient temperatures. Also, a previously developed detailed flooded scroll compressor model has been validated with the oil flooding experimental data, for which good agreement was found. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{very large}} hot stars, {{pressure}} from gamma rays in the stellar core keeps the upper {{layers of the}} star supported against gravitational pull from the core.

This reduces the pressure. When the collapse stops, the positrons find electrons and the pressure from gamma rays is driven up, again. The population of positrons provides a brief reservoir of new gamma rays as the expanding supernova's core pressure drops.|$|R

The effects of the main parameters of performance analysis such as refrigerating effect, compressor work, coefficient of performance, volumetric refrigerating capacity, discharge temperature, pressure ratio, condenser duty, compressor power, refrigerating mass flow are analyzed for various evaporating temperatures. The compressor power required for the refrigeration during analysis with R 152 a and its blends were observed. The results shows that the refrigerants R 435 A consumes 1. 098 % less compressor power than that of R 152 a. The COP, Refrigerating effect for R 435 A is 1. 229 %, 32. 198 % higher than R 152 a respectively. The refrigerant mass flow is decreased by 24. 353 % while using R 435 A substitute to R 152 a.
