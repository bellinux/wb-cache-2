5|$|In {{the wake}} of his wedding to Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) is urged to flee Walford by his father and uncle after {{becoming}} the prime suspect in the investigation of the murder of local landlord Archie Mitchell. Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood) distracts the police while Bradley and Stacey attempt to escape from Albert Square. Elsewhere, Archie's youngest daughter Roxy (Rita Simons) suspects that her sister Ronnie (Samantha Womack) is the murderer. She accuses Ronnie, who tells her that their father raped Stacey, and confesses that he did the same to her when she was a child. Ronnie and Roxy's cousin Phil (Steve McFadden) ransacks the home of Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), believing that Ian <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> possession a cufflink which would implicate him in Archie's murder. He exits without finding it, leaving Ian and Dot Branning (June Brown) to watch an old videotape of their family and friends from the past 25 years, reminiscing about the past.|$|E
5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic concept}} of SaGa Frontier {{is based on}} its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven {{different}} protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, {{each with its own}} culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non-linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are free to go almost anywhere and interact with almost anyone. Travel through most of the Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has his or her own storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters even encounter each other during their quests. The storyline of each character also changes depending on who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who the protagonist <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or her party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2.|$|E

25|$|When Goldfinger first meets Bond in Miami, {{he claims}} that he is agoraphobic; a ploy {{to allow him to}} cheat Junius du Pont, a {{previous}} acquaintance of Bond's (from Casino Royale) at a game of two-handed Canasta. Bond figures out how Goldfinger is managing this, and blackmails him by forcing him to admit his deception. This incident also establishes Goldfinger as boundlessly greedy, as whatever sums he can gain by this elaborate cheating are negligible compared with what he already <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> possession.|$|E

Former manager Darren Ferguson said [...] "there might be those who say he lacks a little bit of pace but what he does not have in his legs he <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head". In his career, Boyd has only ever scored three headed goals, and says that he is much more comfortable with the ball at his feet.|$|E
500|$|Until the {{invention}} of the googly, bowling was expected to be predictable, and the googly may initially have been considered an underhand tactic. On one occasion, Nottinghamshire batsman William Gunn was stumped after running down the pitch in an attempt to stop a ball bowled by Bosanquet. Gunn's teammate Arthur Shrewsbury then protested that Bosanquet's bowling was unfair. On another occasion, when asked if the googly was illegal, Bosanquet is said to have replied, [...] "Oh no, only immoral." [...] For many years, the googly remained known as a [...] "Bosie" [...] in Australia. His Times obituary stated, [...] "No man probably <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> time had so important and lasting an influence on the game of cricket".|$|E

500|$|Chadwick {{argues that}} the antiquity of the tale's theme – feasting – is {{probably}} the most anciently attested of all Celtic stories. [...] The heroic communal feast was apparently central to the Celtic tradition, and classical ethnographers of the Posidonian tradition, notably the 2nd-century Athenaeus, give accounts of Gaulish feasts which closely parallel their Insular counterparts. Similarly, in the 1st century BC, the Greek ethnographer Diodorus Siculus describes in detail how the Gauls [...] "honour distinguished men with the best portions of the meat", and how disputes often lead to challenges in which [...] "they set about glorifying the valour of their forefathers and boasting of their own prowess; {{and at the same time}} they deride and belittle their opponent, and try by their speeches to rob him of the courage he <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart".|$|E
500|$|The {{plant in}} front of John the Baptist has aspects of both hyssop and cornflower, yet is most likely a hyssop because it grows from a wall. Cornflower is an {{attribute}} of Christ and symbolizes Heaven while hyssop symbolizes both the humility of Christ and baptism. There is a citron tree in the background, which represents the Cedar of Lebanon. Michelangelo uses the hyssop and tree as a visual representation of a quote by Rabanus Maurus, [...] "From the Cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop which grows on a stony wall we have {{an explanation of the}} Divinity which Christ <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Father and of the humanity that he derives from the Virgin Mary." [...] The clover in the foreground represents the Trinity and salvation. [...] The anemone plant represents the Trinity and the Passion of Christ.|$|E

500|$|Playwright Horton Foote {{reportedly}} considered {{giving up}} on film writing, due to what he regarded as a poor adaption of his 1952 play The Chase into a 1966 film of the same name. Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaption of his 1968 play Tomorrow in 1972, his interest in filmmaking was rekindled, {{under the condition that}} he maintain some degree of control over the final product. Foote said of this stage in his career, [...] "I learned that film really should be like theatre in the sense that in theatre, the writer is, of course, very dominant... If we don't like something, we can speak our minds.... It is always a collaborative effort.... But in Hollywood it wasn't so. A writer there <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> contract that you are a writer for hire, which means that you write a script, then it belongs to them." [...] This renewed interest in cinema prompted Foote to write Tender Mercies, his first work written specifically for the screen. In the view of biographer George Terry Barr, the script reflected [...] "Foote's determination to battle a Hollywood system that generally refuses to make such personal films." ...|$|E
500|$|After Carey premiered [...] "Obsessed" [...] on June 16, 2009, {{the media}} frenzied and began speculating {{the song was}} {{targeting}} at Eminem, due to its lyrics and overall message. Following the song's accompanying music video, which featured Carey playing a role that resembled the rapper, critics considered it Carey's response to Eminem's [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". Soon after both the song and video's release, the rapper released another song, titled [...] "The Warning" [...] on July 30, 2009, which he {{claimed to be a}} retaliation. The song's lyrics allude to his supposed relationship with the singer, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof he claims to have of the couple. The song begins [...] "Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me.

500|$|Critics praised Damon's {{performance}} in the episode. A television reviewer from The Sacramento Bee noted that Damon [...] "did a well-publicized (and very good) gig" [...] on the show. [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented that Damon was [...] "incredibly charming" [...] and funny. Matt Roush of TV Guide, in review of season four, said: [...] "If it weren't for some inspired guest stars — Matt Damon as a straight guy bluffing his way into a gay chorus, Michael Douglas as a gay detective clowning {{it up on the}} dance floor, Glenn Close as a lusty photographer groping both Will and Grace during a shoot — this season would be an awfully sad misfire." [...] Wales on Sundays Wil Marlow called Damon's performance {{one of the most memorable}} guest appearances in the history of the show, and commented that he [...] "held his own well against serial scene-stealer Sean Hayes." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald said the episode [...] "flies with jokes predicated on stereotypes and sexual innuendo", but [...] "Damon is a good sport with all the silliness, though, and seems more at ease here in the sitcom than he <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> last three films." [...] Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, said Damon was [...] "magnificent" [...] in the episode and a [...] "great experience" [...] for the cast of the show. Sean Hayes cites [...] "A Chorus Lie" [...] as one of his favorite episodes. In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Damon's guest spot as their number two most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.|$|E

500|$|Catholic {{theology}} sees conscience as {{the last}} practical [...] "judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [...] to do good and to avoid evil". The Second Vatican Council (1962-65) describes: [...] "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and {{to do what is}} good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths." [...] Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but [...] "the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful" [...] In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience. [...] Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before confession. Catholic teaching holds that, [...] "Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters". This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience. [...] A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, [...] "t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility... In such cases, the person is culpable for the wrong he commits." [...] Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience. [...] For example, some priests make {{on the use of the}} so-called internal forum solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The Catholic Church has warned that [...] "rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching... can be at the source of errors in judgment in moral conduct".|$|E
