40|$|Conceptualising {{smallholder}} farming households as {{collective action}} institutions, that make interrelated decisions about investment, resource use and allocation {{in a common}} household farm, may contribute to understanding widely observed uncooperative outcomes, such as yield gaps, gender gaps in productivity, suboptimal or Pareto inefficient sustainable intensification and climate change adaptation. We examine the relation between participatory intra-household decision making – {{as a set of}} ‘rules of the game’ that reduces information and bargaining power asymmetries – and cooperative, i. e. more efficient, sustainable and equitable, outcomes in smallholder coffee farming households in Uganda.

40|$|Polycultured agrarian {{systems in}} Ecuadorian Amazonia (also called chakras or swollen gardens) are characterised by a market-oriented crop for the {{generation}} of monetary income, for example, cocoa, other agricultural products (e. g., banana and cassava), and livestock for family <b>farm</b> <b>consumption.</b> Moreover, a chakra is an outstanding example of agroforestry production, in which ecological, social and economic elements co-evolve from a set of close and strong connections. In this context, the conservation and transformation of their biological subsystems {{can be understood as}} the result of complex interactions between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors. In turn, such interactions are essential to provide food and monetary income to the indigenous community. Relevant agency capabilities exist that could cause an agroforestry system to take a different path of co-evolution, that is, towards greater or lesser sustainability associated with different levels of complexity. In conclusion, chakras have key ecological features that can mitigate the impact of human population growth in Amazonia. Additionally, chakras have their own processes of social self-regulation which enhance the possibilities of adaptation of Kichwa communities to changing environmental conditions, being essential elements in local food sovereignty, equitable gender relations and the respect of ancestral wisdom...|$|E

This paper concerns the studies of existing water resource management and determines factors affecting decision making of water resource management in rainfed area. In these cases, a multi criteria decision making model has been determined that aims at allocating efficient water and land resources to farms in the Upper Ping River basin in Chiang Mai, by optimizing a set of important socio-economic objectives which depend on sustainable agricultural and rural development. The solution was found by the using two analytical steps as follows: single objective optimization and compromise programming. In rainfed areas, the model cropping pattern advises farmers to grow the in-season rice, tobacco and longan. If the farmers follow the model cropping pattern even the gross margin increases insignificantly and water using increases slightly from the up to now existing water on <b>farm</b> <b>consumption.</b> The water resource management in rainfed areas the farmers store the scarce water in small reservoirs and water tanks on their farms for saving it for the dry season because the water on-farm security is an indispensable prerequisite in decide making upon the next year crop.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} in situ {{conservation}} of landrace crop varieties in the Medak district of the southern Indian state, Telangana. The objective of this work was to investigate two main questions: 1) Under what unique conditions are smallholder peasant farmers {{willing and able to}} continuously grow local, landrace crops? 2) What characterises the women farmers who grow local landrace crops in this district of landrace crop origins? A Systems Thinking methodology was used to develop and analyse the data. 101 surveys were given out across 14 different villages to build a context of what types of farms exist in the region, how they are situated, and the proportions of landrace crops grown in the area. 36 semi-structured interviews were undertaken for a deeper insight into the farmers' values and perceptions concerning landrace and modern varieties of crops. All data was collected via the Deccan Development Society network. The results showed that there are unique socio and ecological conditions in the Medak that do make the area an important and functioning region of {{in situ conservation}} efforts for many landrace crops. 1. Ecologically, the district is semi-arid with scarce rainfall and general soil nutrient unbalances, this renders many modern variety crops unsuitable allowing locally adapted landraces the default crop to be used. 2. Socio-economically, farmers are without financial means, therefore, much of the investments needed for agricultural modernisation is inaccessible to them i. e. synthetic pest management inputs, irrigation, land size, etc. The quantitative results showed that smallholding farmers conserve the most overall crop genetic diversity. This is understood for various reasons: 1. Little market integration characterised by direct on <b>farm</b> <b>consumption</b> of crops grown 2. Functioning and sprawled rural communities 3. Negative perceptions towards modern variety crops 4. Some limited institutional support 5. Functioning markets that demand local, landrace crops 6. Tradition. The Medak district is a functioning area of in situ conservation for many landrace crops, {{and will continue to be}} while farmers work within the boundaries of the six points noted above. The continued sustainability of these efforts rests in the next generation whose values may depart from their fore-families while India itself goes through major agrarian changes, and education becomes more accessible...|$|E

40|$|High level {{radioactive}} waste (HLW) {{is stored in}} underground storage tanks at the Savannah River Site. The SRS is proceeding with closure of the 22 tanks located in F-Area. Closure consists of removing {{the bulk of the}} waste, chemical cleaning, heel removal, stabilizing remaining residuals with tailored grout formulations and severing/sealing external penetrations. A performance assessment is being performed in support of closure of the F-Tank Farm. Initially, the carbon steel construction materials of the high level waste tanks will provide a barrier to the leaching of radionuclides into the soil. However, the carbon steel liners will degrade over time, most likely due to corrosion, and no longer provide a barrier. The tank life estimation in support of the performance assessment has been completed. The estimation considered general and localized corrosion mechanisms of the tank steel exposed to the contamination zone, grouted, and soil conditions. The estimation was completed for Type I, Type III, and Type IV tanks in the F-Tank Farm. The tank life estimation in support of the F-Tank Farm closure performance assessment has been completed. The estimation considered general and localized corrosion mechanisms of the tank steel exposed to the contamination zone, grouted, and soil conditions. The estimation was completed for Type I, Type III, and Type IV tanks in the F-Tank <b>Farm.</b> <b>Consumption</b> of the tank steel encased in grouted conditions was determined to occur either due to carbonation of the concrete leading to low pH conditions, or the chloride-induced de-passivation of the steel leading to accelerated corrosion. A deterministic approach was initially followed to estimate the life of the tank liner in grouted conditions or in soil conditions. The results of this life estimation are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 for grouted and soil conditions respectively. The tank life has been estimated under conservative assumptions of diffusion rates. However, the same process of calculation can be followed, once {{a better understanding of the}} concrete degradation and consequent diffusion rates is developed. A stochastic approach was also followed to estimate the distributions of failures based upon the same mechanisms of corrosion, but accounting for variances in each of the independent variables.

40|$|Clostridium difficile is an {{anaerobic}} spore forming gram-positive bacterium. Infection with C. difficile {{may lead}} in humans to symptomless carriership, {{but may also}} lead to diarrhea varying in severity from mild to life-threatening pseudomembraneous colitis. C. difficile spores can survive {{for long periods of}} time in the environment and are resistant to extreme temperatures, drought, radiation, and chemicals including disinfectants. C. difficile was considered a classical nosocomial pathogen, with a risk group consisting of elderly patients with comorbidities, treated with antimicrobials. However, since the beginning of the 21 th century C. difficile infection (CDI) is increasing in incidence and severity, and is also reported in younger patients, not receiving antimicrobials, and in patients in the community. Ribotype 078 is associated with this change in epidemiology and has increased in prevalence, to the 3 rd most common isolated type in human patients in Europe. The finding of the same 078 ribotype in diarrheal piglets led to the concern that interspecies transmission could occur. The goal of this PhD research was to investigate the risk of transmission of C. difficile from pigs to humans. C. difficile was commonly found in fecal samples of neonatal piglets with diarrhea. The use of a more sensitive detection method for the bacterium resulted in isolating C. difficile in fecal samples of almost all piglets, regardless their disease status. With this method, samples from sows, piglets and the environment were investigated to determine how piglets become infected with C. difficile. Since C. difficile was found in all piglets within 48 hours after birth, while all sows became positive within 113 hours after parturition, contamination of the environment with C. difficile is the most logical source for infection. Indeed, C. difficile was present in environmental samples in the farm. C. difficile was also found in the air of the farrowing ward. Follow-up research on all pig wards at the same pig farm revealed a widespread dissemination of C. difficile. Furthermore, C. difficile was present in air samples 20 meter outside the <b>farm.</b> <b>Consumption</b> of pork meat is considered a possible infection route, because C. difficile was found in retail pork samples. To determine if the source could be slaughter pigs colonized with the bacterium, rectal samples of slaughter pigs were taken at the abattoir. A prevalence of around 10 % was found. However, whether C. difficile can subsequently contaminate the carcass depends on the slaughter hygiene. Human and pig C. difficile ribotype 078 seem to be genetically related because a comparison of C. difficile isolates from humans with CDI and piglets with diarrhea revealed a high similarity in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Samples from farmers, employees, family members and the pigs at the same farms were investigated for the presence of C. difficile. Colonization rates of C. difficile in pig farmers and their employees were higher then the colonization rates described in healthy adults. C. difficile isolates from pig farmers and their pigs are highly similar, which indicates that working with pigs is an occupational risk for colonization with C. difficile...|$|E
40|$|The allergy {{prevalence}} is markedly low {{in children}} {{growing up on}} farms. Contact with livestock and consumption of unpasteurized milk {{has been associated with}} allergy protection, although other elements in the environment may contribute. The FARMFLORA birth cohort was established to identify factors that may be part of the allergy protection of the farming environment. In this thesis, early dietary exposures of farm and control children were evaluated in relation to allergy at three years of age, including: 1) maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation; 2) fatty acid composition of infant sera at birth and in sera and breast milk four months postpartum; 3) introduction practices of complementary foods; and 4) diet at one year of age. Twenty-eight children from dairy farms in South-Western Sweden, and 37 non-farm control children from the same rural area were included in the cohort. The children were examined clinically by pediatricians to diagnose food allergy, eczema, asthma and rhinitis. Farming mothers consumed more full-fat dairy and saturated fats during pregnancy and lactation than control mothers, who instead consumed more margarines and oils. The same pattern was found in the children’s diet at one year of age. The higher intake of saturated fats among the farming mothers was reflected in their breast milk as higher proportions of saturated fatty acids and lower proportions of the polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid. However, the only difference found in the infants’ sera was higher proportions of arachidonic acid at birth and lower proportions of the monounsaturated omega- 7 fatty acid 18 : 1 four months postpartum in farmers’ children. Neither did timing of introduction of complementary foods differ between farm and control children, except for an earlier introduction of nuts in farm children. One farm child (4 %) and 10 control children (25 %) were allergic by the age of three years. The intake of margarines and oils both by the mothers during pregnancy and lactation and by the children at one year of age was weakly associated with allergy development at three years of age. Also, higher intakes of pork was found in subsequently allergic compared to healthy children, when farmers were excluded from the analysis. The most pronounced difference between healthy and subsequently allergic children was higher proportions of the long-chain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid in serum both at birth and four months postpartum, reflecting maternal fish intake during pregnancy and lactation. Concordantly, a pattern of earlier introduction of fish in the healthy children was observed, alongside higher intakes of seafood at one year of age. Healthy children also tended to introduce flour and eggs earlier. Exclusive breastfeeding was associated with less allergy, although the protective effect was only observed up to three months of age. In conclusion, a low margarine consumption by the mother and child was weakly associated with less allergy as well as with growing up on a <b>farm.</b> <b>Consumption</b> of fish in mothers during pregnancy and lactation {{as well as in the}} early diet of children was associated with a decreased risk of allergy development, although unrelated to farm residence.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine environmental and nutritional exposures associated with the gene expression of innate immunity receptors during pregnancy and {{the first year of}} a child's life. METHODS: For the Protection Against Allergy: Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE) birth cohort study, 1133 pregnant women were recruited in rural areas of Austria, Finland, France, Germany, and Switzerland. mRNA expression of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 through TLR 9 and CD 14 was assessed in blood samples at birth (n= 938) and year 1 (n= 752). Environmental exposures, as assessed by using questionnaires and a diary kept during year 1, and polymorphisms in innate receptor genes were related to gene expression of innate immunity receptors by using ANOVA and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Gene expression of innate immunity receptors in cord blood was overall higher in neonates of farmers (P for multifactorial multivariate ANOVA=. 041), significantly so for TLR 7 (adjusted geometric means ratio [aGMR], 1. 15; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 30) and TLR 8 (aGMR, 1. 15; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 1. 26).

RESULTS: Endotoxin levels were significantly higher in milk samples from non-farming families compared to farming families [adjusted geometric means ratio (95 % confidence interval) = 2. 61 (1. 53 - 4. 43) ]. No significant difference in endotoxin levels was found between shop milk and farm milk samples [adjusted geometric means ratio (95 % confidence interval) = 1. 56 (0. 94 - 2. 58) ].

Vegetable production like any other farming activity requires the use of inputs as efficiently as possible to optimize production. To identify the sources of efficiency among indigenous vegetable farmers, the stochastic frontier production function which incorporates a model for the technical efficiency effect was employed. Data from 100 indigenous vegetable (waterleaf) producers were obtained through two-stage sampling procedure with the aid of questionnaire. Using the maximum likelihood estimation analysis, asymptotic parameter estimates were evaluated to describe efficiency sources. Results revealed that the average resource use efficiency is 0. 81 (81...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in organic <b>farming</b> and <b>consumption</b> show dynamic growth in markets; new uptake of Organic Agriculture by farmers, however, has been slow. Hindrances {{appear to be}} production problems or lack of trust by the farmers that organic methods can solve farming problems, such as fertilization, plant protection, animal health, efficient use of workforce, marketing diversity etc. While in some cases those problems can be solved through learning existing and regionally practiced methods, innovations are imperative to make organic farming competitive and a viable alternative farming system. OFIA, the Organic Farming Innovation Award, part of the Organic World Congress, highlights outstanding innovations and publishes priorities for innovative research. ...|$|R
