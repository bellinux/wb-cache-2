40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} various {{patterns}} for electricity market. Different countries adopt different patterns {{according to their}} own characteristics. However, no matter what pattern they adopt, there must be a certain structure similar to long-term market and real-time market where power sellers usually make electricity transaction. From the view of electricity power sellers, it is the key for hydropower enterprise (Power seller) to find an optimal sale strategy which can maximize the amount of electricity sale while minimizing the probability of risk. In this paper, on the base of analysis on the deterministic <b>gross</b> <b>generation,</b> a mathematic model is established to gain the maximal income of electricity sale in the case of considering risk factors, and to investigate the relationship between risk factors and electricity sale distribution in the two markets, long-term market and real-time market. Then, subsequently, the optimal strategy of electricity sale distribution of <b>gross</b> <b>generation</b> will be obtained in every market in order to maximize the total expected benefit. The feasibility and validness of the Model are verified by its application to a case as well...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to develop the {{equations}} for forecasting net energy consumption (NEC) using an artificial neural-network (ANN) technique in order to determine the future level of energy consumption in Turkey. In this study, two different models were used in order to train the neural network. In one of them, population, <b>gross</b> <b>generation,</b> installed capacity and years are used in the input layer of the network (Model 1). Other energy sources are used in input layer of network (Model 2). The net energy consumption is in the output layer for two models. Data from 1975 to 2003 are used for the training. Three years (1981, 1994 and 2003) are used only as test data to confirm this method. The statistical coefficients of multiple determinations (R 2 -value) for training data are equal to 0. 99944 and 0. 99913 for Models 1 and 2, respectively. Similarly, R 2 values for testing data are equal to 0. 997386 and 0. 999558 for Models 1 and 2, respectively. According to the results, the net energy consumption using the ANN technique has been predicted with acceptable accuracy. Apart from reducing the whole time required, with the ANN approach, it is possible to find solutions that make energy applications more viable and thus more attractive to potential users. It is also expected that this study will be helpful in developing highly applicable energy policies.

40|$|AbstractAn Integrated Biohydrogen Refinery (IBHR) and {{experimental}} net energy analysis are reported. The IBHR converts biomass to electricity using hydrothermal hydrolysis, extractive biohydrogen fermentation and photobiological hydrogen fermentation for electricity generation in a fuel cell.
