5|$|The {{government}} sees Taunton's {{traffic congestion}} problems {{as a serious}} obstacle to its continuing economic growth. An {{important part of the}} government's growth strategy for the town is new road infrastructure consisting of a new link road (Taunton's Third Way) which was completed 27 September 2011 at a cost of £7.5 million. A second link road, (the Northern Inner <b>Distributor</b> <b>Road)</b> planned for completion by the end of 2014 at a cost of £21 million, is still unfinished in 2016, with no completion in the near future. The road would link Staplegrove Road with Priory Avenue, running across Station Road.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to the busy M4 motorway through Newport, the Southern <b>Distributor</b> <b>Road</b> (A48) is a two-lane dual carriageway connecting M4 junction 24 to junction 28. Combined with the M4 in the north, the SDR forms the southern part of a ring road for the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of {{regeneration}} involved improving the city centre road network, including turning Kingsway and Queensway into boulevards. The Southern <b>Distributor</b> <b>Road</b> {{to the south of}} the city opened in 2004, including the new City Bridge over the River Usk, improving access and opening up new areas for development. The Newport City footbridge opened in 2006 linking the east and west banks of the river for pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E

40|$|A {{sustainably}} safe road environment requires {{bicycle facilities}} that separate motorized traffic from relatively vulnerable road users like cyclists. Research indicates that on <b>distributor</b> <b>roads</b> the road sections with adjoining or separate bicycle tracks are safer than the road sections without any bicycle facilities. Furthermore, roundabouts with separate bicycle facilities are safer than roundabouts without such facilities. Other intersection types require speed reduction measures {{to reduce the}} number of crashes...|$|R
25|$|The Old Green Interchange is an {{elevated}} roundabout over the A4042 (Heidenheim Drive) {{at the western}} end of Newport Bridge. Newport's pedestrianised High Street runs southwest from the interchange through Westgate Square to the pedestrianised Commercial Street. Queensway passes Newport railway station and links the Old Green Interchange to Newport Civic Centre via Clytha Park Road. Kingsway/Usk Way is a boulevard on {{the west bank of the}} River Usk linking the Old Green Interchange to the Southern <b>Distributor</b> <b>Road</b> at {{the western end of}} City Bridge and to Newport Transporter Bridge.|$|E
25|$|The M4 is the {{principal}} motorway {{in the region that}} connects Cardiff with Swansea to the west, and Newport and London to the east. Cardiff is served by three junctions of the M4, plus A48(M), which leads onto the M4. The A470 is another major road within the city that provides an important link to the north with the Heads of the Valleys road, mid and north Wales. The A4232 (also known as the Peripheral <b>Distributor</b> <b>Road</b> or PDR) when completed, will form part of the Cardiff ring-road system along with the M4 motorway between junctions 30 and 33.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 a new east-west <b>distributor</b> <b>road</b> linking School Road and Bedworth Road {{replaced}} {{an ancient}} footpath. This development divorced the Church from Church Street; further road developments {{led to the}} demolition {{of many of the}} buildings in the historic precinct, and by the 1980s only Church Street retained any historic continuity. The remaining historic buildings were threatened with demolition which led directly {{to the creation of the}} Bulkington Conservation Area in 1985, which covers Church Street and the area surrounding St James' Parish Church. In November 2008 the Barbridge Close area, north of St James' Church, was excluded from the conservation area.|$|E
50|$|Although Autowegen do {{not have}} to conform {{completely}} to the new Dutch design standard for regional flow roads (stroomwegen), many of these roads require at least some upgrades. Otherwise, they are downgraded to the safety category of <b>distributor</b> <b>roads</b> and so lose their expressway status.|$|R
5000|$|London has a {{hierarchy}} of roads ranging from major radial and orbital trunk roads down to minor [...] "side streets". At the top level are motorways and grade-separated dual carriageways, supplemented by non-grade-separated urban dual carriageways, major single carriageway <b>roads,</b> local <b>distributor</b> <b>roads</b> and small local streets.|$|R

500|$|Taunton {{also has}} good road links, having the M5 {{motorway}} junctions 25 (Taunton) and 26 (Wellington) {{close to the}} town, {{as well as other}} major roads such as the A38 and A358. The Taunton bypass section of M5, from J25-26, opened in April 1974, relieving the town of heavy holiday traffic on the A38. Taunton Deane services are located between junctions 25 and 26 on the M5. However, with the flourishing local economy, traffic is a problem with Somerset County Council giving a prediction of a significant increase based on 2001 levels. Two major new road have been undertaken since 2010. The [...] "Third Way" [...] linking Bridge Street and castle Street opened in 2011 but the Northern Inner <b>Distributor</b> <b>Road</b> between Staplegrove Road and Priory Avenue, due to open March 2015, remains incomplete as of April 2017.|$|E
500|$|The Drove Bridge, which {{marks the}} current {{extent of the}} Port of Bridgwater is the nearest to the mouth and the newest road bridge to cross the river. With a span of , the bridge was {{constructed}} {{as part of the}} Bridgwater Northern <b>Distributor</b> <b>road</b> scheme (1992), and provides a navigable channel which is [...] wide with [...] headroom at normal spring high tides. Upstream of this is the retractable Telescopic Bridge, built in 1871 to the design of Sir Francis Fox, the engineer for the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It carried a railway siding over the river to the docks, but had to be movable, to allow boats to proceed upriver. An [...] section of railway track to the east of the bridge could be moved sideways, so that the main [...] girders could be retracted, creating a navigable channel which was [...] wide. It was manually operated for the first eight months, and then powered by a steam engine, reverting to manual operation in 1913, when the steam engine failed. The bridge was last opened in 1953, and the traverser section was demolished in 1974, but public outcry at the action resulted in the bridge being listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, {{and the rest of the}} bridge was kept. It was later used as a road crossing, until the construction of the Chandos road bridge alongside it, and is now only used by pedestrians. Parts of the steam engine were moved to Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum in 1977.|$|E
50|$|Inside of {{built-up}} areas, all {{roads are}} municipal. They are categorised only as either <b>distributor</b> <b>roads</b> or local access roads. Arterial roads and collector roads {{fall into the}} first category. Their maximum speed is 50 km/h except for arterials with a dual carriageway, which may be 70 km/h. Bicycle tracks have to be segregated.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} main, {{backbone}} <b>distributor</b> <b>roads</b> throughout Quinns. Quinns Road/Ocean Drive follows the entire southern and western {{perimeter of the}} suburb along the coastline. Tapping Way broadly divides Old Quinns and the Norfolk Estate in an approximately south-eastern to north-western manner, while Santa Barbara Parade strictly serves the eastern, inland part of the suburb.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{completion}} of the junction 8 to 9 section, the M20 was 3 lanes {{either side of the}} original A20(M) section. [...] This was a bottleneck, so it was decided to widen this section of motorway. [...] The road here was increased to a dual 3 or 4 lane road with 2 lane <b>distributor</b> <b>roads</b> either side. This section was opened in 1995.|$|R
500|$|Much of {{the history}} of the river is defined by its bridges, which are {{described}} from here mouth to source. The Drove Bridge, which marks the current extent of the Port of Bridgwater, is the nearest to the mouth and the newest road bridge to cross the river. With a span of , the bridge was constructed as part of the Bridgwater Northern <b>Distributor</b> <b>road</b> scheme (1992), and provides a navigable channel which is [...] wide with [...] headroom at normal spring high tides. Upstream of this is the retractable or Telescopic Bridge, built in 1871 to the design of Sir Francis Fox, the engineer for the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It carried a broad gauge (later standard gauge) railway siding over the river to the docks, and was movable, to allow boats to proceed up river. An [...] section of railway track to the east of the bridge could be moved sideways, so that the main [...] girders could be retracted, creating a navigable channel which was [...] wide.

2500|$|A {{controversial}} new [...] road, the Norwich Northern <b>Distributor</b> <b>Road,</b> linking {{from the}} A140 road/Norwich International Airport {{to the north}} of Norwich to the A47 road to the east of Norwich was given Programme Entry status in December 2009 and an estimated completion data of 2015. The Postwick hub, an integral park of the NDR is a development of the junction between the A47 road and the A1042 road to the east of Norwich with an additional 500 parking places in the Postwick park and ride site. There is also discussion of building the section from the A140 west to the A1067 and from the Wensum Valley to the A47 southern bypass to the west, as originally proposed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the Balham Loop {{motorway}} {{was to provide a}} connection between Ringway 1 and the M23 motorway running through south London. Other incoming motorways, such as the M1 and M11, were intended to terminate directly on the innermost Ringway, but the route of the M23 through south London was considerably more difficult than the M1's route through north London and there was no simple or direct route for the M23 to reach Ringway 1 in Clapham. Instead, the Balham Loop would have acted as a <b>distributor</b> <b>road</b> connecting to the West Cross Route and SCR at Battersea and to the SCR at Brixton, via the [...] "South Cross Route to Parkway D [...] Radial".|$|E

2500|$|The H6 Childs Way {{runs from}} Whitney {{in the west}} of Milton Keynes at Kingsmead to a point short of Junction 14 of the M1 {{motorway}} in the east. The H6 starts as a [...] local <b>distributor</b> <b>road</b> between the districts of Kingsmead and Whitney. After crossing Whitney Roundabout the road becomes [...] but remains as a single carriageway. After bridging Powis Lane in between Westcroft and Oxley Park the road becomes a dual carriageway at Shenley Roundabout. It then passes {{very close to the}} Grove Independent School and subsequently bridges both the A5 and the West Coast Main Line. The road then crosses the V6 Grafton Street and runs along the southern edge of Central Milton Keynes and Campbell Park before passing Willen Lake. After this it passes the original Milton Keynes village and then curves up to meet the A509, briefly becoming the A4146.|$|E
2500|$|Plans for an 'M4 Relief Road' around Newport {{were first}} {{announced}} by the Welsh Office in 1991, but made little progress. The Welsh Assembly Government revived the scheme as the M4 relief road tolled bypass in 2007 but later abandoned it for financial reasons. An extension to the Newport Southern <b>Distributor</b> <b>Road</b> through the old Corus steel works is being considered. This road is already a dual carriageway but not open to the public. A public consultation exercise on options for improving {{the capacity of the}} M4 corridor around Newport opened on 5 March 2012. [...] Its website states that: [...] "the motorway around Newport does not conform to today’s motorway standards. It lacks continuous hard shoulders, has closely spaced junctions with sub-standard slip road visibility and narrows to a restricted two lane section through the Brynglas Tunnels. Heavy congestion occurs along this stretch and either side of it at peak hours." ...|$|E

50|$|As far {{as these}} roads have (inter)regional significance, {{they are also}} {{numbered}} and to an extent signposted with an N and typically three digits. In that case, the roads {{are referred to as}} N-roads. These roads are mostly categorised as <b>distributor</b> <b>roads,</b> with a speed limit of 80 km/h. In principle, farm traffic and slow road users are not allowed. For them, there should be parallel roads like frontage roads or cycle tracks.
