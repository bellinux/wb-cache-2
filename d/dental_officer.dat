Horvath, however, applied for a {{commission}} to join the U.S. Navy and was sworn in as a lieutenant j.g. that August. He was sent at first to Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois for training, where he practiced dentistry and acted as an assistant to Brown, who had entered the Navy and was coaching the base's football team. Horvath served in Hawaii and coached a football team there that won a service national championship. He later traveled on assignment as far as China as a naval <b>dental</b> <b>officer.</b>|$|E

MBA Professional ReportThis research project identifies key {{influences on the}} retention of Navy <b>Dental</b> <b>Officers</b> beyond their post-obligation period. Two sample groups were selected. The first sample group was selected from <b>Dental</b> <b>Officers</b> who did not receive a Navy sponsored residency program and the second group from <b>Dental</b> <b>Officers</b> who completed a Navy sponsored residency program. Logistic regression models were developed for the Non-Residency and Residency sample data obtained from Bureau of Medicine and Surgery Manpower Information System. The results revealed that accession source, dental specialty {{and the number of}} operational tours as a percentage of total tours an officer completes during his or her obligation period were significant factors for retention of <b>Dental</b> <b>Officers</b> in the Non-Residency Model. Significant factors identified for the Residency Model were gender, age when first paid as a Navy Dentist, the number of years <b>Dental</b> <b>Officers</b> waited to begin a Navy-sponsored residency program and <b>dental</b> specialty. <b>Dental</b> <b>Officers</b> who receive their residency training between their sixth and eight year of service are more likely to remain on active duty more than one year beyond their obligated service commitment than officers beginning residency programs earlier or later in their careers.

50|$|Two <b>Dental</b> Corps <b>officers</b> {{were killed}} and four were wounded in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941; {{they would not be}} the last <b>dental</b> <b>officers</b> to die in the line of duty. As the US got ready for world conflict, Navy Dentistry's active duty numbers swelled to its highest levels ever - {{ultimately}} reaching 7,000 <b>dental</b> <b>officers</b> and 11,000 <b>dental</b> technicians. Active in nearly every engagement during the war, dental personnel who were assigned to operational units in the South Pacific often assisted in emergency medical operations ashore, especially facial trauma requiring surgery. Numerous <b>dental</b> <b>officers</b> were killed in action aboard war ships and in major battles in Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, and Iwo Jima. For their heroic efforts, 93 <b>dental</b> <b>officers</b> received personal awards, including the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and the Bronze Star Medal.|$|R

25|$|As the war progressed, the {{importance}} placed upon dental health within the AIF increased and by early 1917 stricter standards were being enforced on recruits and dental officers {{were given the}} power require personnel to be paraded for dental inspections. Initially, the ranks held by dental officers were honorary, but in June 1917 these were made substantive. In order to improve {{the management of the}} service, staff officers were appointed to oversee the units in France, the United Kingdom and Egypt. By the end of the war, there were 130 dental officers serving overseas, representing a ratio of one <b>dental</b> <b>officer</b> per 4,250 men.|$|E

25|$|The MDS at the Schoonhord {{was again}} {{captured}} by the Germans {{in the early hours}} of the 22 September. The other nine buildings being used by the medics were by now, almost constantly under fire, and unable to be evacuated many of the wounded were killed in their beds. Orders were issued that the wounded would have to remain at battalion aid posts, as moving them to the MDS was impossible in the circumstances. By now food and water supplies were running out, to solve the water shortage, central heating systems were drained and the <b>Dental</b> <b>Officer</b> shot two sheep with a borrowed sten gun to help feed the wounded.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{the small number of}} full-time dental personnel were augmented by Militia officers and civilian volunteers. Although early enlistment was low, as part of the mobilisation process, in October 1939 provision was made for the establishment of dental units consisting of one <b>dental</b> <b>officer,</b> two dental mechanics and one clerk orderly, who were to be placed within three field ambulances, one casualty clearing station, two general hospitals and one convalescent depot. Initially, dental equipment and supplies were insufficient for the tasks required, with a single division requiring an estimated 50,000 fillings, 40,000 extractions and 10,000 dentures, however, personnel managed to overcome this through the acquisition of stores from local areas.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study of}} varying amounts of {{fluoride}} in water {{was led by}} Dr. H. Trendley Dean, a <b>dental</b> <b>officer</b> of the U.S. Public Health Service. In 1936 and 1937, Dr. Dean and other dentists compared statistics from Amarillo, which had 2.8 – 3.9mg/L fluoride content, and low fluoride Wichita Falls. [...] The data is alleged to show fewer cavities in Amarillo children, but the studies were never published. Dr. Dean's research on the fluoride-dental caries relationship, published in 1942, included 7,000 children from 21 cities in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. [...] The study concluded that the optimal amount of fluoride which minimized the risk of severe fluorosis but had positive benefits for tooth decay was 1mg per day, per adult. [...] Although fluoride is more abundant in the environment today, this was estimated to correlate with the concentration of 1mg/L.|$|E
50|$|Early in 1922, a {{significant}} milestone occurred: {{the creation of}} a Dental Division in the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Shortly after on 3 February 1923, the U.S. Naval Dental School opened as the dental department of the United States Naval Medical School. Its purpose was to furnish postgraduate instruction in <b>dental</b> medicine to <b>officers</b> of the <b>Dental</b> Corps of the Navy and to train and equip men of the Hospital Corps as assistants to <b>dental</b> <b>officers.</b> There were 150 <b>dental</b> <b>officers</b> on duty at the time.|$|R

2500|$|Later, as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was raised, a <b>dental</b> <b>officer</b> was {{recruited}} and situated in each military district with the remit of providing advice to senior medical personnel. They {{were not to}} carry out dental procedures, however, {{and as a result}} civilian dentists offered free services to soldiers while undertaking training in Australia. Upon the AIF's arrival in Egypt in 1915, General William Throsby Bridges argued the case for dentists to be attached to the army in the field, stating that it would reduce the instances of soldiers having to be evacuated from the field as 'dental casualties'. [...] While some progress towards mitigating this was taken in January 1915 when the Australian Army Medical Corps (Dental) Reserve was approved, appointments were slow and consequently the AIF troops that deployed to Gallipoli did so without dental support. By July 1915, over 600 soldiers from the 1st Division had been evacuated as dental casualties.|$|E
2500|$|Landing {{under fire}} the 133rd were widely {{scattered}} {{and it was}} not until 20:30 that some non commissioned officers and men reached Wolfheze. By dawn 19 September, the two surgical teams and the majority of the unit had reached Wolfheze. Lieutenant-Colonel Alford decided to open a MDS where they were to support the brigade's advance towards the high ground north of Arnhem. [...] By 19:30 Alford and forty-one other men, including the two surgical teams moved into Oosterbeek to establish a MDS, linking up with the 181st (Airlanding) Field Ambulance and started moving the less serious wounded to Oosterbeek. A German attack on Wolfheze early on 20 September, captured those men still in the village either treating or trying to move the wounded. All that now remained of the 133rd was the commanding officer, the two surgeons, the <b>dental</b> <b>officer</b> (who was also the anaesthetist) and ten other ranks. On the 20 September the 133rd opened a new dressing station about [...] from the division's main MDS at the Hotel Taffelberg, by that evening there were around 1,000 wounded being treated by the divisions medical staff. Over the following days the dressing station was subjected to artillery and mortar fire. Then on the 24 September a local armistice was agreed and the majority of the division's walking wounded in the hospital area were evacuated leaving around 300 men who were unable to be moved. [...] By the next day the shelling around the hospital area made it safer for the wounded to remain at their regimental aid posts, rather than take the risk of moving them. By that evening the hospitals had been overrun by the Germans. But 2,100 of the 10,000 men of the 1st Airborne Division were evacuated south of the River Rhine that night. However almost all the division's medical staff twenty-five officers and 400 other ranks had been taken prisoner.|$|E
