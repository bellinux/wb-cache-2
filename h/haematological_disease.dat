40|$|BACKGROUND: A few {{case reports}} have shown {{controversial}} results of rituximab efficacy {{in patients with}} chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). OBJECTIVE: To analyse the efficacy of rituximab in a large CIDP cohort. METHODS: A retrospective, observational and multicentre study {{on the use of}} rituximab in CIDP. 13 Italian CIDP patients were treated with rituximab after the partial or complete lack of efficacy of conventional therapies. Eight patients had co-occurring <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases.</b> Patients who improved by at least two points in standard clinical scales, or who reduced or discontinued the pre-rituximab therapies, were considered as responders. RESULTS: Nine patients (seven with <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases)</b> responded to rituximab: six of them, who were non-responders to conventional therapies, improved clinically, and the other three maintained the improvement that they usually achieved with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange. Significantly associated with shorter disease duration, rituximab responses started after a median period of 2. 0  months (range, 1 - 6) and lasted for a median period of 1  year (range, 1 - 5). CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab seems to be a promising therapeutic choice when it targets both CIDP and co-occurring <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases.</b> Timely post-onset administration of rituximab seems to be associated with better responses...|$|R

30|$|Patients with {{malignant}} <b>haematological</b> <b>disease</b> {{and especially}} those who require intensive care have {{an increased risk of}} bleeding and thrombosis [7 – 11], but none of the studies were in ICU patients only. The prevention of haemorrhage and thrombosis is a challenging task as the risk of both complications is likely to increase in patients with sepsis [12 – 14], which is very frequent in ICU patients with malignant <b>haematological</b> <b>disease</b> [2, 5]. Thrombocytopenia increases risk of bleeding complications [11], and platelet transfusions remain the cornerstone in treatment and prevention of bleeding [15, 16]. Large multicentre studies on prophylactic platelet transfusions in thrombocytopenic non-ICU patients have shown that a restrictive prophylactic platelet transfusion strategy is likely to be safe [9], although the degree of restrictiveness is still controversial [10]. The vast majority of patients with malignant <b>haematological</b> <b>disease</b> are receiving blood products [17] so complications secondary to transfusions are also likely [14].|$|E

40|$|Our aim was {{to assess}} the {{validity}} of the ICD- 10 code for splenomegaly in the Danish National Registry of Patients (DNRP), as well as to investigate which underlying diseases explained the observed splenomegaly. Splenomegaly is a common finding in patients referred to an internal medical department and can be caused by a large spectrum of <b>diseases,</b> including <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases</b> and liver cirrhosis. However, some patients remain without a causal diagnosis, despite extensive medical work-up. We identified 129 patients through the DNRP, that had been given the ICD- 10 splenomegaly diagnosis code in 1994 - 2013 at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, excluding patients with prior splenomegaly, malignant haematological neoplasia or liver cirrhosis. Medical records were reviewed for validity of the splenomegaly diagnosis, diagnostic work-up, and the underlying disease was determined. The positive predictive value (PPV) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the splenomegaly diagnosis code. Patients with idiopathic splenomegaly in on-going follow-up were also invited to be investigated for Gaucher disease. The overall PPV was 92 % (95 % CI: 85, 96). <b>Haematological</b> <b>diseases</b> were the underlying causal diagnosis in 39 %; hepatic diseases in 18 %, infectious disease in 10 % and other diseases in 8 %. 25 % of patients with splenomegaly remained without a causal diagnosis. Lymphoma was the most common haematological causal diagnosis and liver cirrhosis the most common hepatic causal diagnosis. None of the investigated patients with idiopathic splenomegaly had Gaucher disease. Our findings show that the splenomegaly diagnosis in the DNRP is valid and can be used in registry-based studies. However, because of suspected significant under-coding, it should be considered if supplementary data sources should be used in addition, in order to attain a more representative population. <b>Haematological</b> <b>diseases</b> were the most common cause, however in a large fraction of patients no causal diagnosis was found...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{secondary}} malignant neoplasms developed {{in patients with}} chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), skin carcinomas are considered particularly important for their incidence and their biological behaviour, sometimes very aggressive, with frequent relapses and multiple lesions. To evaluate the incidence of skin carcinomas in patients with CLL we selected all the subjects with skin carcinomas from the group of 1010 patients affected by CLL with B cells, followed-up from January 1992 to January 2003, in the Ambulatory of the Department of Hematology of University of Rome "La Sapienza" and sent to consultation to the Ambulatory of Oncologic Dermatology. We observed 27 subjects affected by 35 skin carcinomas: 19 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) (54. 289 %), 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (28. 57 %), 4 metatypic carcinomas (11. 42 %), 2 Bowen's tumors (5. 71 %). In 7 patients there were multiple tumors (25. 92 %). The immunohistochemical study evidenced peritumoral infiltrates in more than 50 % of the cases, composed mostly by B lymphocytes. According to these data we can confirm that skin carcinomas in subjects with CLL are not rare and may be multiple and/or invasive even if prognosis is generally related to the course of <b>haematological</b> <b>disease.</b> In fact during follow-up 4 out of these 27 patients died: three for progression of <b>haematological</b> <b>disease</b> and one for lung carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|Although iron {{overload}} is clinically significant, {{only limited}} data {{have been published}} on iron overload in <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases.</b> We investigated cardiac and liver iron accumulation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a cohort of 87 subjects who did not receive chelation, including 59 haematological patients. M-HIC (MRI-based hepatic iron concentration, normal values < 36 [*]μmol/g) is a non-invasive, liver biopsy-calibrated method to analyse iron concentration. This method, calibrated to R 2 (transverse relaxation rate), {{was used as a}} reference standard (M-HIC(R 2)). Transfusions and ferritin were evaluated. Mean M-HIC(R 2) and cardiac R* of all patients were 142 [*]μmol/g (95 % CI, 114 – 170) and 36. 4 [*] 1 /s (95 % CI, 34. 2 – 38. 5), respectively. M-HIC(R 2) was higher in haematological patients than in patients with chronic liver disease or normal controls (P< 0. 001). Clearly elevated cardiac R 2 * was found in two myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with severe liver iron overload. A poor correlation was found between liver and cardiac iron (n= 82, r= 0. 322, P= 0. 003), in contrast to a stronger correlation in MDS (n= 7, r= 0. 905, P= 0. 005). In addition to transfusions, MDS seemed to be an independent factor in iron accumulation. In conclusion, the risk for cardiac iron overload in <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases</b> other than MDS is very low, despite the frequently found liver iron overload...|$|R

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{analyze the}} immunophenotype of blast cells in {{patients}} with acute leukaemia after polycythemia vera, together with the most relevant clinical and <b>haematological</b> <b>disease</b> characteristics. METHODS [...] The immunophenotype was analysed in nine patients by immunofluorescence flow cytometry using a panel of 15 monoclonal antibodies. The DNA content of blast cells was determined using Vindelov's technique. RESULTS [...] The most relevant clinical and <b>haematological</b> <b>disease</b> characteristics included: the presence of enlarged spleen and liver by 56 % and 67 %, respectively; a moderate degree of leucocytosis with thrombocytopenia while haemoglobin was normal in 50 % of patients. All patients received alkylating agents or hydroxyurea, or both. Interestingly, the chronic phase in patients receiving this latter drug was shorter. All cases showed a myeloid phenotype, four of them reactive only to early myeloid antigens (CD 13 / 33); in the remaining cases the blast cells displayed granulomonocytic (CD 14 +, CD 15 +), erythroid (CD 71), or megakaryocytic (CD 61 +, CD 41 +) markers. Coexpression of lymphoid related antigens (CD 7, TdT, or CD 19) was also detected. The morphological assessment of blast cells agreed with the immunophenotyping in five out of the nine cases. Blast cells from all six patients analysed displayed a diploid DNA content {{and the proportion of}} S-phase cells ranged from 0. 4 % to 4 %.

40|$|Patients with <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{entitled}} to supportive care. Considering organisational and technological development, support {{in the form of}} caring communication provided through the web is today a possible alternative. The aim of this thesis was to examine the usefulness and importance of a web-based counselling service to patients with <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases.</b> The basis for the thesis was a development project funded by the Swedish Cancer Society, which provided an opportunity to offer patients communication with a nurse through a web-based counselling service. Four studies were performed from a patient perspective. Study I had a cross-sectional design, measuring occurrence of anxiety and depression, and these variables’ associations to mastery, social support, and insomnia among patients with <b>haematological</b> <b>diseases.</b> Study II was a qualitative content analysis focusing on conditions for provision and use of the web-based counselling service. Study III used a qualitative hermeneutical approach to focus on patients’ experiences of using the counselling service. Study IV was a qualitative deductive analysis examining how communication within the web-based counselling service can be caring in accordance to caring theory. The results revealed that females of 30 - 49 years of age are vulnerable to experiencing anxiety. Low sense of mastery and support are associated with anxiety and/or depression. Being able to self-identify the need for support as well as appreciate the written medium are necessary conditions for the web-based counselling service to be used. The counselling service must also be part of a comprehensive range of supportive activities and web-based services to be useful. The main importance of the communication is that the patient’s influence on the communication is strengthened, and that the constant access to individual medical and caring assessment can imply a sense of safety. When patients share their innermost concerns and search for support, nursing compassion and competence can substantiate in explicit written responses. A conclusion {{is that there is a}} caring potential in communication within a web-based counselling service. To make this form of communication possible, nurses should take possession of and ensure that this medium for communication is offered to patients. Nurses should also increase their knowledge of caring communication in writing and how this possibly can impact patients...|$|R
