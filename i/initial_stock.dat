5|$|Battle {{losses of}} horses were {{approximately}} 25percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion {{accounted for the}} remainder and the Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the <b>initial</b> <b>stock</b> numbers, mainly due to infection from the tsetse fly. On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the Crimean War, 120 percent in the Boer War and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, too tired to lift their heads high enough to breathe. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun. By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the Clydesdale horses, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over {{the course of the}} war, Britain lost over 484,000horses, one horse for every two men. A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas.|$|E

40|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> trial, 19 {{years old}} at the time of assessment, was located in Rotoehu Forest, and {{incorporated}} genetically improved stock (with a Growth and Form factor of 13) and unimproved stock (GF 3). It was planted at six levels of <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> from 250 to 1500 stems/ha, and thinned to 250 stems/ha. Results of the evaluation were adjusted for bias due to microsite. There was an apparent site index differential of 1. 6 m between selection extremes. This was attributed mainly to differences in <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> rather than to the effect of selecting taller trees. There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in mean diameter at breast height (dbh) due to selection ratio. The straightness of both the unpruned logs and the pruned butts was enhanced with increasing selection. By increasing selection ratio, total merchantable volume and pruned volume were substantially improved, owing to height differences and reduced malformation. Because of improved quantity and quality, there was an increase in stumpage value at age 19 with increasing selection ratio, the highest selection ratio tested (6 : 1) bein...|$|R

25|$|The RLAF {{began its}} {{operations}} as a liaison, logistics and transport unit. Its <b>initial</b> <b>stock</b> were a melange of French and American supplied rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft inherited from its predecessor, Aviation Laotienne. On 9 January 1961, the new RLAF was supplied with six AT-6 Texans {{as its first}} strike aircraft. Although these were quickly lost, they were replaced by five T-28 Trojans. Despite ongoing losses, the T-28 inventory would eventually burgeon under American auspices to 75 Trojans on board in 1973. It would also acquire ten AC-47 gunships for a time. Pilot procurement for the swelling fleet would always be problematic, with the inadequate roster of Lao and Hmong pilots being filled out with Thai mercenary pilots, and a few Americans from Air America. By the time American aid was withdrawn in 1973, dooming the force, the RLAF would total 180 aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters.|$|E
40|$|Copepods are {{the most}} common metazoans in the marine {{environment}} and are considered to be ideal live prey for fish larvae. However, the difficulty in their culture, particularly at high culture density, hinders their use in aquaculture hatcheries. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> density on a range of biological parameters affecting the culture productivity of the calanoid copepod Parvocalanus crassirostris. Five <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> densities of 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000 and 9000 adults L− 1 were evaluated. Among the treatment differences on both daily and total egg production, the egg hatching rate and mortality rate were all highly significant (p < 0. 001). Egg production was monitored over seven consecutive days, and the density of 5000 adults L− 1 produced significantly (p < 0. 001) more eggs daily than did the other treatments. Egg hatching success was very high at 91. 8 – 92. 3 % at the lower <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> density of ≤ 5000 adults L− 1; however, as density increased to ≥ 7000 adults L− 1, it dropped sharply to only 55 – 73 %. Similarly, significantly higher adult mortality rates were recorded for densities ≥ 7000 adults L− 1. Moreover, population growth was evaluated for a 15 -day culture period. It showed that the <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> density of 5000 adults L− 1 produced the highest final population (6429. 4 ± 202. 2 individuals L− 1) at the end of the culture period. However, in terms of percentage population growth over the initial population, it was the lowest density of 1000 adults L− 1 that achieved the highest growth (319. 4 ± 20. 0 %), while high density treatments of 7000 and 9000 adults L− 1 suffered negative percentage growth. Interestingly, the sex ratio was also significantly affected by <b>initial</b> <b>stocking</b> densities as the male to female ratio increased significantly at a density of ≥ 7000 adults L− 1. Our results demonstrated that P. crassirostris is a highly promising species for culture as live prey for aquaculture hatcheries, and it can be stocked at a high initial density of 5000 adults L− 1 without negatively impacting culture productivity...|$|R

25|$|After the war's end, {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to build any {{aircraft}} or aircraft engines. The treaty singled out the Fokker D.VII for destruction or confiscation, the only aircraft to be named in the treaty. In 1919 Fokker returned to the Netherlands and started a new aircraft company, the Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfabriek (Dutch Aircraft Factory), predecessor to the Fokker Aircraft Company. Despite the strict disarmament conditions in the Treaty, Fokker did not return home empty-handed: he managed to smuggle six goods trains' worth of D.VII and C.I military planes and spare parts out of Germany across the German-Dutch border. Author Weyl says that Fokker used 350 railway wagons and made sure that each train was too long to fit into the railway sidings where trains were normally checked for contraband. Weyl quotes Fokker himself as saying that he paid 20,000 Dutch guilders in bribes. The trains included 220 aeroplanes, more than 400 aero engines and much other material. This <b>initial</b> <b>stock</b> enabled him to quickly set up shop, but his focus shifted from military to civil aircraft such as the very successful Fokker F.VII trimotor.|$|E
