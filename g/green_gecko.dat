25|$|Naultinus {{species and}} indeed, New Zealand lizards in general, are very {{conservative}} in their evolutionary development of scales. Most have the standard gecko-type scales which {{are small and}} granular, giving the skin a dull, velvety appearance. The two exceptions to this rule are two South Island members of the genus; the rough gecko (N. rudis) and, to a lesser extent, the Marlborough <b>green</b> <b>gecko</b> (N. manukanus). The rough gecko has enlarged conical scales which are both significantly wider and which protrude much further from the body than ordinary scales. These enlarged scales are {{scattered all over the}} body except for the underside of the animal. The Marlborough <b>green</b> <b>gecko</b> also has enlarged scales, but they are confined to the dorsal, pelvic area, and sometimes even in rows {{along the side of the}} animal. In any case, they are never found over all upper surfaces of the body as in the rough gecko.|$|E

[...] From 1997 to 2001 22 Wellington <b>green</b> <b>geckos</b> (8 males, 4 females, 10 unknown) were translocated to Mana Island. The geckos {{appear to be}} established on Mana Island. Between 2006 and 2013 over 90 Wellington <b>green</b> <b>geckos</b> were released on Matiu / Somes Island. All were photographed and their unique markings recorded. Early in 2015 a young female gecko was discovered that had markings that did not match any of those recorded. This indicated that a breeding population had been established on the island.|$|R

40|$|Constant {{inventories}} of New Zealand gecko populations {{are important to}} monitor {{the status of the}} populations over time and allow diagnosis of declines in abundance. Long-term monitoring can also provide information on how effective different management schemes are for conserving a species. Populations of Pacific geckos (Dactylocnemis pacificus) are monitored at Shakespear and Whakanewha, and populations of forest (Mokopirirakau granulatus) and <b>green</b> <b>geckos</b> (Naultinus elegans) are monitored at Tawharanui and Whakanewha on a yearly basis. Whakanewha has a poison based regime for controlling predators, and Tawharanui and Shakespear are largely reliant on predator-proof fences. Visual encounter surveys (VESs) provide a relative abundance estimate of the gecko populations in terms of catch per unit effort (CPUE). There was no significant change in CPUE over the three years of monitoring (2012 - 2014) for any of the gecko populations. It is a possibility this could be a result of small statistical power tests. Comparisons of abundance indices could not be made between parks due to the likely difference of detectability in different vegetation types. Despite the change in activity levels of some animal species during different phases of the moon, this study found that the same phenomenon does not occur for <b>green</b> and forest <b>geckos.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} the CPUE of the gecko species from VESs conducted during the new and full moon. Therefore, there is no need to stratify VESs based on the moon phases in order to account for changes in the activity levels of the geckos when obtaining abundance indices. Tracking tunnels have proven an effective monitoring device for estimating the distribution and relative abundance of animal species and have increasingly been used to monitor lizard species. Its use for detecting arboreal geckos has not been completed with any great success. One Pacific gecko was detected in this study using tracking tunnels designed for arboreal geckos, a very low tracking rate. Cell foam retreats (CFRs) were also used for detecting geckos. They were able to detect the presence of all gecko species at the three parks that were detected by VESs except for one instance: CFRs failed to detect the presence of <b>green</b> <b>geckos</b> at Whakanewha. Therefore, it is advisable that they are not used exclusively for monitoring the gecko populations...|$|R

50|$|The {{clusters}} of staminate flowers are arranged spirally and are flanked by very tough leathery bracts. Each {{has a small}} bracteole, three sepals forming a cylindrical tube, and a three-lobed corolla. There are 17 to 22 stamens. The pistillate flowers are solitary and borne at the angles of the rachis and are partially sunken in it {{in the form of}} a cup. They are ovoid with three petals as well as three sepals. It has been suggested that they may be pollinated by animals such as the endemic lizards which inhabit the forest where they occur. Pollination by wind and rain are also thought to be important. Only when Lodoicea begins to produce flowers, which can vary from 11 years to 45 or more, is it possible to determine the sex of the plant. The nectar and pollen are also food for several endemic animals e.g. bright <b>green</b> <b>geckos</b> (Phelsuma sp.), white slugs (Vaginula seychellensis) and insects.|$|R
50|$|It {{can be seen}} in forest, scrub and {{farmland}} {{and around}} rock faces and houses. It rarely hovers, instead feeding by sitting on an exposed perch and waiting for prey to pass, then swooping down to catch it. Lizards, particularly <b>green</b> day <b>geckos</b> (Phelsuma) and skinks (Mabuya), make up 92% of its diet and it will also take small birds, frogs, rats and insects.|$|R

50|$|The Wellington <b>green</b> <b>gecko</b> is {{much larger}} and more heavily built than the Auckland <b>green</b> <b>gecko</b> and can be {{distinguished}} by the yellow soles on its feet instead of grey-green.

2500|$|Naultinus is a genus of geckos. It {{is one of}} two genera of geckos {{that are}} endemic to New Zealand, the other genus being Hoplodactylus. [...] On account of their {{striking}} colouration, species in the genus Naultinus are commonly known as <b>green</b> <b>geckos.</b> There are eight described species in the genus, while another species from the North Island is awaiting formal scientific description. Species in the genus share a number of traits that set them apart as quite {{different from the rest of}} the world's two thousand odd gecko species, which are generally brown in colour, ovivaparous, short-lived and nocturnal. In contrast, Naultinus are green (with the exceptions of males in two South Island species which exhibit sexual dimorphism in colouration), ovovivaparous, live up to 30 years or more and are strictly diurnal. New Zealand has a temperate, maritime climate, and in terms of distribution Naultinus is one of the southern-most gecko genera in the world — some species live in habitats in the South Island which receive regular snowfall in winter. Animals in this genus possess several physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with these periods of low temperatures and adverse weather.|$|R
50|$|At {{least five}} species of {{reptiles}} {{have been recorded}} for the island. One is a snake - Boddaert's tropical racer (Mastigodryas boddaerti), and four are lizards - <b>Green</b> iguanas, Turnip-tailed <b>geckos,</b> Ocellated geckos (Gonatodes ocellatus), and an unidentified species of skink in the sub-family Mabuyinae.|$|R

40|$|The Balearic Islands were {{populated}} by humans sometime between {{the second and}} fourth millennium BC. Palaeontology research shows {{that most of the}} current terrestrial vertebrates have been introduced and that almost all nonflying pre-human vertebrates are extinct, either through human predation or, in most cases, through impacts from introduced fauna. All terrestrial mammals (a small endemic bovid with continuously growing incisors, Myotragus – a giant dormouse, Hypnomys and a giant shrew, Nesiotites) disappeared a few centuries after the arrival of humans. Very few other vertebrates have survived. The endemic lizard from Mallorca and Minorca, Podarcis lilfordi, has been extirpated from the main islands and only survives on islets that have remained free of snakes and carnivores. In addition, the Mallorcan midwife toad, (Alytes muletensis) only survives in the few karst canyons. The list of species that were introduced in prehistoric or historic times is very long and includes: snakes, green toads, <b>green</b> frogs, <b>geckos,</b> turtles, tortoises...|$|R
50|$|Like most Phelsuma species, {{the males}} {{can be quite}} quarrelsome and {{territorial}} and will not accept other males in their neighborhood. They only allow females to enter their territory. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a female. In this case {{the male and female}} must be separated. Breeding behavior includes, the shaking of the tail or body, vocalizing, and if the female does not accept the male she may turn a darker <b>green.</b> The day <b>geckos</b> may move slowly, but when they are startled they can move very fast. They are known for being very good at escaping their enclosures. Giant day geckos have no eyelids. To keep their eyes clean, they often lick them.|$|R
