40|$|In a {{previous}} communication (1), methods were described {{for studying the}} digital blood flow, blood pressure, and vascular resistance in normal subjects and in patients with hypertension and coronary thrombosis. These methods have been applied to the investigation of Raynaud's syn-drome, scleroderma, and thrombo-angiitis ob-literans involving the upper extremities. RESULTS The results are presented in Table I. In three cases of typical Raynaud's disease, one of less than one year's duration, and the others of less than extreme decrease in digital blood flow to approxi-mately four per cent of the normal, with a corre-spondingly extreme increase in digital vascular resistance to the height of 1740 units (normal 63 to 96 units). The digital arterial blood pre-sure was somewhat low and the brachial-digital arterial pressure gradient moderately increased. Seven cases of scleroderma were studied. In one case (C. R.) only the neck, chest, face, and legs were involved, there being no perceptible sclerodactyly. In this case, the digital blood flow was at the lower limit and the digital vascular resistance at the upper limit of normal.

40|$|Advances in info-communication {{technologies}} have brought many social, cultural, and economic changes along across the world. Recent reflections {{of these changes}} over citizenship studies are noteworthy. One of the relevant concepts, <b>digital</b> citizenship {{can be defined as}} applying and advocating behaviors necessary for legal, ethical, safe, and responsible use of info-communication technologies in online settings (ISTE, 2007). Day by day, individuals {{are becoming more and more}} <b>digital</b> citizens with the spread of the Internet and <b>digital</b> communication devices. However, this gives rise to discussions about problems related with ethics, privacy and security, health, communication, and etc. (Symantec, 2010; Deniz, 2010; Kadll, Kumba & Kanamad, 2010; Gunduz & Ozdinc, 2008; Kabakci & Can, 2009). All these hot issues, debates, and current technological competence standards point that teachers should teach this concept to their students as efficiently as possible by adopting <b>digital</b> citizenship (Greenhow, 2010). Ribble (2006) states that this education can be carried out through 9 dimensions such as <b>digital</b> ethics, <b>digital</b> communication, <b>digital</b> literacy, <b>digital</b> access, <b>digital</b> commerce, <b>digital</b> rights and law, <b>digital</b> privacy and security, <b>digital</b> responsibility, and <b>digital</b> health & wellness...|$|R
40|$|Architecture is {{presently}} {{engaged in an}} impatient search for solutions to critical questions {{about the nature and}} the identity of the discipline. Meanwhile, evolving <b>digital</b> technology continues to serve as a key agent for prevailing innovations and new ideas in architecture. Still, this feels familiar, as technology has always been a catalyst for new ideas in architecture. A positive <b>digital</b> future in architecture requires a clearer definition of principles and skills necessary to maintain a rigor in emerging <b>digital</b> projects/projections. At the same time, recognition about the significance of the already existing <b>digital</b> scholarship in architecture must be connected with emerging lines of inquiry evolving within the discipline. Healthy disciplines remain tolerant of a state of flux by constantly questioning the inclusion|exclusion, import|export, and collaboration|isolation to|from new ideas, new techniques, new disciplines, and new technology. At the perimeter of this nebulous exchange, an innovative new <b>digital</b> discourse is emerging that offers some unexpected new conduits to an attentive discipline of architecture.
