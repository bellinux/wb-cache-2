Fox concludes that [...] "quite simply, the contention <b>is</b> <b>nonsense.</b> A few troopers undoubtedly took their own lives, {{but it is hard to}} know what factors fostered the idea of wholesale suicide". Fox in his turn has been criticized for selectively using Indian oral tradition when it suits him, but discarding it as nonsense when he finds it disagreeable.|$|E
500|$|... "Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson" [...] is {{the tenth}} {{episode of the}} twenty-third season of the American {{animated}} sitcom The Simpsons. In the episode, Bart uploads a video on YouTube in which Homer rants about airlines' horrible treatment of passengers. It quickly becomes popular and Homer is eventually given his own political cable news show. Homer wins support among average Americans and is chosen by the Republicans to pick their candidate for the next presidential election. He chooses Ted Nugent, but in the end, he realizes that he made the wrong decision and that everything he has said on his show <b>is</b> <b>nonsense,</b> so he admits on television that he is [...] "full of crap".|$|E
500|$|Peter Bergen, {{writing for}} The Nation, offered a {{detailed}} {{critique of the}} film. Bergen wrote that even if al-Qaeda is not as organised as the Bush administration stressed, {{it is still a}} very dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. On Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was a creation of neoconservative politicians, Bergen said, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>nonsense.</b> There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks." [...] Bergen further claimed that Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and his ignoring warnings of a terrorist attack prior to 11 September.|$|E

Karlsen called him [...] "so level-headed and mature" [...] and noted his intelligence and performance at school, while also saying {{that this could be}} a disadvantage as [...] "The best footballers tend to have a bit of needle, a bit of fire". While former Norway international Jan Åge Fjørtoft was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane, he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop: [...] "Comparing Ødegaard to Messi <b>is</b> <b>nonsense</b> from the media. Messi is a player who can make the difference and Martin can do the same, but any comparisons should not be taken seriously". Ødegaard reacted to the attention on him by saying [...] "If you get carried away now, you won't get far in 10 years. I'm supposed to be at my best then, not now. That I know".|$|E
500|$|The England Test was the All Blacks' third {{international}} {{in as many}} weeks; they had been played on successive Saturdays, with a mid-week match between each. England named eight new caps in their side, and played a rover (or wing-forward) on top of seven forwards. The game {{has been described as}} [...] "a benefit for All Black wing Duncan McGregor". He scored four tries in the Test—a record not equalled by an All Black until 1987. A try was also scored by Fred Newton, and with none of the five tries converted, the score finished 15–0. English sportsman C. B. Fry said after the match, [...] "The notion that these men beat us because of our physical degeneracy <b>is</b> <b>nonsense.</b> They beat us by organisation and by tactics." [...] A legacy of this match is that the whistle used by the referee, Gil Evans, has been used to start the opening match of every Rugby World Cup tournament. Between tournaments the whistle is housed at the New Zealand Rugby Museum in Palmerston North and was donated to them by the chairman of the NZRFU and manager of the 1924–25 All Blacks.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's love of wordplay and {{nonsense}} {{with a twist}} found a {{wider audience}} when he was 24. Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after [...] "Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles {{came to me and}} I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, [...] "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of [...] "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories [...] "remarkable... also very funny... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>nonsense</b> writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." [...] Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers [...] "took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".|$|E

2500|$|Published in 1991, Sheldrake's The Rebirth of Nature: The Greening of Science and God {{addressed}} {{the subject of}} New Age consciousness and related topics. A column in The Guardian said that the book [...] "seeks to restore the pre-Enlightenment notion that nature is 'alive'", quoting Sheldrake as saying that [...] "indeterminism, spontaneity and creativity have re-emerged throughout the natural world" [...] and that [...] "mystic, animistic and religious ways of thinking {{can no longer be}} kept at bay". The book was reviewed by James Lovelock in Nature, who argued that [...] "the theory of formative causation makes testable predictions", noting that [...] "nothing has yet been reported which would divert the mainstream of science. ...

My advice to ministers is clear: that there is no science in homoeopathy. The most it can have is a placebo effect – it is then a political decision whether they spend money on it or not." [...] His predecessor, John Beddington, referring to his views on homeopathy being [...] "fundamentally ignored" [...] by the Government, said: [...] "The only one [...] I could think of was homoeopathy, which is mad. It has no underpinning of scientific basis. In fact, all the science points {{to the fact that it}} is not at all sensible. The clear evidence is saying this is wrong, but homoeopathy is still used on the NHS." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nanorobotics is the {{emerging}} technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at {{or close to}} the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Also known as [...] "nanobots" [...] or [...] "nanites", they would be constructed from molecular machines. So far, researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems, such as bearings, sensors, and synthetic molecular motors, but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the Nanobot Robocup contest. Researchers also {{hope to be able}} to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria, which could perform tasks on a tiny scale. Possible applications include micro surgery (on the level of individual cells), utility fog, manufacturing, weaponry and cleaning.

2500|$|Nathaniel Hawthorne and {{his family}} had moved to a small red {{farmhouse}} near Lenox, Massachusetts, at the end of March 1850. He became friends with Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and Melville beginning on August 5, 1850, when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend. Melville wrote [...] an unsigned review of Hawthorne's short story collection Mosses from an Old Manse titled [...] "Hawthorne and His Mosses", which appeared in The Literary World on August 17 and 24. Bezanson finds the essay [...] "so deeply related to Melville's imaginative and intellectual world while writing Moby-Dick" [...] that it could be regarded as a virtual preface and should be [...] "everybody's prime piece of contextual reading". In the essay, Melville compares Hawthorne to Shakespeare and Dante, and his [...] "self-projection" [...] is evident in the repeats of the word [...] "genius", the more than two dozen references to Shakespeare, and in the insistence that Shakespeare's [...] "unapproachability" [...] <b>is</b> <b>nonsense</b> for an American.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{became the}} centre of media {{interest}} in early 2016 when he refused to clarify his support for Brexit. In February 2016 he endorsed Vote Leave in the [...] "Out" [...] campaign for the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016. He labelled Cameron's fears on the matter as [...] "greatly over exaggerated". Following this announcement, which was interpreted by financial markets as making Brexit more probable, the pound sterling slumped by nearly 2% to its lowest level since March 2009. When Obama urged the UK {{to remain in the}} EU, Johnson alleged that the President was motivated by anti-British sentiment caused by his Kenyan ancestry. The comments were condemned as racist and unacceptable by several Labour and Liberal Democratic politicians, and a King's College London student society revoked a speaking invitation to him on the basis of it. Conversely, his comments were defended by both UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage and the Conservative Iain Duncan Smith. On 22 June 2016, the day before the referendum vote, Johnson declared that 23 June could be [...] "Britain's independence day" [...] in a televised debate in front of a 6000-member audience at Wembley Arena. David Cameron, British Prime Minister at the time, specifically addressed Johnson's claim, publicly stating; [...] "the idea that our country isn't independent <b>is</b> <b>nonsense.</b> This whole debate demonstrates our sovereignty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{subsequent}} campaign ended abruptly {{in southern}} Romania's invasion by the Central Powers (Germans and their allies). In November 1916, shortly before King Ferdinand and the pro-Entente government retreated to Iași, they appointed Tzigara-Samurcaș a custodian of the Crown and Royal Domains, tasked with preventing acts of vandalism on the occupiers' part. He stayed behind in Bucharest {{and met with}} August von Mackensen, head of the occupation forces. As {{a result of this}} encounter, the Germans asked Tzigara to discuss an offer of collaboration with the senior Conservative Party Germanophiles: Maiorescu, Alexandru Marghiloman, Petre P. Carp. All three refused to openly associate with Mackensen's military rule, but a puppet civilian administration was set up under Carp's disciple Lupu Kostaki. Carp's reply to Tzigara's proposition is recorded as: [...] "Such a thing is of no interest to me; it <b>is</b> <b>nonsense,</b> and at this moment counts as weakness." [...] Maiorescu's deteriorating relationship with Carp was also a factor: Carp flatly refused to attend any meeting where Maiorescu was present, and alienated the other two by stating that King Ferdinand should be deposed. Maiorescu himself explained that {{it was a question of}} principle: [...] "Tzigara has been proposing this to me, but I did not wish to. If [...] orders me to go, let him send in armed soldiers to take me." ...|$|E
2500|$|C. S. Lewis {{argues that}} {{when talking about}} omnipotence, {{referencing}} [...] "a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it" [...] <b>is</b> <b>nonsense</b> {{just as much as}} referencing [...] "a square circle"; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking [...] "Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" [...] is just as much nonsense as asking [...] "Can God draw a square circle?" [...] The logical contradiction here being God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement [...] "God can lift this rock" [...] must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that’s too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this doesn’t quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that {{the only difference is that}} this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.|$|E
