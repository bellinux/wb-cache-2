5|$|The crew {{are able}} to track the Osaarian vessel, finding a large 1,000-year-old sphere {{constructed}} out of a single alloy. Archer and his away team discover a series of habitat modules containing most of the stolen items. The crew also finds a cargo manifest, and Ensign Sato soon learns they had also recently attacked a Xindi ship. Archer once again confronts Orgoth, demanding to <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> the Xindi. He then drags the Osaarian to an airlock, initiating the decompression cycle. Orgoth soon relents, revealing they downloaded the Xindi database, while providing the access codes to their computer. When the alien ship returns, Mayweather maneuvers Enterprise close enough for Sato to download the bulk of it. Archer sends Orgoth back to his people.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> their {{particular}} situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E

500|$|Marceline {{has been}} {{critically}} acclaimed and is popular with fans of Adventure Time. The character {{was also the}} focus of a miniseries entitled Stakes, which aired during the show's seventh season. Early in the show's history, Ward himself has stated that Marceline is his favorite character in the series because he does not <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> her history and backstory, which he noted adds a mysterious element to her character. Despite the positivity, the episodes [...] "What Was Missing" [...] and [...] "Sky Witch" [...] became somewhat controversial because of an implied past relationship between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline.|$|E
500|$|The Mirror Never Lies was a {{collaboration}} between the Indonesian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Wakatobi regency government, and SET Film Workshop, with the former two providing funding. It focused on the Bajau people, also known as [...] "sea gypsies" [...] for their nomadic maritime lifestyle. Little Indonesian-language documentation was available to the crew, and as such production took over two years, most of which was research. Andini later recalled that the crew had to [...] "go directly to Wakatobi {{back and forth to}} get to <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> the [...] tribe". Originally planned for the second quarter of 2010, shooting was further delayed until September owing to an extended rainy season. Unlike most contemporary Indonesian films, which are often completed in a matter of days, the crew shot on site over a period of two months. They faced poor weather, including typhoons and large waves, and had difficulty manoeuvring over the wooden walkways and bridges used by the Bajau.|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics, {{written by}} Cyrus, Antonina Armato, Tim James and Devrim Karaoglu, have been mistakenly {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of ways. The song's protagonist sings in first person perspective while condemning an unspecified subject for wanting to invade her privacy. The majority of reviewers thought the protagonist was referring to a [...] "controlling boyfriend". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times sided with the boyfriend, and believed the song's protagonist was [...] "bullying some poor boy for the sin of wanting to know what she talks about with her friends." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe believed the song could have described a number of subjects, such as [...] "a former boyfriend, the media, and even her fans." [...] However, in an interview with Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Cyrus said the song was about [...] "the media" [...] and [...] "how they think they <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> , when they don't.

During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what the}} secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E
500|$|Shero was an innovator, {{aside from}} being the first coach to employ systems, and {{known as one of}} the first Western coaches to study Soviet influences, he was the first coach to study film. His son Ray even recalls his father {{breaking}} down games from radio broadcasts. He was also the first to have his players use in season strength training, with the use of an Apollo machine, a precursor to Nautilus equipment. As well as one of the first coaches to adopt the morning skate. He was one of the first coaches to have a game plan specifically designed on how to attack opposing teams, although not all of them worked to plan. Bernie Parent recalls a game against Montreal in which Shero decided to out skate the highly skilled Canadiens. After the first period, during which the Flyers' goaltender faced 21 shots, he jokingly summed it up by saying, [...] "the Zamboni didn't even need to resurface the other end of the ice." [...] Yet it illustrates Shero's understanding that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> coaching and his pursuit to learn more.|$|E

500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus {{with the aid of}} Armato, James, and Devrim Karaoglu. [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was {{intended}} for the media, regarding [...] "how they think they <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> , when they don't. They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [...] 24/7." [...] Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid paparazzi but they appeared, [...] "not going away like little annoying flies." [...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing. [...] "It's saying if there's someone you've loved but for some reason you can't love them anymore, you have to take your feelings, scoop them out, and put them {{at the bottom of the}} ocean." [...] Cyrus, Armato, James, Aaron Dudley co-wrote [...] "Wake Up America", a track about environmentalism. The song was directed towards [...] "the people in the back seat", children of today's generation; she said that, in the future, they would be the ones [...] "driving [...] Earth to what it's gonna be." [...] "It's the only one you got, so you gotta take care of it. And if you don't, there's gonna be, maybe not for you, right then, and your generation but your kids and their kids ... Every generation has a cycle that'll carry on for the rest of eternity", she concluded. Cyrus recorded a cover of Cheyenne Kimball's [...] "Four Walls" [...] from the album The Day Has Come (2006) for Breakout, titled [...] "These Four Walls". The twelfth and final track is a remixed version of the hit [...] "See You Again", referred to as the Rock Mafia Remix and the 2008 Remix; [...] "See You Again" [...] was originally released on the Meet Miley Cyrus disc of Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus.|$|E

After his revelation, she tells him he should go and to write about their night together. In the middle of their conversation, she hears a voice she recognizes singing. When she looks at the stage, she sees that it is Charlie and realizes that she did not <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> him. Michael is upset, thinking that she declined his offer for Charlie and is ready to go. After they leave, Charlie is auditioning for a music agent and is rejected. The next day when Peggy goes to talk to Charlie, he lashes out at her and she gives him a song she [...] "wrote" [...] for him (which ends up being [...] "She Loves You", by The Beatles). She then goes to Richard to say goodbye, saying she wants to stop messing up her life and everyone else's since the reason Charlie stopped singing was her becoming pregnant right before they graduated. Richard proposes, but she refuses because she does not want to marry anyone and he has to be valedictorian. Confused, she visits her grandparents for her birthday. After her grandparents tell her that her grandmother can see the future, she tells them her story. Her grandfather and his lodge friends then try a strange séance ritual to send her back to 1985.|$|E
2500|$|Another wartime {{personality}} of Valenciennes was Louise de Bettignies (born in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux), a pupil of the Ursulines in Valenciennes from 1890 to 1896. Fluent in four languages (including German), in 1915 she created {{and directed the}} main British intelligence network behind enemy lines, nearly [...] from the front around Lille. Arrested {{at the end of}} September 1915, and imprisoned in Germany, she died of mistreatment in September 1918 two months before the Armistice. It is estimated that she saved the lives of nearly a thousand British soldiers by the remarkably precise information she obtained. For example, it enabled the British to conduct the first aerial bombing of a train (that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who came to visit the front at Lille), though both aircraft were not equipped with suitable viewfinders and so the raid narrowly missed its target. The German High Command, based in Brussels, then put all its efforts into neutralising the accursed network that allowed the British to see everything and <b>know</b> <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> this part of the front. Louise's arrest was associated with the escape of Szeck Alexandre, a young Austrian radio operator got out of Brussels in August 1915, allowing the British {{to get their hands on}} the secret German diplomatic code. This code was exploited by Secret Service Room 40 ("Room 40"), under the supervision of Sir Reginald Hall, and in January 1917 allowed the decipherment of the famous Zimmermann Telegram, which triggered the United States' entry into the war in April 1917.|$|E
