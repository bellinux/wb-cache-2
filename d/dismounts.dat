5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process is over the male <b>dismounts</b> the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak <b>dismounts</b> and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915, {{after several}} {{occasions}} when the British had to temporarily <b>dismount</b> regiments and send them into the front lines, an establishment for the <b>Dismounted</b> Cavalry Division was created. The three British cavalry divisions each formed a <b>dismounted</b> cavalry brigade, with the 1st Brigade being raised from the 1st Division, and so on. The cavalry brigades formed a <b>dismounted</b> cavalry battalion, numbered after their parent brigades, so the 9th Cavalry Brigade formed the 9th <b>Dismounted</b> Battalion, for example. The cavalry regiments each formed one <b>dismounted</b> company and a machine gun section for their battalion. However, the <b>Dismounted</b> Cavalry Division, with only three brigades, was smaller than an infantry division, which had four brigades. This disadvantage was felt throughout the formation, with the <b>dismounted</b> cavalry brigade only having three battalions instead of the four in an infantry formation, and the <b>dismounted</b> cavalry battalion only having three, albeit larger, companies {{as opposed to the}} four of an infantry battalion. There was one other divisional-sized formation raised in 1916 that contained British cavalry regiments. This was the Imperial Cavalry Division, which served in the campaign in Mesopotamia. This was another British Indian Army division, and like all Indian divisions, it had one British regiment per brigade.|$|R

500|$|Following {{the dog to}} {{the tree}} is often done on foot, {{although}} some hunters use mules or horses, and some utilize all-terrain vehicles.

Hermóðr rides for nine nights in deep, dark valleys where Hermóðr can see nothing. The two arrive at the river Gjöll and then continue to Gjöll bridge, encountering a maiden guarding the bridge named Móðguðr. Some dialogue occurs between Hermóðr and Móðguðr, including that Móðguðr notes that recently there had ridden five battalions of dead men across the bridge that made less sound than he. Sleipnir and Hermóðr continue [...] "downwards and northwards" [...] on the road to Hel, until the two arrive at Hel's gates. Hermóðr <b>dismounts</b> from Sleipnir, tightens Sleipnir's girth, mounts him, and spurs Sleipnir on. Sleipnir [...] "jumped so hard and over the gate that it came nowhere near."

500|$|Breeding occurs mostly {{during the}} summer. Some studies report that {{breeding}} ceases entirely during the winter, but winter breeding occurs {{as far north}} as Virginia, primarily because photoperiod influences their circadian rhythm which determines breeding. In both Texas and Virginia, [...] variation in reproductive activity in females is less than in males. In the south of its range, animals may breed less when the summer is at its warmest. The duration of the estrous cycle ranges from 6 to 9 days, with an average of 7.72 days. Estrus occurs again after a litter is born. [...] Copulatory behavior in the marsh rice rat is similar to that in laboratory brown rats. Before mating starts, [...] "the male pursues the running female from behind." [...] The male then repeatedly mounts and <b>dismounts</b> the female; not all mounts result in an ejaculation. Penetrations only last for about 250ms, but during mating, the penetrations and the intervals between them become longer. Even when a male is satiated after mating, it is able to copulate again when a new female is introduced (the Coolidge effect). Partly because of resistance by the female, the frequency of ejaculation during mating is rather low in marsh rice rats as compared to laboratory rats, hamsters, and deermice.|$|E

2500|$|In India, {{the mating}} season occurs between mid-October and January, while captive dholes in the Moscow Zoo breed mostly in February. Unlike wolf packs, dhole clans may contain {{more than one}} {{breeding}} female. More than one female dhole may den and rear their litters {{together in the same}} den. During mating, the female assumes a crouched, cat-like position. There is no copulatory tie characteristic of other canids when the male <b>dismounts.</b> Instead, the pair lie on their sides facing each other in a semicircular formation. The gestation period lasts 60–63 days, with litter sizes averaging 4–6 pups. Their growth rate is much faster than that of wolves, being similar in rate to that of coyotes. Pups are suckled at least 58 days. During this time, the pack feeds the mother at the den site. Dholes do not use [...] sites to meet their pups as wolves do, though one or more adults will stay with the pups at the den {{while the rest of the}} pack hunts. Once weaning begins, the adults of the clan will regurgitate food for the pups until they are old enough to join in hunting. They remain at the den site 70–80 days. By the age of six months, pups accompany the adults on hunts, and will assist in killing large prey such as sambar by the age of eight months. Maximum longevity in captivity is 15–16 years.|$|E
