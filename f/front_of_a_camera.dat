5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about what he looked like in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E

25|$|Swanson was {{angered by}} the response, as she felt those very studios had {{produced}} questionable films themselves, and were jealous at not having the chance to produce Rain. After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to the MPAA, and then the newspapers. She only heard back from Marcus Loew, who promised to appeal on her behalf, and since he owned a chain of theatres this eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on Sadie Thompson which already had $250,000 invested in it. Before casting began, the young Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. wanted to audition {{for the role of}} Handsome O'Hara. However, Swanson felt he was too young and not right for the role. Lionel Barrymore had been first picked to play Davidson but was thought to be too ill at the time, though he eventually won the role. Barrymore wore the same outfit for an entire week, aggravating Swanson. She asked some of the crew to tell him to change and wash, which he did. Aside from this, Swanson was happy with his performance. Walsh had not appeared in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> in eight years, and feared {{he would not be able}} to direct and act at the same time. However, two days into filming, his fears had disappeared.|$|E

Cardinale said of her acting, [...] "I never felt scandal and confession were necessary to be an actress. I've never revealed my self or even my body in films. Mystery is very important." [...] In a 2014 interview, she revealed her secret of success: [...] "If you want to practise this craft, {{you have to have}} inner strength. Otherwise, you’ll lose your idea of who you are.

500|$|McAdams' {{break-out}} role came in 2004, {{when she}} {{starred in the}} comedy film Mean Girls opposite Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried, based on Rosalind Wiseman's book Queen Bees and Wannabes. McAdams was 25 {{years old when she}} was cast as the mean high school queen bee Regina George, and she modelled her character on Alec Baldwin's performance in the drama Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). Mike Clark of USA Today praised her [...] "comic flair" [...] while Jenny McCartney of The Daily Telegraph found her [...] "delightfully hateful." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that [...] "McAdams brings glamour and magnetism to Regina, but also the right hint of comic distance." [...] The film grossed $129 million worldwide and earned McAdams two MTV Movie Awards. Mean Girls later reached No. 12 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the Greatest Ever High School Movies. Tina Fey, who co‑starred in the film and wrote the screenplay, has credited McAdams with teaching her how to act in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> rather than an audience: [...] "She's a film actor. She's not pushing. And so I kind of learned that lesson from watching her." ...|$|E
500|$|In a retrospective, Paul Mallinson of Computer & Video Games (CVG) {{wrote that}} the game's {{production}} was [...] "speedy, focused and fun". Castle said that, because the company was creating other titles at the time, development of Command & Conquer was not a [...] "working party"; but lead programmer Joe Bostic later {{said that it was}} [...] "so much fun that I would sometimes marvel that I actually got paid as well." [...] The game's playtesters were enthusiastic about the game during development, which Castle later said had encouraged the team to work harder. The team created live-action FMV cutscenes for the game. These cutscenes contain no professional actors aside from Kucan, who played Kane and was heavily involved in their production. The cast is made up of Westwood team members, and a low budget meant that filming took place in [...] "spare rooms" [...] and warehouses. Castle later said that the team [...] "had no illusions that we were as good as TV or film," [...] but that the cutscenes were not intentionally campy. He credited Kucan with [...] "taking ragtag group of people who had no business in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> and making something reasonably good." [...] To replace the spice from Dune II, the team introduced Tiberium, which was inspired by the 1957 B-movie The Monolith Monsters. Castle said that the team's goal in both cases was to create [...] "a central resource that everybody was fighting over." [...] As with Dune II, the soundtrack was composed by Frank Klepacki.|$|E

500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{praised the}} film, saying, [...] "It sounds kooky on paper {{but on the}} screen cowboys and aliens make beautiful, fun music together." [...] Honeycutt felt {{that the success of}} the film's blend of aliens and western themes was due to [...] "the {{determination}} by everyone involved to play the damn thing straight. Even the slightest goofiness, the tiniest touch of camp, and the whole thing would blow sky high. But it doesn't." [...] He criticized the aliens, which he said [...] "don't rate as characters", existing as [...] "moving blobs you shoot at in a video game." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt's sentiments that the [...] "potential hamminess" [...] of the premise is offset by the cast, particularly Craig through a [...] "mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity." [...] He considered however, that Wilde had the opposite effect, stating she [...] "appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars". Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying [...] "beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play" [...] and concluded that [...] "a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best." [...] Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice said the Western elements of the film were [...] "lovingly" [...] handled but called felt the science aspects a [...] "gimmick" [...] and [...] "much more standard fare" [...] in comparison.

The method is tested on domestic images such as people, curtains blown by wind and external events such as tree branches. 1 Introduction In this paper, <b>an</b> initial study <b>of</b> <b>a</b> process for detecting and classifying moving objects is presented.

Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd {{be a lot of people}} out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!"
