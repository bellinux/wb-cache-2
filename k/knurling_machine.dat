5|$|Mary Phagan {{was born}} on June 1, 1899, into an {{established}} Georgia family of tenant farmers. Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of Marietta, Georgia. During or after 1907, they again relocated to East Point, Georgia, in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house. Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill. In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta. That spring, Phagan took {{a job with the}} National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a <b>knurling</b> <b>machine</b> that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week. She worked {{on the second floor of}} the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.|$|E
5000|$|The beer {{engine was}} invented by John Lofting, a Dutch inventor, {{merchant}} and manufacturer who moved from Amsterdam to London in about 1688 and patented a number of inventions including a fire hose and engine for extinguishing fires and a thimble <b>knurling</b> <b>machine.</b> The London Gazette of 17 March 1691 stated [...] "the patentee hath also projected a very useful engine for starting of beers and other liquors which will deliver from 20 to 30 barrels an hour which are completely fixed with brass joints and screws at reasonable rates." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{machinery}} {{was left}} {{inside the building}} after the mill closed, {{with the exception of}} footpresses for riveting. It drew its power from a turbine beneath the building, which powered a direct current generator. The electricity from the generator drew a motor that turned a line shaft, to which the machinery was attached by belting. The machinery present included three power presses, one of them extensively modified by Messerschmidt; a <b>knurling</b> <b>machine,</b> built by Messerschmidt; two multiple-spindle screw machines; and seven swaging machines, as well as machinery and hand tools for metalworking in a toolroom contained in an addition to the building.|$|E
5000|$|After the war, Murray {{became known}} as a {{manufacturer}} of low-cost bicycles, and placed its own brand on some products. Since the 1930s, Murray had been producing bicycles that, while stylistically different, imitated designs by other U.S. manufacturers, including Schwinn and AMF. This occasionally brought Murray into legal conflict with competitors, as when Schwinn filed against Murray for duplicating a Schwinn <b>knurling</b> and <b>machining</b> process on its rims.|$|R
5000|$|John Lofting (1659 - 15 June 1742, London), {{originally}} Jan Loftingh, was {{an engineer}} and entrepreneur from the Netherlands. His parents were Herman and Johanna. He moved to London, England, before 1686. He patented two inventions: the [...] "sucking worm engine" [...] (a fire engine) and a horse-powered thimble <b>knurling</b> <b>machine.</b> His mill {{was set up in}} Islington, where Lofting Road is named after him. However, in or about 1700, he moved his main operation to Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire {{to take advantage of the}} River Thames' ability to turn a water wheel which improved productivity, enabling the production of over 2 million thimbles per year.|$|E
50|$|Charles' {{mechanical}} work was highly successful. Though he lacked formal {{training as a}} mechanical engineer, a natural mechanical inclination sharpened by boyhood on the farm and in the sawmill allowed him to create unique machinery to cheaply manufacture his products. His achievements including building a <b>knurling</b> <b>machine</b> for utensil stock from a mixture of home-made and purchased parts, and the extensive modification of a power press to stamp nutcracker teeth. In addition to the mechanical changes within, a shed was built {{across the road from}} the mill in about 1935 so that the products could be nickel plated. Manufacturing continued at the mill, using the original machinery, until 1974 or 1976. In 1970, two waste lagoons were dug on the property for disposal of the nickel waste, and the dam was patched with concrete during the 1970s.|$|E
