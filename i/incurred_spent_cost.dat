40|$|Abstract. Nowadays in the {{development}} of embedded system, cutting-edge embedded system products are quickly disappearing from the markets because of their short product development period which shortens the product life cycle. Therefore, strengthening its competitiveness and minimizing its development cost can be said {{to be one of the}} most important factors. For this motive, an Embedded Integration Prototyping (IP) system based on Component Technique was designed and implemented through this paper. The system is composed of Physical Prototyping (PP) providing the environment in which the product can be tested by using Actuator(Motor), Sensor and reusable Blocks, and Virtual Prototyping (VP) in which visual test on the product can be carried out by applying various components and libraries based on technique related to the computer. And, IP System was built in order to mutually compensate for drawbacks latent in both of physical and virtual prototyping environment by making use of component module. The module will be able to enhance the product competitiveness, through spending less time in developing kinds of the component owning almost same features, using it again for different embedded system products, and accordingly minimizing <b>spent</b> <b>cost</b> and time for developing the component...|$|R
40|$|The {{upcoming}} {{challenges in}} the energy sector coupled with growing concern about climate risks are {{likely to result in}} dramatic changes in public policy. The choice of energy and transportation strategies will have a profound impact {{on the future of the}} United States of America and the world. A business as usual scenario indicates lower GDP, labor-intensive employment with high unemployment and increasing CO 2 emissions. Practical options exist to turn this scenario into higher GDP, good employment and lower CO 2 emissions. Several policy scenarios were modeled with constrained oil supply using Millennium Institute’s T 21 -USA model. The most positive result by every significant metric (GDP, greenhouse gas emissions, oil used) came from the combination of the two most environmentally positive policies: a massive push for electrified rail transportation (inter-city railroads and Urban Rail) coupled with a massive push for renewable energy, to be completed by 2030. With an estimated total investment of $ 250 - 500 billion in inter-city railroad lines Non-Oil Transportation could supplant most inter-city truck freight and unspecified modal share of passenger service. Up to $ 60 billion/year ($ 1. 2 trillion over 20 years), <b>spent</b> <b>cost</b> effectively on Urban Rail, shoul...|$|R

40|$|Internationally {{there is}} a huge desire to {{increase}} mobility by constructing new infrastructure. The European Union has an investment program of approximately € 600 billion up to 2020. At the same time we notice that while ambitions are high, the requirements put on new infrastructure have been rising over the years. This increase in demand is, for example, visible in the additional rules and legalisation that need to be complied with, such as those relating to flora & fauna, archaeology and soil decontamination. Additional pressure comes from the higher profile and more professional behaviour of stakeholders who are affected by Large Infrastructure Projects (LIPs) such as communities, pressure groups and environmental protection agencies. Apparently, in the implementation of LIPs ‘good’ is not ‘good enough’ anymore. Studies show that the results of LIPs are often regarded as disappointing in terms of money <b>spent</b> (<b>cost</b> overruns), late delivery and a general dissatisfaction from the stakeholders involved. On the basis of these facts, we can conclude that we are facing a potential deadlock between an enormous need for mobility on the one hand, and great difficulties in implementing LIPs to meet this need on the other. A possible solution to break this deadlock is by increasing fundamentally the quality of management of LIPs [...] . etcetera...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{deal with}} {{uncertain}} demand rates in stochastic periodic inventory routing problem (SPIRP), supply chain planners foresee an extra stock amount, known as “safety stock” at the retailers. This safety stock prevents stock-out from occurring {{and gives the}} supply chain planner the possibility to offer a level of service assurance to its retailers. The pre-set service level for the retailers guarantees the reliability of having the demand rates satisfied at a certain rate during the planning horizon. To prove the guaranteed service level at the retailers, the actual service level is measured through a simulation experiment. The results of the simulation show {{that the difference between}} the actual and pre-set service level does not behave linearly for the different scenarios. In addition, this non-linearity changes with the length of the planning horizon. Minimization of the difference between actual and expected service level results in saving the <b>spent</b> <b>costs</b> for the assurance of service at the retailers. In this paper, we evaluate the behavior of the actual service level compared to the pre-set service level. Also the effects on short/long term planning horizon is measured and analyzed. A case study of a distribution center is simulated to show how to optimize the inventory level and routing system with different planning horizons and pre-set service levels...|$|R
