40|$|A DAEE {{working paper}} on urban {{agricultural}} activities in Zimbabwe. Crop production on open municipal and undeveloped lands {{has become a}} significant source of the food security and indirectly sources of household cash income generation or savings. Advent of economic reforms has exacerbated urban agriculture. This is because of the removal of subsidies on food commodities and retrenchments in the formal employment sectors. These have in turn contributed to falling real incomes and reduced food security status of urban households. Urban cultivation had become an important strategy through which families cope with the impact of the economic structure adjustment programme. Though a widespread practice, urban agriculture is not planned for or supported by other planners and managers as a legitimate form of urban land use. Urban agriculture comes into direct conflict with planning provisions for urban space. This study examines the socio-economics of urban crop on municipal lands, cultivators’ views and perceptions on the use of urban space for agricultural activities and related issues in Harare, Zimbabwe. Urban agriculture is used for subsistence maize production. It improves food grain availability, thus increasing household food security and real incomes available for other household requirements as contributes to savings on food expenditure. This is the <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> on undeveloped urban land spaces. The study gives empirical insight on the uses of urban space for agricultural activities from the cultivators' perspectives. The findings of the study also show that there is a serious problem of lack of concern for the environment {{on the part of the}} cultivators. The majority of the cultivators were aware of but ignored the steam bank regulations. There was general lack of knowledge about the environmental effects of cultivation on the urban environment. Given the importance of urban agriculture to the cultivators and the concern on the environmental impacts, there is need to design extension programmes through which the cultivators would be provided with advice on proper land use husbandry...|$|E

2500|$|The {{regulation}} {{of genetic engineering}} concerns approaches taken by governments to assess and manage {{the risks associated with}} the use of genetic engineering technology, and the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), including genetically modified crops and genetically modified fish. There are differences in the {{regulation of}} GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. [...] Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. [...] For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. The European Union differentiates between approval <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> within the EU and approval for import and processing. While only a few GMOs have been approved <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing. The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about coexistence of GM and non GM crops. Depending on the coexistence regulations <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> of GM crops differ.|$|R

Examples include grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Carignan noir and Palomino (see complete table below).|$|R

In 2008, Wildlife SOS {{collaborated with the}} state government on {{the expansion of the}} existing Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar, near Pune, which currently houses 30 leopards. In addition, Wildlife SOS veterinarians and biologists conduct awareness workshops and training programs for local communities, the Forest Department, law enforcement, educational institutions and forums to help raise awareness and mitigate conflict situations.|$|R
40|$|Wheat was {{the single}} most {{important}} product of the British economy during the Industrial Revolution, being both the largest component of national income and the primary determinant of caloric intake. This paper offers new estimates of annual wheat production during industrialisation. Whereas other researchers infer wheat production indirectly from demand equations, we estimate production directly from output equations. Our estimates are based on a new time series model of wheat yields, encompassing both environmental and technological variables. We trace the impact of war and population growth on wheat yields, mediated through changes in the economic <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> wheat <b>cultivation.</b> We test the accuracy of our new wheat output series by modelling the market price of wheat in England between 1700 and 1825.

40|$|A {{combination}} of social surveys and direct field observations {{was used to}} identify and determine the abundance status of botanicals used in treating carnivorous animals in Ekiti States, Nigeria. A total of 11 species belonging to 9 families were identified as being used. Voucher specimens of the botanicals identified by the respondents were collected, identified and relevant information on them were documented. Leaves constituted the {{major part of the}} plants used for the treatment in the study area. The sources of the identified botanicals used in the study area were identified. Most of the respondents sourced their botanicals from the forests, household farms, common areas and household areas. The availability of these plants constituted a favorable <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> their <b>cultivation</b> in large quantities. The relative abundance of the identified species was determined based on their accessibility when required. Thus species were classified into two groups, abundant and rare species. It was observed that 45 % of the botanicals identified were in abundant status. Only 36. 36 % of them were cultivated in the study area and the species were cultivated mainly for other uses apart from being used as medicine...|$|R
25|$|Colombia {{continues}} to be the world's single largest producer of cocaine and coca leaves. The land area under coca cultivation has decreased from over 140,000 hectares in 2001 due to aerial coca eradication and manual eradication, but there has been an increase in coca cultivation since 2013, with 96,000 hectares under coca cultivation in 2015 according to the latest United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report, representing a 39% increase on the previous year. The majority (81%) of coca cultivation is concentrated in three southern departments (Nariño, Cauca, Putumayo, Caquetá) and in Norte de Santander Department, which are also regions with a substantial FARC presence. The UNODC suggests that different negotiations on the issue, in Havana and other settings, are generating <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> increased coca <b>cultivation</b> because of the perception that the benefits of development projects would mainly be directed at coca cultivators.|$|R
40|$|In situ {{conservation}} of tropical forests often requires restricting human use and occupancy within protected areas by enforcing regulations. However, law enforcement interventions {{that seek to}} prevent deforestation rarely have been evaluated. Conservationists increasingly recognize the need to measure {{the effectiveness of their}} interventions, using an indicator of biodiversity change, such as rate of deforestation, and a counterfactual approach that addresses a fundamental question: what would have happened had there been no intervention? This study examines how law enforcement can mitigate habitat loss from small-holder coffee growing by comparing 34 years of empirical data on deforestation rates and coffee prices across a zone of high law enforcement and a zone of low law enforcement using satellite imagery, ecological data, interviews, and GIS modeling. In the early 1980 s strong law enforcement efforts were found to reduce deforestation inside Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP), southwest Sumatra. However, law enforcement efforts were weak in remote areas of BBSNP, where high coffee prices spurred rapid deforestation. Furthermore, law enforcement efforts were reversed by the 1997 - 1998 Asian economic crisis. the fall of the national president, and by new regulations surrounding regional autonomy. These findings indicate that law enforcement is critical but insufficient alone. They also highlight that rising costs of agricultural commodities can be detrimental to tropical forests and their associated biodiversity. In the long run one must act to decrease the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> coffee <b>cultivation.</b> A multi-faceted strategy that includes law enforcement and incentives to reduce poverty around PAS is proposed...|$|R

Reviewing evidence from the literature, we discuss especially indirect effects of various interventions and their cost-effectiveness. The paper concludes by providing a systematic overview of how, why, when {{and to what extent}} specific ALMPs are effective.|$|R

The spillover effect can enhance the <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> the regulated facility-based firm to make upgrades if access prices are not regulated.
