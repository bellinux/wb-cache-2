60|$|Suddenly, in {{the fading}} light, she flung <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> {{pressing}} me tightly, desperately.|$|E
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> {{so tight}} as almost to hurt me. And thus we {{remained}} until again I must have fallen asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't cry, dearie," [...] {{said the}} young lady in a very {{different}} voice from the one she had used before. She sat down beside me and put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "We'll take you over to Marsden if you've got off at the wrong station." ...|$|E
5000|$|I often wonder {{just how}} mother really feels about me. God knows I love her {{as my own}} {{and try to do}} just what she wants but so often little things meet with such discouragement that I hate to try again. I know I'm not the model {{daughter}} but when I kind of look around, I don't see any other daughters (real daughters, too) do what I try to do for Mother. Just little things mothers usually appreciate. Gee, how good it would feel to have Mother put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> or give me a little kiss! â€¦But I guess we are just too different.-April 18, 1935 ...|$|R
6000|$|Emily met me {{in tears}} in the passage. [...] "Harold! Harold!" [...] she cried, flinging <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> wildly <b>around</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Oh, my darling! my darling! how can I ever {{say it to}} you? Mamma says she won't allow me to see you here any longer." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{with advice}} and {{guidance}} both for {{this world and}} the next did my mother, with <b>her</b> soft, warm <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> prepare me for the great step which lay before me.|$|R
60|$|It {{goes without}} saying that the door was opened very {{suddenly}} when I whispered my name, and on feeling <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> I was so heartened that it seemed as if I could successfully encounter any ordinary number of Tories or red-coats who might seek to make me prisoner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Harold!" [...] Emily cried, flinging <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> wildly, [...] "it's all {{my fault}}! It's my fault only! By my foolish stupidity I've lost your case. I've sent you to prison. Oh, Harold, I can never forgive myself. I've sent you to prison. I've sent you to prison." ...|$|E
60|$|We didn't die, {{and next}} morning we went right back the way we'd come. And little Albert got awful heavy. Doctor Wilson was mad as could be, and said I was the worst feeb in the institution, along with Joe and Charley. But Miss Striker, who was a nurse in the {{drooling}} ward then, just put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and cried, she was that happy I'd got back. I thought right there that mebbe I'd marry her. But only a month afterward she got married to the plumber that came up from the city to fix the gutter-pipes of the new hospital. And little Albert never twisted his eye for two days, it was that tired.|$|E
60|$|All that day, in {{the teeth}} of a keen winter wind, I hugged myself in my plaid, and it was as though <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> were flung <b>around</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I stooped down, and <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> were {{suddenly}} <b>around</b> <b>me</b> like a vise. She clung {{to me with}} her whole body, and held me so that I could scarcely breathe.|$|R
60|$|I {{dropped my}} arm for a moment, {{and a moment}} only. Again the knife was raised, and Wolf Larsen would have surely died had she not stepped between. <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> were <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> <b>her</b> hair was {{brushing}} my face. My pulse rushed up in an unwonted manner, yet my rage mounted with it. She looked me bravely in the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{said very}} little, {{and that was}} one of the strangest things about her. But she sat and stared and stared and stared at me, as if I were some sort of curiosity on exhibition, and did not answer {{anything}} I said to her. I was awfully nervous, though I knew from the few words she had said that she was not angry with me; but she kept on staring and staring and staring, and then she suddenly leaned forward and put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and kissed me. Then she sat back in her chair again, slapped her two hands upon her knees, and said, speaking to herself, 'It shall be done. I am a fool to have a doubt about it.' And then she went without another word. Now was not that simply amazing? Did she come here, and did she act in that way?" ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{arrived at}} the Clarence Basin, Liverpool, (the dock Clarence Mangan had his first name from) {{on my way to}} Sligo for my {{holidays}} I was among Sligo people. When I was a little boy, an old woman who had come to Liverpool with crates of fowl, made me miserable by throwing <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> the moment I had alighted from my cab and telling the sailor who carried my luggage that she had held me in her arms when I was a baby. The sailor may have known me almost as well, for I was often at Sligo quay to sail my boat; and I came and went once or twice in every year upon the ss. Sligo or the ss. Liverpool which belonged to a company that had for directors my grandfather and his partner William Middleton. I was always pleased if it was the Liverpool, for she had been built to run the blockade during the war of North and South.|$|E

5000|$|... "When {{they told}} me I was playing her daughter, I was like, 'What? Daughter? Me?' I {{remember}} on my first day when I walked into the rehearsal hall, Susan and Michael were rehearsing a scene," [...] said Gellar. [...] "I was very nervous. I kept thinking, 'What if I'm really bad and they fire me?' I just snuck {{in the back and}} tried to blend in with the coffee machine, when all of a sudden, Susan said, 'Hold it, we need to stop for a minute.'" [...] Gellar said that Lucci walked over to her and said, [...] "Congratulations! I'm very glad you're here" [...] and hugged her. [...] "She put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Don't worry, nobody bites.' And then she introduced me to everyone who was there. She really did help me and always made sure I was okay during my first couple of weeks when I was still unsettled. Both Susan and Michael made me feel comfortable," [...] Gellar stated.|$|R
6000|$|And then I mounted and she bound me [...] With <b>her</b> triumphing <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>me,</b> [...] And {{whispering}} to herself enwound me; [...] But when the horse had felt my weight, [...] He shook himself and neighed three times: [...] Caolte, Conan, and Finn came near, [...] And wept, and raised their lamenting hands, [...] And bid me stay, with many a tear; [...] But we rode {{out from the}} human lands.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Seymour {{described}} {{writing for}} Human Frailty: I {{was in a}} relationship with a woman I was very much in love with and she was the inspiration. I wrote virtually all the lyrics on Human Frailty about my relationship with <b>her</b> ... Throw Your <b>Arms</b> <b>Around</b> <b>Me</b> was the first song I wrote that wasn't angry. And because it was so out of the square, we didn't record it particularly well. ...One time, we played it at The Palace, to about 2000 people who just went off. We finally got it right, so we recorded it again. I think we did about four versions of it. Mark Seymour ...|$|R
