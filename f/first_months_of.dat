5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the Black Hawk War.

5|$|Egyptian field commanders {{complained of}} a total lack of {{topographical}} maps causing a real problem in the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the war. Commanders had difficulty planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates. Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation. Chief of Egyptian Intelligence, Salah Nasr, admitted that information on Yemen was nonexistent. Egypt had not had an embassy in Yemen since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen, all he provided was an economic report on the country.|$|E

5|$|Over the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War Norwegian {{neutrality}} was violated {{repeatedly in}} the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality. Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for the counterattack {{were made}} during the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1944. As {{the bulk of the}} 17th Army was {{stationed}} in northern and southern Bougainville, engineers needed to develop roads and bridges to allow the troops to move to the hills inland from the American perimeter. All of the units selected for the offensive had departed their bases by mid-February, and advanced along the eastern and western coasts of the island. Barges also moved artillery and other equipment to a point east of Cape Torokina; the guns and supplies were then carried overland into the hills. Only two weeks' worth of rations were assembled, however.|$|E
