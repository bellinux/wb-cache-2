5|$|Roland Morris was an {{experienced}} instructor {{with more than}} 2,000 hours. He was critical of Finucane's habit of trying to force the aircraft to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> instead of coaxing it. Despite a series of blunders, Finucane wanted to fly solo. At that time Finucane was five hours flight training behind {{the rest of his}} group, but he made a successful solo trip on 21 September after the completion of 14:05 hours piloting. The flight was not without fault; Finucane nearly stalled the aircraft after taking off.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Motown sales {{executive}} Barney Ales, Harry Balk got the song released to record stores, sending 100,000 copies of the song without Gordy's knowledge, on January 17, 1971, with another 100,000 copies sent after that success. Upon its release, the song became a hit and was Motown's fastest-selling single at the time, peaking at number 1 on the Hot Soul Singles Chart, and peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Gordy {{was stunned by the}} news and drove to Gaye's home to discuss him making a complete album, stating Gaye could <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> with his music if he finished the record within 30 days before the end of March and thus effectively giving him the right to produce his own albums. Gaye returned to Hitsville to record the rest of What's Going On, which took a mere ten business days between March 1 and March 10. The album's rhythm tracks and sound overdubs were recorded at Hitsville, or Studio A, while the strings, horns, lead and background vocals were recorded at Golden World, or Studio B.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop, the first image {{that came to}} him was of Spike. Prior to that, Watanabe had the {{character}} of Spike in mind {{for a long time}} beforehand. From that point on, Watanabe [...] "tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool." [...] Watanabe created Spike as a mirror image of himself: in Watanabe's words, [...] "I don't smoke or drink or fight, but I want to – so Spike does." [...] Spike forms the main focus on the series, with the central theme being his past and its karmic effect on him. Spike was portrayed as a [...] "typical old-style Japanese man", who would simply <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> and expect others to follow his lead and watch him from the sidelines. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it. In order to portray him as cool, Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look [...] "uncool": when he stands still, he has a hunched appearance. This meant that when the character was moving vigorously, he came across as [...] "extra cool". Spike's appearance was primarily based on the main protagonist of Tantei Monogatari, portrayed by famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda. Although Yamadera was a fan of Matsuda's, he avoided imitating his distinctive manner of speaking, noting that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded right" [...] for Spike. Spike's Swordfish II spaceship was created by mecha designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo-bomber Fairey Swordfish, which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber. The conclusion of Spike's story and his final battle with Vicious were planned by Watanabe well in advance, with each episode featuring them meant to shadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of the lawsuit, the Move fired Secunda and hired Don Arden, who had himself recently been fired as manager of the Small Faces. In a 2000 interview, Wayne noted that there had always been a major split within the group about Secunda's tactics: [...] " [...] had the animals who would <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to do in Trevor, Ace, and me — the fiery part of the stage act.

60|$|He let {{a couple}} of ropes run out through the {{clattering}} blocks, and the sloop, slanting over a little farther, seemed to leap forward. The sparkling green ridges which came tumbling up {{on one side of}} her swung her aloft with the foam boiling along the edge of her lee deck, and then surged away in turn and let her drop while another came rolling up. Instead of being a mere thing of wood and canvas she seemed to become animate, charged with vitality. The springy way she rushed along was strangely exhilarating. Frank became fascinated watching her bows go up and the snowy, straining sail sweep across the dazzling blue at every lurch, while he became conscious of a sense of control and mastery as he gripped the tiller. He felt that he could <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> with this wonderful rushing thing.|$|E

60|$|Verena {{spoke to}} the others, but {{she looked at her}} lover, and the {{expression}} of her eyes was ineffably touching and beseeching. She trembled with nervous passion, there were sobs and supplications in her voice, and Ransom felt himself flushing with pure pity for her pain--her inevitable agony. But at the same moment he had another perception, which brushed aside remorse; he saw that he could <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> that she begged him, with all her being, to spare her, but that so long as he should protest she was submissive, helpless. What he wanted, in this light, flamed before him and challenged all his manhood, tossing his determination to a height from which not only Doctor Tarrant, and Mr. Filer, and Olive, over there, in her sightless, soundless shame, but the great expectant hall as well, and the mighty multitude, in suspense, keeping quiet from minute to minute and holding the breath of its anger--from which all these things looked small, surmountable, and of the moment only. He didn't quite understand, as yet, however; he saw that Verena had not refused, but temporised, that the spell upon her--thanks to which he should still be able to rescue her--had been the knowledge that he was near.|$|E
6000|$|... "A friend?--do {{you mean}} Mr. Burrage?" [...] And Ransom {{stood looking at}} her with his {{extraordinary}} eyes. [...] "Of course, I haven't a vehicle to drive you in; but we can sit on a bench and talk." [...] She didn't say it was Mr. Burrage, but {{she was unable to}} say it was not, and something in her face showed him that he had guessed. So he went on: [...] "Is it only with him you can go out? Won't he like it, and may you only do what he likes? Mrs. Luna told me he wants to marry you, and I saw at his mother's how he stuck to you. If you are going to marry him, you can drive with him every day in the year, and that's just a reason for your giving me an hour or two now, before it becomes impossible." [...] He didn't mind much what he said--it had been his plan not to mind much to-day--and so long as he made her <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> he didn't care much how he did it. But he saw that his words brought the colour to her face; she stared, surprised at his freedom and familiarity. He went on, dropping the hardness, the irony of which he was conscious, out of his tone. [...] "I know it's no business of mine whom you marry, or even whom you drive with, and I beg your pardon if I seem indiscreet and obtrusive; but I would give anything just to detach you a little from your ties, your belongings, and feel for an hour or two, as if--as if----" [...] And he paused.|$|E
6000|$|It is in {{the light}} of this Idea, the ideal of Coleridge's later life, that we must judge Coleridge and weigh him. To {{continue}} to see in opium the sole or even the principal cause of his failure, is to misjudge him altogether. To compare him with others of different powers who accomplished more in one direction in the matter of literary output, with Sir Walter Scott or Byron, for instance, is misleading. It is the man of profound genius, who in his own time, is feeling on all sides into the Future, who is least likely to give forth [...] "finished productions," [...] as they are called, in which the subjects of which they treat are often exhausted, and please the ear of the Present. Coleridge is such a man of genius; nearly all his works are fragmentary, unfinished, suggestive rather than [...] "complete," [...] just because they verge upon that Transcendentalism which {{he was the first to}} make audible to English ears in his day. Ill health, and opium in conjunction with ill health, contributed no doubt to enfeeble his utterance; but to assert that opium was the cause or the main cause of Coleridge's inability to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> himself to do, or what his friends and contemporaries expected him to do, is a gross perversion of the facts of the case. Coleridge's inability arose from his multiplicity of motive, his visionary faculty of seeing {{in the light of}} a new principle a host of problems rise up on all sides, all claiming recognition and solution. [...] "That is the disease of my mind--it is comprehensive in its conceptions, and wastes itself in the contemplations of the many things which it might do." [...] (Letter to Poole, 4th January 1799, [...] "Letters", p. 270). A greater than Coleridge had felt this tendency before him, and created as its embodiment [...] "Hamlet"; and Coleridge has been called the Hamlet of literature.|$|E
