5|$|On October 14, 1979, between 75,000 and 125,000 people {{marched on}} Washington for gay rights. Many carried portraits of Milk, and {{placards}} honoring his legacy. The rally, something that Milk {{had intended to}} organize, was <b>instead</b> <b>a</b> tribute to his life.|$|E
5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is <b>instead</b> <b>a</b> collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century Camber Castle and the {{surrounding}} farmland remained in private ownership and open to visitors. In the 1931 there was a proposal to turn the keep into a golf clubhouse but the project was not taken forward and the facility was built at the nearby Castle Farm <b>instead.</b> <b>A</b> research team from the Victoria County History project visited the castle in 1935, resulting in the first – albeit cursory – historical analysis and survey of the fortification being published two years later.|$|E

5|$|Club Europe is the short-haul {{business}} class on all short-haul flights. This class allows {{for access to}} business lounges at most airports. Club Europe provides seats in a 2–2 configuration on narrowbody aircraft, with the middle seat not used. <b>Instead,</b> <b>a</b> table folds up from under the middle seat on refurbished aircraft. Pillows and blankets are available on longer flights.|$|E
5|$|Cosme was {{initially}} forecast to pass over Hawaii at tropical storm strength. <b>Instead,</b> <b>a</b> strong ridge of high pressure kept the system well {{south of the}} island. Outer rainbands produced several inches of rainfall, leading to minor flooding while simultaneously alleviating drought conditions. Winds gusts briefly reached tropical storm strength, though no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the weight}} had {{increased}} from 149 to 170 tonnes; to reduce this to 158 tonnes, {{the original idea}} of step-free access was discontinued. <b>Instead,</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair lift was installed, but it proved not to work. The area around the doors are step-free from the platform, but within the trains steps {{must be taken to}} reach the seating area. The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People have criticized Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for the disabled.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. The relationship was further strained because Eleanor desperately wanted {{to go with her}} husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna <b>instead.</b> <b>A</b> few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna took care of her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group {{designed}} the park. Having designed landscape along Chinatown's Cermak Avenue, Wong {{was familiar with}} the community and invited the public to voice their opinions and ideas for the future park. The park's original design called for walled plazas inspired by traditional Chinese gardens in Suzhou, China. This design was scrapped, however, because of security and vandalism concerns. <b>Instead,</b> <b>a</b> system of pathways was created to link defined spaces and mimic courtyards.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} clear hostility of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Wallachian revolutionaries sought <b>instead</b> <b>a</b> {{rapprochement}} with the Ottoman leadership. Efforts {{were made to}} clarify that the movement did not seek to reject Ottoman suzerainty: for this purpose, Ion Ghica was sent to Istanbul as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led Sultan Abdülmecid I to reconsider his position, especially after being faced with Russian protests. Süleyman Pașa, Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to Bucharest with orders {{to report on the}} situation and take appropriate measures.|$|E

5|$|Freamon and Leander Sydnor gather enough {{evidence}} to arrest Stanfield {{and most of his}} top lieutenants, seizing a large quantity of drugs. Stanfield suspects that Michael is an informant, and orders him killed. Michael realizes he is being set up and kills Snoop <b>instead.</b> <b>A</b> wanted man, he leaves Bug with an aunt and begins a career as a stick-up man. With his support system gone, Dukie lives with drug addicts.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} the three were {{grounded}} on July 14, Strindberg's highly specialized cartographic camera, which {{had been brought to}} map the region from the air, became <b>instead</b> <b>a</b> means of recording daily life in the icescape and the constant danger and drudgery of the trek. Strindberg took about 200 photos with his seven-kilogram (15lb) camera {{over the course of the}} three months they spent on the pack ice, one of the most famous being his picture of Andrée and Frænkel contemplating the fallen Eagle (see image above).|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} to keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but <b>instead</b> <b>a</b> collection of fun experiences.|$|E

5|$|Hatchlings were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; <b>instead,</b> <b>a</b> grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white eye rings) to just below the ears.|$|E
5|$|Historians like Milcíades Peña {{consider}} this historical {{period of the}} Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets. Rodolfo Puiggrós consider it <b>instead</b> <b>a</b> feudalist society, based on work relations such as the encomienda or the slavery. Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but an hybrid system result of {{the interaction of the}} Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, still living in the prehistory.|$|E
5|$|Holographic weapon sights {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected reticle system. <b>Instead,</b> <b>a</b> representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, {{there was}} {{discussion}} of a rapid transit extension from Kennedy to Scarborough City Centre. As multiple types of technologies were examined many politicians requested a subway extension instead of the then proposed streetcar line. <b>Instead,</b> <b>a</b> medium-capacity rail transport system, known as the Scarborough RT was built.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great Dark Spot on the planet. <b>Instead,</b> <b>a</b> new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|In May 1921 {{the policy}} of the Canadian {{government}} towards Arctic expeditions changed with the advent of a new Prime Minister, Arthur Meighen, who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal. Shackleton was required to rethink his plans, and decided to sail for the Antarctic <b>instead.</b> <b>A</b> varied programme of exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in southern waters would replace the abandond Beaufort Sea venture.|$|E
