Although Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell {{insisted that they}} had made the film as partners, the studio refused — because of the already {{ballooning}} costs — to pay for Campbell to stay in Los Angeles during post-production (although the executives later compromised). The studio replaced Raimi's music composer, Joseph LoDuca, with {{one of its own}} choosing. It <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> the editor, removing Raimi's influence over the film's final cut.|$|E

Malkoč told the Bosnian enlisted men of 1st Company that they were being deceived, released the German NCOs and rallied the company to hunt down the ringleaders. Schweiger <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> 2nd Company. Dizdarević and Džanić were shot and killed during the fighting, and Vukelić was captured, while Jelinek escaped.|$|E
5|$|These crowns {{continue}} {{a history of}} monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization. Both tribal and more complex pre-Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure, while others <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current European monarchies that spread their reach across the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century.|$|E

5|$|Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist {{approach}} {{believe that}} the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, {{it can lead to}} the adoption of racist attitudes toward those of non-Northern European ancestry. Anti-racist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups, and that in Norse mythology the Æsir also <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> Vanir, Jötun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of its white members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>with</b> Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E
