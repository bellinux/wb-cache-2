5|$|It has {{a unique}} method of {{capturing}} tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs {{to a higher level}} and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and eats it.|$|E
5|$|Rigorous {{attempts}} to warn of tornadoes {{began in the}} United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, {{with the advent of}} weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E

25|$|Drop kick: Kicking a ball after {{bouncing}} <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Although {{rarely used}} today, {{it has the}} same status in scoring as a place kick. This play is part of the game's rugby heritage, and was largely made obsolete when the ball with pointed ends was adopted. Unlike the American game, Canadian rules allow a drop kick to be attempted at any time by any player, but the move is very rare.|$|E

25|$|However, {{notwithstanding}} the grant of original jurisdiction, the Court has, through the years, assigned to lower courts {{such as the}} Court of Appeals the power to hear petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto and habeas corpus. As a result, the Court has considerable discretion to refuse to hear these petitions filed directly before <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> that such should have been filed instead with the Court of Appeals or the appropriate lower court. Nonetheless, cases that have attracted wide public interest or for which a speedy resolution {{is of the essence}} have been accepted for decision by the Supreme Court without hesitation.|$|E
25|$|Tamboo-bamboo bands {{consist of}} three {{different}} instruments (each cut from bamboo): boom, foulé, and cutter. The boom serves as the bass instrument, is usually about five feet long, and is played by stamping <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The foulé, a higher-pitched instrument, consists of two pieces of bamboo, each about a foot long, and is played by striking these pieces end to end. The cutter, the highest-pitched instrument in the ensemble, is made from a thinner piece of bamboo (of varying length) and is struck with a stick. These three types of instruments combined to beat out rhythms that accompanied the chantwells and were a staple of carnival celebrations for many years. They were gradually rendered obsolete by the steel band.|$|E

25|$|Weapons {{are linked}} to several superstitions and {{cultural}} beliefs in South Asia. Drawing a weapon without reason is forbidden and considered by Hindus to be disrespectful to the goddess Chandika. Thus the saying that a sword cannot be sheathed until it has drawn blood. It was a mother's duty to tie a warrior's sword around his waist before war or a duel. In addition, she would cut her finger with the sword and make a tilak on his head from a drop of her blood. Weapons themselves were also anointed with tilak, most often from the blood of a freshly-decapitated goat (chatanga). Other taboos include looking at one's reflection in the blade, telling the price or source of acquisition, throwing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or using it for domestic purposes.|$|E
25|$|Chicks hatch {{synchronously}} with a dense downy coat. The coloring is white, grey or yellow, {{with dark}} spots {{to aid in}} camouflage. The young are precocial, and can run {{almost as soon as}} they hatch. Soon after hatching the eggs, the male will leave the nest and call the chicks to him with a soft contact call. If threatened, he will freeze and attempt to hide the chicks under his wings or belly. There have been documented cases of females caring for the young; it is thought that this occurs when the male has been killed. Young chicks can feed themselves within the first few days, but the male will bring the food and drop <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in front of them. The chicks have a high initial mortality rate. However, within a few days they are chasing insects on their own and, at 1–3 weeks, they can fly to branches a metre from the ground. They are self-sufficient within 20 days.|$|E
25|$|A player may tackle an {{opposing}} {{player who has}} the ball by bringing them to ground. Once tackled, a player must immediately release the ball, either by passing to a teammate or placing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and the tackler must release them and move away. After the ball has been released by a tackled player, players from either side may try to regain possession of the ball. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds), and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being {{referred to as a}} tap-tackle or ankle-tap). Tackles that involve lifting a player and then forcing or dropping them to the ground head first (called a tip tackle or spear tackle) have been deemed particularly dangerous. A player performing this sort of tackle would typically be sent-off.|$|E
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 19th century, nation-states {{commonly}} divided themselves between those granting nationality <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of jus soli (France, for example) and those granting <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of jus sanguinis (Germany, for example, before 1990). However, since 2007 the European migrant crisis has focused attention on these two conflicting sources of nationality rights.|$|R

25|$|During general play, players may {{position}} themselves {{anywhere on the}} field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are kicking, handballing and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently bounce or touch <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball. A distinctive feature of the game is the mark, where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded possession. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid. Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents. Dangerous physical contact (such as pushing an opponent in the back), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches, depending on the seriousness of the infringement. The game features frequent physical contests, spectacular marking, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring.|$|E
25|$|The Northern {{boundary}} between the British and French mandates was defined in broad terms by the Franco-British Boundary Agreement of December 1920. That agreement placed {{the bulk of the}} Golan Heights in the French sphere. The treaty also established a joint commission to settle the precise border and mark <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The commission submitted its final report on 3 February 1922, and it was approved with some caveats by the British and French governments on 7 March 1923, several months before Britain and France assumed their Mandatory responsibilities on 29 September 1923. Under the treaty, Syrian and Lebanese residents would have the same fishing and navigation rights on Lake Hula, Lake Tiberias, and the Jordan River as citizens of the Palestine Mandate, but the government of Palestine would be responsible for policing of the lakes. The Zionist movement pressured the French and British to include as much water sources as possible to Palestine during the demarcating negotiations. These constant demands influenced the negotiators and finally led to the inclusion of the whole Sea of Galilee, both sides of the Jordan river, Lake Hula, Dan spring, and part of the Yarmouk. The High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, had demanded full control of the Sea of Galilee. The new border followed a 10-meter wide strip along the northeastern shore.|$|E
25|$|Great Britain {{accepted}} a Mandate for Palestine {{at the meeting}} of the Allied Supreme Council at San Remo, but the borders of the territory were not defined at that stage. The boundary between the forthcoming British and French mandates was defined in broad terms by the Franco-British Boundary Agreement of December 1920. That agreement placed the bulk of the Golan Heights in the French sphere. The treaty also established a joint commission to settle the precise details of the border and mark <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The commission submitted its final report on 3 February 1922, and it was approved with some caveats by the British and French governments on 7 March 1923, several months before Britain and France assumed their Mandatory responsibilities on 29 September 1923. In accordance with the same process, a nearby parcel of land that included the ancient site of Tel Dan and the Dan spring were transferred from Syria to Palestine early in 1924. The Golan Heights, including the spring at Wazzani and the one at Banias, thus became part of the French Mandate of Syria, while the Sea of Galilee was placed entirely within the British Mandate of Palestine. When the French Mandate of Syria ended in 1944, the Golan Heights became part of the newly independent state of Syria and was later incorporated into Quneitra Governorate.|$|E
