40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of an Image Processing (IP) application is a complex activity, which can be greatly alleviated by user-friendly graphical programming environments. Our major objective is to help IP experts reuse parts of their applications. A first work towards knowledge reuse has been to propose a suitable representation of the strategies of IP experts by means of IP plans (trees of tasks, methods and tools). This paper describes the CBR module of our interactive system for the {{development of}} IP plans. After a brief presentation of the overall architecture of the system and its other modules, we explain the distinction between an IP case and an IP plan, and give the selection criteria and functions that are used for similarity calculation. The core of the CBR module is a search/adaptation algorithm, whose main steps are detailed: retrieval of suitable cases, recursive adaptation of the selected one and memorization of new cases. The system's implementation is presently completed; its functioning is described in a session showing the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>provided</b> by the CBR module during {{the development of a new}} IP application...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} which <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> users {{need to run}} a VCR a {{study was}} carried out in which operating tasks were supported by providing either printed operation instructions or a human expert as support. The study was conducted as a computer simulation so that logfiles could show the number of actions and time needed to fulfill the tasks. The results show that human assistance leeds to a shorter way of solving the task but does not support the learning process better than the text. Subjects who used the operation instructions needed more time to solve the problem but could solve the posttest task as fast as the subjects beforehand supported by a human expert. The human experts were not instructed concerning the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> they <b>provided.</b> Thus it was possible to posthoc analyse the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> the experts <b>provided</b> and compare the effects <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> on the subjects' performances. Those subjects who had an active assistance with gestures additional to explanations performed significantly better than those with passive assistance and explanations only. ...|$|R

40|$|How much {{instructional}} <b>assistance</b> to <b>provide</b> {{to students}} as they learn, and what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> to <b>provide,</b> is a much-debated problem in research on learning and instruction. This study presents two multi-session classroom experiments {{in the domain of}} chemistry, comparing the effectiveness and efficiency of three high-assistance (worked examples, tutored problems, and erroneous examples) and one low-assistance (untutored problem solving) instructional approach, with error feedback consisting of either elaborate worked examples (Experiment 1) or basic correctness feedback (Experiment 2). Neither experiment showed differences in learning outcomes among conditions, but both showed clear efficiency benefits of worked example study: equal levels of test performance were achieved with significantly less investment of time and effort during learning. Interestingly for both theory and practice, the time efficiency benefit was substantial: worked example study required 46 – 68 % less time in Experiment 1 and 48 – 69 % in Experiment 2 than the other instructional approaches...|$|R
40|$|As {{the role}} of teams becomes more {{important}} in organizations, developing and maintaining high performance teams has been the goal of several researchers (Decker, Sycara, & Williamson 1997; Beyerlein, Johnson, & Beyerlein, 2001, Cannon-Bowers & Salas, 1998; McNeese, Salas & Endsley, 2001; Salas, Bowers, & Edens, 2001). One major {{question is how to}} turn a team of experts into an expert team. Several strategies such as task-related cross training (Salas, Cannon-Bowers, & Johnson, 1997; CannonBowers and Salas, 1998) have emerged. In addition to traditional behaviorally-based methods for facilitating team development, advances in computer science and robotics are now allowing the introduction of artificial intelligence (sic; intelligent agents) into teamwork in a variety of roles and functions. This advent of agent technologies raises two questions: 1) what <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> can be <b>provided</b> and 2) what <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> prove beneficial.

40|$|Women {{entrepreneurship}} is a {{force to}} be reckoned with. Women in business are commonly found all over the country and they help to create vibrant economic activities in domestic arena. This study focuses on the characteristics of 50 women entrepreneurs in the state of Penang, Malaysia. Among others, we find that many of them are stay-at-home married women with children. Therefore, they have to juggle and find balance between family life and their business. It is interesting to note that 84 percent come from families with entrepreneurial experiences. Therefore, it is fair to say that this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> exposure has cultivated interest among these women to become entrepreneurs themselves. Further, family support has been one of the important factors that encourage these women to venture into businesses. However, despite their involvement in business, 50 percent of our respondents have not attended any training and courses on entrepreneurship. It seems that they rely more on advices from family members on issues related to their business compared to formal or government institutions. This is probably due to their reliance on personal savings and family sources of capital in embarking into the businesses such that institutional involvement is minimal in charting the direction of their businesses though they are aware <b>of</b> various <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>assistance</b> <b>provided</b> by the government. Hence, even in a smaller scale, women entrepreneurs are increasingly creating wealth for the nation while simultaneously caring for their families...|$|R
40|$|When the Western {{countries}} confronted backlash {{in their}} promotion of democracy, they wooed India {{to join them}}. India has shown reluctance to join them due to various factors. It starts with discussion of how it was inconceivable for India to promote democracy during the Cold War and then examine factors that made India reticent to commit itself to democracy promotion in the post-Cold War. The paper discusses the reasons as to why a nuanced shift towards supporting democracy promotion {{has taken place in}} the turn of the Century and how this shift is made with the intention of making a difference through participation rather than openly protesting and standing aloof on principle ground. The main focus of the paper is to highlight how India <b>provides</b> democracy <b>assistance</b> differently from that of the Western countries and what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> tangible <b>assistances</b> India <b>provided</b> to those who sought. It highlights how, keeping in view the sensitivity of sovereignty among the developing countries, India uses term such as â€˜democracy assistanceâ€™ or â€˜democracy supportâ€™ instead of â€˜democracy promotionâ€™ and how it adopts policy <b>of</b> <b>providing</b> democracy <b>assistance</b> only when requested and it follows top-down approach, dealing mainly with the sovereign states and their institutions. It ends with an emphasis on the value addition of having diverse approaches to spreading democracy.

The selection from the pool munificence of candidate companies is done taking into consideration four characteristics: managerial characteristics, market characteristics, product characteristics and financial characteristics. It means candidate companies need to be evaluated in the light of these characteristics. Monitoring and business assistance intensity is also another value-addition activity or service offered by an incubator. As defined by Hackett and Dilts, monitoring and business assistance intensity is {{the degree to which the}} incubator observes and helps incubatees with the development of their ventures including helping them to learn from low-cost failures and containing the cost of potential failure. This is achieved through time intensity <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>provided,</b> comprehensiveness <b>of</b> the <b>assistance</b> <b>provided</b> and the quality <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>provided.</b> The last value addition services of the Hackett and Dilts model is what they call resource munificence which they define as the relative abundance of incubator resources, measured by the following: resource availability, resource equality and resource utilization.|$|R
