40|$|Due to {{its wide}} use in personal, but most importantly, {{professional}} contexts, email represents a valuable {{source of information}} that can be harvested for understanding, reengineering and repurposing undocumented business processes of companies and institutions. Towards this aim, a few researchers investigated the problem of extracting process oriented information from <b>email</b> <b>logs</b> in order to take benefit of the many available process mining techniques and tools. In this paper we go further in this direction, by proposing a new method for mining process models from <b>email</b> <b>logs</b> that leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques with little human involvement. Moreover, our method allows to semi-automatically label emails with activity names, {{that can be used for}} activity recognition in new incoming emails. A use case demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed solution using a modest in size, yet real-world, dataset containing emails that belong to two different process models.

40|$|In {{this age}} of social networking, it is {{necessary}} to define the relationships among the members of a social network. Various techniques are already available to define user- to-user relationships across the network. Over time, many algorithms and machine learning techniques were applied to find relationships over social networks, yet very few techniques and information are available to define a relation directly over raw email data. Few educational societies have developed a way to mine the <b>email</b> <b>log</b> files and have found the inter-relation between the users by means of clusters. Again, there is no solid technique available that can accurately predict the ranking of each user within an organization by mining through their email transaction logs. The author in this report presents a technique to mine the email data log files in order to figure out the position wise structure of an organization. The author also discusses send-receive analysis, statistical analysis, semantic analysis and temporal analysis over the data, and has applied them to test cases. Throughout the research the author has used the Enron employees <b>email</b> <b>log</b> files, which was made public on 2001...|$|E

Combining those movies with measures of social network analysis such as the change over time in group betweeness centrality (GBC) and group density leads to deep insights into organizational dynamics. In addition we have defined a contribution index, which measures the activity of an individual as a sender and receiver of messages relative to a team. Based on these findings we can make predictions on the productivity of teams and suggest interventions for improved performance...|$|E

One of three sets of experiments showed that results produced by extended algorithms were better than one of the reference algorithms, in other words more nodes were classified correctly.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} STAMP: a tool {{to analyse}} SMTP servers overlay topology. STAMP builds a weighted and oriented graph from an email database, an <b>email</b> <b>log</b> or just a simple email header allowing a post-analysis of the SMTP overlay structure and {{the identification of the}} paths used by an email. The objective of this tool is twofold. STAMP allows to automatically perform an analysis of the SMTP topology for debugging (e. g, message delay, emails loop, [...] .) and for metrology purposes. While several traceroute-like measurements projects try to map the Internet, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no tool allows to drive an analysis of the SMTP overlay network. Thus, the goal of the resulting graph is to develop methods (from graph theory, statistical analysis, [...] .) to identify relaying problems. We aim to explore the impact of IP network problems over emails delivery (and respectively: emails’ traffic over IP networks) in conjunction with IP measurements driven synchronously. In the present paper, we introduce the design and the measurement methodology of the STAMP software and as second contribution, bring out to the networking community the tool and some measurements databases...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s, the Dutch {{equivalent}} for “heritage,” erfgoed, {{has become}} a buzzword in the Netherlands. Often presented as a neologism, little {{attention is paid to}} the term’s longer history. Th is article traces the history through a survey of digitized newspapers from 1700 to 1975, revealing elements of erfgoed’s current meaning well before the twentieth-century heritage mania. In the eighteenth century a synonym of “freedom,” in the latter nineteenth century frequently carrying the prefix nationaal, and in the 1930 s associated with genetics and folk culture, erfgoed can be regarded as a speculum vitae, taking on different meanings depending on the era. As elsewhere in Europe, {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century was the most decisive moment in the evolution of the term.  Show Less Contributions to the History of Concepts Contributions to the History of Concepts Print ISSN: 18079326 Online ISSN: 1874656 X  eTOC Alerts Get Latest Issue TOC RSS  Journal Table of Contents Access brought to you by: Universiteit Van Amsterdam Universiteit Van Amsterdam Customer Support <b>Email</b> <b>Log</b> out © 2017 Berghahn Books Powered by PubFactory  Sign in to annotat...|$|E

Within the framework of CARE, each domain independently builds its reputation database based on both the local email history and the information exchanged with other collaborating domains.

To validate the efficacy of CARE, we have analyzed real <b>email</b> <b>logs,</b> conducted a DNS-based estimation experiment, and performed a series of simulations.

We test our algorithm on predicting patterns in <b>email</b> <b>logs,</b> correlations between stock closing prices, and social grouping in herds of Plains zebra.

40|$|Of {{the major}} factors {{affecting}} end-to-end service availability, network component failure {{is perhaps the}} least well understood. How often do failures occur, how long do they last, what are their causes, {{and how do they}} impact customers? Traditionally, answering questions such as these has required dedicated (and often expensive) instrumentation broadly deployed across a network. We propose an alternative approach: opportunistically mining “low-quality ” data sources that are already available in modern network environments. We describe a methodology for recreating a succinct history of failure events in an IP network using a combination of structured data (router configurations and syslogs) and semi-structured data (<b>email</b> <b>logs).</b> Using this technique we analyze over five years of failure events in a large regional network consisting of over 200 routers; to our knowledge, this is the largest study of its kind...|$|R

The variability and obfuscation being employed by the spammers to avoid detection at the destination creates distinctive patterns that allow legitimate email traffic to be distinguished from spam at the source. Some relatively simple heuristics result in the detection of low numbers of "false positives" despite tuning to ensure few "false negatives". The system is deployed at a major ISP and has considerably improved the "time-to-fix" for customers who are inadvertently relaying spam and, as a bonus, has proved very effective at detecting a number of recent email virus epidemics...|$|R
