25|$|Denton is {{the county}} seat of Denton County. From 1914 to 1959, the City of Denton used a mayor–city {{commission}} system, but a charter adopted in 1959 created a council–manager form of city government. Residents elect a mayor, four single-member district council members, and two at-large members. The city manager is appointed by the Denton City Council. Council terms are for two years, with a maximum of three consecutive terms, and elections are held each year in May. Utilities are administered by Denton Municipal Utilities; the city provides water, wastewater, <b>electric,</b> <b>drainage</b> and solid waste service. The electric utility, Denton Municipal Electric (DME), has been in operation since 1905. In 2009, DME began providing 40 percent of its energy to customers through renewable resources. The City of Denton Water Utilities Department serves the city's water demand. Atmos Energy provides the city's natural gas.

40|$|It is {{important}} to reveal the relations of physical factors to deposition of contaminants on insulator. In this paper, the simulation model of high voltage end of insulator was established to study the force and motion characteristics of particles affected by <b>electric</b> <b>force</b> and airflow drag force near the ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) insulator. By finite element method, the electric field was set specially {{to be similar to}} the one near practical insulator, the steady fluid field was simulated. The <b>electric</b> <b>force</b> and air drag force were loaded on the uniformly charged particles. The characteristics of the two forces on particles, the relationship between quantity of electric charge on particles and probability of particles contacting the insulator were analyzed. It was found that, near the sheds, airflow drag force on particles is significantly greater than <b>electric</b> <b>force</b> with less <b>electric</b> charge. As the charge multiplies, <b>electric</b> <b>force</b> increases linearly, airflow drag force grows more slowly. There is a trend that the magnitude of <b>electric</b> <b>force</b> and drag force is going to similar. Meanwhile, the probability of particles contacting the insulator is increased too. However, at a certain level of charge which has different value with different airflow velocity, the contact probability has extremum here.
