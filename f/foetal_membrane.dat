5000|$|Courtship {{occurs in}} early spring {{for a period of}} six weeks, during which time males have been {{observed}} to fight. In mating, the male grasps the female’s head with his jaws and mounts her. After an estimated gestation period of 101 to 110 days, females produce large litters of 20 to 30 (largest recorded: 67) live-young in early summer. [...] During birth, the female holds her hind legs close to her body, as when moving through grass, giving single births about every 30 minutes during which she moves around. The young are born curled up in a <b>foetal</b> <b>membrane,</b> which they eat after breaking free. Immediately after birth, the young start flickering their tongues. The tongue and mouth are dark blue and the ventral surface is black in juveniles, changing to pink and mauve respectively after about three months. The young are independent from straight after birth without any parental care and start feeding on slugs and snails. Age at sexual maturity is about 22 months.|$|E
40|$|Preterm {{premature}} rupture of the foetal membranes (früher vorzeitiger Blasensprung) {{has remained}} a devastating complication of pregnancy with very high risk of pregnancy loss. Several methods of sealing spontaneously ruptured membranes to stop amniotic fluid leakage and prolong pregnancy have been tested, but no {{one of them has}} achieved a clinical breakthrough. Also, needle and foetoscopic puncture of membranes for diagnostic or surgical interventions in the amniotic cavity carry a significant risk of persistent membrane leakage and subsequent rupture - thus limiting the developing field of intrauterine foetal surgery. Efforts are concentrated on taking action before rupture rather than reacting after rupture: one avenue of research concerns prophylactic plugging of foetoscopic access sites in foetal membranes at the time of intervention, thus inhibiting leakage and rupture. <b>Foetal</b> <b>membrane</b> injuries, spontaneous or iatrogenic, constitute extreme challenges to repair: thinness of <b>foetal</b> <b>membrane</b> tissue, difficult localisation and accessibility of the rupture site, the need for injectable sealants, wet gluing conditions and poor wound healing in this tissue all complicate repair. The goal is to achieve immediate {{and at the same time}} long-lasting closure of the membrane leak. Here we review approaches to closure of <b>foetal</b> <b>membrane</b> defects with liquid sealants or solid biomaterial scaffolds, with the focus on prophylactic plugging of foetoscopic access sites...|$|E

40|$|The {{disease is}} caused by Brucella abortus and in bovines, occurs in sexually mature animals. The disease {{is also known as}} {{contagious}} abortion or Bang’s disease. Spread of disease occurs primarily by ingestion, skin penetration or udder contamination. B. abortus is usually transmitted by contact with the placenta, fetus, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges from infected animals. Animals are infectious after either abortion or full-term parturition. The organisms may also be found in the milk, urine, semen, feces. Shedding in milk can be prolonged or lifelong, and may be intermittent. Many infected cattle become chronic carriers. Congenital infection may be present in calves. The semen of infected bulls is a good source of infection during artificial insemination. After gaining entry, the organisms are localized in the pregnant uterus, udder, testes, accessory male sex gland and joint capsule to produce symptoms.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} cell proliferation in platelet-enriched collagen plugs with and without addition of amniotic fluid-derived heterologous foetal cells to seal an iatrogenic membrane defect in the foetal rabbit model. METHODS: Amniotic fluid cells were harvested from three donor does at 23 days of gestation (term = 32 days) and labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE). In 42 other does, <b>foetal</b> <b>membrane</b> defects were induced by foetoscopic needle puncture at 23 days of gestation, and closed with either a platelet-enriched collagen plug with (n = 44) or without (n = 32) amniotic fluid cells. At 30 days of gestation, the defects were harvested and assessed microscopically. RESULTS: The plugs enriched with heterologous amniotic fluid cells more commonly had proliferating cells in the centre of the plug than those without cell addition. CFDA-SE labelling confirmed the presence of heterologous amniotic fluid cells over the entire membrane plug. Cell typing showed a mixture of fibroblasts and epithelial cells at the wound edges, whereas in the centre, there was an abundance of fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: When sealing iatrogenic membrane defects in the foetal rabbit model, enrichment of collagen plugs with platelets and amniotic fluid-derived heterologous foetal cells increases local cell proliferation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{derived from}} the amniotic <b>foetal</b> <b>membrane</b> of human term {{placenta}} have drawn particular attention mainly for their plasticity and immunological properties, which render them interesting for stem-cell research and cell-based therapeutic applications. In particular, we have previously demonstrated that amniotic mesenchymal tissue cells (AMTC) inhibit lymphocyte proliferation in vitro and suppress the generation and maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Here, we show that AMTC also significantly reduce the proliferation of cancer cell lines of haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic origin, in both cell-cell contact and transwell co-cultures, therefore suggesting the involvement of yet-unknown inhibitory soluble factor(s) in this 'cell growth restraint'. Importantly, we provide evidence that the anti-proliferative effect of AMTC is associated with induction of cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 phase. Gene expression analyses demonstrate that AMTC can down-regulate cancer cells' mRNA expression of genes associated with cell cycle progression, such as cyclins (cyclin D 2, cyclin E 1, cyclin H) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK 4, CDK 6 and CDK 2), whilst they up-regulate cell cycle negative regulator such as p 15 and p 21, consistent with a block in G 0 /G 1 phase with no progression to S phase. Taken together, these findings warrant further studies to investigate the applicability of these cells for controlling cancer cell proliferation in vivo...|$|E

Bacterial endotoxin induces pro-inflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins and proteases via the pro-inflammatory pathway nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which {{plays a key role in}} initiating uterine contractions and rupture of <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes.</b> In non-gestational tissues, the phytophenols curcumin, naringenin and apigenin exert anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of NF-κB. The aim of this study was to determine whether these treatments regulate pro-inflammatory and pro-labour mediators in human gestational tissues. Placenta, <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and myometrium were treated with curcumin, naringenin and apigenin in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin (IL) - 1 β. In placenta and <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes,</b> all treatments significantly reduced LPS-stimulated release and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 and IL- 8; placenta decreased cyclooxygenase (COX- 2) mRNA expression, subsequent release of prostaglandins PGE 2 and PGF 2 α and expression and activity of matrix-degrading enzyme matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9. In myometrial cells, all treatments attenuated IL- 1 β-induced COX- 2 expression, release of PGE 2 and PGF 2 α and expression and activity of MMP- 9. Although naringenin significantly attenuated IL- 1 β-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 mRNA expression and release, there was no effect of curcumin and apigenin. LPS-stimulated release of 8 -isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, was attenuated by all treatments. NF-κB p 65 DNA-binding activity was also decreased using these treatments. In conclusion, curcumin, naringenin and apigenin exert anti-inflammatory properties in human gestational tissues by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of NF-κB.

40|$|The authors {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} prepartum immunopotentiators administered during late gestation on postpartum fertility, IgG levels and calf viability. Fifty buffalo were divided into five groups (10 animals in each group). Group I was the control group. Each animal in Group II received 30 ml intramuscularly of viteselen (1. 7 mg sodium selenium and 150 mg vitamin E/ml). Each animal in Group III received a subcutaneous injection of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) at 0. 5 ml. In Group IV, each animal received 12. 5 ml of levamisole hydrochloride intramuscularly, while those in Group V received 10 ml of ultra-corn subcutaneously. The immunopotentiators were administered according to each group 60 days prior to the anticipated date of parturition. Postpartum fertility was assessed by close observation and rectal examination after parturition. Colostrum from the dams and sera from the newborn were collected to estimate the level of immunoglobulin (IgG). Body weight, growth rate and viability of the calves were recorded after parturition. Prepartum treatment with viteselen reduced the period of <b>foetal</b> <b>membrane</b> expulsion by 2 h {{compared to the other}} groups. Concomitantly, the uterine involution period was significantly shorter in animals treated with viteselen and ultra-corn than in the other groups. Injection of viteselen, BCG or ultra-corn significantly reduced the calving to the first oestrus interval and length of postpartum service period (by 57, 54, 48 days and 67, 57, 44 days, respectively) than the levamisole group. The IgG level was significantly higher in both the colostrum of the dam and in newborn serum after administration of immunopotentiating agents. Furthermore, the viteselen injection resulted in a significantly higher level of IgG in both dam colostrum (at parturition) and calf serum in comparison to the other groups. The calves from viteselen and ultra-corn treated dams showed a higher growth rate and better health condition than the controls. Prepartum administration of immunopotentiators appears to be beneficial, promising and offer improvements to postpartum reproductive performance and calf viability in Egyptian buffalo. Finally, additional work involving a larger number of animals is suggested...|$|E

In this lecture he expounded his revolutionary {{ideas about the}} origin of the <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and the phylogenetic history of the vertebrates in general. HUBRECHT was of the opinion that in the ancestors of the Mammalia there was only one embryonic membrane, and that has been retained as the the trophoblast. Its original function was to protect the larva, but when, in the early mammals, intra-uterine development was established, this membrane assumed the function of feeding the embryo as we see in our present day mammals. In order to function properly a connection was then established with the embryonic vascular system, this connection became the allantois. According to HUBRECHT the ancestors of the mammals had not the large, yolk-laden eggs as found in reptiles and birds, but they were viviparous animals with small, holoblastic eggs. From such an early viviparous ancestor, the reptiles and birds might have developed as a side branch, when the small vesicular blastocyst accumulated more and more yolk in its yolk-sac, which made it possible for viviparity to be replaced by oviparity.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the histo-morphology of the full-term placenta of African buffalo and to compare placental morphology between African buffalo and cattle. African buffalo, water buffalo and cattle differ, besides numerous external features, in various reproductive parameters such as gestational length. Interest in reproduction in African buffalo, including the application of assisted reproductive technologies, has gained momentum in recent years, with the aim of finding an efficient way of a) increasing genetic diversity and b) producing “disease free” offspring of this wild ruminant species. In contrast to the many studies on placentation in domesticated bovids (cattle and water buffalo), the placenta of African buffalo has been almost completely neglected. A polycotyledonary, synepitheliochorial placenta, characterized by the development of numerous placentomes is generally described for members of the bovid family. Cattle placentomes are stalked, mushroom shaped and represent sites of anchorage and close contact between mother and foetus via interdigitation of foetal cotyledonary villi within corresponding caruncular crypts. Placentomes from 3 peri-partal, and <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> from 7 post-partal African buffalo cows were collected and placentomal and cotyledonary samples prepared for light microscopy (LM), scanningand transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM, TEM). The morphology and villous-crypt architecture of buffalo placentomes as well as the histology and ultrastructure of their structural components were described. Complete <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> were macroscopically examined and cotyledonary villi were studied by SEM. A comparison with cattle placentomes and <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> was performed directly or via comparison with relevant descriptions available in the literature. Comparison between buffalo and cattle placentae revealed that distribution pattern and placentome size were similar in both genera but that buffalo displayed considerably more placentomes than cattle. Buffalo placentomes were, in contrast to those of cattle, non-stalked. Differences in foetal villousity included long, slender and moderately branched villi in buffalo compared to broad, conical and complexly branched villi in cattle. Comparable cell types were involved in the synepitheliochorial interhaemal placental barrier in both genera but histological evidence for the process of placental maturation seems to be less pronounced in the buffalo than in the cattle placenta. The simpler villi in the non-stalked placentomes of the African buffalo form less complex fetomaternal interdigitations, which is interpreted as providing a somewhat less efficient nutrient supply to the developing foetus. This might partly explain the longer gestation period in buffalo compared to cattle. The placenta of water buffalo also contains non-stalked placentomes, thus resembling the African buffalo placenta in this respect, indicating a closer phylogenetic relationship between the two buffalo genera than between buffalo and cattle. Results of this first study of placentomes and <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> of African buffalo fills large gaps existing in ruminant placentation and may provide the basis for further research in buffalo reproduction. The similarity in placental morphology between the African buffalo and water buffalo may enhance future trials of intergeneric embryo transfer between the two buffalo genera.

In contrast to corresponding human tissues, ferret foetal placenta and amnion readily supported viral replication although both human and ferret umbilical cord were susceptible. In limited experiments, neither the membranes nor the susceptible foetal tissues became infected after intranasal inoculation of pregnant ferrets of various gestational ages. However, after intracardial inoculation of pregnant ferrets with high titre virus (ca 10 (9) EBID 50) virus was isolated from both <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and foetuses. The membranes became infected at early, middle and late gestation, but virus appeared to cross the placental barrier to infect foetal tissues only in late gestation.

Abortion occurred in 3. 5 % of ewes in the flock; the foetuses were well developed and had congested lungs and sero-haemorrhagic fluid in the thoracic cavity; pinpoint, necrotic-like lesions were recorded on the placental cotyledons, whilst the inter-cotyledonary areas appeared normal. The same findings were also recorded in the foetus and the <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> of a pregnant ewe that died and was necropsied; on the <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> of that animal, bright yellow-coloured amniotic plaques were also seen. Lameness was recorded in 3 % of the ewes in the flock; oedema of the periarticular tissues and sparse synovial fluid in the infected joints were evident in a ewe that died and was necropsied. Long-standing lameness was recorded in two fattening pigs, reared in the farm. E. rhusiopathiae was isolated in pure culture and heavy growth from joints of the pigs, joints, lungs, liver, foetuses and placentae of the ewe that died, aborted foetuses and placentae from the ewes that aborted, synovial fluid from the lame ewes. The identity of the organism was confirmed by means of conventional bacteriological techniques and the API-system. Specific tests for other common causes of ovine abortion were carried out, but no evidence of involvement of other agents was found. On the basis of all the evidence available, a diagnosis of erysipelas was made. Penicillin was given to all ewes in the flock and sanitation measures were applied to control the disease.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF 5) {{has been shown}} to associate with nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) to regulate genes involved in inflammation. However, there are no studies on the expression and regulation of KLF 5 in the processes of human labour and delivery. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine the effect of i) human labour on KLF 5 expression in both <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> and myometrium; ii) the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL 1 β), bacterial product flagellin and the viral dsRNA analogue poly(I:C) on KLF 5 expression and iii) KLF 5 knockdown by siRNA in human myometrial primary cells on pro-inflammatory and pro-labour mediators. In <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes,</b> there was no effect of term or preterm labour on KLF 5 expression. In myometrium, the term labour was associated with an increase in nuclear KLF 5 protein expression. Moreover, KLF 5 expression was also increased in myometrial cells treated with IL 1 β, flagellin or poly(IC), likely factors contributing to preterm birth. KLF 5 silencing in myometrial cells significantly decreased IL 1 β-induced cytokine expression (IL 6 and IL 8 mRNA expression and release), COX 2 mRNA expression, and subsequent release of prostaglandins PGE 2 and PGF 2 α. KLF 5 silencing also significantly reduced flagellin- and poly(I:C) -induced IL 6 and IL 8 mRNA expression. Lastly, IL 1 β-, flagellin- and poly(I:C) -stimulated NFκB transcriptional activity was significantly suppressed in KLF 5 -knockout myometrial cells. In conclusion, this study describes novel data in which KLF 5 is increased in labouring myometrium, and KLF 5 silencing decreased inflammation- and infection-induced pro-labour mediators.

40|$|Ichthyosis {{prematurity}} syndrome (IPS) {{is a rare}} inherited skin disorder. Children {{are born}} prematurely with thick skin and {{have been found to}} develop neonatal asphyxia due to occlusions in the bronchial tree from debris in the amniotic fluid. At 31 weeks of gestation, separation of amniotic and chorionic membranes was identified as well as polyhydramnion. The child was born 2 weeks later, with thickened skin with a granular appearance and required immediate ventilation and intensive care. At 2 years of age, the patient has developed an atopic skin condition with severe itching, recurrent skin infections, food intolerance and periods of wheezing. Prenatal observation of separation of <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> or dense amniotic fluid may be signs of IPS and severe complication immediately after birth...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study rapid changes in 15 -ketodihydro-PGF 2 α, {{cortisol}} and progesterone {{in the period}} preceding parturition in cattle, pre-term parturition was induced in 4 late pregnant heifers. Parturitions were induced by 2 intramuscular injections of 20 mg dexamethasone with a 24 -h interval. The first injection was made on days 254, 258, 264 and 265 in gestation, respectively. Twenty-four h before the first injection an intravenous polyurethane cannula was inserted. Blood samples were collected at least every hour until 12 h after parturition and during {{the second stage of}} labour at least 6 times per hour. Plasma was analysed for 15 -ketodihydro-PGF 2 α and progesterone by radioimmunoassays, and for cortisol by an ELISA. The average time from injection to parturition was 7. 7 (6. 6 – 8. 9) days (mean (range)). Two of the heifers had retained <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> (RFM). At the start of the experiment the levels of PGF 2 α metabolite were low (10000 pmol/L) were reached at the time of delivery. No pulsatile release was seen. Immediately after foetal expulsion the PG-metabolite levels decreased rapidly in all animals. In the 2 animals with RFM, however, this decline ceased within a few h. The PG-metabolite levels in these animals then started to increase and reached levels as high as during parturition. Luteolysis occurred between 1. 6 and 0. 4 days before parturition in all animals. The cortisol profile showed a distinct peak at the time of parturition in the RFM heifers. This peak was absent in the non-RFM heifers. This study shows that the PGF 2 α release at prepartal luteolysis and parturition is not pulsatile in cattle and that cortisol profiles in heifers with retained <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> might differ from the profiles in non-RFM heifers at the time of parturition. </p...|$|R
40|$|Retained <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes</b> in cattle {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complications}} associated to the reduction in milk yield and impaired fertility in dairy cattle. in order to determine some endocrine mechanisms controlling parturition and delivery of <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes,</b> plasma concentrations of steroids and prostanoids were determined in 20 healthy Holstein cows. Samples were taken within the interval of 5 days pre-parturition to 12 h after calving. Progesterone (P- 4) levels were similar in cows with (PR) and without (NPR) placental retention. While the estradiol- 17 beta (E- 2) peak at parturition was lower in PR than in NPR cows, cortisol levels were greater in PR cows 12 and 24 h pre-parturition. the Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha metabolite (PGFM) levels were higher at parturition in NPR compared with the PR group, but 12 h later, these levels in the PR group increased so that concentrations were greater as compared with NPR cows. the Prostaglandin E- 2 metabolite (PGEM), 24, 48 and 72 h pre-parturition, were higher in PR cows. However, the PGFM:PGEM ratio was greater in cows up NPR at all time when included, indicating the importance of higher levels of Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) than Prostaglandin E- 2 (PGE(2)) for normal placental delivery. in conclusion, placental retention was related to both estrogen and PGF(2 alpha) deficiency, which may be a consequence of metabolic stress leading to PGE 2 and maternal cortisol synthesis before parturition.

30|$|Retained {{products}} of conception (RPOC) consist of intrauterine tissue that develops after conception and persists after miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, delivery or caesarean section [1]. The occurrence of RPOC is not rare; however, the prevalence varies widely (from 0.5 {{to as much}} as 19 %) depending on pregnancy duration, pregnancy outcome and the successive management [2]. There is no consensus in literature on the type of tissue RPOC comprise. Some authors describe RPOC as non-villous trophoblastic tissue, chorionic villi or <b>foetal</b> <b>membranes,</b> and they state that decidua alone does not fall within the definition [3 – 5]. Others say that RPOC consist of the gestational sac, the decidua capsularis, chorionic villi or the embryo itself [6]. Still others argue that RPOC are from placental origin, and thus, that the presence of chorionic villi in RPOC is necessary [1, 7].|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{obtained}} {{which suggests that}} maternal γ-globulin (γG) is readily transferred to the foetal circulation of the grey squirrel. This was shown in two animals by the transfer of human γ-globulin and in a third by transfer of anti-Brucella abortus antibodies. Foetuses of all five pregnant squirrels studied, showed on analysis of their sera by immunoelectrophoresis a line indicative of γG but not of γM. Transfer of γG to exocoelomic, amniotic and yolk sac fluids, also occurred, but analysis of these fluids by immuno and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a paucity of the high molecular weight α- and γ-macroglobulins, and lipoprotein. A pre-albumin component was present in relatively high proportion in all sera and fluids analysed and foetal sera were particularly rich in α-foetoprotein.
