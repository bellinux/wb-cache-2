5000|$|The {{different}} kinds of B were eventually written differently, so as to distinguish them in music theory treatises and in notation. The flat sign [...] derives from a round b that signified the soft hexachord, hexachordum molle, particularly the presence of B. The name of the flat sign in <b>French</b> <b>is</b> bémol from medieval <b>French</b> <b>bé</b> mol, which in modern <b>French</b> <b>is</b> bé mou ("soft b"). The natural sign [...] and the sharp sign [...] derive from variations of a square b that signified the hard hexachord, hexachordum durum, where the note in question is B. The name of the natural sign in <b>French</b> <b>is</b> bécarre from medieval <b>French</b> <b>bé</b> quarre, which in modern <b>French</b> <b>is</b> bé carré ("square b"). In German music notation the letter B or b always designates B while the letter H or h - a deformation of a square b - designates B.|$|R

Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. , the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low {{for the majority of the}} Malagasy population.|$|E

5|$|The country's {{principal}} {{language is}} Kinyarwanda, which is spoken by most Rwandans. The major European languages {{during the colonial}} era were German, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence.

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or <b>French</b> <b>are</b> more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
