50|$|In addition, {{evidence}} has been found of irrigation <b>draining</b> <b>ditches,</b> dating back to 9,000 years ago. A number of plants, including taro were grown, at {{what would have been}} the edge of its cultivable limit in the highlands. These ditches can be divided into three types: major disposal channels, large field ditches, and small field ditches. The major disposal channels were built to divert water from the fan flowing south and direct them toward the northeast areas. The large and small field ditches are more uniform, surrounding the perimeter of the planting areas. They connect with the major disposal channels. During this time, the people of Kuk Swamp transformed their landscape into an anthropogenic grassland suitable for agriculture.|$|R

40|$|Furrow {{erosion and}} {{sediment}} 	 deposition redistributes topsoil within fields. Both {{of these processes}} are directly proportional to {{the energy of the}} furrow irrigation stream. This stream must be large enough at the application point to provide sufficient water for infiltration along the entire furrow length to meet the purposes of irrigation. Where slopes exceed about 0. 7 % on many silt loam soils, the flow velocity combined with the stream size at the upper ends of fields has sufficient energy to erode soil (Berg and Carter, 1980). As the furrow stream size decreases from infiltration along the furrow, the energy to erode and transport evil also decreases. At some point along the furrow the stream energy reaches a level where it no longer erodes soil. Then, further down slope, the energy reaches a level where the stream will no longer carry the accumulated sediment from upstream erosion. At that point sedimentation begins and continues downslope. The quantity of eroded soil. actually leaving the field through the furrow depends upon the sediment load in the furrow stream at the entry point into the <b>drain</b> <b>ditch</b> at the lower en...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find out both the effect of different exchangeable cations and the concentration of ions in the soil pore fluid on strength and plastic properties of a sample of cohesive soil taken from the bank of an open <b>drain</b> <b>ditch</b> at the Utah State University Irrigation and Drainage Farm. The experimental results of this study may be summarized by the following points: A general decrease of liquid limit and an increase in both shear strength and modulus of elasticity, with increasing salt concentration in the pore fluid, were observed for all samples, with the exception of HC 1 -treated samples for which shear strength was independent of HCI concentration in the pore water. An increase in both shear strength and modulus of elasticity with decreasing exchangeable sodium percentage was definite. The increase of soil shear strength caused by different exchangeable cations with distilled water in the soil pores was in the order Na + 3 ̆c Ca ++ 3 ̆c Mg ++ 3 ̆c K + 3 ̆c HCl-treated soil, whereas the modulus of elasticity increased in order Na + 3 ̆c K + 3 ̆c Ca ++ 3 ̆c HCI-treated soll 3 ̆c ++ Mg A decrease in the liquid limit with decreasing exchangeable sodium was found. The influence of the different exchangeable cations used on soil liquid limit was in the order Na + 3 ̆e HCl-treated sample 3 ̆e Mg++ 3 ̆e Ca ++ 3 ̆e K+. From this study it could be concluded that: The strength and plastic properties of cohesive soils are affected greatly by the type and concentration of adsorbed ions {{as well as by the}} ions concentration in the pore fluid. The failure of the sloping sides of <b>drain</b> <b>ditches</b> may be attributed at least in part to increasing exchangeable sodium percentage. For satisfactory and economical design of earth structures, a knowledge of chemical as well as physical properties of cohesive soils is essential. The boundary conditions which may change the soil physico-chemical properties with time should be considered. Strength properties of HCl-treated soils are controlled by aluminum rather than hydrogen ions. Exchangeable aluminum was liberated as a result of the breakdown of the clay fraction in soils when treated with HC 1. The experimental results are not completely explained in terms of the Gouy-Chapman theory of double layers. However, the Stern theory which considers the specific adsorption of ions on clay surfaces is a better alternative and does explain the results adequately...|$|R
