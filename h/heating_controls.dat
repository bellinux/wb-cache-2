The {{exterior}} {{had undergone a}} little sprucing up (with the addition of two electronic signs, which cost a total of $300,000 [...] ), but the facility was in increasing disrepair and its appearance reflected 1960s interior design aesthetics. Although Clarke and Rapuano had designed the reflecting pool to last 100 years, after just 16 years the pool leaked noticeably into the Great Hall below. Fixing it required expensive repairs to the expansion joints in the roof and recaulking much of the pool. The electrical system was inadequate and outdated, the <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> were failing, and the air conditioning system was {{nearing the end of}} its lifetime. The columns and walls in the Great Hall as well as the ramp from the upper level had been damaged by exhibitors, and extensive wear and tear had left the restrooms and carpeting throughout the facility worn. Exhibitors also complained about a lack of meeting room space. In the Music Hall section of Public Auditorium, the restrooms needed to be made accessible, and worn carpeting, drapes, and concessions equipment needed to be replaced. The total cost of repairs was estimated at $6 million ($ in [...] dollars). Lack of business meant that the center lost about $1 million ($ in [...] dollars) a year in the late 1970s. By 1982, this loss had risen to $1.9 million ($ in [...] dollars), and the convention center estimated that it would run a $1.7 million ($ in [...] dollars) deficit in 1983.|$|E

5000|$|In 1915 Sidney Horstmann and his {{brothers}} built a large factory, Newbridge Works, {{in what was then}} the outskirts of Bath. The general engineering company, The Horstmann Gear Company, specialised in gas street lighting controls, time switches, gauges, and latterly central <b>heating</b> <b>controls,</b> used [...] "Newbridge" [...] as a trademark for some of its products.

50|$|In 1904, Horstmann and his {{brothers}} founded Horstmann Gear to produce a variable speed gearbox he had invented for cars and motorcycles. The firm later became a general engineering company and came to specialise in gas street lighting controls, time switches, gauges, and latterly central <b>heating</b> <b>controls.</b> In 1915 a large factory, Newbridge Works, was opened in Newbridge, Bath, and Newbridge {{was used as a}} trade mark. In 1994 the Horstmann family sold their remaining shares and Horstmann Group became part of Clayhithe plc, which in 1998 was acquired by Roxspur plc.

5000|$|The Series 2 {{vehicles}} (1985-91) can {{be distinguished}} {{by the use of}} plastic bumpers. The cars lost some of their earlier distinctiveness, but maintained the [...] "stalk-free" [...] layout, where turn signals, wiper controls, horn and headlights could be operated by the driver's fingertips while his/her hands remained on the steering wheel. The suspension became stiffer in most models, with arguably a more aggressive look, as opposed to the more elegant Series 1 design. Although the dashboard retained the [...] "pod" [...] housing for the instrumentation, it lost the revolving-drum instruments and received a sloping centre dash area, and the radio moved to a position sideways and between the front seats, with the height corrector and <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> moving to the centre console.|$|E
5000|$|The {{whole range}} {{received}} a facelift in summer 1977 (model year 1978 - launched 1978 outside Europe), featuring an interior upgrade and subtly revised styling including repositioned indicators {{and depending on}} model, either four round or two rectangular headlights. [...] The objective, according to the manufacturer, was to differentiate the car more strongly from the mechanically similar Audi 80. Inside there was a restyled dashboard {{in the style of}} the Golf, with the radio and <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> now mounted centrally, one above the other, in a single unit alongside the principal dials. [...] Engine mountings, the gear box and the exhaust system were modified in order to reduce interior noise, and comfort was also improved by changes to the springing and shock absorbers. [...] The car's wheels were increased in size, and at the back there was a stronger anti-roll bar.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{electric}} showers, with various types of <b>heating</b> <b>controls.</b> The heating element of an electric shower is immersed in the water stream, using a nichrome resistance element which is sheathed and electrically isolated, like the ones used in oil heaters, radiators or clothes irons, providing safety. Due to electrical safety standards, modern electric showers are made of plastic instead of using metallic casings like in the past. As an electrical appliance that uses more electric current than a washer or a dryer, an electric shower installation requires careful planning, and generally is intended to be wired directly from the electrical distribution box with a dedicated circuit breaker and ground system. A poorly installed system with old aluminum wires or bad connections may be dangerous, as the wires can overheat or electric current may leak via the water stream through the body of the user to earth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Traditionally, human {{vision is}} applied to {{locating}} {{the region of the}} asphalt pavement defects. This will bring large variations for <b>heating</b> <b>control</b> of the microwave maintenance vehicle due to a shortage of the accurate control data. In this paper, a novel machine vision-based method was proposed to produce the control data precisely for the <b>heating</b> <b>control.</b> First, a scheme of the microwave <b>heating</b> <b>control</b> system based on machine vision was proposed for the microwave maintenance vehicle. Then, for the image distortion caused by the lens, the cubic polynomial warping algorithm and the reprojection transformation method were used to rectify it. Third, from the rectified image, the automatic and the manual method extracting control data were put forward. Last, matching with the obtained control data, a circuit design was demonstrated. Product testing proves that the proposed machine vision-based method is not only prompt and accurate in locating asphalt defects, but also quite effective in energy saving...|$|R

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} {{published}} with kind {{permission of the}} conference organiser. This paper presents measurements of householders’ manual interaction with their <b>heating</b> <b>controls.</b> The results demonstrate the importance of measuring heating use behaviour directly {{rather than relying on}} thermostat and timer settings or inferring heating use from internal temperature measurements. This is the first time, to the author’s knowledge, that manual heating interactions have been recorded. <b>Heating</b> <b>controls</b> will only save energy if used effectively, yet currently, little is known about how they are used. This paper describes an in-depth study of twelve UK residential properties that had new <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> installed. Heating system interactions with these controls, energy consumption and room temperatures were monitored for ten months from July 2014 to April 2015 inclusive, covering autumn and spring shoulder months and the winter heating season. These measured data were supported by a series of qualitative interviews with the households. The paper reports details of the householders’ heating system use, separating the occupants’ manual interactions with the controls from their pre-programmed heating schedules. The findings show that the participants had many manual interactions with their heating systems, even during scheduled heating periods; changing heating durations and demand temperatures. The results also identify that manual interactions with <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> occur more frequently during the winter season than in the shoulder months. The results have important implications relating to assumptions of set-point temperatures and schedule characteristics previously based only on self-reported use or measured internal temperature profiles...|$|E
