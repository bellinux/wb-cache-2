40|$|Intentional insider {{misuse of}} {{information}} systems resources (i. e., IS misuse) represents a significant threat to organizations. For example, industry statistics suggest that between 50 %- 75 % of security incidents originate from within an organization. Because of {{the large number of}} misuse incidents, it has become important to understand how to reduce such behavior. General deterrence theory suggests that certain controls can serve as <b>deterrent</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by increasing the perceived threat of punishment for IS misuse. This paper presents an extended deterrence theory model that combines work from criminology, social psychology, and information systems. The model posits that user awareness of security countermeasures directly influences the perceived certainty and severity of organizational sanctions associated with IS misuse, which leads to reduced IS misuse intention. The model is then tested on 269 computer users from eight different companies. The results suggest that three practices deter IS misuse: user awareness of security policies; security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs; and computer monitoring. The results also suggest that perceived severity of sanctions is more effective in reducing IS misuse than certainty of sanctions. Further, there is evidence that the impact of sanction perceptions vary based on one's level of morality. Implications for the research and practice of IS security are discussed. © 2009 INFORMS...|$|E

The effect of feature size, geometry, and wettability on {{the settlement of}} different algae was evaluated. These films showed various antifouling performances to Ulothrix, Closterium and Navicula. For Navicula (length: 10 - 12 mu m), the feature size and geometry displayed a substantial correlation with the antifouling properties. The film with pillars spaced 3 mu m reduced Navicula settlement by 73 % compared to the control surface. For Closterium (length: 45 - 55 pm), their responses were governed by the same underlying thermodynamic principles as wettability, the largest reduction in Closterium, 81 %, was obtained on the surface with grooves spaced 12 mu m apart. For Ulothrix (length: 5 - 8 mm), the surface also showed the best antifouling performance, the reduction ratio of the settlement on the surface with grooves spaced 12 mu m apart could even reach 92 %. At last, physical fouling <b>deterrent</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the films with various textures were analyzed in detail. The feature size and geometry display a substantial correlation with the antifouling properties when the size of fouling algae {{is close to the}} textures. With the increasing size for algae, antifouling performance was getting better on surface with pillars or grooves because the algae are bridged between two or more features other than stabilizing its entire mass on one single feature or able to settle between features.

40|$|Any {{man-made}} structure {{immersed in}} the marine environment rapidly becomes fouled, with significant economic consequences. Solutions to fouling have generally used toxic paints or coatings which have damaging effects on marine life. The subsequent phasing out of these antifoulants has sparked a search for non-toxic antifouling alternatives, including the development of technologies based on natural biofouling defence models (biomimicry). The biomimetic approach to antifouling {{is the focus of}} this thesis, with an emphasis on physical fouling defence mechanisms in molluscs. Surface microtextures have been identified as potential fouling <b>deterrent</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in molluscs and have been recorded on the blue mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and M. edulis. The aim of this thesis is to develop biomimetic fouling control using marine molluscs as a natural model. To determine physical defences the surface texture of a range of marine bivalves and gastropods from the Great Barrier Reef was characterised and many unique micro-topographical patterns discovered. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to quantify the surface roughness parameters for 36 selected species. This is the first example of the characterisation of natural marine surfaces in terms of mean roughness and waviness profiles, skewness, anisotropy and fractal dimension. The wettability of the selected species was also determined. Subsequently, the 36 species were assessed for fouling resistance over three months and fouling resistance and removal was correlated with the surface roughness parameters generated. Key roughness parameters, in particular skewness, fractal dimension and hydrophobicity, were identified for species specific fouling resistance and also fouling removal. Total fouling cover was positively correlated to fractal dimension and negatively correlated to skewness. Algal cover was negatively correlated to hydrophobicity, Spirorbid tubeworm cover was positively correlated to fractal dimension, and percent fouling removal was positively correlated with mean waviness. To establish the role of surface microtexture in fouling deterrence, biomimics were created for three bivalves, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Tellina plicata, which have differing microtopographical patterns, and Amusium balloti, which has a smooth surface. Smooth biomimics were significantly more fouled than microtextured biomimics. The fouling resistance of microtextured biomimics diminished after 6 - 8 weeks, in contrast to natural shells which maintained their fouling resistant properties for 3 months. The extended fouling resistance of natural shells supports a multiple defence strategy of the surface-bound periostracum, with the proteinaceous nature of the coating providing a defence against microfouling. A theory is proposed that microtextured biomimics only deters macrofouling larvae and that microfoulers that are smaller than the size of the microtexture fill the textures and negate its effects. This theory is termed ‘attachment point theory’, whereby larval attachment is influenced by the number of attachment points with settling larvae preferring the maximum number of attachment points to enhance successful adhesion and recruitment. To test attachment point theory, microtextured films of varying texture widths (2 - 512 μm) were developed and attachment to the microtextures by a range of micro- and macro-fouling organisms was determined. Diatoms attached in significantly higher numbers on textures smaller than the width of the diatom cell. In contrast attachment was reduced on textures slightly smaller than the cell width, clearly supporting attachment point theory. Attachment by macrofouling larvae and algal spores to microtextures also supported the theory. Larvae and spores generally settled in higher number on the texture larger than the spore/larval size. Attachment points for settling larvae are identified as important mechanisms in fouling deterrence, or attachment, with the critical factor being the ratio of the width of settling organism to that of the microtexture. The findings of fouling resistance on micro-rough surfaces were explored further to incorporate nano-scale surface roughness. This novel antifouling mechanism combines micro- and nano-scale roughness to a hydrophobic surface to create superhydrophobicity. A range of surfaces incorporating micro- with nano-scale roughness, and nano-scale roughness alone, were tested against a range of micro- and macro- fouling organisms. Nano-rough surfaces alone significantly deterred all tested organisms. In contrast micro-scale with nano-scale roughness either attracted or repelled larvae. From the mixed preferences recorded on the choice bioassays, factors other than hydrophobicity {{play a significant role in}} the selection of a surface on. All coatings were superhydrophobic (> 155 º) but differed in roughness and produced very different settlement responses. The consistently high level of deterrence by the nano-scale surface supports a theory of nano-bubbles at the surface of these coatings as an antifouling mechanism. The confirmation of this theory requires further collaborative investigation between physicists, chemists and biologists, but is a significant outcome. Overall, the research presented has elucidated a number of novel approaches to biomimetic fouling control and developed novel theories for the mechanisms of action of natural surface-mediated fouling defences. These results also contribute to the development of promising alternatives to toxic antifouling technologies and provide unique approaches to significant new developments in micro- and nano-surface technologies in the field...|$|E

A putative abuse deterrent formulation of oxycodone extended release (OxyContin®) {{was introduced in}} 2010. Early reports demonstrated reduced abuse and diversion, however, an analysis of social media found 32 feasible methods to circumvent the abuse <b>deterrent</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We measured trends of diversion, abuse and street price of OxyContin to assess the durability of the initial reduction in abuse. MethodsData from the Poison Center Program, Drug Diversion Program, Opioid Treatment Program, Survey of Key Informant Patients Program and StreetRx program of the Researched Abuse, Diversion, and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS®) System were used. The average quarterly rates of abuse and diversion for OxyContin were compared from before reformulation to the rate in second quarter 2015. Rates were adjusted for population using US Census data and drug availability. ResultsOxyContin abuse and diversion declined significantly each quarter after reformulation and persisted for 5 years. The rate of abuse of other opioid analgesics increased initially and then decreased, but to lesser extent than OxyContin. Abuse through both oral and non-oral routes of self-administration declined following the reformulation. The geometric mean difference in the street price of reformulated OxyContin was 36 % lower than the reformulated product in the year after reformulation.

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} to assess merger policy effectiveness based on standard oligopoly theory and stock market reactions. We focus on four different dimensions of effectiveness: 1) legal certainty, 2) decision errors, 3) reversion of anti-competitive rents, and 4) deterrence. We apply this framework to 368 merger cases scrutinized by the European Commission (EC) between 1990 and 2007. To evaluate {{the economic impact}} of the change in European merger legislation, we compare the results of the four tests before and after its introduction in 2004.

40|$|Social parasites are {{involved}} in a coevolutionary arms race, which drives increasing specialization resulting in a very narrow host range. The Formicoxenus ants are a small group of social parasites with a xenobiotic lifestyle. Formicoxenus quebecensis and Formicoxenus provancheri are highly specialized ants using chemical mimicry to blend into their respective Myrmica ant host colonies. However, Formicoxenus nitidulus is unique in being able to survive in over 11 different ant host species. We observed that when live or dead F. nitidulus adults are seized by their host they are immediately dropped undamaged, despite possessing a cuticular hydrocarbon profile that differs markedly from its host. Hexane extracts of the F. nitidulus cuticle made previously acceptable prey items unattractive to their Formica host, indicating a chemical deterrent effect. This {{is the first time that}} a social parasite has been shown to exploit the generalized deterrence strategy to avoid host aggression over long periods of time. This supports the idea that coevolved and generalist diseases or parasites require fundamentally different defence mechanisms.

The primary focus of that study was Part 130 of the Uniform Rules for the New York State Trial Courts (Part 130), implemented on January 1, 1989, which permits the award of costs and the imposition of financial sanctions for frivolous conduct in civil litigation. The general objective of the Committee was to study and recommend appropriate means for addressing problems caused by abusive conduct in the courts of New York State. The Committee believes that in adopting Part 130, the New York State courts acted appropriately and took a significant step in the right direction. Nevertheless, the Committee recommends that Part 130 be modified in several significant ways. Most of the proposed revisions stem from the Committee 2 ̆ 7 s view that the focus of Part 130 should be on abusive conduct rather than on frivolous pleadings.

Weekly intravenous administrations of MAb with high affinity for alpha-rat ANP, named KY-ANP-II (MAb[KY-ANP-II]), started at the age of 6 wk, significantly augmented the rise in blood pressure of SHR-SP, compared with control SHR-SP treated with another MAb with quite low affinity for alpha-rat ANP, named KY-ANP-I (MAb[KY-ANP-I]), throughout the observation period. The administrations of MAb[KY-ANP-II] had no significant effect on blood pressure of age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats, compared with those receiving MAb[KY-ANP-I]. Weekly administrations of MAb[KY-ANP-II] also significantly aggravated hypertension in DOCA-salt rats. Blood pressure of DOCA-salt rats treated with MAb[KY-ANP-II] was significantly higher than that of DOCA-salt rats treated with MAb[KY-ANP-I] throughout 8 wk of DOCA and 1 % saline administration. The administration of MAb[KY-ANP-II] also significantly attenuated exaggerated diuresis and natriuresis in DOCA-salt rats compared with those treated with MAb[KY-ANP-I]. Elevated plasma cGMP levels of both SHR-SP and DOCA-salt rats were significantly reduced by the administration of MAb[KY-ANP-II].

40|$|Chemoreception {{plays an}} {{important}} role in predator-prey interactions and feeding dynamics. While the chemoreception of attractant or pleasant tasting compounds has been well studied, aversive chemoreceptive signaling has been difficult to investigate behaviorally in an ecological context because these interactions are species- and context- specific and deterrent compounds vary among prey. Using the coral reef system, this thesis explores on a molecular level the <b>deterrent</b> <b>mechanism</b> underlying detection by fish predators of an aversive compound, in order to gain a greater understanding of predator-prey interactions in this community. Like other organisms that are sessile or slow-moving, marine sponges have special mechanisms for defense from predation, commonly containing aversive-tasting compounds that defend these organisms from predation. To this end, we sought to identify and characterize a fish chemoreceptor that detects one or more of these compounds. We isolated a single cDNA clone encoding RAMP-like triterpene glycoside receptor (RL-TGR), a novel co-receptor involved in the signaling of triterpene glycosides. This co-receptor appears to be structurally and functionally related to receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), a family of co-receptors that physically associate with and modify the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Expression in Xenopus oocytes showed that it responds to triterpene glycosides in a receptor-mediated manner and requires co-expression of a GPCR to enable signaling in oocytes; both of these receptors may be components of a larger signaling complex. A 40 bp portion of the gene is conserved across multiple fish species, but is not found in any other organism with a sequenced genome, suggesting that the expression of this receptor is limited to fish species. RL-TGR is the first identified gene encoding a co-receptor that responds to a chemical defense. This finding may lead the way for the identification of many other receptors that mediate chemical defense signaling in both marine and terrestrial environments, as this protein has the potential to represent the first of an entire family of co-receptors that respond to aversive compounds.

40|$|The {{right to}} claim for civil damages {{in terms of}} section 65 of the Competition Act No. 89 of 1998 of South Africa (“CA of 1998 ”) is likely to {{contribute}} significantly to {{the objectives of the}} competition law in the country by serving as a deterring measure for companies to engage in anti-competitive behavior. Companies infringing the Competition Act will know that upon a finding of an infringement, they will have to pay back to consumers whatever profits they would have made illegally plus the litigation costs. These payments will be made in addition to the administrative penalties levied by the Competition Commission of South Africa, the Competition Tribunal of South Africa or the Competition Appeal Court of South Africa (“collectively referred to as the competition authorities”) and the possibility of directors’ criminal liability for causing companies to engage in cartel behavior. Therefore, the achievement of the objectives of the CA of 1998 as amended also depends on the effectiveness of civil damages claim provisions of section 65. However, the effectiveness of civil damages claims in terms of section 65 is compromised when consumers are incapable of exercising the right conferred to them in terms of this section. The recent increase on the findings by the competition authorities for an infringement of the prohibited practices in terms of chapter 2 of the CA of 1998, the period in which the respondents had engaged in those prohibited practices, the financial losses or damages suffered by consumers who in most cases are end users of the products or services and most importantly consumers inactiveness in exercising their rights to claim for such damages in terms of section 65 of the CA of 1998 have influenced the researcher to investigate the relevant section and the impediments to pursuing civil damages claims in terms thereof. The investigation both from the comparative law and individual consumer response shows amongst others the following as challenges that consumers will normally face to pursue their right in terms of section 65 : the cost of litigation, lack of knowledge of consumer rights, lack of consumer activism, financial assistance, dragging of matters before the courts to frustrate consumers, complex procedures to claim damages before civil courts etc. There appears to be general consensus throughout the data collected by the researcher that private enforcement will discourage companies to engage in any form of anti-competitive behavior thereby serving as a <b>deterrent</b> <b>mechanism</b> for infringement in addition to the administrative penalties and directors’ criminal liability.

40|$|State {{aspirations}} to have national properties recognised {{as belonging to}} the heritage of humanity with an international significance has increasingly empowered the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in regard to its influence upon international behaviour. In the early 1970 s, UNESCO embarked on an ambitious mission to protect and preserve humanity’s most outstanding heritage to guarantee {{that it will be}} passed to future generations. It also aimed to recognise people’s interaction with nature and to ensure a balance between them. Towards this end, UNESCO launched a global World Heritage regime to accomplish its noble mandate. Over the past thirty-nine years this regime has become an international success as it has enabled the safeguarding of numerous tangible and intangible goods of exceptional value for the entirety of humanity. The key to its success has been a balanced combination of measures that highlight the regime’s direct and indirect forms of power. Yet, with a growing number of sites inscribed on the World Heritage List and with growing threats to them, the World Heritage system has found itself increasingly facing difficulties in maintaining its “moral power”. These challenges have been exacerbated by a lack of coercive force and sanctioning methods in realistic terms, as well as by rising flows of tourism and, at the same time, decreasing international assistance and funds. The ongoing success of the regime thus come to depend, more than ever, upon the shared involvement and commitment of the States Parties, the international community, and the civil society. This thesis proposes to examine the multiple ways in which the World Heritage regime has used its power mechanisms to achieve its current significant international position. It will begin with a definition of the UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention, an international treaty to preserve the world cultural and natural and intangible heritage. UNESCO’ s World Heritage regime is thus chiefly based on the implementation of the World Heritage Convention and the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention through the World Heritage Committee (WHC). A brief diachronic view of the Convention’s work and aims are therefore imperative for understanding the regime’s power mechanisms and its dynamics. Also provided will be definitions of cultural and natural heritage as well as cultural landscapes and the adopted criteria for the nomination of world heritage, which are all key aspects and assessment measures of UNESCO’ s Heritage regime. After a brief synopsis of the differences between this regime and conventional International Organisations (IOs), this research will shed light on the nature of its persuasive forms of power: scientific objectivity, blacklisting, mimicry, and competition - especially regarding the significance of both the States Parties and the regime’s reputation, as well as its legitimacy. It will discuss how vital these forms of power are to success in influencing states to ratify the World Heritage Convention, to ensure compliance, and persuade them to jointly achieve the proposed goals. It will be further shown that the regime’s legitimacy is based on the perception of its procedures and favourable outcomes by its Member States. In addition, this research will theorise on the constructivist IR approach by adapting it to the regime. How Member States follow constructed rules and adopt a ‘logic of appropriateness’ will also be explored. It will in addition involve examination of its political tools, the World Heritage List, the List of World Heritage in Danger and socio-cultural tools, since they represent the conduit for its power mechanisms, and argue the chances of success in each arena. Examples from the Cologne Cathedral in Germany and the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal illustrate how the regime’s tools {{can be used as a}} <b>deterrent</b> <b>mechanism</b> to ensure the integrity of World Heritage sites. Moreover, the dichotomy of heritage viewed through the lens of national and international interests will be addressed, as well as what this entails for the States Parties’ sovereignty. International interests may come to the forefront of heritage protection, creating a new form of sovereignty: ‘Disaggregated sovereignty’. The World Heritage regime’s various benefits will also be discussed, its impact on the state’s economies especially in regard to tourism, the granting of international assistance as well as funds, and its influence on the States Parties social life by igniting a sense of prestige and pride about their World Heritage properties and by sensitising entire nations regarding the necessity to jointly protect and conserve this collective treasure. Examples from Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo illustrate the effectiveness of international assistance provided by the regime, while the example of the Galapagos Islands’ underlines the need to develop sustainable tourism practices to prevent the deterioration of heritage sites.
