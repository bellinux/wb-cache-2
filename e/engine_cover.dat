5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent <b>engine</b> <b>cover</b> {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Eastern Daylight Time (UTC-4) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in cloudy and windy weather conditions. Both Ferrari drivers {{maintained}} their good pace from qualifying; Michael Schumacher had the fastest time, a 1:18.932. Barrichello finished with the second quickest time. The McLaren drivers rounded out the top four fastest drivers; Häkkinen in front of Coulthard. Amongst the slower runners, Heidfeld had a worrying moment when his <b>engine</b> <b>cover</b> was shed from the chassis on the main straight.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new underfloor and brought more powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying and the race. Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new <b>engine</b> <b>cover,</b> a titanium gearbox and rear suspension geometry. The team decided to only test the gearbox during the first free practice session.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "road switcher" [...] is {{not used}} in the UK. The nearest {{equivalent}} is the type 1 locomotive of which there were 5 designs. None of these designs exactly match the Road Switcher. The British Rail Class 14 and British Rail Class 17 have the low <b>engine</b> <b>covers,</b> but the cab is located centrally. Two other designs had the cab near one end like the road switcher, i.e. British Rail Class 15 and British Rail Class 16. However the <b>engine</b> <b>covers</b> reach the cab roof level. The most successful type 1 locomotive is the British Rail Class 20, which still has some members in service. In this case, the cab is at one end with high <b>engine</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following the French Grand Prix on 2 July, six teams {{conducted}} testing {{sessions at}} the Silverstone Circuit between 4–6 July {{to prepare for}} the Austrian Grand Prix at the A1-Ring. Frentzen was fastest {{on the first day of}} testing, ahead of Sauber's Pedro Diniz. Alexander Wurz's car was afflicted with an gearbox issue, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Jaguar driver Eddie Irvine was fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen for Arrows was quickest on the final day of testing, although his car's front wing was damaged when his <b>engine</b> <b>cover</b> was shed from its chassis. Ferrari and McLaren opted to test at the Mugello Circuit where both teams concentrated their efforts on aerodynamic and suspension set-ups between 4–7 July. Ferrari spent one further day performing shakedown runs of their cars at the Fiorano Circuit with their test driver Luca Badoer. Williams and BAR tested at the Autódromo do Estoril between 5–7 July where testing consisted of tyre, engine, aerodynamic and set-up optimisation.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry for the Saturday-morning practice sessions. Häkkinen set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the third}} session at 1:51.043, quicker than his best on Friday and ahead of Frentzen, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher. Coulthard, who had an engine problem early in the session, was fifth-fastest (ahead of Button and Michael Schumacher). Alesi, Villeneuve and Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. During the final practice session Häkkinen could not improve his time, although he remained the fastest. Button, much happier with his car's handling, set the second-fastest time. The Jordan drivers were third and fourth, with Trulli ahead of Frentzen. Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard completed the top six. Of the slower drivers, Marc Gené had an anxious moment when his Minardi car shed its <b>engine</b> <b>cover</b> but was {{able to return to}} his garage.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} {{maintain}} his lead from teammate Coulthard. On lap two Herbert moved into fifth position after Irvine dropped to seventh place when Verstappen overtook him. Further down the field Barrichello continued to gain positions when he passed both BAR drivers for eighth. The McLaren drivers managed to maintain a gap to Trulli who set the fastest lap of the race, 1:46.321. Irvine lost a further position to Barrichello on lap three, as Frentzen claimed 14th from Diniz. On lap four, Frentzen made up a further position by passing Heidfeld for 13th. On the same lap Verstappen locked up his tyres to avoid a collision with Herbert. This allowed Barrichello to pass Verstappen for sixth position in the run up to the Clark chicane on lap five. Herbert lost fifth position to Barrichello on lap six with Frentzen continuing {{to move up the}} field by passing Ralf Schumacher and Wurz for eleventh. Barrichello began setting consecutive fastest laps as he closed the gap to de la Rosa. Zonta lost 10th position when he was passed by Frentzen on lap seven. On the next lap, Verstappen suffered a worrying moment when half of his <b>engine</b> <b>cover</b> was shed from its chassis. Frentzen managed to gain a further four positions in the next four laps.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Before qualifying began on Saturday afternoon, Mercedes was forced to change the power unit in Nico Rosberg's car back to the one used in Belgium, which had already run for six full races, after finding an issue with the new specification unit. Meanwhile, Lotus was forced to borrow tyre blankets from other teams, as their own had been rendered unusable by rain during the night. When the session began, Nico Hülkenberg {{was one of the first}} out on track, but his fast lap was disrupted by Marcus Ericsson, who was later penalised for the incident. Both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen spent most of the session in the pit lane. While Ricciardo was able to get out and set a lap sufficient to see him proceed to the second part of qualifying (Q2), Verstappen went out only to see his <b>engine</b> <b>cover</b> blown off at Curva Grande, scattering the track with debris, though at the very end of the session, so no other cars were affected. Next to Verstappen, both Manor Marussia and McLaren drivers were eliminated.|$|E

5000|$|The {{result was}} the Class 17, fitted with a centre cab and low <b>engine</b> <b>covers.</b> These {{requirements}} meant that instead of having a single large engine, {{it was necessary to}} use two smaller six-cylinder horizontal engines, one {{on either side of the}} cab.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} was revised too, {{with the center}} console split from the dashboard, and the climate controls relocated. Pininfarina tweaked {{the body of the}} car to better integrate the spoilers and <b>engine</b> <b>cover</b> and update the design in line with the recently released 348.|$|E
25|$|Babs used exposed chains (covered by a fairing) to take {{power to}} the drive wheels. It has been rumored that the high <b>engine</b> <b>cover</b> {{required}} Parry-Thomas to drive with his head tilted to one side.

5000|$|Although its straight-six {{engine was}} smooth, the {{motorcycle}} was heavy, expensive and thirsty, and the Z1300 sold poorly, particularly in Europe.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a deep {{numerical}} analysis on an internal combustion <b>engine’s</b> <b>cover</b> is carried out.

The comparison in terms of sound pressure levels between the experimental and FEM/SEA analysis results shows a very good agreement, in the whole investigated frequency range. The obtained results encourage to use the numerical model for further investigations aimed at the improvement of its acoustic performances.
