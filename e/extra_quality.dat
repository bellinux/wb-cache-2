Thus, if the teacher helps to connect notions and phenomena to students' innate and embodied knowledge, then these notions become less complex and the emergent phenomenon loses its magic: it becomes logically connected to the subjacent phenomena.

This contribution shows the main characteristics of the talc mineralization {{related to the}} Río de Las Tunas ultramafic bodies in the Salamanca Mining District, Frontal Cordillera of Mendoza province. According to the parageneses defined on the studied samples, three generations of talc were established: 1 º) crystallized in metaperidotites and related to the prograde stage of the regional metamorphism; 2 º) crystallized inreaction zones (mostly in the talc zone) developed at the boundary between metaperidotites and their country-rocks. These reaction zones evidence a metasomatic process due to geochemical gradient between the ultramafic body and their country-rocks. This process was developed during the retrogression of the regional metamorphic cycle. 3 º) Talc present in shear-zones that cut across the ultramafic bodies. The extreme serpentinization of the ultramaficbodies is concentrated in shear-zones where the serpentine is subsequently replaced by talc ± carbonates related with a hydrothermal stage. Aqueous fluids relatively enriched in CO 2 flowed through these shear-zones causing the cease of serpentine formation favoring the talc and/or carbonates. Mined talc deposits are those in shear zones and reaction zones. They are mostly industrial-, asbestine- or talcschist-type.

Nowadays such an approach seems to be insufficient. Our society needs graduates who are further capable of making successful careers and taking various socially meaningful activities.

40|$|This paper aims {{to reveal}} consumers’ {{preferences}} for quality graded fish products based upon existing data on first-hand sales in Denmark. The data represents {{the value of}} fish for consumption as a non-differentiated private good. The objective is to measure the welfare gains to society {{of an increase in}} “quality” for major fish species. The demand for <b>Quality</b> <b>Extra</b> and <b>quality</b> A-fish is estimated using an Inverse Almost Ideal Demand System (IAIDS-model) as the functional form of demand on first-hand sales data following the European Union established trade norms for quality-grading and sizecategories. Secondly the possibility of estimating changes in consumer surplus as the welfare gained by society of a general increase in quality of landed fish is discussed. However, the estimates on consumer surplus are not yet completed. The model adopted is a pricing model for the implicit price of the characteristic “quality” which necessarily is part of the product i. e. fish for consumption. Today the Danish market for fish does not explicitly state the “quality” of fish in the consumers market. This is generally a credence parameter. There are no objective verifiable standards available to the consumer and this is an element of trust in the word of the fish retailer. This paper shows the first results of adopting a revealed preference model for indirect benefit estimation on existing quality differentiated fish at first-hand sales. We explicitly discuss the assumptions of “weak complementarity” and “derived demand” necessary to run the model...|$|R
