25|$|Ultimately, the purpose, {{objective}} {{and meaning of}} healthcare philosophy is to consolidate the abundance of information regarding the ever-changing fields of biotechnology, medicine, and nursing. And seeing that healthcare typically {{ranks as one of}} the largest spending areas of governmental budgets, it becomes important to gain a greater understanding of healthcare as not only a social institution, but also as a political one. In addition, healthcare philosophy attempts to highlight the primary movers of healthcare systems; be it nurses, doctors, allied health professionals, <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators,</b> health insurance companies (HMOs and PPOs), the government (Medicare and Medicaid), and lastly, the patients themselves.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, 2010, the {{emergency}} room at St. Vincent's closed, officially shuttering the hospital after 161 years. <b>Hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> said that the vote to close came after a six-month-long effort to save the financially troubled institution, but August 21, 2011, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office were reported to have launched an investigation to determine whether administrators intentionally ran St. Vincent's into the ground. The remaining parts of Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, including its nursing homes, home health agency, St. Vincent's Hospital Westchester, and US Family Health Plan, were to continue to operate without interruption, but these entities were sold to other providers' systems.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, Mohamud and Erdoğan {{concurrently}} inaugurated {{a number}} of new Turkish-built development projects in Somalia, including the Digfer Hospital in the capital. It was concurrently renamed Erdoğan Hospital in honour of Erdoğan. The new 200-bed Somalia-Turkey Training and Research Hospital was constructed by Turkey's international development body, the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA), in accordance with an earlier Somalia-Turkey bilateral agreement. It has a $135.7 million operating budget, $85.6 million of which is slated to be covered by the Turkish authorities over the next five years. The 13,500 square-meter indoor premises includes 20 incubators, 14 newborn intensive care beds, 12 intensive care beds, 4 operating rooms, a delivery room, and laboratory and radiology units, with general surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, children, maternity, urology, internal medicine, anesthesia, dental and ocular departments.

500|$|A competent, if {{controversial}} {{member of}} the cabinet, Weaver, as Minister for Health, travelled extensively and concentrated on the expansion of hospitals, becoming Director of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (1929-1930). His determination to exert more control over hospitals and the banning of honorary doctors from local hospital boards brought him into conflict with the NSW branch of the British Medical Association. His strict control over <b>Hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> brought him into conflict with the medical community and he was eventually dropped from the cabinet on 10 February 1935 by Premier Stevens, who found him [...] "too extreme in personal independence" [...] and possessing a [...] "needlessly sharp tongue." [...] Weaver returned to the backbenches and won re-election at the 1935 election on 11 May with an increased margin of 88.42%. On 3 July 1935, King George V, {{on the advice of}} the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Gowrie, granted him retention of the title [...] "The Honourable", for having served more than three years on the Executive Council of New South Wales.|$|E
2500|$|A 2003 {{survey of}} <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> {{conducted}} in Canada, the U.S., {{and three other}} countries found dissatisfaction with both the U.S. and Canadian systems.

However, U.S. administrators were the most negative about their country's system. Hospital executives in all five countries expressed concerns about staffing shortages and emergency department waiting times and quality.|$|E

2500|$|However, [...] "there {{appears to}} be a gap between physicians' attitudes and {{practices}} regarding error disclosure.

[...] Brad Bannon of US News and World Report wrote, [...] "The [...] insults may also have an ironic backlash. Ryan, Akin, Mourdock, and Koster are poster boys for the need for more women in Congress, so Republican attacks on women may mean the election of more women." [...] The conservative blog Hot Air linked Akin's remarks to a ten percent shift in US public opinion polls toward supporting legalizing abortion in all circumstances. In a column in Salon, Joan Walsh wrote, [...] "suddenly Americans had to try to imagine how doctors or <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> or law enforcement officials would decide what was 'legitimate rape,' as opposed to something else.

[...] The key issue for many of them in 1939, for example, was not the fate of the hospital, but rather the future of Europe after Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland. In one instance, [...] "several interns responded by wearing badges to signify support for the Allies," [...] but the hospital's director told them to remove them lest they upset some of the patients. The interns then took the matter to Salk. Salk replied, [...] "everyone should wear the badge as an act of solidarity." [...] One intern recalled, [...] "Jonas was a very staunch guy. He never took a backward step on that issue or any other issue of principle between us and the hospital." [...] The <b>hospital</b> <b>administrators</b> backed off and there was no further interference from the director.|$|E
