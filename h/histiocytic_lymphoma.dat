This allows it to be used to distinguish diseases of otherwise similar appearance, such as the monocyte/macrophage and lymphoid forms of leukaemia (the latter being CD68 negative).

With the monoclonal antisera, all three were found to bear two surface antigens (OKT 9 and OKT 10) previously described on early thymocytes, and were devoid of the Ia antigen.

By cytomorphologic classification, there were two small lymphocytic lymphomas, one small cleaved cell lymphoma, two mixed small cleaved and large cell lymphomas, 17 large cell lymphomas, one small noncleaved cell lymphoma, three immunoblastic lymphomas, and two lymphoblastic lymphomas. This distribution of histologic types was compatible with that of nodal lymphoma. The lymphomas with poor prognostic histology (23 cases) outnumbered those with favorable prognosis (five cases). Three of 28 cases (one in the stomach and two in the small intestine) had cytologic features consistent with centrocytoid cell lymphoma of the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue and were large cell lymphomas. Immunophenotypically, 23 cases expressed B-cell markers (82. 1 %) and three cases reacted with T-cell markers. Two cases did not react with either T-cell or B-cell markers. True <b>histiocytic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> were not identified. Gastric lymphomas (nine cases) and colorectal lymphomas (three cases) were of B-lymphocyte origin whereas T-cell lymphomas were noted in the small intestine (two cases) and ileocecal region (one case). Three cases of centrocytoid lymphoma were of B-lymphocyte origin. Histologically B-cell lineage lymphomas were evenly distributed on various histologic subtypes but all T-lineage lymphomas belonged to the large cell type.

Reed-Sternberg cells were stained {{with one or}} other of the antigranulocyte antibodies in the nodular sclerosing and lymphocyte depleted subtypes. Reed-Sternberg cells in all but three cases of mixed cellularity Hodgkin's disease were positive with both Leu-M 1 and 3 C 4. One case stained with only Leu-M 1, and two cases were consistently negative with both antibodies. HLA-DR was widely expressed in the Reed-Sternberg cells of all three subtypes. In the four cases of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease the multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells did not stain with either antigranulocyte antibody but were strongly positive with anti-HLA-DR. Twenty five cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in which there were multinucleated giant cells resembling Reed-Sternberg cells, were studied in a similar way. These cases included pleomorphic T cell and B cell <b>lymphomas,</b> <b>histiocytic</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> and malignant histiocytosis of the intestine.

Cryostat section studies topographically defined EAC binding cells. Cytochemical determinations and immunoperoxidase methods for detection of intracellular immunoglobulin and lysozyme complemented other techniques in evaluating infiltrates containing large neoplastic cells. B-cell malignancies comprised 58 cases (80 %) {{of this series}} and included well and moderately well differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas (10 / 10); nodular (23 / 23) and diffuse (10 / 18) poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas; and lymphomas of mixed lymphocytic-“histiocytic” (3 / 3), “undifferentiated” (3 / 3), and “histiocytic” (9 / 13) types. Nodular lymphomas were characterized as B-cell neoplasms but also revealed a prominent population of T lymphocytes (39 ± 12 %). Alkaline phosphatase activity, a cytochemical marker for lymphoid cells of follicular cuffs, was most consistently observed in B-cell lymphomas of moderately well differentiated lymphocytic type (4 / 6 cases). In some diffuse lymphomas, cryostat section studies (EAC rosettes) suggested a pre-existing nodular proliferation. One unusual B-cell lymphoma of large cell type exhibited IgGEA rosette formation and a strong receptor for the Fc portion of IgG.

In contrast, the tumor cells of true <b>histiocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> exhibited a marker expression {{very similar to that}} of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease. These cells expressed markers CD 30, 2 H 9, and 1 A 2, but rarely expressed CD 11 b, CD 11 c, CD 14, or CD 45. Regardless of their cytologic features, the tumor cells from both types of <b>histiocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> exhibited diffuse nonspecific esterase and acid phosphatase activities, and they expressed histiocyte markers CD 15, CD 68, LN 5, 1 E 9, and M 387 to varying degrees.

Polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated clonal T-cells and developing rearrangement in TCRβchain gene. 　In spite of rare proliferating cells in the T-cells and no complication of hemophagocytic syndrome and high-grade T-cell lymphoma，these recurrent peculiar subcutaneous nodules were diagnosed as those of an early phase of CHP/PLTL under the consideration of its pathogenesis. ...|$|R

S ECONDARY ACUTE nonlymphoblastic leukemias (ANLL) are being reported with increasing frequency in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) who have been treated with intensive combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Such secondary leukemias {{may be difficult to}} distinguish from leukemic progression of the lymphoma in a given patient.

40|$|Fever not {{explained}} by infection may occur {{in patients with}} malignant lymphoma presumably caused by a release of endogenous pyrogen. Although pyrogen {{has been found in}} some tumors with a mixed cell population, production of endogenous pyrogen by the neoplastic cells has not been demonstrated. This report documents the apparently spontaneous synthesis and release of such pyrogen by two human tumor cell lines derived from patients with Hodgkin's disease and <b>histiocytic</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> The endogenous pyrogen from the two cell lines was similar and closely resembled that produced by normal human monocytes in antigenic properties as well as heat and pronase sensitivity. The Hodgkin's disease and <b>histiocytic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cell lines do not require specific stimulation for the production of endogenous pyrogen suggesting that the mechanism of pyrogen release by neoplastic macrophage-related cells differs from that of normal phagocytic cells. The tumor-associated fever in some patients with malignant lymphoma may be caused by a release of endogenous pyrogen by proliferating neoplastic cells...|$|E
40|$|The subtle {{morphology}} {{and functional}} properties of cells {{are the best}} parameters to use for their definition. This is also true for the corresponding tumours, especially malignant lymphomata. In studies of 106 cases of malignant lymphoma we therefore applied as morphological methods haematological staining (Giemsa in sections and imprints) and electron microscopic analysis. As functional criteria we used the nonspecific esterase reaction to define tumours of histiocytes and an estimation of the immunoglobulin content of tissue extracts and single cells to define tumours of B lymphocytes and their derivatives. By combining all of these methods {{it was possible to}} propose a new classification. Whereas not one <b>histiocytic</b> malignant <b>lymphoma</b> ("reticulosarcoma") was found in the series, at least most of the malignant lymphomata investigated seemed to be derived from the B lymphocyte system. The following types are distinguished: (1) Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; (2) diffuse germinocytoma (malignant lymphoma, lymphocytic, intermediate); (3) germinoblastoma (follicular, follicular and diffuse, diffuse; sclerotic, nonsclerotic) which can show a transition into germinoblastic sarcoma; (4) immunoblastic sarcoma of the B cell type (previously called reticulo-sarcoma); (5) lymphoplasmocytoid immunocytoma, which may be associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia and can show a mixed cellularity; (6) lymphoblastic (paraleukoblastic) sarcoma and leukaemia, which are, at least in most cases, probably neoplasias of germinoblasts. All of these lymphomata can produce immunoglobulins. Sixty-seven cases showed an Ig increase in the tumour. This was mostly IgM, but sometimes IgG, IgA, IgD and/or IgE. A morphological equivalent of even abnormal Ig secretion is the globular positive (diastase resistant) PAS reaction in lymphoid cells (not in the histiocytes) in paraffin sections, which we found in 43 cases. Only 19 of the 63 cases with an IgM increase in the tumour showed an increase of IgM in the serum. WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinaemia is a facultative symptom of morphologically different malignant lymphomata and should therefore be considered only as a clinical syndrome and not as a nosological entity...|$|R
40|$|Skp 1 -Cul 1 -F-box (SCF) E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase complexes modulate {{the accumulation}} of key cell cycle regulatory proteins. Following the G 1 /S transition, SCFFbx 4 targets cyclin D 1 for proteasomal degradation, a critical event necessary for DNA replication fidelity. Deregulated cyclin D 1 drives tumorigenesis, and inactivating mutations in Fbx 4 {{have been identified in}} human cancer, suggesting that Fbx 4 may function as a tumor suppressor. Fbx 4 +/− and Fbx 4 −/− mice succumb to multiple tumor phenotypes, including <b>lymphomas,</b> <b>histiocytic</b> sarcomas and, less frequently, mammary and hepatocellular carcinomas. Tumors and premalignant tissue from Fbx 4 +/− and Fbx 4 −/− mice exhibit elevated cyclin D 1, an observation consistent with cyclin D 1 as a target of Fbx 4. Molecular dissection of the Fbx 4 regulatory network in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed that loss of Fbx 4 results in cyclin D 1 stabilization and nuclear accumulation throughout cell division. Increased proliferation in early passage primary MEFs is antagonized by DNA damage checkpoint activation, consistent with nuclear cyclin D 1 -driven genomic instability. Furthermore, Fbx 4 −/− MEFs exhibited increased susceptibility to Ras-dependent transformation in vitro, analogous to tumorigenesis observed in mice. Collectively, these data reveal a requisite role for the SCFFbx 4 E 3 ubiquitin ligase in regulating cyclin D 1 accumulation, consistent with tumor suppressive function in vivo...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic appearance of various focal, space-occupying renal lesions and determine its value in their detection and characterization. Following baseline B-mode sonography of 15 dogs and one cat with renal space-occupying lesion(s), contrast-enhanced sonography was performed. The resulting images were evaluated qualitatively using conspicuity {{and number of}} lesions, and enhancement patterns were assessed during early arterial and late corticomedullary phases. Renal lesions were malignant in the cat (renal cell carcinoma) and 10 dogs (four renal cell carcinoma, two histiocytic sarcoma, one B-cell lymphoma, two hemangiosarcoma metastasis, one chemodectoma metastasis) and benign in five dogs (two abscesses, one traumatic hematoma, one idiopathic hematoma, one hemorrhagic/necrotic nodule). Substantial overlap was present regarding the baseline sonographic features of benign vs. malignant lesions. With contrast-enhanced sonography, all renal cell carcinomas were characterized by large tortuous arteries, sometimes enhancing slightly earlier than vessels in the surrounding normal kidney. During the late corticomedullary phase, renal cell carcinomas had intense homo- or heterogeneous, iso- or slightly hypoechoic enhancement, which decreased progressively. Compared with renal cell carcinoma, <b>histiocytic</b> sarcoma and <b>lymphoma</b> had smaller and less obvious arteries, and an earlier loss of enhancement during the late phase. All hemangiosarcoma metastases appeared as nonenhancing nodules during the early arterial and late corticomedullary phases of enhancement, and additional lesions were detected. Histiocytic sarcoma and benign lesions had increased conspicuity with baseline sonography. The descriptions provided herein will be valuable as more work is done to establish the role of contrast-enhanced sonography {{in the assessment of}} renal lesion...|$|R
