Cross-file system data sharing with history is provided by a new mechanism called grafting.

ECMO is a high-risk procedure in critically ill patients and both technical and patient-related complications frequently occur. We report on a patient with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis (histiocytosis x), in whom ECMO was used as bridge to urgent lung transplantation. Respiratory insufficiency necessitating ECMO therapy was due to spontaneous pneumothorax with bronchopleural fistula. Access was initially made by femoral veno-venous canulation.

Despite marked hemodynamic improvement after this intervention, high flow rates creating high premembrane pressures were required to ensure oxygenation.

METHODS: A 74 -year-old Swedish patient with heart failure had access to a Nintendo Wii at home for 12 weeks. Exercise motivation, exercise self-efficacy and exercise capacity were assessed before and after the intervention. Data on perceived physical effort, global well-being and expended energy were collected every day during the intervention. RESULTS: During the 12 weeks of access to the Nintendo Wii, daily physical activity increased by 200 % on weekdays and 57 % on weekends, compared with baseline. The patient’s exercise motivation and exercise self-efficacy increased during the study, whereas perceived physical effort and global well-being did not change.

40|$|Background: Open {{fractures}} {{of tibia}} have posed great difficulty in managing both {{the soft tissue}} and the skeletal components of the injured limb. Gustilo Anderson III B open tibial fractures {{are more difficult to}} manage than I, II, and III A fractures. Stable skeletal fixation with immediate soft tissue cover has been the key to the successful outcome in treating open tibial fractures, in particular, Gustilo Anderson III B types. If the length of the open wound is larger and if the exposed surface of tibial fracture and tibial shaft is greater, then the management becomes still more difficult. Materials and Methods: Thirty six Gustilo Anderson III B open tibial fractures managed between June 2002 and December 2013 with "fix and shift" technique were retrospectively reviewed. All the 36 patients managed by this technique had open wounds measuring > 5 cm (post debridement). Under fix and shift technique, stable fixation involved primary external fixator application or primary intramedullary nailing of the tibial fracture and immediate soft tissue cover involved septocutaneous shift, i. e., shifting of fasciocutaneous segments based on septocutaneous perforators. Results: Primary fracture union rate was 50 % and reoperation rate (bone stimulating procedures) was 50 %. Overall fracture union rate was 100 %. The rate of malunion was 14 % and deep infection was 16 %. Failure of septocutaneous shift was 2. 7 %. There was no incidence of amputation. Conclusion: Management of Gustilo Anderson III B open tibial fractures with "fix and shift" technique has resulted in better outcome in terms of skeletal factors (primary fracture union, overall union, and time for union and malunion) and soft tissue factors (wound healing, flap <b>failure,</b> <b>access</b> to secondary procedures, and esthetic appearance) when compared to standard methods adopted earlier. Hence, "fix and shift" could be recommended as one of the treatment modalities for open III B tibial fractures...|$|E
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β 1 {{genotype}} polymorphisms determine AV fistula patency in hemodialysis patients. BackgroundIn hemodialysis patients with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> is {{primarily due to}} fistula stenosis, which predisposes to thrombosis and subsequent access loss. The risk for <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> differs interindividually, an observation that is independent from vascular anatomy in {{a significant number of}} patients. Fistula stenosis is histologically characterized by intimal hyperplasia, which is induced by growth factors, among which transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β 1) is of major importance. The quantitative production of TGF-β 1 interindividually differs due to polymorphisms in the gene region encoding the signal sequence of the cytokine. We hypothesized that the TGF-β 1 genotype, by influencing the development of arteriovenous fistula stenosis, determines the risk for vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> MethodsOne hundred twenty patients who had undergone placement of an AV fistula for initiation of hemodialysis treatment were genotyped for the polymorphic bases at position + 869 and + 915 of the TGF-β 1 gene. The primary end-point was time from fistula placement to <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> ResultsAV fistula patency was significantly associated with the TGF-β 1 genotype (P = 0. 0046); patency was 62. 4 % and 81. 2 % after 12 months for TGF-β 1 high and intermediate producers, respectively. In contrast, AV fistula patency neither differed between diabetic and nondiabetic patients, nor between patients with and without manifest cardiovascular disease. ConclusionPolymorphisms in the gene region encoding the signal sequence of TGF-β 1 influence the risk for hemodialysis <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> By inducing synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, overproduction of TGF-β 1 may accelerate the development of intimal hyperplasia, resulting in fistula stenosis and subsequent <b>access</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) {{is a large}} myosin {{associated}} {{protein that}} is frequently mutated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Despite a burst of research since the early 90 s, our understanding of its mechanism in muscle physiology remains elusive. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} the cardiac isoform of MyBP-C serves as a regulator of actomyosin contractility where it functions as both a “break” and “accelerator” in in vitro motility assays. Its absence in MYBPC 3 -knockout mice fibers promotes hyper-contractile function indicating that it may function to slow down actomyosin kinetics. We begin, in Chapter 3, by identifying whether genotype-phenotype relationship exists in human HCM samples with MYBPC 3 mutations scattered along its sequence. No differences in fiber contractility were observed in comparing mutation types (missense vs. nonsense), or location of mutations (N- vs. C-terminus). Our findings show HCM with MyBP-C mutants behave in a similar manner to HCM without sarcomeric mutations. Moreover, we demonstrate that HCM as a whole differs quite significantly from donors, but only in the presence of calcium. Intriguingly, upon examination of each individual mutation, the N-terminal V 219 mutation located in the C 1 domain clearly deviated from mutants clustered in the C 3 -C 9 domains. This suggests that the N-terminal portion of MyBP-C, that is known to interact with actin or myosin, plays a potentially significant role in regulating contractility. As such, in Chapter 4, our focus shifted from complex fiber contractility to a simplified in vitro motility system. The latter enables direct interrogation of how the N-terminus of MyBP-C regulates actomyosin kinetics on the molecular level. Chapter 4 utilised N-terminal MyBP-C fragments with engineered site-directed mutagenesis that has been previously shown to ablate actin- or myosin-binding. Surprisingly, these fragments containing the actin- or myosin-binding mutations by and large prevented the thin filament from switching on at low calcium, coupled with more inhibition at higher calcium concentrations. These mutants also reduced thin filament binding affinity but myosin affinity was unaffected. Overall, these findings suggest that the N-terminus of MyBP-C interacts strongly with the thin filament, and mutations in this area will probably diminish this interaction. The role MyBP-C plays in regulating cardiac physiology is complex. In addition to mutations, the expression of skeletal isoforms of MyBP-C was also previously identified in the failing heart. Chapter 5 investigated the role of fast and slow skeletal MyBP-C in relation to the known function of the cardiac N-terminus. In a cardiac based system, the slow isoform behaves solely as an accelerator while the fast isoform operates predominately as a brake – {{in stark contrast to the}} dual-modal regulation of the cardiac isoform. Furthermore, Chapter 6 demonstrated that PKA-phosphorylation reduced the thin filament’s sensitivity to calcium. Phosphorylation seemed to hold little to no effect on the slow MyBP-C fragment whereas inhibition was lost upon phosphorylation of the fast fragments. Overall there is a considerable amount of work ahead of us to resolve the function of MyBP-C in muscle. The recent shift towards skeletal MyBP-C function is an interesting avenue to explore how small structural differences can ultimately alter its response to and regulation of the contractile system. Moreover, our understanding of this family of thick filament regulators poses as a potential therapeutic target for contractile-system based heart and skeletal muscle <b>failure.</b> <b>Access</b> is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.
