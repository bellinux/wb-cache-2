This visual analysis is part of learning strategy based on an exploratory approach of data. We demonstrate by variations around basic graphs, such as <b>histograms,</b> <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> scatter plots, rotating plots, contour plots, how an inexperienced user in statistics can better assimilate the object of statistics and get a better understanding of the limits of statistical treatments from his/her own mental representations. To explain the importance of mental representations in mathematics, we refer to the cognitive psychology and especially to neurosciences of learning. The methodology of the active pedagogy is based on the triptych : exploration, verbalization, formalization, in accordance to the headways of the new science of learning.

A questionnaire has been designed, using 12 items with multiple answers, grouped in four tasks where translations between text, tables and dots <b>charts,</b> <b>histograms,</b> <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> stem and leaf charts and boxes graphs take part. A number of 72 students of Primary Teacher Training have answered the test, before and after they have passed a process of Descriptive Statistics learning session, for approximately 12 hours. Results show little differences in capacities {{of translation}} in different tasks, but only some graphs show a bigger difficulty, although it gets reduced but do not disappear after the educational process has been done. The data has been analyzed using the Rasch methodology, the study shows that the order of difficulty of items doesn’t change after the process but, this analysis allows us to consider that students improve remarkably their knowledge and understanding.

40|$|Examining data using {{graphical}} tools, such as <b>histograms,</b> <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> quantile plots, scatterplots {{and other}} statistical graphics, {{is a necessary}} part of any serious analysis effort. Statistical graphics are typically most useful at two stages of an analysis. Initially, plots are useful for data cleansing [cross-ref. C 2. 1] where unusual sets of values can be investigated, attribute distributions can be evaluated and transformations can be suggested using graphical techniques. After a data mining model has been built, similar techniques can be used to validate the results of the model, highlight unusual or atypical results and present the model in a way that facilitates understanding [cross-ref. C 8. 1, C 9] With the advent of cheap graphics-capable desktop computing, these tools have become widely available. But the use of computers enables more than simply reproducing static plots on a display; it allows users to interact with plots, changing parameters, querying, zooming and linking plots together so that interesting features of one plot {{can be seen in the}} light of the others. Interactive statistical graphics explore data by manipulating a graphical representation of the data. Becker et al. (1987) define the process thus: &quot;The data analyst takes an action through manual manipulation of an input device and something happens on the screen.

40|$|Abstract: Data on {{the ages}} of persons are often grouped in tables. However, unequal bin widths are {{frequently}} used in setting up the groupings. This {{can lead to a}} variety of distortions, depending on the degree to which adjustments are made for nonuniformity in the bin widths of the groups. Using motor vehicle crash data, the issues are illustrated via <b>histograms</b> and <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> produced with SAS/INSIGHT visualization and analysis software and with SAS/GRAPH. The principles extend to any variable grouped with unequal bin widths. In particular, {{it is important to be}} aware of the difference between density and relative frequency. Finally, authors and software developers are urged to give greater attention to the concept of density and the proper labeling of the y-axis of a histogram. ...|$|R
40|$|For more urbanization, {{engineering}} structures {{are not limited}} to underground tunnels or metro stations, engineers are constructing underground multistoried building even underground city. Therefore accurate assessment of rock strength is necessary for the rational design of underground structures. Bearing capacity {{is one of the most}} important factor for assessment of rock strength. Various studies on determination of bearing capacity for intact as well as jointed rock mass have been performed. Concisely, various studies have been performed for determination of bearing capacity of rock mass under dry condition while for submerged condition, it is outnumbered. In this study, determination of submerged bearing capacity of rock mass is attempted. Most cases, the rock substratum is considered to be homogeneous, intact, but the practical scenario does not recommend so. In-situ rock mass variability renders the deterministic analysis to be inefficient and hence there arises the necessity for probabilistic or reliability analyses to model the uncertainties. Rather than calculating a deterministic factor of safety, a reliability based analysis is more appropriate for geotechnical design. Present study comprises of different aspects regarding ultimate bearing capacity of rock foundations for both dry and submerged condition. These are, development of algorithmic modelling for determination of ultimate bearing capacity for both dry and submerged condition, analysis of behavior of ultimate bearing capacity due to the effect of submergence, comparative study between theorem mechanisms and reliability analysis through Monte-Carlo simulation for various parameters of rock mass. The data generated from the mentioned aspects are represented in graphical form and <b>histogram</b> <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> are developed from Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R

50|$|Bar graphs {{can also}} be used for more complex {{comparisons}} of data with grouped <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> and stacked <b>bar</b> <b>charts.</b> In a grouped <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> for each categorical group there are two or more bars. These bars are color-coded to represent a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with different colored bars to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would show the revenue. Alternatively, a stacked <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> could be used. The stacked <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> stacks <b>bars</b> that represent different groups on top of each other.

40|$|Basic <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> {{have been}} {{commonly}} available, but they only show highly aggregated data. Finding the valuable information {{hidden in the}} data {{is essential to the}} success of business. We describe a new visualization technique called pixel <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> which are derived from regular <b>bar</b> <b>charts.</b> The basic idea of a pixel <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is to present all data values directly instead of aggregating them into a few data values. Pixel <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> provide data distribution and exceptions besides aggregated data. The approach is to represent each data item (e. g. a business transaction) by a single pixel in the <b>bar</b> <b>chart.</b> The attribute of each data item is encoded into the pixel color and can be accessed and drilled down to the detail information as needed. Different color mappings are used to represent multiple attributes.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} {{double sampling}} (SDS) (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> comprises the double sampling (DS) (X) over bar and conforming run length (CRL) sub-charts. The SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> {{has been studied}} under the assumption of known process parameters in the literature. Nevertheless, in practice, process parameters are usually unknown and are estimated from an in-control Phase I dataset. This paper investigates {{the performance of the}} SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters, in terms of the average run length (ARL), average number of observations to signal (ANOS) and standard deviation of the run length (SDRL). The performance of the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters by minimizing the out-of-control ARL and the out-of-control ANOS is compared with the corresponding chart's performance with known process parameters. In addition, the minimum number of Phase I samples required by the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters so that it has approximately the same in-control ARL and ANOS performances as the chart with known process parameters is studied. The ARL, ANOS and SDRL properties of the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters differ significantly from that of the chart with known process parameters. Therefore, suitable optimal charting parameters are introduced so that the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters has an adequate performance as its known process parameters counterpart without having to use large number of Phase I samples and sample size...|$|R

40|$|The double {{sampling}} (DS) X <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> {{one of the}} most widely-used charting methods, is superior for detecting small and moderate shifts in the process mean.

In this paper, therefore, MRL is used as the performance criterion instead of the traditional ARL. Generally, the performance of the DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is investigated under the assumption of known process parameters. In practice, these parameters are usually estimated from an in-control reference Phase-I dataset. Since the performance of the DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is significantly affected by estimation errors, we study the effects of parameter estimation on the MRL-based DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> when the in-control average sample size is minimised.
