40|$|Improvedmethods for {{assessing}} cereal crop feed value are {{a prerequisite for}} the genetic improvement of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] feed value. Rate of starch digestion is now commonly {{believed to be the}} limiting factor in sorghum utilization by cattle (Bos taurus). However, techniques to assess this trait are not useful to sorghum breeders because of high labor inputs, lab error associated with starch measurement, and need for high numbers of replications. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a simple technique capable of identifying differences in digestion between sorghum and corn (Zea mays L.) and detecting differences among sorghum genotypes. In vitro starch and dry matter digestion were measured on sorghum and corn lab standards at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 40 h. Maximum differentiation between corn and sorghum dry matter digestion (345 vs. 253 g kg 21) and starch digestion (403 vs. 301 g kg 21) occurred at 12 h, and dry matter and starch digestion were highly correlated. Differences among five sorghum lines were significant for 12 -h dry matter digestion and ranged from 229 to 272 g kg 21. This procedure provides a precise and rapid technique that can be used by feed grain breeders to evaluate modifications in <b>grain</b> <b>digestion</b> parameters...|$|E
40|$|Feeding grain whole to cattle {{generally}} {{results in}} a lower digestibility than that obtained with processed grain. If this problem could be overcome, feeding with whole grain would reduce processing costs, and the slower rate of starch digestion in the rumen could improve fibre digestion with potential beneficial effects on intake and animal production. Two strategies are available to increase the digestibility of whole grain. The first, longer term strategy relies on the selection or breeding of feed grains that are efficiently digested by cattle when fed whole. The review considers the chemical and physical properties of grains likely to increase the degree of grain damage during mastication, and increase the digestibility of the seed coat fraction. Research is required to determine the feasibility of selecting feed grains with these characteristics. The second strategy is to treat whole grain with chemicals or enzymes to increase digestibility of the seed coat and consequently whole <b>grain</b> <b>digestion</b> within the rumen. Considerable {{research has been conducted}} on the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment of grain, and there is sufficient evidence from cattle experiments to indicate that digestibility, liveweight gain, and milk production on NaOH-treated whole grain can be similar to that on rolled grain, provided sufficient NaOH is applied. However, a number of practical and commercial considerations have limited the more widespread adoption of this technology on farms. Although ammonia treatment offers a more practical alternative to NaOH, digestibility and animal production responses have been highly variable, and research is required to identify effective ammoniation procedures. The increased availability of enzymes for livestock feeding has potentially provided another grain treatment option. The application of fibrolytic enzymes to whole grain prior to high-moisture storage or feeding, and their subsequent effect on grain digestibility, require research. The impact of grain characteristics, both physical and chemical, on the response to alkali or enzyme treatment also requires research...|$|E

CABI Publishing, ISBN: 0851993699, 337 Main Description: The Encyclopedia of Farm Animal Nutrition {{deals with}} the whole of farm animal nutrition, {{embracing}} {{a wide range of}} disciplines, including physiology, biochemistry, veterinary medicine and feed technology. The encyclopedia contains approximately 2000 entries from 90 contributors. These entries range from short definitions to more discursive articles, all entries are fully cross-referenced to aid further research. The encyclopedia covers every type of farm animal found in both developing and developed countries, including cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, goats, horses, fish, deer, buffaloes, rabbits and camelids, as well as ducks, turkeys, ostriches and other birds. Sample Entries: Acylglycerol, A form of lipid made up of one glycerol molecule combined with three individual (not necessarily identical) fatty acid molecules attached to the glycerol by ester bonds. Acylglycerols form part of the neutral lipid fraction. Free fatty acids (FFAs), Also called non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), fatty acids that are not esterified to glycerol or another alcohol such as choline or cholesterol. In blood plasma or serum, FFAs are really not free but bound to plasma albumin. Locust bean, Properly the fruit of the African locust bean tree (Parkia filicoidea) but the name is frequently applied to the fruit of the carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua). The latter originated in the eastern Mediterranean region and is also found in the subtropics. The fruits are thick, fleshy (more so in the carob) pods each containing about a dozen seeds. The seeds are tough and must be crushed before feeding. The resulting meal has a high sugar and energy content and is very palatable but is low in protein (42 - 54 g kg- 1). Oyster Shell, Oyster shells are almost pure calcium carbonate (95 - 99 %) and are good sources of calcium for all classes of animals. Clam shells, conch shells, coral and coral sand can all be used for feeding. Shells that have been ground to coarse grit tend to be more palatable to laying hens and help <b>grain</b> <b>digestion</b> in the gizzard, as well as producing strong eggshells. For laying hens the shells should be ground to 0. 5 - 2. 0 mm and mixed 2 : 1 with finely ground limestone. Pacu, A commercially important freshwater fish native to the rivers of Brazil. This large migratory fish reaches 60 cm in length and is a scavenger that eats vegetation, mostly of fruit that falls into the water as well as an occasional small fish or insect.

40|$|The time-course of starch {{digestion}} in twin-screw extruded milled sorghum grain {{was investigated}} using an in-vitro procedure based on glucometry. The sorghum grains were hammer-milled, and extruded at three levels each of moisture and screw speed. Irrespective of the extrusion conditions, extruded and non-extruded milled sorghum grain exhibited monophasic digestograms, and the modified first-order kinetic and Peleg models adequately described the digestograms. Extrusion increased {{the rate of}} digestion by about ten times compared with non-extrudates. Starch gelatinisation varied in the extrudates, and microscopy revealed a mixture of raw, gelatinised and destructured starch and protein components in the extrudates. Starch digestion parameters significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated with extruder response and various functional properties of the extrudates. Extrusion conditions for maximum starch gelatinisation in milled sorghum <b>grain</b> for fastest <b>digestion</b> as an efficient animal feed were interpolated, {{as well as the}} conditions for directly-expanded extrudates with potential for human food, where minimum starch digestion is desired.

40|$|Spent grains (SG), {{the residue}} {{remaining}} after extraction of wort, {{are a major}} by-product of brewing. This lignocelluose-rich biomass may provide a source of sugars for fuel ethanol fermentations. Dilute acid and enzyme treatments were developed to convert the hemicellulose and cellulose fractions to glucose, xylose and arabinose. Pretreatment of dried, milled grains with 0. 16 N HNO 3 at 121 1 C for 15 min {{was chosen as the}} most suitable method for solubilizing <b>grains</b> before enzymatic <b>digestion</b> with cellulase and hemicellulase preparations. Solids loading concentrations (10 %, 15 % and 20 % w/v) were compared and reducing sugar between 40 and 48 g (100 g SG) 1 was extracted. Hydrolysate, prepared from 20 % SG, pretreated with 0. 16 N HNO 3, partially neutralized to pH 5 – 6 and digested with enzymes for 18 h, contained 27 g L 1 glucose, 16. 7 g L 1 xylose and 11. 9 g L 1 arabinose. Fermentation of this hydrolysate for 48 h by Pichia stipitis and Kluyveromyces marxianus resulted in 8. 3 and 5. 9 g L 1 ethanol corresponding to ethanol conversion yields of 0. 32 and 0. 23 g ethanol (g substrate) 1, respectively. Substrate utilization efficiency was less when compared with glucose/xylose mixtures in synthetic media, suggesting that yeast inhibitory compounds derived from SG were present in the hydrolysate...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for the determination of total arsenic in rice <b>grain</b> by microwave-assisted <b>digestion</b> inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Standard calibration solutions were matrix-matched with respect to acid concentration and carbon content post-digest. The importance of eliminating the drying step during sample preparation procedures was investigated. The method was validated with spikes containing standard arsenate solutions into the rice matrix, and with certified reference material SRM 1568 a (rice flour) from NIST. The method was successfully applied to a commercially available rice sample. ^ Four arsenic species [arsenate (As(V)), arsenite (As(III)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) ] were extracted from rice grains by microwave-assisted extraction and separated with high performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The method includes a novel sample clean-up step involving a dialysis procedure to decrease the amount of large starch molecules in the injection solution, {{in order to minimize}} poor resolution of chromatographic peaks and maximize column life. The method was validated with spikes of standard arsenic solutions, added to the rice matrix before the extraction procedure. Literature reference values for arsenic species quantification in SRM 1568 a (rice flour) were also compared. This method was successfully applied to a commercially available rice sample. ^ A study into improvements in reverse phase-HPLC separations of arsenic species was conducted. For the first time, a Sunfire C 8 column from Waters (Milford, CT) was employed for the separation of arsenic species in rice extracts. This column was compared to a Symmetry C 8 column with respect to total elution time, detection limits, interference effects, and column life, and evaluated with respect to peak resolution, shifts in retention times, and peak symmetry. ...|$|R

The inﬂ uence of pressure-cooking (121 °C and 141 kPa) for 30 min on, trypsin inhibitors concentration and inhibitors reactivation from ten Brazilian beans varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris L. namely: IAPAR- 14, IAC-Carioca, Rudá, Corrente, IAC-Aruã, IAPAR- 16, IAPAR- 57, IAC-Carioca Pyatã, Carioca, Aporé, were investigated. The inhibitors reactivation was evaluated {{in comparison with}} the activity of raw and pressure-cooking. For raw the in vitro protein digestibility mean values ranged from 40 % (in Carioca cultivar) to 60 % (in IAC-Aruã cultivar), showing an increase from 11 % to 37 % using the autoclaving at 121 °C and 141 kPa. Among ten cultivars studied the trypsin inhibitor activity varied from 36. 18 UTI. mg- 1 for IAC-Aruã to 63. 33 UTI. mg- 1 for IAPAR- 16. Trypsin inhibitor activity was totally inactivated by pressure-cooking. The study of the trypsin inhibitors reactivation using double-digestive pepsin-pancreatin enzymes in vitro showed a recovering activity from 34 % up to 100 %. Native inhibitor is resistant to double- digestive pepsin-pancreatin proteolysis, whereas autoclaving to 121 oC. 30 min- 1 results in a non-native conformation that is susceptible to proteolysis, improving the digestibility and inactivate differentially the activity of trypsin inhibitors. The results of the thermal treatment of the beans show inactivation of the inhibitors, which may be due to formation of high molecular weight aggregates with other substances of the <b>grain.</b> The pepsin-pancreatin <b>digestion</b> of the inactivated inhibitor restores the activity, probably due to its retention by the digested fragments...|$|R
40|$|Quality of grain, next to yield, is {{the most}} {{important}} factor for rice (Oryza sativa L.) production in semi-arid tropical Australia. Studies were undertaken in the Burdekin River Irrigation Area of northern Australia to improve rice grain quality through nitrogen fertilisation. This paper reports the results of 4 experiments comparing the response of 3 rice genotypes differing in maturity and stature to 5 rates of applied nitrogen (0, 70, 140, 210, and 280 kg/ha) over 4 seasons (2 wet and 2 dry seasons). The components of grain quality studied were endosperm chalkiness, whole grain millout, <b>grain</b> size, alkali <b>digestion</b> (gelatinisation temperature), and grain protein. This paper also examines the suitability of the 3 genotypes as parental material in breeding programs aimed at selecting for specific grain quality attributes. Starbonnet was identified as a potential parent in breeding programs which aim to specifically select for reduced chalkiness and high millout in low N environments. Selection for lower chalkiness, and higher millout and protein concentration, should occur {{in a wide range of}} target environments to account for the seasonal variation observed in these parameters. Grain size appeared to be affected more by genetic than agronomic factors, since grain length and breadth were largely unaffected by N rate, yet genotypic differences were found for both parameters in all experiments. Newbonnet grain was long and slender, suggesting this genotype would be a suitable parent in breeding programs aimed at improving grain appearance. The response of alkali digestion to N rate and genotype was small for all seasons. The importance of developing N fertiliser strategies that optimise both grain yield and quality was highlighted by differences in the responses of grain protein and grain yield to N rate. A number of linkages were examined among various components of grain quality. However, the magnitude of these linkages was small, suggesting that selection for one quality component should not be at the expense of selection for another...|$|R

[...] It usually occurs after the inhalation of the gas beyond the threshold limit value.Nitrogen dioxide is reddish-brown with very harsh smell at high concentrations. It is colorless and odorless at lower concentration but yet harmful. Nitrogen dioxide poisoning depends on the duration, frequency, and intensity of exposure.Nitrogen dioxide is an irritant of the mucous membrane linked with another air pollutant that causes pulmonary diseases such as OLD, asthma, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and sometimes acute exacerbation of COPD and in fatal cases, deaths.Its poor solubility in water enhances its passage and its ability to pass through the moist oral mucosa of the respiratory tract.Like most toxic gases, the dose inhaled determines the toxicity on the respiratory tract. Occupational exposures constitute the highest risk of toxicity and domestic exposure is uncommon. Prolonged exposure to low concentration of the gas may have lethal effects, as can short-term exposure to high concentrations like chlorine gas poisoning. It {{is one of the major}} air pollutant capable of causing severe heath hazards such as coronary artery disease as well as stroke.Nitrogen dioxide is often released into the environment as a byproduct of fuel combustion but rarely released by spontaneous combustion. Known sources of nitrogen gas poisoning include automobile exhaust and power stations. The toxicity may also result from non-combustible sources such as the one released from anaerobic fermentation of food <b>grains</b> and anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of biodegradable waste.The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a global recommendation limiting exposures to less than 20 parts per billion for chronic exposure and value less 100 ppb for one hour for acute exposure, using nitrogen dioxide as a marker for other pollutants from fuel combustion.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine effects of source of forage and starch degradability on milk production, digestibility and passage in Holstein cows. A preliminary experiment showed that sampling site, dosing time and passage model had little influence on passage parameter estimates for grain in lactating cows. Mean retention times were 17 and 25 h for duodenal and fecal sampling, respectively, and 16 and 18 h at the duodenal site and 24 and 26 h at the fecal site for doses given before rather than after feeding, respectively. In an 8 wk trial cows in early lactation were fed diets with 30 % NDF with forage NDF from wheat straw or alfalfa hay in proportions of 0 : 3, 1 : 2, 2 : 1 or 3 : 0. Intake and milk yield were not influenced, but milk fat percentage, acetate to propionate ratio (C 2 :C 3) and persistence were decreased with increasing straw, and yield of FCM decreased on all straw. Ratio of forage NDF to ruminally degradable starch (FNDF:RDS) was 1. 10 1. 01,. 92 and. 84 in 0 : 3, 1 : 2, 2 : 1 and 3 : 0 diets, respectively, and {{it was concluded that}} a ratio of 1 : 1. Forage source did not influence any performance parameter nor did forage source interact with grain processing. Steam-flaking grain increased milk yield 12 %, milk protein yield 14 % and improved efficiency and persistence. Although milk fat percentage was decreased from 3. 6 to 3. 2, yield of milk fat was not influenced. It was concluded that increasing starch degradability may improve performance if the ratio of FNDF:RDS is maintained > 1 : 1. In the last experiment, duodenally cannulated cows were fed diets similar to those in the second lactation trial, except straw was substituted for 2 / 3 of the alfalfa hay on an NDF basis. Substituting straw for alfalfa did not influence flow of OM, starch or any CP fraction, but resulted in decreased (54 vs 47 %) ruminal cellulose digestibility. Steam-flaking sorghum <b>grain</b> increased ruminal <b>digestion</b> of starch (74 vs 48 %), increased flow of non-ammonia CP (120 vs 110 % of intake) and bacterial CP (2. 8 vs 2. 2 kg/d), and decreased ruminal digestibility of cellulose (47 vs 53 %), compared to dry-rolling.

40|$|The cosmogenic nuclide 10 Be is a {{tool for}} {{quantifying}} earth surface processes that occur on millennial timescales. 10 Be is produced in the atmosphere (meteoric 10 Be) or in mineral grains (in situ 10 Be). Well-understood nuclear physics, physical mixing processes, and the denudation of regolith control concentrations of in situ 10 Be; in contrast, a combination of geomorphic, pedogenic, geochemical, and biological processes influence meteoric 10 Be concentrations. Some have hypothesized that meteoric 10 Be {{can be used as}} a tracer of sediment movement if meteoric 10 Be is normalized against the concentration of native 9 Be in grain coatings. This study aims to better understand Be dynamics in river sediment systems by further characterizing a large dataset of fluvial sediments (202 total samples from 7 study areas) that have previously been analyzed for in situ and meteoric 10 Be. I determined 9 Be and major element compositions of grain coatings (as the acid-extractable fraction) and <b>grains</b> (by total <b>digestion)</b> of fluvial sediments. I compiled the emical data with characteristics of sample watersheds that I acquired using ArcGIS and with meteoric and in situ 10 Be data from previous studies. With this dataset, I performed a statistical analysis testing relationships between the concentration of meteoric 10 Be and 9 Be in acid-extractable grain coatings, meteoric 10 Be/ 9 Be ratios, 9 Be concentrations in mineral grains, watershed characteristics, and major element compositions of fluvial sediment grains and grain coatings. I calculated meteoric 10 Be/ 9 Be-derived denudation rates using a published mass balance model and compared them to in situ 10 Be-derived denudation rates. Though this thesis focuses on fluvial sediment samples, I also measured 9 Be concentrations of soil, suspended sediment, and glacial lake sediment samples with known meteoric 10 Be or in situ 10 Be concentrations, which can be used in future studies of 9 Be and 10 Be dynamics. I find that meteoric 10 Be and 9 Be concentrations in grain coatings are significantly influenced by geochemical and geomorphic conditions in watersheds. HCl-extracted 9 Be is significantly correlated to total meteoric 10 Be concentrations in all but one study area, suggesting that meteoric 10 Be and 9 Be are well mixed in most, but not all, soil systems. Trends in meteoric 10 Be do not mirror trends in in situ 10 Be. Though normalizing meteoric 10 Be against 9 Be concentrations improves the correlation between meteoric 10 Be and in situ 10 Be in fluvial sediments, the spatial variation in parent 9 Be concentrations and meteoric 10 Be delivery rates, combined with the observation that meteoric 10 Be and 9 Be are not always well mixed, makes it difficult to interpret changes in meteoric 10 Be/ 9 Be across study areas. A mass balance model for deriving meteoric 10 Be/ 9 Be denudation rates helps control for some variation in 9 Be concentrations and meteoric 10 Be delivery rates across study areas, but uncertainties in quantifying these variables for each watershed introduce noise into the correlations between meteoric 10 Be/ 9 Be -derived denudation rates and 10 Beis-derived denudation rates. When considering all samples, meteoric 10 Be/ 9 Be-derived and 10 Beis-derived denudation rates are significantly correlated and have similar central tendencies. However, the 10 Bemet/ 9 Bereactive -derived measure is less sensitive to changes in denudation than the 10 Beis –derived measure...|$|R
