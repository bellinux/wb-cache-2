Hitler's attempt to integrate the Soviet Union into the anti-British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> Molotov in Berlin in November, and he ordered preparations for {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler—accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, {{his former}} naval {{adjutant}} Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> the NSDAP came {{to power}} on 30 January 1933, the SS were {{considered}} a state organization and {{a branch of the}} government. Law enforcement gradually became the purview of the SS, and many SS organizations became de facto government agencies.|$|E

Adolf <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> other Nazi leaders were enraged, and ordered retaliation.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the mutiny, the {{division}} was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training.

5|$|During the Battle of Berlin (16 April 1945– 2 May 1945), <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> {{his staff}} {{lived in the}} {{underground}} Führerbunker while the Red Army approached. On 30 April, when Soviet troops were one or two blocks away from the Reich Chancellery, <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> Eva Braun committed suicide in the Führerbunker. On 2 May, General Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov. Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor. Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide the next day after murdering their six children. On 4–8 May 1945, {{most of the remaining}} German armed forces surrendered unconditionally. The German Instrument of Surrender was signed 8 May, marking the end of the Nazi regime and the end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion was {{postponed}} indefinitely. <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> his generals {{were aware of the}} problems of an invasion. Hitler was not ideologically committed to a long war with Britain and many commentators suggest that German invasion plans were a feint never to be put into action.|$|E

5|$|In late 1930 Goebbels met Magda Quandt, a divorcée who {{had joined}} the party a few months earlier. She worked as a {{volunteer}} in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organize his private papers.

5|$|On 8 November 1923 <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> the SA stormed {{a public}} meeting of 3,000 people {{organised}} by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, {{he announced that}} the national revolution had begun and declared {{the formation of a}} new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.|$|E

5|$|The {{stock market}} in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929.

5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and mass unemployment. During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party was essentially a rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf <b>Hitler</b> <b>and</b> his world view.|$|E
