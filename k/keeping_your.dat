The song begins with a [...] "Kevin Ayers-style psych-pop intro"; [...] "a Beatlesque {{harpsichord}} line" [...] accompanied by intermittent bass and occasional strummed guitar chords with Rhys singing the lines [...] "You're perched so neatly on the fence, you're <b>keeping</b> <b>your</b> cards all to yourself..."

500|$|The game Action Button {{described}} as [...] "about <b>keeping</b> <b>your</b> eyes on balls" [...] {{was inspired by}} tennis. It was released with little advanced notice in early November 2012. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com compared it with Sidhe Interactive's Shatter and VG247 called it a rendition of Breakout. Pocket Gamer Mark Brown likened it to both and further compared it with Alleyway, Arkanoid, and Super Hexagon with a [...] "telekinetic power" [...] to alter the ball's direction apart from the panel (as in Shatter). He found the game frustrating at times when unable to control the ball. Though Brown found TNNS fun, different, and addictive, it had [...] "not quite won [...] over".|$|E
500|$|Both {{managers}} {{approached the}} match {{with a view}} to win, in spite of the Shield's friendly feel. Arsenal manager George Graham opined [...] "Winning is a good habit, so why not start early?" [...] Graham lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: [...] "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is overdone. We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." [...] However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said [...] "Winning means <b>keeping</b> <b>your</b> job, and it can be a delicate situation. But I tell myself I'm not going to fail in this game." [...] Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United [...] "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".|$|E

500|$|... "Jealous" [...] was {{initially}} conceived when Boots {{first saw it}} and the song consisted of [...] "some drums and that synth". He added a [...] "high" [...] melody containing the lines [...] "If you're <b>keeping</b> <b>your</b> promise I'm keeping mine" [...] as he felt it seemed [...] "like a shame something more melodic didn't happen in the song". When Beyoncé's creative team was widely searching for {{the concept of the}} song's music video, the singer sent a clip of a song called [...] "Roach Cock" [...] by Hanni El Khatib to Boots. Inspired by its feel, she requested from him to bring elements of that track to [...] "Jealous". He added a [...] "gnarly fuzz guitar ripping in the background" [...] to the song also present in its final version. Beyoncé explained the meaning of [...] "Jealous" [...] on her iTunes Radio channel, [...] " [...] a song about being human. We all get jealous. It doesn't matter who you are. At some point, it's just inevitable." ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger conceded {{his opponents}} were the better side, but praised his team's resolve, telling reporters: [...] "It was {{important}} to score the first goal and with neither team scoring it remained tight for a long, long period. There were some times {{in the second half}} when we were a bit lucky but we defended very well and to keep a clean sheet is good." [...] He admitted his players had practiced taking penalties, but was quick to point out [...] "you don't score because of the practising – <b>keeping</b> <b>your</b> nerve is more important." [...] Lehmann, who had been side-lined by Wenger {{during the course of the}} season, credited his teammates for scoring all five penalties, and described it as a [...] "big mental achievement." [...] Cole called Arsenal's win a [...] "…great team performance, we didn't have too many chances but we defended really well and battled really hard." [...] Henry, who sat out the final due to injury expressed sympathy for Manchester United, and recollected a similar experience from his early Arsenal career: [...] "I know how they feel because we lost against Liverpool and did not deserve to lose. If your name is on the cup you win it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{was written}} by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its {{producer}} Ian Kirkpatrick, and was included on Dua Lipa's eponymous debut studio album in 2017. Lipa worked on the record during three years, stating that the extended process led to her writing and recording songs until {{she felt she had}} a considerable amount to pick from. When asked what it was like working with younger artists like Lipa and Noah Cyrus, Warren stated that they both were [...] "older souls" [...] and that she helped them to express what they wanted to say. [...] "In both cases they were pretty comfortable telling those stories. [...] end up being true to each artist because it is coming from their story, too," [...] Warren said. Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it. Talking about the song, the artist explained that [...] "'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album. I wanted it to feel very new [...] It's the breakup song that I wish I had when I was breaking up with someone" [...] and that [...] "It's about <b>keeping</b> <b>your</b> distance from someone who's bad for you. I'm setting some rules down so [...] won't go back to that person." [...] "New Rules" [...] was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August 2017. Three days later, a remixed version by Australian DJ Alison Wonderland was released on iTunes.|$|E
