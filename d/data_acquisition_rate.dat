40|$|Abstract The resource-constrained {{nature of}} mote-level {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) poses challenges {{for the design of}} a general-purpose sensor network query processors (SNQPs). Existing SNQPs tend to generate query execution plans (QEPs) that are {{selected on the basis of}} a fixed, implicit expectation, for example, that energy consumption should be kept as small as possible. However, in WSN applications, the same query may be subject to several, possibly conflicting, quality-of-service (QoS) expectations concomitantly (for example maximizing <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates</b> subject to keeping energy consumption low). It is also not uncommon for the QoS expectations to change over the lifetime of a deployment (for example from low to high <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>rates).</b> This paper describes optimization algorithms that respond to stated QoS expectations (about <b>acquisition</b> <b>rate,</b> delivery time, energy consumption and lifetime) when making routing, placement, and timing decisions for in-WSN query processing. The paper shows experimentally that QoS-awareness offers significant benefits in responding to, and reconciling, diverse QoS expectations, thereby enabling QoS-aware SNQPs to generate efficient QEPs for Funded by the EC 7 th Framework Programme and the UK EPSRC WINES Programme.

40|$|Pulse-shape {{analysis}} of the ionization signals from germanium gamma-ray spectrometers is a method for obtaining information that can characterize an event beyond just the total energy deposited in the crystal.

A hardware realization of a real-time digital signal processor for implementing a parametric pulse shape is presented. Specifically, a previously developed method for distinguishing between single-site and multi-site gamma-ray interactions is demonstrated in an on-line digital signal processor, compared with the original off-line pulse-shape analysis routine, and shown to have no significant difference.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the timing advantage of implementing a multiple-fan-beam projection technique using optical fiber sensors for a tomography system. To prepare the sensors {{to be used}} for this projection, a collimator is not needed, but optical fiber lens termination is crucial. In this research, the fiber optic lens for transmitters is modeled by experimental methods to transmit light at an emission angle of 30 deg. Due to this small emission angle, a multiprojection technique can be implemented without the light overlapping. A multiple-fan-beam projection technique is here defined as one allowing more than one emitter to project light at the same time using the switch-mode fan-beam method. This method can increase the optical sensor's ability for flow visualization. For the 32 pairs of sensors used, the two-projection technique and four-projection technique were investigated. Sixteen sets of projections formed one frame of light emission for the two-projection technique, and eight sets did so for the four-projection technique. Compared to the conventional single-light projection used in the switch-mode fan-beam method, multiple-light projection can achieve a higher <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>rate,</b> thus minimizing data loss and producing a more accurate real-time tomographic image.
