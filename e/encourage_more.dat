South Vietnamese soldiers in civilian clothing infiltrated the north, spreading rumours of impending doom. One story was that the communists had a deal with Vietnam's traditional enemy China, allowing two communist Chinese divisions to invade the north. The story reported that the Chinese were raping and pillaging with the tacit approval of the communists. Lansdale hired counterfeiters to produce bogus Viet Minh leaflets on how to behave under communist rule, advising them to create a list of their material possessions so that the communists {{would be able to}} confiscate them more easily, thereby fomenting peasant discontent.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy first {{appears in}} EastEnders at Lucy Beale's (Melissa Suffield) party, where he gets {{pleasure}} from watching {{a fight between}} two girls, and asks other girls to play Twister with him but nobody will. In EastEnders: E20, he helps his friend Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu) with a project to <b>encourage</b> <b>more</b> young people to the church, but his ideas leave them both humiliated. They meet Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and ZsaZsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells ZsaZsa and Leon both his parents {{were killed in a}} drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering ZsaZsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop out of the window. On their last night in the flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive. Knowing they can no longer stay there, he invites ZsaZsa, Mercy and Leon to stay at his house in Wanstead, but Mercy decides to go home to her grandmother.|$|E
5|$|However, when {{a country}} is {{suffering}} from high unemployment or wishes to pursue a policy of export-led growth, a lower exchange rate {{can be seen as}} advantageous. From the early 1980s the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed devaluation as a potential solution for developing nations that are consistently spending more on imports than they earn on exports. A lower value for the home currency will raise the price for imports while making exports cheaper. This tends to <b>encourage</b> <b>more</b> domestic production, which raises employment and gross domestic product (GDP) – though the effect may not be immediate due to the Marshall–Lerner condition. Devaluation can be seen as an attractive solution to unemployment when other options, like increased public spending, are ruled out due to high public debt, or when a country has a balance of payments deficit which a devaluation would help correct. A reason for preferring devaluation common among emerging economies is that maintaining a relatively low exchange rate helps them build up foreign exchange reserves, which can protect against future financial crises.|$|E
