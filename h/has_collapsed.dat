The dome of the Samalanga Mosque, Pidie's central mosque, <b>had</b> <b>collapsed.</b> Massive power outages occurred throughout Pidie and Pidie Jaya as telephone poles and electrical poles tumbled. Several houses collapsed during the quake. Roads were also damaged. Preliminary data suggest that 14 structures <b>had</b> <b>collapsed</b> during the quake, including a minimarket in Pidie. Photos of destroyed houses and buildings were circulated on social media. Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management later [...] "many structures" [...] were damaged, of which 25 suffered heavy damage. Detailed information revealed that 72 stores <b>had</b> <b>collapsed,</b> 15 houses <b>had</b> been destroyed, 1 mall <b>had</b> <b>collapsed,</b> 5 mosques appeared destroyed and an Islamic school also <b>had</b> <b>collapsed.</b> It was reported that dozens of Islamic students were trapped under an Islamic School in Bireun Regency.

5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It {{has been a}} failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply {{sanctions}} except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, <b>has</b> <b>collapsed</b> over half the world.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method that allows a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may reveal that the airway is torn, or that the airways are blocked by blood, or that a bronchus <b>has</b> <b>collapsed,</b> obscuring more distal (lower) bronchi from view.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{return to}} Versailles, Eliza joins Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate at her estate before the {{invasion}} of the Palatinate in her name. Eliza informs William of Orange of the troop movements caused by the French invasion which frees his forces along the border of the Spanish Netherlands, a region of stalemate between France and the Dutch Republic. During her flight from the Electorate of the Palatinate, Eliza becomes pregnant by Louis's cryptographer, though popular knowledge suggested it was the French nobleman Etienne D'Arcachon's child. Meanwhile, William takes the free troops from the border on the Spanish Netherlands to England, precipitating the Glorious Revolution, including the expulsion of JamesII. James flees London and Daniel Waterhouse soon encounters him in a bar. Convinced that the Stuart monarchy <b>has</b> <b>collapsed,</b> Daniel returns to London and takes revenge on Jeffreys by inciting a crowd to capture him for trial and later execution. Though he plans to depart for Massachusetts, Daniel's case of bladder stones increasingly worsens during this period. The Royal Society and other family friends are very aware of this and force Daniel to get the stone removed by Robert Hooke at Bedlam.|$|E

Many local buildings, often crudely constructed, {{were buried in}} the landslides caused by the earthquakes.

5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon <b>has</b> <b>collapsed</b> because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Ahmose's pyramid in Abydos were {{discovered}} in 1899 and identified as his in 1902. Most of its outer casing stones had been robbed for use in other building projects over the years, and the mound of rubble upon which it was built <b>has</b> <b>collapsed.</b> However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by Arthur Mace, who estimated its steep slope as about 60 degrees, {{based on the evidence}} of the limestone casing (compare to the less acute 51 degrees of the Great Pyramid of Giza). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose's queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks stamped with the name of Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma'asara (Tura) in Ahmose's year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its stamped bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.|$|E

Almost the entire hull <b>has</b> <b>collapsed,</b> except for a portion that is held up by the port side boiler. The double hulled bottom of the bow is standing vertical and the bow section <b>has</b> <b>collapsed</b> forwards and downwards into two parts. There are still enormous boilers that remain on site, approximately 2-3 {{times the size of}} a diver and provide a spectacular site for anybody who visits the site and the port main boiler has rolled out and is free of the hull remains. Underneath the collapsed hull, the engine still remains relatively intact.|$|E

He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film’s story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} {{of the floor}} of the canyon system between Candor and Melas chasmata is grooved. This is interpreted to be alluvial deposits and/or material that <b>has</b> <b>collapsed</b> or contracted by the removal of ice or water. There are also portions of older and younger massive floor {{material of}} volcaniclastic origin - only separated in age by crater distribution. Also there is etched massive floor material that is like the younger and older massive material except that it has wind erosion features on it. There are also a few spires of undivided material composed of the same material as the canyon walls.|$|E

While Daleka Obala sported a pop-rock sound influenced by Novi val, Croatian pop and even Dalmatian folk, Majke were a back-to-basics, garage-rock act stylistically influenced by bands like the Black Crowes, Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, as well as their Serbian counterparts Partibrejkers. Laufer, led by Damir Urban (who later went on to form Urban & 4), were an early nineties alternative rock band taking their cue from the grunge movement.|$|E

Louis is inspired to join Alex and begins playing the Starfighter game.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{population}} census, Mandarin and other varieties of Chinese {{are the most common}} languages spoken at home. They are used by 51% of {{the population}}. The table below shows the change in distribution of Mandarin and other Chinese varieties, as well as English, as home languages of the resident Chinese population of Singapore in 1990, 2000 and 2010. It can be observed that the percentage of the population which speaks English and Mandarin has increased, while the percentage of those who speak other Chinese varieties <b>has</b> <b>collapsed</b> and is now limited mainly to the elderly.

25|$|South-East Yoruba was {{probably}} {{associated with the}} expansion of the Benin Empire after c. 1450. In contrast to NWY, lineage and descent are largely multilineal and cognatic, and the division of titles into war and civil is unknown. Linguistically, SEY has retained the /ɣ/ and /gw/ contrast, while it has lowered the nasal vowels /ĩ/ and /ʊ̃/ to /ɛ̃/ and /ɔ̃/, respectively. SEY <b>has</b> <b>collapsed</b> the second and third person plural pronominal forms; thus, àn án wá can mean either 'you (pl.) came' or 'they came' in SEY dialects, whereas NWY for example has ẹ wá 'you (pl.) came' and wọ́n wá 'they came', respectively. The emergence of a plural of respect may have prevented coalescence of the two in NWY dialects.|$|E

25|$|The bouleuterion (council house), or odeon, is {{centered}} {{on the north side}} of the North Agora. As it stands today, it consists of a semicircular auditorium fronted by a shallow stage structure about 46m wide. The lower part of the auditorium survives intact, with nine rows of marble seats divided into five wedges by radial stairways. The seating of the upper part, amounting to an additional twelve rows, <b>has</b> <b>collapsed</b> together with its supporting vaults. The plan is an extremely open one, with numerous entrances at ground level and several stairways giving access to the upper rows of seats. A system of massive parallel buttresses shows that the building was originally vaulted. The auditorium would have been lighted by a series of tall, arched windows in the curved outer wall. Seating capacity can be estimated at about 1750.|$|E
