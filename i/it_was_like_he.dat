500|$|Johansson {{accepted}} the role because she likes cartoons {{and was a}} fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show. When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, [...] "This is me." [...] He remembered the first cartoon he saw, Bambi: [...] "My first cartoon, I had {{to be carried out}} crying It was Bambi. It's like the great American wound: the death of Bambi's mother. 'Run, Bambi, run!'" [...] Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin; Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a [...] "phone": [...] "I wouldn't say that about his performance. He might be mad if we said that. Technically, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was in another booth in the studio." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Jerry Claiborne {{took over}} as {{head coach of the}} Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland {{improved}} to 5–5–1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as [...] "vanilla", and said his strategy was [...] "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." [...] He went on to say, [...] "But, there's no question he made me a tougher player [...] [...] [...] We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had a sign on our back, 'Hit us, we're stupid'. It made you a tougher player." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allan said: After Mess died {{it really}} shocked me how unemotional [...] was. He {{just kind of}} laughed and said, 'Can you believe it?' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> didn’t care about this kid he grew up with. [...] Tsarnaev stopped going to the martial arts center after Mess was murdered, and did not return until March 2013 when he {{suddenly}} visited and acted rudely.|$|E

"That may be {{matter of}} ancient usage, for thou seest he hath relics {{of the fashion}} of the English troopers in this bit of steel; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like,</b> <b>he</b> holdeth deep {{exercise}} over the vanities of his youth, while recalling the times {{in which they were}} worn." ...|$|R

2500|$|From mid-1996 Skunkhour {{created a}} new sound, abandoning spoken-word content and {{focusing}} more on melody. Aya described the re-defining moment when Dean provided the bass guitar for [...] "Foam": [...] "It really turned things around. That bassline is just out of control, and I was like, 'God, I {{want to get on}} this'. When Deano pulled out that bassline <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was leading us into battle." [...] By that time Chris Simms had been added to live gigs as a percussionist. Their third album, Chin Chin, which was co-produced by the group with Magoo (Regurgitator), was preceded by its lead single, [...] "Breathing Through My Eyes" [...] in April. Chin Chin was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim and peaked at No.34. The Sun-Heralds Peter Holmes described it as [...] "a massive leap forward" [...] from the [...] "cliched, choppy funk material" [...] of their first two albums, concluding: [...] "Skunkhour's overall feel is heavier, the grooves are deeper and the arrangements a little rockier".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believe the}} police covered up what happened. On January 1, Liston's wife called Johnny Tocco {{and said she}} hadn't heard from her husband in three days and was worried. A few years before Tocco died, he {{allegedly}} told his good friend, Tony Davi, {{that he went to}} Liston's house and found the door locked and his car in the driveway. Tocco called the police, and they broke into the house. Tocco said that the living room furniture was in disarray, but the house did not yet smell of death. He said they found Sonny lying on his bed with a needle sticking out of his arm. Johnny left the house before the police did. [...] "Johnny wasn't a braggart," [...] Davi told Liston biographer Paul Gallender. [...] "He told me in the strictest confidence, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> wanted to get it off his chest." [...] Gallender claims, [...] "A lot of officers knew Sonny was dead before Geraldine returned home on January 5, but they chose to let him rot." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has made numerous brief {{returns to the}} serial as a guest character. In 1993, she was featured in a special week of episodes, filmed on-location in Paris, France, where Frank discovered, to his horror, that Diane was pregnant with an unknown foreign man's baby. In June 1994, Diane returned to Walford {{as part of a}} storyline involving her father's disappearance. In 1997, another week's worth of episodes set in Paris reunited Ricky and Diane. Shortly after, the character returned to the soap's setting of Walford, but Lawrence reportedly quit weeks after making her comeback. She had since commented on her reasons for quitting so soon: [...] "Going back to EastEnders was like going back to school and none of your friends are there. I was [...] there with people like Nick Berry (Simon Wicks) and Letitia Dean (Sharon Watts) and they'd all gone. One of the young actors, who will remain nameless, made me a coffee and started telling me all about what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> had no idea I'd been in the soap before." [...] In addition, Lawrence was suffering physically as she was still getting over injuries she sustained from a car accident and was forced to remove a neck brace for filming purposes. On-screen, the character departed to travel with her musician boyfriend, abandoning her young son in her brother's care. Bosses at EastEnders had reportedly been keen for Lawrence to remain on the show, as they were hoping for an on-screen reunion of the Butcher family; Mike Reid had agreed to reprise his role as Frank, though Diane departed before his reintroduction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou {{must not}} think to absent thyself {{from such a}} solemn {{occasion}}, son Henry," [...] was his advice. [...] "Sir Patrick Charteris is to be there himself, and I think <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> a rare occasion for thee to gain his goodwill. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> may order of thee a new suit of harness; and I myself heard worthy Bailie Craigdallie say there was a talk of furbishing up the city's armoury. Thou must not neglect the good trade, now that thou takest on thee an expensive family." ...|$|R

"We {{shall be}} finely helped up here," [...] said Michael Lambourne, {{looking at the}} gateway and gate, [...] "if this fellow's {{suspicious}} humour should refuse us admission altogether, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> may, in case this linsey-wolsey fellow of a mercer's visit to his premises has disquieted him. But, no," [...] he added, pushing the huge gate, which gave way, [...] "the door stands invitingly open; {{and here we are}} within the forbidden ground, without other impediment than the passive resistance of a heavy oak door moving on rusty hinges." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Perkins soon {{saw that}} his words had {{had no effect on}} Philip, {{and for the rest of}} the term ignored him. He wrote a report which was vitriolic. When it arrived and Aunt Louisa asked Philip what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>he</b> {{answered}} cheerfully.|$|E
6000|$|What <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>he</b> did {{not like}} to say, for the most obvious reason--that he saw nothing, and was an honest man. A monk teased him much to impart to him this great discovery, which seemed to the simple untaught sailor a great spiritual mystery, and which was, like some other mediaeval mysteries which were miscalled spiritual (transubstantiation above all), {{altogether}} material and gross imaginations. Godric answered wisely enough, that [...] "no man could perceive the substance of the spiritual soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|An answer {{calculated}} so jistly betwixt the submission {{due to his}} parent, and {{the natural}} feeling of dignity in one who was by birth master of the mansion, excited universal satisfaction. And as Elspeth herself confessed to Tibb on the same evening, [...] "She {{did not think it}} had been in the callant. Till that night, he took pets and passions if he was spoke to, and lap through the house like a four-year-auld at the least word of advice that was minted at him, but now he spoke as grave and as douce as the Lord Abbot himself. She kendna," [...] she said, [...] "what might be the upshot of it, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was a wonderfu' callant even now." ...|$|E

5000|$|After 45 {{minutes of}} {{bruising}} confrontation, Lawton was asked at half time what <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> {{said he had}} enjoyed it a great deal, particularly since in between kicking lumps off each other, Bycroft had sold him a set of tyres for his car." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{saw that}} she could make no {{impression}} on her mistress, and her own reflection {{told her that the}} wounded man's life might be endangered by a longer transportation than was absolutely necessary. An expedient occurred to her, by which she imagined this objection might <b>be</b> obviated; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary she should consult her father. She struck her palfrey with her riding-rod, and in a moment her diminutive, though beautiful figure, and her spirited little jennet, were {{by the side of the}} gigantic Fleming and his tall black horse, and riding, as <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> in their vast shadow. [...] "My dearest father," [...] said Rose, [...] "the lady intends that Sir Damian be transported to the castle, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> may <b>be</b> a long sojourner;--what think you?-is that wholesome counsel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At parting, the {{custodian}} {{told the}} Marches {{that he would}} easily have known them for Americans by the handsome fee they gave him; they came away flown with his praise; and their national vanity was again flattered when they got out into the principal square of Ansbach. There, in a bookseller's window, they found among the pamphlets teaching different languages without a master, one devoted to the Amerikanische Sprache as distinguished from the Englische Sprache. That {{there could be no}} mistake, the cover was printed with colors in a German ideal of the star-spangled banner; and March said he always knew that we had a language of our own, and that now he was going in to buy that pamphlet and find out what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> asked the young shop-woman how it differed from English, which she spoke fairly well from having lived eight years in Chicago. She said that it differed from the English mainly in emphasis and pronunciation. [...] "For instance, the English say 'HALF past', and the Americans 'Half PAST'; the English say 'laht' and the Americans say 'late'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vicky Flores, {{who ran the}} Chicago {{office of}} Davies' firm, commented: [...] "'It was really weird, the timing. Everything was signed off, and then I heard he had died. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> waited until {{everything}} was taken care of.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|The Chief of the Secret Service.

5000|$|He {{was good}} {{director}} {{who wanted to}} know all about the subject. I took Arthur {{on a tour of}} the bars one night.

5000|$|Al Bell, {{co-owner}} of Stax records, said [...] "I love saxophone players, and I have many saxophone players I admire and hold in high esteem. But I {{have never heard}} a saxophone player who affects and penetrates me like Andrew Love. It was the spirit in him, and you could feel it in the music. He could arouse your deepest emotions, but {{he would do it}} gently, softly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was making love to your soul." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I <b>was</b> {{hoping that}} <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> just disappeared. <b>It</b> would <b>be</b> better {{for his mother}} and father. They {{knew he was a}} crazy kid. Maybe he had met somebody, some group of people, and run off. The bottom line is that I let it happen. That makes me just as guilty. I didn't know the body would be chopped up afterwards. That's not me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{the fellow}} that {{assaulted}} you?" [...] {{asked the man}} at the desk, nodding his head toward Lemuel, who tried to speak; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a nightmare; <b>he</b> could not make any sound.|$|R

5000|$|Cotta replies that Crassus' {{speech was}} so raging {{that he could}} not catch his content completely. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> entered in a rich house, full of rich carpets and treasures, but piled in {{disorder}} and not in full view or hidden.

5000|$|Echoing Scully's sentiments, drummer Bill Kreutzmann {{noted in}} his 2015 memoir that he [...] "got along really well" [...] with Constanten and [...] "thought he was a cool enough guy"; however, he felt that [...] "Constanten had this thing where, for {{whatever}} reason, he would perform at rehearsals pretty darn well, but then, when we'd {{be in front of}} an audience, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> froze or something.
