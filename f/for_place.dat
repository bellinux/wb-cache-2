5|$|Consonant {{clusters}} across syllable boundaries do not assimilate <b>for</b> <b>place</b> in Wagiman {{as they do}} in {{many other}} languages. This means that a nasal in a syllable coda will not move to the position of the following syllable onset for ease of enunciation. In English and most other Indo-European languages, this movement occurs regularly, such that the prefix -in, for example, changes to -im when it precedes either a p, a b or an m.|$|E

5|$|Early Europeans {{replaced}} most of {{the original}} Māori names with their own, although they retained some Māori names {{in the north and}} central regions of the North Island. The Royal Geographical Society of London was responsible <b>for</b> <b>place</b> names until 1894 when authority was given to the Governor of New Zealand. Prime Minister Joseph Ward moved an amendment in 1894 that gave preference to Māori names for any new features and allowed misspelt names to be altered (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up to advise on place names, and in 1946 the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) was established and given power to change or implement Māori and English names. Anyone can propose a geographical name to the board, who consult local Māori and allow public submissions before determining if the name should be made official. Names can also be made official through an Act of Parliament and the NZGB is required to keep a public list of all the official New Zealand geographical names.|$|E

However, there is no first molar bracket with accessory tube and hooks in the market, except for the convertible type. Objective:To present a patent for utility model of a bracket Roth prescription, Straight-Wire technique for first molar, {{in order to facilitate}} orthodontic treatment where there is a need <b>for</b> <b>placing</b> accessories in second molars. Material and methods:This patent consists of a molar bracket for bonding, which contains a retentive base for this, similar to the bracket used in the Edgewise technique,with fins <b>for</b> <b>placing</b> alastic or metal ligature,but containing pre-angles and torques as the tubes of the molar Straight-Wire technique with Roth prescription. It also includes an accessory tube <b>for</b> <b>placing</b> arches or cantilevers and hooks <b>for</b> <b>placing</b> elastics. Results and conclusion:With this bracket design proposal it is possible to obtain an accessory that facilitates the inclusion of the second molar in the assembly of the orthodontic brace without the use of bands.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to other women's war fiction of the period, Manning's works do not recount {{life on the}} home front. Instead, her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non-combatants at the front and behind the lines. Wars, in Manning's view, are battles <b>for</b> <b>place</b> and influence, and [...] "with her range of images and illusions, Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant." [...] Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians, emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without, with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons. Military men are far from heroic, and official British responses are presented as farcical. In the Fortunes of War, the conflict is viewed largely {{from the perspective of}} a civilian woman, an observer, though later books include Simon Boulderstone's soldier's view of battle. Views differ on her success in the Fortunes of War battlescenes; initial reviews by Auberon Waugh and Hugh Massie criticised them as implausible and not fully realised, but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid, poignant and largely convincing. Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of Artist among the Missing that [...] "it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper." [...] There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike, and repetition – of stories, events and deaths – used to give [...] "the impression of lives trapped in an endless war" [...] for which there is no end in sight.|$|E
