25|$|Similarly, Nystrom noted of the band's live performances: Well, {{it must be}} hard {{sometimes}} for Jonas to sing his heart out with lyrics referring to personal dark and depressive matters {{and at the same}} time also be accused of being a reluctant frontman. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> much of the stuff he sings about doesn't go in hand with running around on stage, throwing horns, smiling and firing up the audience. We're not an energetic power metal band. I think the withdrawn and shy aura actually does more justice to the concept of our songs than going wild, but we have some songs mainly on the two last albums that don't really fall into the doom and gloom category, but are still dark. And there the more aggressive approach fits better.|$|E

When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get older, you get better.... Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The reason is because they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} film school, Australian director James Wan and Australian writer Leigh Whannell {{wanted to}} write and fund a film. The inspiration that they needed came after watching the low-budget independent film The Blair Witch Project. [...] Another film that inspired them to finance the film themselves was Darren Aronofsky's Pi. The two thought the cheapest script to shoot would involve two actors in one room. Whannell said, [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> the restrictions we had on our bank accounts at the time, {{the fact that we}} wanted to keep the film contained, helped us come up with the ideas in the film." [...] One idea was to have the entire film set with two actors stuck in an elevator and being shot in {{the point of view of}} security cameras.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Daily Star Sunday, Sugababes member Heidi Range blamed their music label, Island, for disappointing sales of their new album. According to Range, [...] "The sales have been disappointing but I don't {{think it is a}} reflection on the album's quality, and the problem is the promotion, <b>I</b> don't <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> our fans know we've even got an album out." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gail Simone, {{who worked}} with Byrne on The All New Atom in 2006, {{described}} Byrne as [...] "very opinionated; a lot of artists are opinionated, and I'm okay with that. <b>Actually,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> John Byrne is brilliant and his forceful personality is part of that." ...|$|R

500|$|Though {{the film}} is part comedy, Cody {{initially}} intended {{for it to be}} a [...] "very dark, very brooding" [...] traditional slasher film. Close to [...] "a third of the way into the process" [...] she felt that she was incapable of doing so because [...] "the humor just kept sneaking in". She stated, [...] "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in the movie that are horrifying are funny to me." [...] Feeling that [...] "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" [...] due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, [...] "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, but <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> that {{for some of these}} shows you don't need to {{understand}} everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am going to do this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E
2500|$|Tributes {{were paid}} to Best {{from around the}} world, {{including}} from arguably three of the greatest football players ever, Pelé, Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff. Maradona commented: [...] "George inspired me when I was young.

[...] 'There is a softer side to her, though, as she can be funny and enjoys a bit of banter with Emily, who now helps out in the post office. <b>I</b> don't <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> Viv's comic side has been sufficiently explored. When Vic was still alive, he and Viv had this great repartee ~ a bit like Jack and Vera Duckworth in Coronation Street. It's a shame that we weren't able to make more of it.|$|R

He also could draw anything, make anything look exciting, and <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> he was even faster than Jack." [...] Talented and well-respected, he died in a commuter-train accident shortly before Marvel's ascendancy into a commercial and pop-cultural conglomerate.|$|E
2500|$|Torvalds {{describes}} himself as [...] "completely a-religious—atheist", adding that [...] "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible {{that something like this}} could have happened in the first place.'" [...] He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in America it has become very politicized. When discussing the issue of church and state separation, Torvalds also said, [...] "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding {{between the state and the}} state religion." ...|$|E

2500|$|I'd place Pollock {{along with}} Hofmann and Morris Louis {{in this country}} among the very {{greatest}} painters of this generation. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> don't <b>think</b> there was anyone in the same generation in Europe quite to match them. Pollock didn't like Hofmann's paintings. He couldn't make them out. He didn't take the trouble to. And Hofmann didn't like Pollock's allover paintings, nor could most of Pollock's artist friends make head or tail out of them, {{the things he did}} from 1947 to '50. But Pollock's paintings live or die in the same context as Rembrandt's or Titian's or Velázquez's or Goya's or David's or ...or Manet's or Ruben's or Michelangelo's paintings. There's no interruption, there's no mutation here. Pollock asked to be tested by the same eye that could see how good Raphael was when he was good or Piero when he was good.|$|R
5000|$|I {{travel to}} India {{at least three}} to four times a year. It's always inspirational. There is so much to learn from India because each and every state is a country by itself and each has its own cuisine.

I keep my mind open and like to explore different places and pick up different influences as I go along. <b>I</b> don't <b>actually</b> <b>think</b> that there is a single state in India that I haven't visited. ... Indian food is a cosmopolitan cuisine that has so many ingredients. I don't think any cuisine in the world has got so many influences the way that Indian food has.
