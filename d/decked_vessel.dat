He had simply {{developed}} (to use his tutor's own expression) from a boy of sixteen to a boy of twenty-one. He was just as easy and open in his disposition as ever; just as quaintly and inveterately good-humored; just as heedless in following his own impulses, lead him where they might. His bias toward the sea had strengthened with his advance to the years of manhood. From building a boat, he had now got on--with two journeymen at work under him--to building a <b>decked</b> <b>vessel</b> of five-and-thirty tons. Mr. Brock had conscientiously tried to divert him to higher aspirations; had taken him to Oxford, to see what college life was like; had taken him to London, to expand his mind by the spectacle of the great metropolis. The change had diverted Allan, but had not altered him in the least. He was as impenetrably superior to all worldly ambition as Diogenes himself. [...] "Which is best," [...] asked this unconscious philosopher, [...] "to find out the way to be happy for yourself, or to let other people try if they can find it out for you?"

25|$|Washington's {{recommendations}} {{led to a}} programme of {{improvements to}} the many small harbours around {{the east coast of}} Scotland. The Fishery Board for Scotland also encouraged the introduction of <b>decked</b> <b>vessels.</b> The main types of boat used for herring fishing on the east coast were the Fifie, and the smaller Skaffie which was common around the Moray Firth. Fishermen initially resisted the introduction of decks because it reduced the space available for the catch, but they also feared that a deck would increase the risk of men being swept overboard.|$|R

25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger <b>decked</b> <b>vessels,</b> 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|R
25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small <b>decked</b> <b>vessels</b> which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|R

60|$|Like {{all other}} vessels, sloops vary in size, {{but none of}} them attain to great magnitude. As a class, they are the {{smallest}} <b>decked</b> <b>vessels</b> we have.

The hull of such a vessel being intended exclusively to carry cargo, very little space is allowed for the crew. The cabins of the smaller-sized sloops are seldom high enough to permit of an ordinary man standing erect. They are usually capable of affording accommodation to two in the cabin, and three or four in the forecastle,--and such accommodation is by no means ample. The class to which vessels belong is determined chiefly by the number of their masts and by the arrangement and the form of their sails.|$|R

40|$|A {{pot fishery}} {{directed}} on spider crab (Maja squinado) {{grew out of}} a mixed tangle net and pot fishery for large crustaceans in the early 1980 s. Approximately twenty half <b>decked</b> <b>vessels</b> of 10 m in length have been involved {{for the duration of the}} fishery but the numbers of pots per vessel has increased; currently 10, 000 pots are set for spider crab in Tralee and Brandon Bays during the summer months. Cpue rose initially during the early years of the fishery, then it stabilised and declined although in the late 1990 s it again recovered somewhat. Sampling in 2000 suggests that the size composition of the catch has altered since the early years of the fishery, its main consequence being the removal of the older age groups so that the landings now consist almost entirely of a single year class. Aspects of the biology of the Maja squinado are compared with what is already known of the species and a number of recommendations are made for the future management of the fishery. These include a further increase in the size limit, a ban on tangle nets and a cap on fishing effort. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|R

Possibilities for the documentation of Sami waterscapes are explored with a focus on the challenges facing cultural heritage management. The assertion that Sami waterscapes have been neglected both within and beyond archaeology is illustrated through selected themes. These include the popular Norwegian concept of kystkultur (coastal culture) focusing on Norwegian identity in which the coastal Sami are marginalized or invisible. Another problematic area is ship preservation (fartøyvern) which excludes a majority of Sami watercraft by focusing on larger <b>decked</b> <b>vessels.</b> The general lack of interest in logboats and other ‘primitive’ watercraft within Norwegian archaeology has also had a negative impact on research into Sami boats, especially in the interior.

5000|$|This enabled Landsbanki to {{increase}} lending to industry, making its operations {{more like a}} real bank rather than a savings and loan society. A few years into the new century, the parent bank in Reykjavík was well enough established to expand, opening an Akureyri branch in North Iceland in 1902 and another in Ísafjörður, in the West Fjords, in 1904. During its six years {{of growth in the}} new century, its balance sheet increased sixfold. Despite the advent of a new competitor: a privately owned bank, Íslandsbanki, mainly owned by Danish investors, appeared on the scene in 1904 and launched its operations by opening three branches. [...] While Landsbanki had done its best to provide credit for upgrading of the fishing fleet with <b>decked</b> <b>vessels,</b> its funding was limited during these early years and clearly constrained the fishing industry’s development. Just prior to the turn of the century, Danish financiers offered to take over the bank, strengthen its financial basis and list in on the Danish stock exchange. The new bank would serve as a central bank for Iceland, issuing notes backed by gold, as was the practice in other countries. A hot dispute among Icelandic politicians as whether to accept or refuse this offer, was concluded by the Althingi’s adoption in 1901 of an act authorising the inception of the new bank - but refusing to have it take over Landsbanki.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the future of}} indigenous Sami fisheries in cybernetic fisheries systems characterized by increasing effectivization and industrialisation. It empirically investigates {{the past and present}} development of a small-scale fjord fishery in Porsanger, northern Norway, which has been {{a major part of the}} material basis for indigenous Sami culture and settlements in the area. The article utilises historical vessel registries and fishers’ vessel career narratives from the post-war period to the present to analyse how relations between vessels, fishers, technology, ecology and the society at large have changed, and to what extent the small-scale fishery of the past seems to be disappearing in a fisheries system characterised by increasing cyborgization especially in the period after 1990. The main finding is an identification of diverse ways of organising the small-scale fishery in Porsanger in the past which had an influence on which types of vessels and fishers stayed put in the post- 1990 period. This process was influenced not only by the introduction of the vessel quota system but also by ecological conditions and changing social and material relations in the local fisheries. In particular, the fishery with small open vessels with outboard engines experienced a golden age prior to the 1990 s, but then abruptly decreased due to a combination of ecological conditions and management interventions. The fishery with <b>decked,</b> coastal fishing <b>vessels</b> however remained relatively stable throughout the period and continues to dominate the Porsanger small-scale fishery. The case study demonstrates diverse and flexible ways of organising relations in a coastal Sami community over time, thus implying that a cybernetic future may be possible also for small-scale fisheries.
