5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, <b>host</b> <b>range</b> and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together. They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow <b>host</b> <b>range.</b> Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans. The <b>host</b> <b>range</b> of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, <b>host</b> <b>range,</b> and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the <b>host</b> <b>range</b> of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its <b>host</b> <b>range</b> and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large <b>host</b> <b>range</b> and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has had limited success, so most preventative methods rely {{on the use of}} agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the cry protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to lepidopteran species including the Maruca.|$|E

40|$|Canine {{parvovirus}} (CPV) {{emerged as}} an apparently new virus during the mid- 1970 s. The origin of CPV is unknown, but a variation from feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) or another closely related parvovirus is suspected. Here we examine the in vitro and in vivo canine and feline <b>host</b> <b>ranges</b> of CPV and FPV. Examination of three canine and six feline cell lines and mitogen-stimulated canine and feline peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed that CPV replicates in both canine and feline cells, whereas FPV replicates efficiently only in feline cells. The in vivo <b>host</b> <b>ranges</b> were unexpectedly complex and distinct from the in vitro <b>host</b> <b>ranges.</b> Inoculation of dogs with FPV revealed efficient replication in the thymus and, to some degree, in the bone marrow, as shown by virus isolation, viral DNA recovery, and Southern blotting and by strand-specific in situ hybridization. FPV replication could not be demonstrated in mesenteric lymph nodes or in the small intestine, which are important target tissues in CPV infection. Although CPV replicated well in all the feline cells tested in vitro, it did not replicate in any tissue of cats after intramuscular or intravenous inoculation. These results indicate that these viruses have complex and overlapping <b>host</b> <b>ranges</b> and that distinct tissue tropisms exist in the homologous and heterologous hosts...|$|R

5|$|Parasitoids {{lay their}} eggs on or {{in the body of}} an insect host, which is then used as a food for {{developing}} larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have a very narrow <b>host</b> <b>range.</b> The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.|$|E

H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the codling moth. The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The moth’s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide <b>host</b> <b>range.</b> Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{isolates}} of Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) fail {{to infect}} tomato because the tomato tm- 1 protein binds to the replication proteins of TMGMV and prevents RNA replication. Previously, we isolated a TMGMVmutant that overcomes tm- 1 -mediated resistance and multiplies in tomato plants. Here, {{we show that}} the causal mutations in the replication protein gene that abolish the interaction with tm- 1 reduce its ability to suppress RNA silencing in host plant Nicotiana benthamiana. The {{results suggest that the}} multifunctionality of the replication proteins is an evolutionary constraint of tobamoviruses that restricts their <b>host</b> <b>ranges.</b> Most viruses infect only a limited <b>range</b> of <b>hosts.</b> Adaptation of a virus to a novel host is a rare event, but when it does occur, it can result in {{the emergence of a new}} virus. A newly emerged virus often loses fitness in the original host. Such fitness trade-offs prevent continuous expansion of <b>host</b> <b>ranges</b> and explain why <b>host</b> <b>ranges</b> of viruses are limited. Even though viral mu-tations critical for adaptation to new hosts have been identified in many instances, little is known about how these mutations lead to the trade-offs (2, 4) ...|$|R
40|$|The P[19] {{genotype}} {{belongs to}} the P[II] genogroup of group A rotaviruses (RVs). However, unlike the other P[II] RVs that mainly infects humans, P[19] RVs commonly infect animals (porcine), making P[19] unique to study RV diversity and <b>host</b> <b>ranges.</b> Through in vitro binding assays and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR, we found that P[19] could bind mucin cores 2, 4, and 6, as well as type 1 histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). The common sequences of these glycans serve as minimal binding units, while additional residues, such as the A, B, H, and Lewis epitopes of the type 1 HBGAs, can further define the binding outcomes and therefore, likely the <b>host</b> <b>ranges</b> for P[19] RVs. This complex binding property of P[19] is shared {{with those of the}} other three P[II] RVs (P[4], P[6] and P[8]) in that all of them recognized the type 1 HBGA precursor, although P[4] and P[8], but not P[6], also bind to mucin cores. Moreover, while essential for P[4] and P[8] binding, the addition of the Lewis epitope blocked P[6] and P[19] binding to type 1 HBGAs. Chemical shift NMR of P[19] VP 8 * identified a ligand binding interface that has shifted away from the known RV P-genotype binding sites but is conserved among all P[II] RVs and two P[I] RVs (P[10] and P[12]), suggesting an evolutionary connection among these human and animal RVs. Taken together, these data are important for hypotheses on potential mechanisms for RV diversity, <b>host</b> <b>ranges,</b> and cross-species transmission. IMPORTANCE: In this study, we found that this P[19] strain and other P[II] RVs recognize mucin cores and the type 1 HBGA precursors as the minimal functional units and that additional saccharides adjacent to these units can alter binding outcomes and thereby possibly <b>host</b> <b>ranges.</b> These data may help to explain why some P[II] RVs, such as P[6] and P[19], commonly infect animals but rarely humans, while others, such as the P[4] and P[8] RVs, mainly infect humans and are predominant over other P genotypes. Elucidation of the molecular bases for strain-specific <b>host</b> <b>ranges</b> and cross-species transmission of these human and animal RVs is important to understand RV epidemiology and disease burden, which may impact development of control and prevention strategies against RV gastroenteritis...|$|R
5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} <b>host</b> <b>range,</b> attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the ecology}} and {{genetics}} of Paxillus involutus {{indicate that it}} may form a complex of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near Uppsala, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries {{found that there were}} three populations of P.involutus unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. However, there were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A molecular study comparing the DNA sequences of specimens of Paxillus involutus collected from various habitats in Bavaria found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species P.vernalis, while those from forests were allied with P.filamentosus. The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that P.involutus sensu lato (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to P.obscurosporus, P.involutus sensu stricto (in the strict sense), P.validus, and a fourth species that has not yet been identified. Changes in <b>host</b> <b>range</b> have occurred frequently and independently among strains within this species complex.|$|E

In particular, we focused {{on the role of}} multiple host niches and a trade-off in infectivity of pathogens to these hosts on the evolutionary outcome.
