5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, <b>induces</b> the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and <b>induces</b> ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E

The abortion definition and its types, necessary for exact delimitation of the topic, are introduced. Then actual legislation and data gathering of <b>induced</b> abortion are provided. The work focuses on the analysis of regional {{differentiation of}} <b>induced</b> abortions in the Czech Republic. The work includes graphs of some statistical indicators of <b>induced</b> abortions in the Czech Republic in 2011. It mainly focuses on pattems of <b>induced</b> abortions in individual regions, according to number of previous live-born babies to mothers who underwent the <b>induced</b> abortion, marital status and education level of these women. Methods of demographic analysis and statistical methods are used (<b>induced</b> abortions to live birth ratios, total <b>induced</b> abortions rate, women's average age at <b>induced</b> abortion). Working hypotheses are presented and consequently verified. Cluster analysis on the regional scale was applied to make the <b>induced</b> abortion patterns more transparent and easier to interpret.

40|$|<b>Induced</b> {{abortion}} in developed countries: trends and law Abstract The {{objective of this}} study is to give a comprehensive overview of law and trends in <b>induced</b> {{abortion in}} developed countries and to analyse and to evaluate patterns, which are typical for selected countries. In the first part, approaches to <b>induced</b> abortion are discussed and development in abortion law is described, in the second part, trends of <b>induced</b> abortion are analysed over time and by age of woman. As a tool, methods of demographic analysis of <b>induced</b> abortion and some statistical methods are applied. <b>Induced</b> abortions from other than health reasons are currently legally permitted in 25 of 28 analysed countries. Significant differences among developed countries not only in quantum of <b>induced</b> abortion but also in the structure of <b>induced</b> abortion by the age of woman were found by the analysis. Besides the law of <b>induced</b> abortions, the most important factor for indicators of <b>induced</b> abortions is prevalence of modern contraception methods. With the spreading difference of their use, the difference among countries in <b>induced</b> abortion decrease. Keywords: <b>induced</b> abortion, law, abortion rate, developed countrie...|$|R

As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk. Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's use in screening.

The minimum cardinality of an <b>induced</b> acyclic path decomposition of G is called the <b>induced</b> acyclic path decomposition number of G and is denoted by πia(G). Similarly the cyclic decomposition number πc(G) is defined. In this paper we begin an investigation of these parameters.
