5|$|Healthcare {{reform was}} a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated to not <b>have</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected {{the use of an}} individual mandate.|$|E

25|$|So, {{shortly after}} HealthCare.gov's launch, the {{problems}} {{still did not}} affect the legal requirement for Americans to <b>have</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> by December 15, which remained on the books as stated. However, on October 23, the effective legal deadline for applying for health insurance via HealthCare.gov without getting a penalty via the individual mandate was extended to March 31, 2014, possibly because of the problems with HealthCare.gov and some of the state healthcare exchanges (but without a de jure explanation as such given).|$|E

25|$|More than 90% of the {{population}} <b>has</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> {{and the government has}} made universal coverage by 2018 a priority.

25|$|Some who {{advocate}} against greater government involvement in healthcare have {{asserted that the}} difference in costs {{between the two nations}} is partially explained by the differences in their demographics. Illegal immigrants, more prevalent in the U.S. than in Canada, also add a burden to the system, as many of them do not carry health insurance and rely on emergency rooms— which are legally required to treat them under EMTALA— as a principal source of care.

25|$|In 2006, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} {{enacted the}} first {{plan in the}} United States to provide all Commonwealth citizens with universal health insurance coverage, {{using a variety of}} private insurance providers. Insurance coverage for low-income individuals is paid for with tax revenues, and higher income people who don't <b>have</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> are required to purchase it. (The health insurance market is publicly regulated, so, at least in Massachusetts, no one can be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or be forced to pay exorbitant rates.) The implementation of Commonwealth Care, the new universal coverage law, is proceeding, as of 2007.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{says that}} when he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not <b>have</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E
40|$|<b>Having</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> is {{a crucial}} factor for many to sustain life in America. This study {{examines}} the demographic determinants of health care coverage within the United States {{with a focus on}} how gender and marital status influence the likelihood of <b>having</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Using the human capital theory and the theory of statistical discrimination, it is predicted that married females will have a higher probability of being insured than divorced and separated females. Also, divorced males are predicted to have a higher probability of coverage than divorced females. The data for this research is retrieved from the United States Census Bureau Current Population Survey and consists of a large sample of adults aged 30 to 65. An OLS and probit regression are used to conduct this study, as well as descriptive statistics. The principle finding is that married adults have a much higher probability of having insurance than single, divorced, and widowed adults. It is also found that men and women do not differ greatly in their likelihood of <b>having</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> One exception is that single, divorced and widowed women are somewhat less likely to have employer provided insurance than their male counterparts...|$|R

25|$|Of those Americans who <b>have</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> {{most are}} covered by employer-sponsored health insurance. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which relies on the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to specify what kinds of {{preventive}} care for women should be covered in certain employer-based health plans. HHS exempted religious employers (churches and their integrated auxiliaries, associations of churches, and any religious order), non-profit organizations that object to any required contraception, employers providing grandfathered plans (that have not had specific changes before March 23, 2010), and employers with fewer than 50 employees. The HRSA decided that all twenty contraceptives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be covered. Companies that refuse are fined $100 per individual per day, or they can replace their health coverage with higher wages and a calibrated tax.|$|E
25|$|Residents of Massachusetts must <b>have</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> {{coverage}} under Chapter 58. Residents must indicate {{on their}} tax forms {{if they had}} insurance on December 31 of that tax year, had a waiver for religious reasons, or had a waiver from the Connector. The Connector waiver can be obtained if the resident demonstrates {{that there is no}} available coverage that is defined by the Connector as affordable. In March 2007, the Connector adopted an affordability schedule that allows residents to seek a waiver. If a resident does not have coverage and does not have a waiver, the Department of Revenue will enforce the insurance requirement by imposing a penalty. In 2007, the penalty was the loss of the personal exemption. Beginning in 2008, the penalty is half the cost of the lowest available yearly premium which will be enforced as an assessed addition to the individual's income tax.|$|E

40|$|James Larson for {{excellent}} {{research assistance}} and Mark Duggan and seminar {{participants at the}} ERIU Ann Arbor conference for helpful comments. Trends in <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Coverage among Low-Skilled Women We analyze the trends in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage for women {{with less than a}} high school education during the 1990 s and also examine how welfare reform affected their probability of insurance coverage. We compare the experiences of these women with trends for women with a high school and college education. We find that the probability of <b>having</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> declined for all of these groups during the 1990 s, but the reasons for these declines differ across groups. Women with less than a high school education experienced a large decline in the probability of <b>having</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> as a result of declines in spousal coverage (due both to declines in marriage and to declines in spousal coverage) and declines in own-employer sponsored coverage for among workers. By contrast, women with a high school degree experienced a smaller decline in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage during the 1990 s, mostly because declines in spousal coverage were partially offset by increases in own-employer coverage. Women with a college education experienced only very small declines in the probability of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage in the 1990 s. Against this backdrop of large overall declines in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage, welfare reform appears to have led to a modest increase in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage for women with less than a high school degree, primarily by increasing the probability of <b>having</b> private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> This modest increase was not large enough to offset the large secular declines in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage among low-skilled wome...|$|R
