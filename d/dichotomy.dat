5|$|Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del método, 1974), is a {{synthesis}} of several historical figures from Latin American, most prominently Gerardo Machado, dictator of Cuba. This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half {{of his life in}} Europe, perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's <b>dichotomy</b> of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that every {{algorithmic}} technique or complexity result that applies to H-coloring problems for directed graphs H applies just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP <b>dichotomy,</b> which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we prove a {{roughness}} theorem {{for a class}} of <b>dichotomies</b> of linear systems of differential equations, the so-called (h,k) -dichotomies.

Dichotomous depictions of literacy, language, and culture are popular and well institutionalized; however, the use of such <b>dichotomies</b> fosters a limited view of "reality, " leads to repression of individual and community expression and needs, promotes cultural bias, creates exclusive discourse that stifles dialogue, and prohibits critical analysis.

5|$|The {{male and}} female <b>dichotomy</b> of polar opposites with the former oppressing the latter at all times is refuted in the Indian context because it was men who {{initiated}} social reform movements against various social evils.

5|$|After {{publishing}} Prehistory of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false <b>dichotomy</b> and that human society has progressed {{through a series of}} technological, economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed from a series of small towns through to the first cities, and right up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.|$|E

40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{formulation of}} the input encoding problem is presented, based {{on the concept of}} compatibility of <b>dichotomies.</b> The input encoding problem is shown to be equivalent to a two-level logic minimization. Three possible techniques to solve the encoding problem are discussed, based on: 1) techniques borrowed from classical logic minimization (generation of prime <b>dichotomies</b> and solving the covering problem), 2) graph coloring applied to the graph of incompatibility of <b>dichotomies,</b> and 3) extraction of essential prime <b>dichotomies</b> followed by graph coloring. The extraction of essential prime <b>dichotomies</b> serves the same purpose as the extraction of essential prime implicants in logic minimization, {{in the sense that it}} reduces the size of the covering/graph coloring problem. The conditions of optimality of the solutions to the input encoding problem are discussed. For near-optimum results a powerful heuristic, based on iterative improvement technique, has been developed and imple [...] ...|$|R
5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the hardiness for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed. This <b>dichotomy</b> has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This <b>dichotomy</b> was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{exponential}} <b>dichotomies</b> {{was first introduced}} by Perron in 1930 [1] to study the conditional stability of the linear differential equations {{and the existence of}} bounded solutions of the nonlinear differential equations. Then Li [2] established the corresponding analogous concept for the linear difference equations. The theory of exponential <b>dichotomies</b> has been playing {{an important role in the}} study of the theory of differential equations and difference equations (see [3 – 5]). An interesting and challenging problem is to establish necessary and sufficient criteria for the existence of exponential <b>dichotomies.</b> Among the many methods and tools, the admissibility techniques or input-output methods have been extensively applying to study the existence of exponential <b>dichotomies</b> for differential equations and difference equations [6 – 15].|$|R
30|$|Johnson and Sell [14] {{considered}} exponential <b>dichotomies</b> in ℝ (in {{a finite}} dimensional space), and proved that for C k perturbations, if the perturbation and its derivatives in λ are bounded and equicontinuous in the parameter, then the projections are of class C k in λ. In {{the case of}} discrete time, Barreira and Valls established the optimal C 1 dependence of the stable and unstable subspaces on the parameter in [15] for the uniform exponential <b>dichotomies</b> and in [16] for the nonuniform exponential <b>dichotomies.</b>|$|R

During the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39, he helped organise aid to those fighting the fascists and, {{during the winter of}} 193637, he visited the country.

The most expensive Danish film produced to that date, it was co-produced by German companies because initially there was no interest in producing the film in Denmark. Portraying the protagonists as morally ambiguous characters, the director tried to depict war as a complicated experience that goes beyond a good versus evil <b>dichotomy.</b> With visual and narrative references borrowed from film noir and the French film Army of Shadows, Flame & Citron also explores themes of love, betrayal, and the emotional aspects of relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this <b>dichotomy,</b> he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E

Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} {{of urban}} renewal under Augustus, {{and the growth}} of Rome's population to as many as 1 million people, was accompanied by a nostalgia for rural life expressed in the arts.
