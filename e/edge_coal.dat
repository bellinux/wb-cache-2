40|$|Efficient mining of coal seams varying in {{thickness}} {{has become}} increasingly important, especially for the coal resources located at the <b>edges</b> of <b>coal</b> seams, in corners or panels. Selecting the 4320 mechanised working face in the Daizhuang Coal Mine located in eastern China as example, collaborative mining technology with different mining equipment for a coal seam varying in thickness within the same long wall working face was studied. A number of key technologies were developed, including scraper conveyor lap technology, a separation device for coal and gangue and working face shortening technology. The roof movement formula for this working face was also monitored. The engineering application showed that this technology could greatly improve the degree of mechanisation, and reduce the labour intensity of workers. Besides, more than 8. 3 Mt of coal were recovered. The results of monitoring the roof movement indicated that stress concentration was located at the junction of thin and thick coal seams, {{but it did not}} appear to affect normal operations within the coal mine, and the periodic pressure in this working face was steady. The above achievements could provide technical reference for coal mining under similar geological conditions in other locations...|$|R

40|$|Mitigating {{global climate}} change via {{emission}} control and taxation is promising for strengthening the economic benefits of bioenergy generation and utilization. This study examines the cost effectiveness of pine needles as an alternative fuel for off-grid electricity generation in India. We first examined the changes of prices in coal for electricity generation due to CO 2 emission reductions and taxes using experimental data of gasification plants. The time value of money and depreciation scale were used {{to find out the}} real levellized cost of electricity generation of gasification plants. Then, the costs of electricity generation fuelled by pine needles and coal were estimated using the cost analysis method. Our results indicate that pine needles would have more competitive <b>edge</b> than <b>coal</b> if emission had taxed at about an emission tax INR 525. 15 Mg- 1 of CO 2 (US$ 8. 4), or higher would be needed for pine needles at a yield of 202. 176 dry Mg hm- 2 yr. The price of coal used for electricity generation would have significantly increased if global CO 2 emission had abridged by 20 % or more. However, pine needles were found a much better fuel source with an increasing yield of 5. 05 Mg hm- 2 yr (with respect to power generation) and 2. 335 Mg hm- 2 yr (with respect to feedstock production) ...|$|R

To determine the extent of the process, a comparison was made of the types of surface soil layers and their ash content in 20 peatlands determined in 1957 – 1965 and in 2017. They are located in the farmland lying the closest to the strip mine, Jóźwin IIB, and in woodland lying further away. The results were compared with those for a peatland in Skulsk, which was not affected by the negative impact of the strip mine. Fen peat, occurring there about 55 years ago has largely turned into grainy moorsh. In the 20 – 50 cm layer, an ash content has grown almost twofold, while in part of the peatlands organic soils have changed into mineral and organic-mineral ones. The greatest changes have occurred in the farmland. In all Park peatlands, grasslands have contracted threefold, while the area of forests and woodlands has grown fivefold.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of seismic profiling along the sidewalls of two headings of a longwall in a coal-seam at a depth of about 850 and 870 metres in a coal mine in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland. The seismic profiles were located in a zone of impact of the same overlying edge of the coal-seam located about 40 m above. This study was interesting from that point of view since there were no other geological and mining factors present which could disturb the impact of the <b>coal</b> seam <b>edge.</b> The profiling of refracted P-wave velocity changes was carried out according to the Dubinski method. This method is used for the assessment of relative stress in a coal seam in the side wall of the excavation. The results obtained on both seismic profiles are very similar, which demonstrates the small impact of the overlying <b>edge</b> of the <b>coal</b> seam in both headings of a longwall. It should be emphasised that at greater exploitation depths, the calculated reference velocity is less reliable than the measured reference velocity. Presumably, the method of calculating seismic anomaly requires updating under such conditions, but additional evidence should be collected...|$|R

40|$|Cast {{blasting}} {{is commonly}} used in Australian dragline strip mines to minimize the amount of material handled by draglines. Cast blasts are designed with relatively high powder factors to `cast 2 ̆ 7 or displace {{a significant proportion of}} the overburden into its final dump location in the previous strip. Each additional cubic metre of material cast by explosive energy saves the cost of it being excavated and transported by the dragline. However, the extra explosive energy used increases the risk of damaging the underlying coal seam. Such damage will lead to reduced coal recovery and may negate the economic benefit derived from casting. The Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre has undertaken a project to understand and quantify the role of cast blasting in coal damage. As a part of this project a blast monitoring program was undertaken at the Mount Thorley mine in New South Wales. Experiments were undertaken to quantify the effect of stand-off (the distance that the explosive is kept above the coal seam) and the use of an overburden buffer or buttress placed against the exposed <b>edge</b> of the <b>coal</b> to prevent its lateral movement during blasting. A 2 D dynamic finite difference numerical model was used to study the impact of different blast designs on coal movement, damage and loss. A careful survey of coal recovery was conducted in the test areas and an economic analysis was prepared in conjunction with mine staff. The results indicate that appropriate design and careful implementation of blasting operations can have a very significant impact on the overall economics of the mine...|$|R
40|$|Brown coal is {{considered}} to be a competitive primary energy source for power generation in parts of Central and Eastern Europe due to the economically recoverable reserves of this fuel in these regions. On the other side, it is well known that brown coal contains significant amounts of moisture which decreases the overall plant thermal efficiency due to the increased flue gas thermal loses. In order to keep the competitive <b>edge</b> of brown <b>coal,</b> an improvement of the power plant efficiency is required. One way to achieve this target is to dry the moist brown coal before combustion. Conventionally, the necessary moisture extraction process is integrated into milling, where a recirculated flue gas stream is used as a drying agent. External brown coal drying offers the potential to increase the net thermal efficiency of the entire power generation process by up to 5 % points. This paper presents a description of the technical fundamentals of drying techniques developed and successfully tested so far. Furthermore, it presents computer simulation studies for the integration of an external dryer into a steam cycle of a Greek brown coal-fired power plant as a typical test to demonstrate the potential of the drying technologies for power generation. The major objectives of these studies are to formulate basic drying schemes which might be integrated into a power production steam cycle. Three dryers using steam as a drying agent, e. g. the tubular dryer, the fluidised bed dryer and the mechanical thermal dewatering process are compared to the conventional flue gas drying technology using a computer simulation.

40|$|In the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), coal seams are {{exploited}} under {{progressively more}} difficult geological and mining conditions (greater depth, higher horizontal stress, more frequent occurrence of competent rock layers, etc.). Mining depth, dislocations and mining remnants in coal seams {{are the most}} important factors responsible for the occurrence of rockburst hazards. Longwall mining next to the mining <b>edges</b> of neighbouring <b>coal</b> seams is particularly disadvantageous. The levels of rockburst hazards are minimised via the use of rockburst prevention methods. One active prevention method is torpedo blasting in roof rocks. Torpedo blastings are performed in order to decrease local stress concentrations in rock masses and to fracture the roof rocks to prevent or minimise the impact of high-energy tremors on excavations. The estimation of the effectiveness of torpedo blasting is particularly important when mining is under difficult geological and mining conditions. Torpedo blasting is the main form of active rockburst prevention in the assigned colliery in the Polish part of the USCB. The effectiveness of blasting can be estimated using the seismic effect method, in which the seismic monitoring data and the mass of explosives are taken into consideration. The seismic effect method was developed in the Czech Republic and is always being used in collieries in the Czech part of the coal basin. Now, this method has been widely adopted for our selected colliery in the Polish part of the coal basin. The effectiveness of torpedo blastings in the faces and galleries of the assigned longwall in coal seam 506 has been estimated. The results show that the effectiveness of torpedo blastings for this longwall was significant in light of the seismic effect method, which corresponds to the in situ observations. The seismic effect method is regularly applied to estimating the blasting effectiveness in the selected colliery...|$|R
