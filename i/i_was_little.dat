500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>little.</b> There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers." [...] The reason for this was due to the fame of the Jackson 5, and wanting to have their money {{in order to have a}} way of living.|$|E

I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor.

500|$|Despite {{growing up}} in the {{predominantly}} white area of Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, Dixon's father Melvin would take her to the Notting Hill Carnival in London to allow her to experience some of her Jamaican heritage. The music she would hear influenced her tastes, as she commented: [...] "all the dancehall records I saved up to buy – Shabba Ranks, Buju Banton – I heard them at Notting Hill".

500|$|Courtney Love: [...] "We {{actually}} show Anne Boleyn too. She was Henry VIII's {{wife who}} had her head chopped off. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E

He had huge experience and gave a lot of advice to me. It was big honor to play with him and I hope I learned something from Sabonis." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, I was living in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>little,</b> in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E
