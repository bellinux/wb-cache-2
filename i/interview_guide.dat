These experiences, feelings, attitudes might be independent of a group or its cultural and social settings but {{are more likely to}} reveal itself in the interaction with other people in a group or another social setting. Focus group discussions help in elaborating the different viewpoints and emotional processes of each member within a group context. The individual interview is simpler for the researcher to control in comparison to a focus group discussion. A focus group discussion, in comparison to other methods helps the research to gain larger pool information in a much lesser amount of time. This observation depends on waiting for things to happen, whereas the researcher has to follow an <b>interview</b> <b>guide</b> in a focus group. In this aspect, focus group discussions are not natural but organized and planned. These discussions are especially helpful when there are differences related to power between its members, decision-makers or professionals, [...] when the culture and language of a specific group is of, and when the researcher or a member wants to understand and explore the level of consensus over a given theme or topic(Kreuger, 1993).|$|E

50|$|Focus group {{discussion}} in qualitative method has gain huge popularity {{of this method}} across the social sciences over the past decade. Focus groups are now thoroughly assessable and familiar to the general public. Prior 1920’s and late 1970’s the focus groups were mainly used in marketing, tool, and studies {{in the field in}} the business. Aspects like including education, communication, media studies, feminist research, sociology and social psychology. Focused groups are also known as ‘group interviews’. The members are encouraged to interact and have discussions. The data collected by focused {{group discussion}} are seldom produced through interview and observation; it enlightens us with its power of knowledge. Focus group discussion also focuses on the process beyond the individual’s memory and desires. The richness and complexity of group dynamics should be considered. Focus group can also access to social interactional dynamics that produce particular memories, ideologies, and practices among the group members. It themselves becomes relevant, termed as units of analysis of our study. Questions, issues and topics process focus group. Through different dynamics multiple angles of vision {{can be seen in the}} new world in unexpected ways. Focus group helps us move towards constructing a ‘methodology of getting lost” and toward enacting “double practices” (lather, 2001). This seems a necessary step towards conducting qualitative research. Keeping norms and rules of groups in mind the researcher and research participants realize that interpretation of individual are situated, provisional, contingent, unstable thus it’s unchangeable. It is necessary for the researcher to have self-reflectivity that involves making the research transparent rhetorical and poetic work of the researcher in representing the object of the study. It is theoretically important to construct a mutual ground between the researcher and the research participants. The second sense of self-reflexivity is important to encourage refection on interpretive research as the dual practice of knowledge gathering and self transformation is done through self-reflection and mutual reflection. Allowing ourselves to dwell in the existing inevitable indeterminacies, we are leading ourselves in the best way of the qualitative research practice. According to Lederman, a focus group is a ‘technique that involves the use of profound group interviews in which participants are selected because they are a purposive sampling of a specific population, with the group being ‘focused’ on a given topic’. (Rabiee, 2004). According to Powell et al., a group of individuals selected and gathered by researchers to discuss and comment on, from personal experience, the topic that is the subject of the research form a focus group.(Gibbs, 1997)Some of the features of focus group discussions include, member’s involvement, a number of consecutive meetings, the common characteristics of members with respect to interests, the evolvement of qualitative data, and discussion within the group that is focused on a topic, that is determined by the purposes of the research(Freitas, 1998). In other words, a focus group is an informal discussion among a group of selected individuals about a particular topic (Wilkinson 2004). A focus group, as a research method, involves more than one participant per data collection session.Some of the main characteristics of Focus Groups are; Focus groups involve people in which there is a group of usually 4-10 members. The group size depends on the topic. It should be understood that the size should be small enough so that all the members get a chance to share their views and yet, large enough for people to get different perspectives (Ogunbameru, 2003).Participants are homogenous and unfamiliar with each other which means that people who have similar ages, ethnic backgrounds, etc. this is because it will help the session very effectively as there won't be too many clashes. It should be noted that the group should not be too homogenous because some amount of heterogeneity is required to get useful information when it comes to recalling past events or religious groups (Ogunbameru, 2003).Focus groups are a data collection procedure where in, the main purpose is to determine the perception, feelings, and manner of thinking. These are not aimed to develop consensus or to arrive at some agreeable plan (Ogunbameru, 2003). Focus groups make use of Qualitative data, which means that the data is collected using qualitative tools, which requires very skilled people. This data provides a great insight into the phenomenological world of the members, taking into consideration the attitude, perceptions, and thoughts (Ogunbameru, 2003). Focus groups have a focused discussion where in the leader maintains focus on a particular topic. This helps the discussion to stay on track as every member has different ideas to pool in about the same topic (Ogunbameru, 2003).The significance of focus group methodology is that it helps in exploring what people perceive and think, and understanding why the members have certain opinions about what they believe in(n.d, 2009). Jenny Kitzinger (2005), a famous focus group researcher, is of the opinion that focus group method is an ‘ideal’ approach for examining the stories, experiences, points of view, beliefs, needs and concerns of individuals. Working in a group enables the researchers to receive different communication forms that the members use in their day-today interactions with other. These communications and interactions involve joking, arguing, teasing and recapturing past events. This is important since it may not be easy, or even possible to receive the knowledge and attitudes of various people while they respond to more direct form of questionsOne of the main purposes of focus group discussion is to get light into the respondents’ phenomenological world of experience, thinking, perceiving and feeling. These experiences, feelings, attitudes might be independent of a group or its cultural and social settings but are more likely to reveal itself in the interaction with other people in a group or another social setting.

40|$|Aim: To {{produce a}} {{framework}} {{for the development of}} a qualitative semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>guide.</b> Background: Rigorous data collection procedures fundamentally influence the results of studies. The semi-structured interview is a common data collection method, but methodological research on the development of a semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>guide</b> is sparse. Design: Systematic methodological review. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science for methodological papers on semi-structured interview guides from October 2004 - September 2014. Having examined 2, 703 titles and abstracts and 21 full texts, we finally selected ten papers. Review methods: We analysed the data using the qualitative content analysis method.

40|$|There are two {{established}} methodological {{approaches in}} present-day epidemiological research: quantitative and qualitative. Both approaches {{were used in}} this paper due to their complementary quality. Semi-structured interviews used with a refined analytical approach of statistical text analysis {{provide an opportunity to}} reach to the core and essence of the subject (personal estimate of their quality of life). The goal of this research was to compare the results of qualitative analysis of textual data acquired through general <b>interview</b> <b>guided</b> approach in epidemiological research with results acquired through analysis of data from SF- 36 Health Survey. Additional goal was to compare the applicability of textual analysis done by computer programs and its contribution in gaining information on examinees in comparison with interpretative methods of textual analysis. Sample consist of 117 examinees aged from 23 to 82, more women (55, 6 %) than men, of various professions, most of them married (73, 5 %), more than 85 % have secondary-school education, most of them are retired (59 %), more than half (52, 2 %) of them self-evaluated their health is the same as health of their peers, most of them (75 %) live in Zagreb. This research used a Croatian edition of SF- 36 as a validated and standardized questionnaire. Analysis of questionnaire SF- 36 shows that the sample correlated to results gained through research based on the same questionnaire used on 1 % of inhabitants in Croatian regions. The analysis of <b>interview</b> <b>guided</b> approach through interpretative techniques resulted in 12 clusters with different numbers of examinees. Every cluster was analyzed and described by examinees' characteristics, {{as well as by the}} Physical Component Summary (PCS) measure and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) measure from SF- 36 Health Survey. The analysis of <b>interview</b> <b>guided</b> approach through computer program Dtm-Vic provided two kinds of results: results of lexicometrical analysis and results of correspondence and cluster analyses. Lexicometrical analysis of textual data provided 32365 words all together, 5381 or 16. 4 % are different words, which shows that examinees mostly use the same language in describing their health condition. 35 most frequently used words are: sam (od jesam) (= I am (from "to be")), ja (= I), mi (= to me), me (= me), imam (= I have), nemam (I don't have), ne_mogu (I can't), mogu (I can). That shows a high level of individual approach in heath evaluation which was insisted upon. Final results of correspondence and cluster analyses were 12 clusters of examinees with different numbers of examinees. They were analyzed and described by examinees' characteristics, as well as by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) measure and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) measure from SF- 36 Health Survey. Clusters obtained by different techniques of analyses (interpretative and computer) cannot be mutually compared as they included different examinees. Comparison of questionnaire SF- 36 analysis and textual data acquired through general <b>interview</b> <b>guided</b> approach shows great similarity in final results. However, textual data, i. e. their analysis, provide much more information, they are more detailed and show examinees' individuality. The paper shows that general <b>interview</b> <b>guided</b> approach is particularly suitable and useful in epidemiological researches because it provides plentiful information on population sample chosen for this research using the method of intensity sampling...|$|R
