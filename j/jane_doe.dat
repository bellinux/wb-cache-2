5|$|The {{local police}} {{department}} {{reported that they}} received many tips suggesting possible identities for the child, those of missing girls throughout the country. Many readers online told police that the girl could be Aliya Lunsford of West Virginia, who disappeared on September 24, 2011. Lunsford would have been six {{at the time of}} the discovery and did bear a resemblance to the reconstruction of the <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe,</b> but she was later excluded from the case. The Massachusetts State Police later released statements on their Facebook pages regarding the exclusions of Lunsford, as well as Ayla Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|In season three, George's father, Harold O'Malley (George Dzundza), is {{diagnosed}} with cancer and dies, with his wife Louise (Debra Monk) and George's brothers Jerry (Greg Pitts) and Ronny (Tim Griffin) by his side. Louise goes on to appear occasionally, and was last seen in season eight. A ferryboat accident brings along Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), who is initially introduced as a pregnant <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe</b> victim, suffering from amnesia. Pope eventually embarks on a relationship with Karev, until she {{is diagnosed}} with a personality disorder in season four, and makes her final departure. Amidst {{the crisis of the}} ferryboat crash, Meredith falls into the water at the disaster site. Although rescued, she goes into cardiac arrest, waking up in what appears to be limbo. Within the limbo, Meredith is entertained by deceased acquaintances Duquette and Dylan Young (Kyle Chandler), who was killed during a bomb crisis in the second season, until eventually being resuscitated. Seeking a cure to her depression, Meredith undergoes therapy sessions with the hospital psychiatrist, Dr. Katharine Wyatt (Amy Madigan), who in addition, serves as a psychiatrist to Hunt.|$|E

50|$|There {{were a few}} {{reasons why}} the court decided {{in favor of the}} Does. The court stated that the Does’ right to privacy was {{violated}} because the information that <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe’s</b> husband gave the police officers (being HIV positive) was confidential information. Even though the information was given willingly and without prompting, <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe’s</b> husband offered that information in a private setting to government officials who are expected to keep that kind of information secret. While the Barrington officers may have only told Runnemede officers, it was a Runnemede officer, Officer Smith, who broke this confidence.|$|R

The <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe's</b> case was featured on the website for America's Most Wanted but did not lead to her identification.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a lot}} {{of debate}} in many cases over what this {{actually}} means. The part that keeps the state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property has been interpreted, in this case, to allow a right to privacy. The police officers being considered government employees makes them representatives of the state. Since the state cannot deprive a person of their liberty, and part of that liberty is a right to privacy, the police here had no reason to break <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe’s</b> husband’s confidence and reveal to the DiAngelos his AIDS diagnosis.|$|R

25|$|It was {{two and a}} {{half years}} after his first kill when Jesperson killed again. On 30 August 1992, the {{currently}} unidentified body of a woman he raped and strangled was found near Blythe, California. He says the <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe's</b> name was Claudia. A month later, in Turlock, California, the body of Cynthia Lyn Rose was discovered. He claims she was a prostitute who entered his truck at a truck stop while he slept. His fourth victim was another prostitute, Laurie Ann Pentland of Salem, Oregon. Her body was found in November of that year. According to Jesperson, she attempted to double the fee she charged for the sex he had been engaged in with her. She threatened to call the police, and he strangled her.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jane</b> <b>Doe's</b> blood alcohol {{concentration}} {{was measured}} in a hospital several hours after the assault at 0.12%, and doctors estimated her intoxication level at 1 a.m., the estimated time of the assault, to have been around 0.22%, or 0.242-0.249%. She told the police {{that she did not}} remember the events from some point after her arrival at the party until she woke up more than three hours later in the hospital. Shortly before 1 a.m., Doe phoned her boyfriend and left a voicemail message, which would be later entered as evidence by the prosecution. The Palo Alto Weekly described it as [...] "almost entirely incomprehensible"; a juror later cited it as particularly strong evidence that she was not in a fit state to give consent.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{into the}} investigation, it was {{speculated that the}} victim {{was one of four}} missing females from the area, Nancy Wilcox, Susan Curtis, Debra Kent and Nancy Baird. Later, these were {{eventually}} eliminated as potential identities after x-rays of Juab County <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe's</b> teeth were compared to their dental records. Currently, all four subjects still remain missing and have never been recovered. A detective was looking through the evidence locker at the Davis County Sheriff's Office in 2013 when he came across some hair marked [...] "Hair from Yuba Lake body." [...] This was attributed to retired Davis County Sheriff's Captain Kenny Payne formerly working there as well as the state medical examiner's office {{at the same time and}} misplacing the evidence. The detective sent it off to Juab County soon after.|$|R

5000|$|After Judge Aaron Persky's {{sentencing}} of Brock Turner in 2016, Persky {{was criticized}} by <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe's</b> attorneys for allowing suggestive {{photos of the}} unidentified victim, taken at a party {{a year after the}} gang rape, into evidence, and preventing other victims from testifying. Attorneys for [...] "Jane Doe" [...] said the photographs were not the only evidence that Persky unfairly permitted. Four of the baseball players had invoked Fifth Amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation. According to a lawyer for Doe, that was a critical juncture: it prevented the victim's team from obtaining evidence that could have helped them pursue their case. The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could refuse to testify, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from subsequently testifying in the case. That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky after he took over the trial in 2011, a move that Doe's attorneys say undermined her case.|$|R
50|$|Austin {{says that}} {{everything}} {{is caused by the}} mysterious body. Tommy is attacked in the bathroom by an unseen figure. He has bruises on his body but only saw the attacker's grey eyes. They decide to burn <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe's</b> body in the cremation furnace, but the door to the autopsy room locks on its own, trapping them inside. Austin breaks a hole in it with an axe and, through the hole, sees one of the living corpses. They then choose to burn her in the examination room, but the fire spreads wildly and burns the camera that was recording the autopsy. They manage to put out the fire using a fire extinguisher, but the body is not burned at all. The elevator turns back on and they rush to get in; however, the door does not close completely. In the ensuing chaos, Tommy uses an axe to attack the living corpse that appeared to be chasing them, revealing to be Emma. Emma's death from the injury devastates Austin and leaves Tommy ridden with guilt.|$|R

[...] Reaser explained that when she was cast, there were no definite plans for the development of her character, and that only the intrigue of the ferry accident had been explained to her. She also deemed her character [...] "frustrated and scared". As for the make up process, Reaser stated: [...] "The prosthetic changes your outlook on yourself. It can be very disorienting. It's intense." [...] Beers, however, noted that the focus on Ava was mainly due to her inability to express her feelings through facial expressions, only communicating with her eyes and voice. Executive producer Rob Corn stated that his plan for the original arc was about <b>Jane</b> <b>Doe's</b> inner life, struggling {{to get out of the}} situation she is trapped in. He stated that the main characteristics they had been looking for in the actress for the part were strength and vulnerability. He also called Reaser's performance [...] "heart-wrenching and wonderful". Betsy Beers, the show's supervising executive producer, found Izzie to have been marked for life by Denny's death, which matured her [...] "in a very sobering way", but played a major role in making her feel more confident. She also noted the undeniable connection between Izzie and Alex Karev, whose desire to do honorable things has been compared with his [...] "cutting and sarcastic" [...] personality. After Izzie's continuous efforts to change Alex during their relationship in the previous season, Beers announced the possibility of a relationship between the two of them. She also contrasted the female leads on the show with women in film, explaining how the characters on television are shaped in unique ways.|$|R
