50|$|Some humoral and {{cellular}} {{components of the}} skin pass through the vessel lymph {{to get to the}} circulation. This circulation net has a big importance, it’s the way of direct communication between the specific site of the skin and the lymph cells found inside the lymph node and the systematic tissues.The epidermis antigens are connected with some cells of the skin. Among them there are the APC, antigen presenting cells (Langerhans, <b>dentritic</b> and cutaneous). They capture the antigen, they process it and they present it on their surface as being associated with the MHC-II. Keratinocytes produce TNFα and IL-1 which act on the Langerhans cells, inducing an increase of the expression of histocompatibility complex and cytokine secretion. Moreover, they induce their migration from the skin to the paracortical areas of the lymph nodes. Once there, these cells can provide the necessary stimulus for the lymphocytes T, who will proliferate and express the cutaneous receptor recruitment and to various chemo attractants that promote the accumulation of dermal micro vascular endothelial cells of inflamed skin to finally enter the skin tissue.Once the activated lymphocytes arrive, they get in contact with the antigen, they proliferate and develop their effector functions in order to neutralize or eliminate the pathogen. The Langerhans cells promote and permit the start of the cellular immune response of lymphocytes through the skin and are recruited from the peripheral blood. Antigen presentation may occur in peripheral lymphoid tissues.|$|E
50|$|TLR9 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major player in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Loss of TLR9 exacerbates progression of SLE, and leads to increased activation of <b>dentritic</b> cells. TLR9 also controls the release of IgA and IFN-a in SLE, and loss the receptor leads to higher levels of both cytokines. In SLE, TLR9 and TLR7 have opposing effects. TLR9 regulates inflammatory response, while TLR7 promotes inflammatory response. TLR9 has an opposite effect in ENL. TLR9 is expressed at high levels on monocytes of ENL patients, and is positively linked to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β. TLR9 agonists and antagonists may be useful in treatment of a variety of inflammatory conditions, and research in this area is active. Autoimmune thyroid diseases have also been shown to correlate with an increase in expression of TLR9 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). Patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases also have higher levels of the nuclear protein HMGB1 and RAGE protein, which together act as a ligand for TLR9. HMB1 is released from lysed or damaged cells. HMGB1-DNA complex then binds to RAGE, and activates TLR9. TLR9 can work through MyD88, an adaptor molecule that increases the expression of NF-kB. However autoimmune thyroid diseases also increase sensitivity of MyD88 independent pathways. These pathway ultimately leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PMBCs for patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases. Autoimmune diseases can also be triggered by activated cells undergoing apoptosis and being engulfed by antigen presenting cells. Activation of cells leads to de-methylation, which exposes CpG regions of host DNA, allowing an inflammatory response to be activated through TLR9. Although it is possible that TLR9 also recognizes unmethylated DNA, TLR9 undoubtedly has a role in phagocytosis-induced autoimmunity.|$|E

The hgpr84 was found by Northern blot analysis as a transcript of about 1.5 kb in brain, heart, muscle, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, intestine, placenta, lung, and leukocytes. In addition, a 1.2 kb transcript in heart and a strong band at 1.3 kb in muscle were detected. A Northern blot from different brain regions revealed strongest expression of the 1.5 kb transcript in the medulla and the spinal cord. Somewhat less transcript {{was found in the}} substantia nigra, thalamus, and the corpus callosum. The 1.5 kb band was also visible in other brain regions, but at very low levels. EST clones corresponding to hgpr84 were from B cells (leukemia), neuroendocrine lung as well as in microglial cells and adipocytes. A more detailed description of expression profile can be found in www.genecards.org. The resting expression of GPR84 is usually low but it is highly inducible in inflammation. Its expression on neutrophils can be increased with LPS stimulation and reduced with GM-CSF stimulation. The LPS-induced upregulation of GPR84 was not sensitive to dexamathasone pretreatment. There was also a GPR84 downregulation in <b>dentritic</b> cell derived from FcRgamma chain KO mice. In microglial cells, the GPR84 induction with interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was also demonstrated. 24 h treatment with IL-1β also induced 5.8 times increase in GPR84 expression on PBMC from healthy individuals[...] Transcriptional dynamics of human umbilical cord blood T helper cells cultured in absence and presence of cytokines promoting Th1 or Th2 differentiation was studies. It turned out that GPR84 belongs to the Th1 specific subset genes. While another publication suggests that GPR84 is rather a CCL1 related Th2 type gene.|$|E

Our work is aimed at developing a new technology for the magnetic manipulation of bacterial cells marked with specific DNA onto which magnetic nanoparticles have been grafted. With this technology, it will be possible to selectively remove from the indigenous microbial population of a soil the bacteria that have been transformed with this magnetic DNA. The tagging of plasmids comprising genes involved in chlorous pollutant degradation pathway will enable to understand the horizontal gene transfer mechanisms involved in the eviction of hard-to-remove polluants such as Lindane. A <b>dentritic</b> approach for the decoration of the nanoparticles appears promising as the diversity of functionalization brought by the arborescent structure answers simultaneously all the criteria of biocompatibility, low toxicity and specificity. The structure of the proposed dendritic molecules can be divided into 3 parts: a biphosphonate group at the core which allows a strong and stable coupling between the nanoparticle and the dendritic part under various pH and temperature conditions, a PAMAM (polyaminoamine) -derived dendron and then, at the periphery, hydrophilic and biocompatible oligoethyleneglycol chains decorated with arnino or carboxylic groups, allowing an interaction with the DNA through phosphate or arnine groups.

40|$|HIV- 1 {{replication}} is {{a tightly}} controlled mechanism which demands {{the interplay of}} host as well as viral factors. Both gp 120 (envelope glycoprotein) and Nef (regulatory protein) have been correlated {{with the development of}} AIDS disease in independent studies. In this context, the ability of HIV- 1 to utilize immature <b>dentritic</b> cells for transfer of virus is pivotal for early pathogenesis. The presence of C-type lectins on dendritic cells (DCs) like DC-SIGN, are crucial in inducing antiviral immunity to HIV- 1. Both gp 120 and Nef induce the release of cytokines leading to multiple effects of viral pathogenesis. Our study elucidated {{for the first time the}} cross-talk of the signaling mechanism of these two viral proteins in immature monocyte derived <b>dentritic</b> cells (immDCs).

Our results also revealed that the anti-apoptotic signals emanated from Nef was put to halt by gp 120 through inhibition of Nef induced STAT 3.
