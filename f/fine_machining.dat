The aim of the presented work was to analysis the effects of reversible <b>fine</b> <b>machining</b> sequence on surface integrity in machined layer. Nonlinear hardening during reverse loading and the change of the Bauschinger effect factor with plastic strain were properly taken into account. In experiments, the residual stresses have been measured using the X-ray diffraction technique (at {{the surface of the}} workpiece and in depth). Moreover, micro-hardness and surface roughness of machined surface are presented. Experimental data for the range of cutting parameters tested showed that the reversible <b>fine</b> <b>machining</b> produce the tensile residual stresses at the surface, which are critical in the performance of the machined components. The experimental results of micro-hardness of reversible <b>fine</b> <b>machining</b> technique are smaller than that of general <b>fine</b> <b>machining</b> show that decreased plastic deformation of the surface layer and work-hardening.

40|$|Conventional manual {{polishing}} is {{the most}} common finishing process step in an otherwise completely automated process chain for free formed dies and moulds made of steel. As constant process parameters cannot be provided by the worker, manual polishing carefully approaches the goal to obtain fine surfaces down to 5 nm Ra and form accuracies better than 1 m {{at the same time and}} requires up to 30 minutes per square centimetre. Therefore, a manual process cannot be implemented efficiently in terms of economic aspects. For steel, ultra precision diamond machining cannot be applied because of high diamond tool wear. The material removal of processes based on indefined cutting edges such as grinding, lapping and polishing are mainly driven by the combination of materials and the process parameters cutting speed, contact pressure and specific duration [1]. In order to perform a deterministic <b>fine</b> <b>machining,</b> thus controlling and keeping these parameters constant is essential. Fu rthermore, the investigation on <b>fine</b> <b>machining</b> of steel surfaces identified micro chipping as most responsible for material removal [2]. For this reason, a modular force controlled machining system, which is guided by a 6 -axis robot arm, was developed at Fraunhofer IPT. The machine can perform both rotational and oscillating removal motions and applies an additional rotation for multidirectional surface treatment. With regard to first polishing attempts the system enables the automated <b>fine</b> <b>machining</b> down to 10 nm Ra starting with 400 nm Ra in less than 5 minutes per square centimetre...|$|E
40|$|In the {{production}} of ceramic components machining in the green state bears many advantages according to flexibility and economy. This holds true especially for small lot sizes when compared to forming processes like moulding and pressing. But unfortunately in the ceramic industry, in most cases, the process design in green machining is based only on experience. Therefore, approaches will be presented for an economic and quality consistent green machining process by applying the potentials of modern machine tools and cutting tools like PCD. The situation is different {{in the area of}} <b>fine</b> <b>machining</b> of ceramics where numerous approaches have been presented in recent years towards optimizing the machining processes, which are already applied in industry such as grinding and lapping.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increased}} demand for manifold industrial goods requires superior manufacturing techniques. In the field of steel products, cold forging has gained importance for the last sixty years. Within cold forging the tool takes a key role as it determines both accuracy and efficiency of forming process. For forming processes with high demands regarding wear resistance WC-Co cemented carbides are increasingly used as tool materials. The manufacturing process of the tool requires a combination of hard and <b>fine</b> <b>machining.</b> In {{order to reduce the}} effort of subsequent <b>fine</b> <b>machining</b> process, surfaces with low roughness are preferred. As grinding leads to high surface qualities, it is a common method in tool machining. Grinding is accompanied by compressive residual stresses in the surface which have a positive influence on the tool life. The absolute value of residual stresses is determined by the machining parameters. The present study investigates the influence of feed and in-feed on the topography and the near surface residual stresses. While the surface roughness is correlated with both parameters, the feed has a major influence on the residual stresses in the surface of cemented carbides...|$|E
