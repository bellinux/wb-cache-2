It is important to notice that the size of the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> depends on the signal wavelength. As a consequence, in order to study diffraction in a given configuration, we need to estimate the occluded {{portion of the}} Fresnel ellipsoids at the frequencies of interest. In [26] the author proposes to use the graphics hardware to estimate the hidden portions of the ellipsoids. The main limit related to the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> is the absence of information related to the phase of the signal: from the hidden portions of the ellipsoid, in fact, we can only infer the absolute value of the diffraction filter. If we need a more accurate rendering of diffraction, we must resort to other techniques.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-level}} {{artificial intelligence}} language with symbolic/logical manipulation capabilities, {{together with a}} simple ansatz based on {{the properties of the}} <b>Fresnel</b> <b>ellipsoid,</b> is used to implement an efficient computer algorithm for automatic ray-tracing. The geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) ray-tracing solution for the radio-line path-loss evaluation over piecewise-linear two-dimensional terrain profiles is presented. The program which implements the algorithm is described separately in this issue on pp. 1499 - 1500. ...|$|E
30|$|It has to {{be noted}} that {{only a portion of}} the {{footprint}} will be ‘sensitive’ to the reflected signal, namely the first Fresnel zone, which is the projection on the ground of the first <b>Fresnel</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> defined considering the geometry and the wavelength [37]. The majority of the reflected power is generated within this area, particularly when the terrain can be considered flat at the used wavelength. If scattering over a rough surface occurs, a wider area (the so-called glistening zone) should be taken into account.|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of fixed {{wireless}} links, having Fresnel zone clearance or in other words Line-of-Sight (LOS) link is highly recommended. Without the presence of obstacles in the first <b>Fresnel</b> <b>ellipsoids,</b> the signal attenuation of the transmission path is equivalent to free space attenuation. Nonetheless, this ideal unobstructed link cannot be attained at all times especially when the transmitting and receiving antennas are positioned near to the ground particularly below rooftop level as well as when wireless propagation channel depends on {{the conditions of the}} environment. Besides the terrain and buildings, the presence of vegetation dong the path will have an adverse effect on the receiving signal. Furthermore, trees growth over time of operation will affect the condition of the link even if the link is initially unobstructed. Hence, this research aims to determine the average value of excess path loss which is inclusive of foliage attenuation by measuring and characterizing the signal distortion attributed to vegetation that exists in the vicinity of point-to-point links based on Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802. 11 a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) standard at 5. 8 GHz. The study on the effect of vegetation blockage is performed within the campus of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for both Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Near Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) links. Data acquisition is performed based on the concept of remote data logging in which data can be gathered via a remote server constantly for 24 hours and seven days a week together with the integration of daily scheduled data logged e-mailing. The behaviour of the link performance is studied and the average excess path losses are found to be 12. 2 dB and 4. 6 dB for NLOS links obstructed by a single tree and a row of trees respectively...|$|R
30|$|Diffraction {{is a very}} {{important}} propagation mode, particularly in densely occluded environments. Failing to properly account for this phenomenon in such situations could result in a poorly realistic rendering or even in annoying auditory artifacts. In this section we provide a brief description of three techniques for rendering diffraction phenomena: the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>Ellipsoid,</b> the line of sources, and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD). We will then explain why the UTD {{turns out to be the}} most suitable approach to the modeling of diffraction in conjunction with beam tracing.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work we have {{demonstrated}} {{a possibility for}} real-time operation by orbital an-gular momentum (OAM) of optical beams via Pockels effect in solid crystalline materials. Basing on the analysis of optical <b>Fresnel</b> <b>ellipsoid</b> perturbed by conically shaped electric field, we {{have shown that the}} point groups of crystals convenient for the conversion of spin angular momentum (SAM) to OAM should contain a three-fold symmetry axis or a six-fold inversion axis. The results of our experimental studies and theoretical simulations of the SAM-to-OAM conversion efficiency carried out for LiNbO 3 crystals agree well with each other.
