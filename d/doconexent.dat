40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids on proliferation and autophagy of human lung cancer cells. Methods The lung cancer cells A 549 were treated with stearic acid (saturated fatty acid) and <b>doconexent</b> (DHA, unsaturated fatty acid), respectively, in concentrations of 0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 μmol/L. MTT test and cell clone formation assay were performed to detect the proliferation of A 549 cells. The morphology of A 549 autophagy was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy after A 549 cells were treated with stearic acid or DHA for 24 hours. Western blotting assay was used to detect the expression of autophagy-related protein after A 549 cells were treated with stearic acid or DHA for 12, 24 and 36 hours, respectively. Results 30 - 240 μmol/L stearic acid or DHA both inhibited the proliferation of A 549 cells (P< 0. 05). Both stearic acid and DHA induced autophagy of A 549 cells, meanwhile, down-regulated Phospho-mTOR (ser 2481) and up-regulated LC 3 Ⅱ/LC 3 Ⅰ of A 549 cells (P< 0. 05). Conclusions Both saturated fatty acid and unsaturated fatty acid can inhibit the proliferation and induce autophagy of lung cancer cells. The mechanisms of autophagy {{may be related to}} Phospho-mTOR (ser 2481) signaling pathway. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2017. 08. 0...|$|E
