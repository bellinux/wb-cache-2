5|$|Joyce became {{frustrated}} with life in Trieste {{and moved to}} Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank. <b>He</b> <b>disliked</b> Rome and returned to Trieste in early 1907. His daughter Lucia was born later that year.|$|E
5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. <b>He</b> <b>disliked</b> aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} {{secondary}} school, Presley {{thought for a}} short time about joining a gospel group. He attempted to join a group called Songfellows who sang at the local church, but he was unsuccessful. He worked on an assembly line in his first job, which he quit after a few weeks because <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> the work. He then decided to become an apprentice electrician at Crown Electric.|$|E

5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. <b>He</b> <b>disliked</b> the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> committees, Hutton {{served as}} an England Test {{selector}} in 1975 and 1976, but business commitments limited his availability so he resigned in 1977. Hutton became involved with Surrey cricket in later years but maintained links with Yorkshire, and became president of Yorkshire county cricket in January 1990. In his final years, Hutton suffered from ill health and became increasingly frail. In September 1990, he suffered a ruptured aorta shortly after watching a cricket match at the Oval. After an unsuccessful operation, he died on 6 September.|$|E
5|$|Following Toronto's first-round exit, McGrady {{became a}} free agent, signing a six-year, $67.5 million {{contract}} with the Orlando Magic. He elected to join the Magic in part because <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> his secondary role playing behind Vince Carter, in part {{so that he could}} return home to Florida, and in part to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady into a larger leadership and scoring role than anticipated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>dislikes</b> Professional wrestling (Pro-wrestling) because [...] "it sucks" [...] and he doesn't like fiction.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in the city, Spider-Man confronts DarkDevil {{the hero}} <b>he</b> <b>dislikes</b> most. The two fight each other.|$|R
5000|$|He {{stated in}} 2013 that <b>he</b> <b>dislikes</b> playing golf {{and uses the}} {{treadmill}} to stay in shape.|$|R
5|$|In 1867, {{three years}} after the first performance, Rossini discreetly orchestrated the Petite messe solennelle, partly for fear that others would do it anyway after his death. As <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> the sound of cathedral boys' choirs, he {{requested}} permission from the pope to perform the work with female voices at a church. When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer preferred the chamber music version anyway.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that we do not}} have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which <b>he</b> <b>disliked.</b> He did not specify what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams had {{a modest}} private income, which {{in his early}} career he {{supplemented}} {{with a variety of}} musical activities. Although the organ was not his preferred instrument, the only post he ever held for an annual salary was as a church organist and choirmaster. He held the position at St Barnabas, in the inner London district of South Lambeth, from 1895 to 1899 for a salary of £50 a year. <b>He</b> <b>disliked</b> the job, but working closely with a choir was valuable experience for his later undertakings.|$|E

50|$|The {{narrator is}} a Stone Age tribal singer who reacts badly to {{criticism}} of his work. He also deals badly with other artists whose work <b>he</b> <b>dislikes.</b> <b>He</b> kills a younger singer {{as well as a}} cave painter.|$|R
5|$|Ashurst Turner Gilbert {{was elected}} Principal in 1822, aged only 35; he had secured the {{fellowship}} in 1809 {{on the strength}} of a first. <b>He</b> <b>disliked</b> teaching – although he admitted it paid the bills – and much preferred being Principal. There, he would be eventually made Vice-Chancellor of the University and later Bishop of Chichester. Gilbert committed Brasenose to a cause of neutral politics and mainstream Anglicanism, strongly rejecting Tractarian and Evangelical ideas including supporting the censure of Dr. Renn D. Hampden. His time was spent pre-occupied with the religious tensions of the University, having spent time opposing changes to religious services in Oxford on behalf of Oxford Tories.|$|E
5|$|Born in the Melbourne {{suburb of}} Preston on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury {{was the second}} son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, née Steel. Growing up in Prahran, Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billycarts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends. Kingsbury {{attended}} Windsor State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at Melbourne Technical College. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business, a job <b>he</b> <b>disliked.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bute {{had four}} major seats, Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire, and Cardiff Castle in South Wales, with his London townhouse on Campden Hill in Kensington. Bute {{preferred}} {{to live in}} Mount Stuart House; <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> London and only spent a few weeks in Cardiff Castle each year. Twice each year he would travel from Mount Stuart House through Ayrshire to Edinburgh, down through northern England to London, and on to Cardiff and his South Wales estates. In November 1843, a fire swept through Luton Hoo House, destroying the interior; the house's historic library survived, however, {{and most of its}} famous collection of paintings were rescued from the blaze; it was subsequently sold off by Bute.|$|E

5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This {{is not to say}} that <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding to be the best Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E
5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in 1817, {{the son of a}} London musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's works, {{especially}} his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. He {{believed that the}} best poetry relied on contemporary language, and <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.|$|E

50|$|Tompkins has {{expressed}} in interviews that <b>he</b> <b>dislikes</b> writing (particularly writing for others), preferring instead {{to perform in}} front of a camera.|$|R
5|$|Mad Maxs quest design also {{received}} mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised {{the content and}} activities scattered across the world, calling the activities engaging for most players. However, <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> the repetition which dragged down their replay value. Hurley found it easy for players to become confused in the game's early stages, since the objectives are unclear. Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity. Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that the game brought nothing new to the genre, and its quests and features were too similar to typical Ubisoft open-world design.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1562, Mary {{sent for}} Knox again after {{he gave a}} sermon denouncing certain {{celebrations}} which Knox had interpreted as rejoicing {{at the expense of}} the Reformation. She charged that Knox spoke irreverently of the Queen in order to make her appear contemptible to her subjects. After Knox gave an explanation of the sermon, Mary stated that she did not blame Knox for the differences of opinion and asked that in the future he come to her directly if he heard anything about her that <b>he</b> <b>disliked.</b> Despite her friendly gesture, Knox replied that he would continue to voice his convictions in his sermons and would not wait upon her.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 1978, Paramount {{assembled}} the largest press conference {{held at the}} studio since Cecil B. DeMille announced he was making The Ten Commandments. Eisner announced that Academy-Award winning director Robert Wise would direct a film adaptation of the television series, titled Star Trek—The Motion Picture. Wise had only seen a few Star Trek episodes, so Paramount gave him about a dozen to watch. The budget was projected at $15million. Dennis Clark (Comes a Horseman) was invited to rewrite the script and to include Spock, but <b>he</b> <b>disliked</b> Roddenberry, who demanded sole credit. Livingston returned as writer, and although he also found Roddenberry unreasonable, Wise and Katzenberg convinced him to continue rewriting the script throughout production.|$|E
50|$|Above all, <b>he</b> <b>dislikes</b> dogmas, {{whether in}} theory, subject matter or technique, and uses {{whatever}} seems {{best suited to}} the matter at hand.|$|R
