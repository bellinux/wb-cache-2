5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E
25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and large yellow underwing.|$|E
6000|$|As for old age, my Lady Lydia {{had little}} respect for that {{accident}} {{in the life of}} some gentlemen and gentlewomen; and, once the settlements were made in her behalf, treated the ancient Van den Bosch and his large periwig with no more ceremony than Dinah her black attendant, whose great ears she would pinch, and whose woolly pate she would pull without scruple, upon offence given--so at least Dinah told Gumbo, who told his master. All the household trembled before my lady the Countess: the housekeeper, of whom even my lord and the dowager had been in awe; the pampered London footmen, who used to quarrel if they were disturbed at their cards, and grumbled as they swilled the endless beer, now stepped nimbly about their business when they heard her ladyship's call; even old Lockwood, who had been gate-porter for half a century or more, tried to rally his poor old wandering wits when she came into his lodge to open his window, inspect his wood-closet, and turn his old dogs out of doors. Lockwood bared his old bald head before his new mistress, turned an appealing look towards his niece, and vaguely trembled before her little ladyship's authority. Gumbo, dressing his master for dinner, talked about Elisha (of whom he had heard the chaplain read in the morning), [...] "and his bald head and de boys who call um names, and de bars eat em up, and serve um right," [...] says Gumbo.

At this time, Carbodies were developing a replacement for the FX4, the CR6, which is why this 'stopgap' FX4S was introduced. However, the CR6 was abandoned in 1985 and MBH decided to carry on making the FX4 until such time as it could fund a new cab. The FX4S was superseded in 1987 by the FX4S-Plus, which had a rear compartment redesigned to allow five passengers, the trim changed to grey. A new <b>grey</b> plastic <b>moulded</b> dashboard was also fitted. This was received very well by the trade, as a sign that their needs were actually being listened to.|$|R

40|$|Several {{species of}} Typhula cause {{diseases}} of cereals and grasses at low temperatures. Taxonomic separation of T. phacorrhiza, T. incarnata and T. ishikariensis was investigated using RAPD, ITS-RFLP and nucleotide sequencing of the ITS region. Using 10 RAPD primers on genomic DNA or eight restriction enzymes on PCR-amplified ITS regions, banding patterns were generated {{for each of}} 19 isolates from five species or varieties. Polymorphisms were found between species and varieties, with fewer among isolates within species or varieties. RAPD analysis suggested that T. ishikariensis var. idahoensis may be distinct from the other varieties (var. ishikariensis and var. canadensis), although this was not supported by ITS-RFLP. To confirm relationships, ITS nucleotides were obtained from single isolates {{of each of the}} five Typhula taxa, and sequence alignments were subjected to distance and parsimony analysis. Although there were differences in branching between dendrograms derived from sequencing vs. RAPD or ITS-RFLP, sequence data supported the distinction of the three main Typhula species, with the T. ishikariensis varieties grouping together and showing differences at an infraspecific level. ITS sequence data also indicated the closer taxonomic affinity of Typhula species to the agaricoid Tricholoma sejunctum compared to the clavarioid Thelephora terrestris. Several species of Typhula are pathogens of grasses and cereals. Typhula phacorrhiza Reichard, the type species of Typhula (Remsberg, 1940), occurs in northern temperate zones. It is a psychrophile, and can be observed frequently on maize residues and other organic debris after at least 80 days of snow cover (Burpee et al., 1987). Burpee et al.

40|$|Efficacy and mode {{of action}} were {{investigated}} for Aureobasidium pullulans, a potential biocontrol agent for <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> on strawberry fruit. Wound inoculation of detached green strawberry cv. Elsanta fruit with Aureobasidium pullulans prevented <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> rot on fruit inoculated 2 days later with Botrytis cinerea.

40|$|Garden {{strawberry}} (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important soft fruit crops in Finland. Every year, over ten thousand tonnes of strawberries are produced, but in many cases they are affected by <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> disease (Botrytis cinerea Pers.). <b>Grey</b> <b>mould</b> disease is absolutely devastating for strawberry, as it can affect up to 80 % of the yield.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in annual crops of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) (cv.

In 1998, the incidence of B. cinerea on flower parts was assessed, and the symptoms of <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> on fruits were characterised with regards to their starting point. The incidence of B. cinerea on petals was 65 - 85 % of those flowers that harboured B. cinerea. The starting point of symptoms was located underneath the sepals in 65 - 85 % of fruits with <b>grey</b> <b>mould,</b> and petals were present at this site in about 50 % of the cases.

40|$|Capsicum (Capsicum annuum L.) {{is mostly}} {{cultivated}} in humid and warm conditions, which increases disease development, particularly <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> caused by Botrytis cinerea. Infection of capsicum fruit by B. cinerea often occurs preharvest but symptoms of <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> {{are not usually}} visible until after harvest making the pathogen difficult to control. Appropriate fertilisation that ensures calcium (Ca) and boron (B) is sufficient in plant tissues, especially in fruit, has been suggested {{as an alternative to}} fungicides for disease management. This research studied the infection pathway of B. cinerea and the effect of Ca and B on <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> development and quality of fruit in two capsicum cultivars (cv. Aries and cv. Papri Queen). Botrytis cinerea infected capsicum preharvest and flowers often died when inoculated at anthesis. The number of dead flowers increased when inoculum concentration increased. The extent of <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> development on fruit inoculated preharvest was not affected by timing of inoculation [at anthesis, 3 days after anthesis (DAA) or 6 DAA], but was dependent on inoculum concentration and cultivar. When capsicum fruit were inoculated after harvest, <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> developed most rapidly in red (R) fruit from cv. Aries and breaker red (BR) fruit from cv. Papri Queen. An inoculation of 10 ⁶ conidia mL¯¹ caused more disease on fruit than 10 ⁴ or 10 ⁵ conidia mL¯¹. Cv. Aries was more susceptible to B. cinerea than cv. Papri Queen regardless of whether inoculation occurred before or after harvest. The effect of both soil and foliar application of boron (B), at different concentrations, on <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> development and fruit quality of capsicum was examined. Preharvest B application, from transplanting to harvest when fruit were mature and red, using 0. 05 or 0. 1 mM H₃BO₃ via soil amendment or 2. 0 or 7. 0 mM H₃BO₃ as a foliar spray increased B concentration in leaves and fruit of both cultivars. However, soil application was more effective than foliar application in increasing B concentration in plant tissues. Foliar application of B at low concentrations (0. 025 or 0. 075 mM H₃BO₃) did not increase B concentration in plant tissue. Increasing B concentration in leaf and fruit tissue reduced <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> development on fruit inoculated with B. cinerea preharvest compared to the control, but did not affect <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> development on red fruit inoculated with B. cinerea postharvest. Preharvest soil application of B increased shelf life of fruit, but did not affect quality of fruit including water content, firmness, total soluble solid content (TSSC) and titratable acidity (TA) at harvest or during storage. Symptoms of B toxicity were observed on leaves from plants that received high B concentration (0. 1 mM H₃BO₃) in the soil, but no effect was observed on fruit. Preharvest application of calcium (Ca) via soil amendment [1. 5, 4. 0 or 8. 0 mM Ca(NO₃) ₂] or as a foliar spray [0. 5 or 1. 0 % w/v mM Ca(NO₃) ₂] increased Ca concentration in leaves, but did not increase Ca concentration in fruit, regardless of cultivar. Soil Ca application appeared to increase Ca concentration in leaf tissue more effectively than the Ca foliar spray. Ca concentration in leaf tissue from cv. Aries was significantly higher than in leaf tissue from cv. Papri Queen when plants received the same amount of Ca, regardless of application method. Ca treatment did not affect quality of fruit at harvest or during storage. Preharvest application of Ca reduced <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> development on fruit that had been inoculated with B. cinerea preharvest, but did not reduce <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> in fruit inoculated postharvest. Symptoms of Ca deficiency were observed on plants that received no Ca or low Ca concentration [1. 5 mM Ca(NO₃) ₂] from transplant to fruiting. Dipping and vacuum infiltration with calcium chloride (CaCl₂. 2 H₂O) did not increase Ca concentration in flesh after treatment, but vacuum infiltration did increase Ca concentration in flesh after 10 days of cool storage (10 °C). Ca treatment after harvest did reduce <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> development on fruit, but did not affect the quality of fruit during storage. A directly inhibitory effect of Ca on fungal growth was responsible for reducing <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> development on fruit. In conclusion, capsicum was most sensitive to infection by B. cinerea at anthesis and high inoculum concentrations caused a greater disease incidence in capsicum fruit, regardless of whether inoculation occurred preharvest or after harvest. Reducing inoculum concentration, especially during flowering, is therefore recommended to reduce losses in capsicum. Preharvest application of Ca or B may be used as an alternative method to reduce <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> on capsicum fruit, but they had no effect on fruit quality. Postharvest application of Ca could also be recommended for cv. Aries fruit before or during storage for controlling <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> on fruit. Findings in this research may therefore provide basic knowledge for management of B. cinerea in the capsicum industry. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|AIM: Test of Bacillus subtilis strain GA 1 for its {{potential}} to control <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> disease of apple caused by Botrytis cinerea. METHODS AND RESULTS: GA 1 was first tested {{for its ability to}} antagonize in vitro the growth {{of a wide variety of}} plant pathogenic fungi responsible for diseases of economical importance. The potential of strain GA 1 to reduce post-harvest infection caused by B. cinerea was tested on apples by treating artificially wounded fruits with endospore suspensions. Strain GA 1 was very effective at reducing disease incidence during the first 5 days following pathogen inoculation and a 80 % protection level was maintained over the next 10 days. Treatment of fruits with an extract of GA 1 culture supernatant also exerted a strong preventive effect on the development of <b>grey</b> <b>mould.</b> Further analysis of this extract revealed that strain GA 1 produces a wide variety of antifungal lipopeptide isomers from the iturin, fengycin and surfactin families. A strong evidence for the involvement of such compounds in disease reduction arose from the recovery of fengycins from protected fruit sites colonized by bacterial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here demonstrate that, despite unfavourable pH, B. subtilis endospores inoculated on apple pulp can readily germinate allowing significant cell populations to establish and efficient in vivo synthesis of lipopeptides which could be related to <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> reduction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work enables for the first time to correlate the strong protective effect of a particular B. subtilis strain against <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> with in situ production of fengycins in infected sites of apple fruits.

40|$|<b>Grey</b> <b>mould</b> is an {{important}} disease of strawberries resulting from flower and fruit infection by Botrytis cinerea Pers. The saprophytic fungus Ulocladium atrum Preuss is a promising biological control agent for control of B. cinerea in strawberry and other crops. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the efficacy of U. atrum to control <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> by a single application of a spore suspension (2 x 106 conidia/ml) at different flower and fruit development stages. Four experiments were carried out in 1999, two under natural and two under enhanced inoculum levels of B. cinerea. In each experiment, flowers and young fruits in six distinct stages of development were sprayed with either water or U. atrum suspension. U. atrum suppressed B. cinerea sporulation on petals by 15 to 54 ÐOne to four days after spraying, U. atrum was present on less than 30 ␘f stamens and did not affect the incidence of B. cinerea on these flower parts. The efficacy of the U. atrum sprays in controlling <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> was low to moderate, and resulted on average in a reduction of 21 ␒n disease incidence on ripe fruits. Low control efficacy was probably due to poor coverage with or colonisation of stamens by U. atrum spores, and a relatively low level of suppression of the colonisation of flower parts by B. cinerea. Significant reductions of <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> in comparison to the control (p ≤ 0. 10; on average 41 ␛eduction) were found most frequently when the antagonist was introduced at late flowering or early fruit stages. Therefore, these are the most suitable stages to apply U. atrum. Further studies are needed to improve the spray coverage and persistence of U. atrum inoculum...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Business Intelligence architecture proposal, including data sources, data warehouse, business analytics, and information delivery, {{to launch an}} early warning system for greenhouse tomato crop <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> disease. Tomato {{is a very important}} crop in the Mediterranean region in general and in Portugal in particular being the production for fresh consumption made essentially in greenhouses. Botrytis cinerea Pers. : Fr. is the causal agent of <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> disease {{and is one of the}} most important diseases affecting greenhouse tomato crops, high relative humidity and the presence of free water on the plant surfaces have been recognized as favourable to the development of this disease. The availability of a early warning system providing to the tomato grower alerts with information of the potential favoured conditions for the disease appearance in its early stages or even before can have a very positive impact in reducing the economic and environmental impacts due to a more rational and efficient disease control management. Today we have the necessary technology to build and launch an Internet based early warning system for <b>grey</b> <b>mould</b> disease in greenhouse tomato crop supported by a wireless sensor network adopting a Business Intelligence approach. From the research conducted until the moment the proposed solution is viable and the next step will be to validate it in the field in different locations and with distinct greenhouses conditions...|$|E
