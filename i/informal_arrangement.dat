5|$|In 1669, the Jewels went {{on public}} {{display in the}} Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a {{cupboard}} {{and showed it to}} visitors for a small fee. This <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement</b> was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, with the help of three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an orb. They were apprehended at the perimeter, and the items were recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb. Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.|$|E

The Crown Dependencies, which are outside of the EU, are not members either. Instead, a Common Travel Area exists between the two states and the Crown Dependencies. The Common Travel Areas is not founded on any formal {{agreement}} between Ireland and the United Kingdom and is not provided for in legislation. Instead, it is an <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement</b> between the states. When the Schengen Area was incorporated into the European Union through the 1992 Amsterdam Treaty, the first formal recognition of the Common Travel areas was made though an annexed protocol exempting their obligations to join.|$|E

25|$|Open {{adoption}} allows {{identifying information}} to be communicated between adoptive and biological parents and, perhaps, interaction between kin and the adopted person. Rarely, it is the outgrowth of laws that maintain an adoptee's right to unaltered birth certificates and/or adoption records, but such access is not universal (it is possible in a few jurisdictions—including the UK and six states in the United States). Open adoption can be an <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement</b> subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole authority over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and binding agreement concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding the child. As of February 2009, 24 U.S. states allowed legally enforceable open adoption contract agreements {{to be included in}} the adoption finalization.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} soon {{declared}} the official [...] "musical ambassadors" [...] for the year, although, according to Linnell, {{it was more}} of an <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The band had originally planned to create short videos called [...] "Space Minutes" [...] which would have aired on an unspecified cable television station that was affiliated with ISY, but the plans never came to fruition. In support of the designation, the logo for ISY is included on the back cover of the album. The band was scheduled for concerts to endorse ISY, and mentioned in promotional material from NASA, which headed the celebration in the United States. Commenting on the success of the designation of International Space Year, however, Linnell pointed out that he [...] " [...] think most people have heard that this is International Space Year".|$|E
500|$|In 1871, President Abbott {{proposed}} that the Board of Trustees [...] "take steps {{to provide for the}} proper layout of the college grounds, planting of trees, location of buildings, etc., by a competent landscape gardener, as soon as means can be spared." [...] In 1872, Adam Oliver, a landscape gardener from Kalamazoo, was hired. During his tenure from 1872–1887, he was oversaw the layout of walks and drives and the placement of numerous buildings, including Linton Hall in 1881. He was responsible for the closed roadway system, an altered form of which remains today as West Circle Drive, and was also responsible for the <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of campus buildings. The character of the campus is described in President Abbott's 1882 report to the Board as follows: [...] "There are in the park no straight rows of buildings or of trees, but its...buildings...are separated by undulating lawns, shallow ravines, and groups of trees".|$|E

The deaths of 76 workers – 64 from Sellafield and 12 from other UK nuclear plants – were examined, although {{the scope of the}} inquiry was later significantly widened." [...] The person behind this scheme was Dr Geoffrey Schofield, who became BNFL's Company chief medical officer, and who died in 1985. Sellafield staff did not breach any legal obligation, did not consider their actions untoward, and published the scientific information obtained in peer-reviewed scientific journals. It was the hospital pathologists, who were profoundly ignorant of the law, who breached the Human Tissue Act 1961 by giving Sellafield human organs, without any consents, under an <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Grand Duke Constantine, {{second son}} of Paul I, was heir {{presumptive}} to his reigning brother Alexander, {{who had no}} legitimate issue, until 1823. In 1821–1822 the Romanov brothers agreed that Constantine would step down from the order of succession in favor of Nicholas. The <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement</b> was sealed by Alexander's secret manifest in 1823. Neither Constantine nor Nicholas were made aware of its existence; the whole country sincerely believed that Constantine was the heir. Extreme secrecy made the Manifest unenforceable in real life. When the news of Alexander's death reached Saint Petersburg on [...] 1825, Nicholas duly pledged allegiance to Constantine before Alexander Golitsyn, one of three persons entrusted with keeping the secret, could reach the Winter Palace. Golitsyn convened an emergency meeting of the State Council and presented the Manifest. Council members, now facing an unprecedented dynastic crisis, were unprepared to act as state authority and left the outcome to Nicholas who reiterated his allegiance to Emperor Constantine. Constantine, who {{did not intend to}} reign, temporarily became the Emperor of All Russias.|$|E

40|$|This study explores both {{formal and}} <b>informal</b> <b>arrangements</b> for care of orphans in the Maseru {{district}} of Lesotho. The study adopted {{a qualitative approach}} using both in-depth interviews and documentary research as the primary methods of data collection. The research findings show that care of orphans in Lesotho is predominantly {{in the hands of}} non-governmental and church based organisations. The government’s role is limited to the provision of technical support, including the formulation of policies and laws and some welfare grant provision in the form of free primary education. Care of orphans in the communities is undertaken not only by the extended family members of orphans, but also non-relation community members. It is clear however that while such <b>informal</b> <b>arrangements</b> might provide care and protection to orphan, many are struggling in the face of extreme hardship and poverty. A crisis of social reproduction is therefore increasingly apparent in Lesotho...|$|R
2500|$|From 2006–2009, Morpurgo, Lee Hall and Revel Guest {{worked on}} a {{proposed}} film version of War Horse, which Morpurgo and Hall would write and Guest produce. Lack of finances meant {{that it was an}} <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement,</b> with the film rights not formally sold by Morpurgo to Guest's production company and no one being paid for the work they undertook. In 2009, film producer Kathleen Kennedy saw the critically acclaimed production of War Horse in London's West End with her husband, fellow producer Frank Marshall and their two daughters. They were very impressed by the story and Marshall has recalled how he was amazed that no one had already bought the film rights to the book. Steven Spielberg was told about War Horse by several people, including Kennedy, who was his colleague at Amblin Entertainment. After discussions with Revel Guest, it was announced on 16 December 2009 that DreamWorks had acquired the film rights to the book, with Spielberg stating: [...] "From the moment I read Michael Morpurgo's novel War Horse, I knew this was a film I wanted DreamWorks to make ... Its heart and its message provide a story that can be felt in every country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{expression}} [...] "curate-in-charge" [...] was mainly used of an <b>informal</b> <b>arrangement</b> whereby an incumbent gave substantial responsibility {{for one of}} the churches within the parish to an assistant, in law it denoted a cleric licensed by the bishop to exercise {{some or all of the}} cure-of-souls when the incumbent had failed to make adequate provision for them or was subject to disciplinary measures. Once in possession of their benefices, rectors and vicars enjoyed a freehold, and could only be removed after due legal process, and for a restricted number of reasons. Perpetual curates were placed on a similar footing in 1838 and were commonly styled [...] "vicars", and this practice was legally recognised in 1868. Clergy (both transitional deacons and priests) who assist the [...] "curate" [...] were, and are, properly called assistant curates, but are often referred to as [...] "the curate". A house provided for an assistant curate is sometimes colloquially called a [...] "curatage". Assistant curates are also licensed by the bishop, but only at the request of the [...] "curate", who had the right of dismissal subject to certain conditions. Although it is customary for a priest to serve as a curate in one or more parishes before becoming an incumbent, it is by no means unknown for priests who have previously been beneficed or consecrated bishop to return to a curacy (as assistant curate), sometimes as a matter of choice. For example, Geoffrey Francis Fisher served as Curate of Trent near Sherborne after retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1961.|$|E
