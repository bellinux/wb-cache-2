5|$|Although rare, {{infection}} of humans by rabies from vampire bat bites has been documented; {{for example in}} 2010 four children in Peru died after being bitten. The highest occurrence of rabies in vampire bats occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> populations found in South America. However, the risk of infection to the human population is less than to livestock exposed to bat bites. Only 0.5% of bats carry rabies, {{and those that do}} may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a consensus that the region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> New World wine market.|$|E
5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses.

They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is thought that they may have a different microbial population <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.|$|E
