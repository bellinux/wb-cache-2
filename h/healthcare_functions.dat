A larger building opened in 1846 on Chapel Road, and was given the name [...] "Worthing Infirmary and Dispensary" [...] after an enlargement in 1860. In 1881, {{the first part of}} what would become Worthing Hospital was opened: an 18-bed facility was built on a former plant nursery on Lyndhurst Road, northeast of the town centre. [...] Its range of facilities was extended in 1889, 1900, 1912 and 1923, and there were 78 beds by 1937. In 1975, a 375-bed block was added, and the oldest buildings were replaced in 1997 by a new ward of 120 beds. [...] The latter extension was undertaken by the Worthing and Southlands Hospitals NHS Trust, but since 1 April 2009 Worthing Hospital has been administered by the Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust. [...] Meadowfield Hospital, formerly Swandean Hospital, is a mental health unit based in an 1865 house in High Salvington. It was opened as an isolation hospital in 1897 and later became a geriatric unit. [...] There is another mental health unit at Greenacres, near Worthing Hospital. [...] Goring Hall Hospital is a private hospital operated by BMI Healthcare, with 12 day-care beds and a 38-bed ward. Princess Margaret opened the facility in 1994. [...] The former Courtlands Hospital, opened in 1951 as postoperative care unit operated by Worthing Hospital, was housed in a Grade II listed building in West Worthing until its closure in 1973. [...] It was still used for <b>healthcare</b> <b>functions</b> by West Sussex County Council until 1996.|$|E
30|$|In {{healthcare}} system, {{the information}} stored in health database has enhanced {{over the past}} ten years, leading it to be considered big data. According to Raghupathi, this industry has historically generated huge amounts of data driven by record keeping and patient care [3]. This massive quantity of data hold the promise of supporting a wide range of medical and <b>healthcare</b> <b>functions,</b> including clinical decision support, sensor-based health condition and food safety monitoring, disease surveillance, and population health management, etc. [4, 5, 6]. For instance, diagnosing cancer requires petabytes of data from various sources to identify the state of the disease and the survival potential of the patient. Further, the use of information technology on healthcare big data today is reducing the cost of healthcare while improving its quality by emphasizing more preventive and personalized care and basing on continuous monitoring [7]. In this context, James et al. give an estimation of savings $ 300 Billion every year in the US alone [8].|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} data {{in the world is}} exploding. In particular, the {{healthcare}} industry is generating large amounts of data, driven by a wide range of medical and <b>healthcare</b> <b>functions,</b> including clinical records, medical images, genomic data, health behaviors, clinical decision support, disease surveil-lance, and public health management [1]. Reports say that worldwide digital healthcare data was estimated to be equal to 500 petabytes in 2012 and is expected to reach 25, 000 pet-abytes in 2020 [2]. However, the challenges in handling this big data are not just about volume. The challenges include capturing, storing, searching, sharing, analyzing, and then finding insights from complex, noisy, heterogeneous, lon-gitudinal, and voluminous data. The collection of large and complex data sets is difficult (or impossible) to process using common database management tools or traditional data pro-cessing applications. Therefore, these challenges are a reality for every business, but only a few firms are taking advantage of the new world of data and information. To take advantage of the massive amounts of data in health-care fields and provide the right intervention to the right pa-tient at the right time, personalized care to the patient, and potentially benefit all the components of a healthcare system, such as provider, payer, patient, and management, big data analytics needs to bridge data mining and healthcare infor-matics communities. In particular, data mining researchers need to be introduced to the sources available and the possi-ble challenges and techniques associated with using big data in the healthcare domain; at the same time, healthcare ana-lysts and practitioners need to be exposed to the advances in the computing field to effectively handle and make infer-ences from voluminous and heterogeneous healthcare data...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{tried to}} {{systematically}} investigate the in vitro antioxidant activity of Rhizoma Cibotii (RC) {{for the first}} time. Method: The methanol extract from RC (MERC) was prepared then systematically investigated by various antioxidant assays, including: DPPH• (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical), ABTS•+ (3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 - sulfonic acid diammonium salt radical), •O 2 - (superoxide anion radical), •OH (hydroxyl radical) scavenging assays, Fe 3 + reducing power, Cu 2 + reducing power assays, compared with positive controls Trolox (± - 6 -hydroxyl - 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetramethlychromane- 2 -carboxylic acid) and BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole). Its total phenolics and caffeic acid content were also measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method and HPLC, respectively. Result: MERC exhibited effective antioxidant activity in dose-dependent manners and its IC 50 values were calculated as 44. 2 ± 0. 62, 19. 84 ± 0. 31, 137. 66 ± 2. 90, 22. 94 ± 0. 90, 289. 73 ± 46. 17, 53. 52 ± 1. 51 µg /mL，for DPPH•, ABTS•+, •O 2 -, •OH scavenging assays, Fe 3 + reducing power, Cu 2 + reducing power assays, respectively.

40|$|Our heavily {{populated}} world is facing exponentially increasing healthcare demands that challenge existing healthcare infrastructure. Struggling {{to respond to}} the rapidly changing spatial needs of healthcare, the architecture of healthcare facilities, undergo frequent cycles of building renovation, reconfiguration and expansion. The relevant financial stress and resource expenditure has impelled both publicly and privately funded healthcare institutions to seek the most effective and cost effective ways to deliver quality healthcare results. However, these current resolutions such as facility focus on outpatient services and decentralization of clinical functions, imply a certain shortsighted view that architecture’s only role in healthcare is the facilitation of medical procedures. Whether on the individual or collective level, healthcare is a continuous and comprehensive event that extends far beyond medical procedures that are predominantly reactive in nature. Such is architecture that is capable of contributing to successful healthcare results, by providing a variety of other spatial functions and conditions. With the noticeably growing value of preventative healthcare and interest in the self-curation of healthcare, this thesis intends to redefine the traditional role of architecture in healthcare by exploring the possibility that healthcare and the public libraries can be effectively integrated through architecture. By spatially conditioning the combined access and experience of diagnosis, consultation, awareness education and anticipatory data collection, architecture can become the means to maximize the potential of preventative healthcare, and proactively improve the overall health of a population. Using Brooklyn Public Libraries’ Pacific Branch as an opportunity of investigation, this thesis first examines the needs and trends of both healthcare and the public libraries, to align their mutual interests as institutions and as building types. An unconventional program and a list of qualitative criteria are then created as the basis of a design proposal, which attempts to resolve these two apparently incompatible functions. Finally, a theoretical analysis of the proposed library renovation with added <b>healthcare</b> <b>functions</b> seems to confirm the prospect of this hybrid architecture as an appropriate strategy to begin resolving current and future healthcare challenges...|$|E
40|$|Big data {{is a broad}} {{term that}} {{is related to the}} collection, storage and {{analysis}} of large volumes of data. The term big data is often associated with the popular 3 V’s model, which defined that data is growing significantly in the characteristics volume, variety and velocity. In this research we defined big data as: the collection, storage and transformation of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources into useful information (or knowledge) to improve decision-making within organizations. The significant growth of data is also occurring in the health care sector. A lot of these scattered data sources, possessing large volumes of personal health data of patients, are present in the health care. Big data have shown potential to support health care, by combining and transforming health data. Big data can be used to support medical and <b>healthcare</b> <b>functions,</b> including among others clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and population health (Raghupathi & Raghupathi, 2014). The increasing availability of large data sets from various sources in combination with the development of more advanced analytical tools for big data makes it more and more difficult to ensure privacy. Big data in its current form is still relatively new, and the knowledge on the implications on the security and privacy issues that it brings is still limited. This study explores the relation between big data and privacy in the health care. The research objective {{of this study is to}} gather knowledge on how big data affects privacy in the health care. In order to reach this objective, semi-structured interviews have been conducted with eight experts in either big data, health care or privacy in the Netherlands. In this research, a conceptual model of privacy has been created based on existing theories of privacy (e. g. nonintrusion theory, seclusion theory, control theory and restricted access theory). The conceptual model of privacy defines privacy in the elements: natural privacy, normative privacy, control aspect of privacy and the condition of privacy and has been used as a structure to analyze the relation between big data and privacy.

40|$|Introduction : High {{quality of}} medical {{services}} {{is essential to}} proper <b>healthcare</b> <b>functioning</b> and to achieve aims. High quality of nursing care {{should have the same}} characteristics as the whole healthcare system. Although current healthcare systems focus on best quality medical services, the number of adverse events is increasing. It sometimes happens that a patient suffers injuries not due to his/her illness, but because of poorly organised healthcare. Aim of the research : To assess the influence of adverse events and their identification on nursing care quality and to analyse the correlation between patient safety and adverse events identification and reporting. Material and methods: The research was conducted in hospital wards that have and do not have a Certificate of Quality Management System. In the research, the Hospital Survey on Patient Culture prepared by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was used as well as the author’s own survey. Results: In the survey, nurses’ activities were evaluated in the context of adverse events identification. As the most common undesirable events, the following were considered: discrepancy connected with organisation and administration (35 %), medical equipment (24 %), hospital infections (23 %), medication administration (22 %), doctor’s (20 %) and nurse’s (19 %) activity, and blood and blood related specimen transfusion (10 %). However, these areas were not disastrous. Conclusions: It has been stated that nurses, for fear of disciplinary consequences, are more unwilling to report such events.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) -based healthcare control system, {{which is based}} on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) and P 300 of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The proposed system is composed of two modes, a brain switching mode and a <b>healthcare</b> <b>function</b> selection mode. The switching mode can detect whether a user has the intent to activate the function selection mode by detecting SSVEP in an ongoing EEG. During the function selection mode, the user is able to select any functions that he/she wants to activate through a healthcare control panel, and the function selection is done by detecting P 300 in the user’s EEG signals. The panel provides 25 functions representing 25 frequently performed activities of daily life. Therefore, users with severe motor disabilities can activate the system and any functions in a self-paced manner, achieving the goal of autonomous healthcare. To achieve high P 300 detection accuracy, a novel P 300 detector based on kernel Fisher’s discriminant analysis (kernel FDA) and support vector machine (SVM) is also proposed. Experimental results, carried out on five subjects, show that the proposed BCI system achieves high SSVEP detection (93 %) and high P 300 detection (95. 5 %) accuracies, meaning that the switching mode has a high sensitivity, and the function selection mode has the ability to accurately detect the functions that the users want to trigger. More important, only three electrodes (Oz, Cz, and Pz) are required to measure EEG signals, enabling the system to have good usability in practical use...|$|R
