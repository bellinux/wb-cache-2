40|$|Half of {{all human}} {{transcription}} factors use C 2 H 2 zinc finger domains to specify site-specific DNA binding and yet very {{little is known about}} their role in gene regulation. Based on in vitro studies, a zinc <b>finger</b> <b>code</b> has been developed that predicts a binding motif for a particular zinc finger factor (ZNF). However, very few studies have performed genome-wide analyses of ZNF binding patterns, and thus, it is not clear if the binding code developed in vitro will be useful for identifying target genes of a particular ZNF. We performed genome-wide ChIP-seq for ZNF 263, a C 2 H 2 ZNF that contains 9 finger domains, a KRAB repression domain, and a SCAN domain and identified more than 5000 binding sites in K 562 cells. Our results suggest that ZNF 263 binds to a 24 -nt site that differs from the motif predicted by the zinc <b>finger</b> <b>code</b> in several positions. Interestingly, many of the ZNF 263 binding sites are located within the transcribed region of the target gene. Although ZNFs containing a KRAB domain are thought to function mainly as transcriptional repressors, many of the ZNF 263 target genes are expressed at high levels. To address the biological role of ZNF 263, we identified genes whose expression was altered by treatment of cells with ZNF 263 -specific small interfering RNAs. Our results suggest that ZNF 263 can have both positive and negative effects on transcriptional regulation of its target genes...|$|E

The widely used minutiae-based representation did not utilize a significant component of the rich discriminatory information available in the fingerprints.

40|$|Abstract — Forensic Science {{is an art}} {{and science}} of a print made by an {{impression}} of ridges in {{the skin of a}} finger, often used for biometric identification in criminal investigation. The law enforcement agencies uses system like AFIS (Automatic Fingerprint Identification System) where reference fingerprints are stored in database which are further used to match with latent fingerprints recovered from actual crime scene. There is high rate of rejection of latent fingerprints since they are found in damaged condition due to blood spills, oil spills, wet surface, snow, dust, etc that damages their quality and hence individuality of fingerprint is lost. Verification of such mutilated fingerprints against stored reference fingerprint can be done using Laplacian, Gaussian, minutia-based, etc methods. Each such method has there own advantages and disadvantages. The paper emphasis on the use of Gabor filters for fingerprint identification. The fingerprint matching is done by extracting the <b>Finger</b> <b>code</b> from both reference and latent fingerprints and then finding the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding finger codes. After proper training the system, the result obtained provides 99 % rate of recognition. Keywords- Biometrics, Gabor filters, Finger code,Euclidean distance,latent fingerprint...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Biometrics {{technique}} {{is an important}} and effective solution for automatic personal verification/identification. Re-cently, a novel hand-based biometric feature, Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP), has attracted an increasing amount of attention. Like any other biometric identifiers, FKPs {{are believed to have}} the critical properties of universality, uniqueness and permanence for personal recognition. This paper investigates a new approach for human FKP recognition using 1 D Log-Gabor filter response. We employ 1 D Log-Gabor wavelet to extract the information. Thus each finger is represented by a two <b>finger</b> <b>codes</b> (real and imaginary template). Those templates (<b>finger</b> <b>codes)</b> are compared with those in the database using Hamming distance. The experimental results showed that the designed system achieves an excellent recognition rate on the Hong Kong polytechnic university (PolyU) Finger-Knuckle-Print Database. The proposed {{technique is}} computationally effective with recognition rates of 99. 71 % and 99. 91 % for verification and identification, respectively...|$|R

The final product could easily be incorporated into 3 D applications, each customized to utilize a set of poses.

40|$|AbstractKrüppel (Kr), a {{segmentation}} gene of Drosophila, encodes {{a protein}} sharing structural {{features of the}} DNA-binding “finger motif” of TFIIIA, a Xenopus transcription factor. Low-stringency hybridization of the Kr <b>finger</b> <b>coding</b> sequence revealed multiple copies of homologous DNA sequences in the genomes of Drosophila and other eukaryotes. Molecular analysis of one Kr-homologous DNA clone identified a developmentally regulated gene. Its product, a finger protein, relates to Kr by the invariant positioning of crucial amino acid residues within the finger repeats and by a stretch of seven amino acids connecting the finger loops, the “H/C link. ” This H/C link is conserved in several nuclear and chromosome-associated proteins of Drosophila and other eukaryotic organisms including mammals.

40|$|Abstract. The Kinect T M camera has {{revolutionized}} {{the field of}} computer vision by making available low cost 3 D cameras recording both RGB and depth data, using a time of flight infrared sensor. We recorded and made available a large database of 50, 000 hand and arm gestures. With these data, we organized a challenge emphasizing the problem of learning from very few examples. The data are split into subtasks, each using a small vocabulary of 8 to 12 gestures, related to a particular application domain: hand signals used by divers, <b>finger</b> <b>codes</b> to represent numerals, signals used by referees, marshalling signals to guide vehicles or aircrafts, etc. We limited the problem to single users for each task and to the recognition of short sequences of gestures punctuated by returning the hands to a resting position. This situation is encountered in computer interface applications, including robotics, education, and gaming. The challenge setting fosters progress in transfer learning by providing for training {{a large number of}} subtasks related to, but different from the tasks on which the competitors are tested. ...|$|R
40|$|The Broad-Complex (BR-C) is {{essential}} for metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. This locus is coextensive with the 2 B 5 ecdysone-responsive early puff and is necessary for puffing and transcription of many subsequently activated late genes in the developing salivary gland. Mapping of 31 cDNA clones indicates that approximately 100 kb of the genome {{is devoted to the}} synthesis of many BR-C RNAs. Sequence analyses of these cDNA clones show that the BR-C encodes a family of related proteins characterized by a common core amino-terminal domain fused to alternate carboxy domains each containing a pair of zinc fingers. Most proteins also contain domains rich in distinctive amino acids located between the common core and zinc finger regions. BR-C mutant alleles resulting from chromosomal rearrangements at 2 B 5 are associated with deletions of 5 '-untranslated sequences, separation of the core coding domain from the downstream zinc finger domains, or a P element insertional disruption of a zinc <b>finger</b> <b>coding</b> sequence. We infer that the BR-C directly regulates late gene expression by specifying the synthesis of a family of proteins with DNA binding potential...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{describe}} {{here the}} sequencing, annotation and comparative analysis of an 8 Mb region of pig chromosome 17, {{which provides a}} useful test region to assess coverage and quality for the pig genome sequencing project. We report our findings comparing the annotation of draft sequence assembled at different depths of coverage. Results: Within this region we annotated 71 loci, of which 53 are orthologous to human known coding genes. When compared to the syntenic regions in human (20 q 13. 13 -q 13. 33) and mouse (chromosome 2, 167. 5 Mb- 178. 3 Mb), this region {{was found to be}} highly conserved with respect to gene order. The most notable difference between the three species is the presence of a large expansion of zinc <b>finger</b> <b>coding</b> genes and pseudogenes on mouse chromosome 2 between Edn 3 and Phactr 3 that is absent from pig and human. All of our annotation has been made publicly available in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation browser, VEGA. We assessed the impact of coverage on sequence assembly across this region and found, as expected, that increased sequence depth resulted in fewer, longer contigs. One-third of our annotated loci could not be fully realigned back to the low coverage version of the sequence, principally because the transcripts are fragmented over several contigs. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the considerable advantages of sequencing at increased read depths and discuss the implications that lower coverage sequence may have on subsequent comparative and functional studies, particularly those involving complex loci such as GNAS...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} avail the {{benefits}} of higher user convenience, hygiene, and improved accuracy, contact less 3 D fingerprint recognition techniques have recently been introduced. One of the key limitations of these emerging 3 D fingerprint technologies to replace the conventional 2 D fingerprint system is their bulk and high cost, which mainly results {{from the use of}} multiple imaging cameras or structured lighting employed in these systems. This paper details the development of a contact less 3 D fingerprint identification system that uses only single camera. We develop a new representation of 3 D finger surface features using <b>Finger</b> Surface <b>Codes</b> and illustrate its effectiveness in matching 3 D fingerprints. Conventional minutiae representation is extended in 3 D space to accurately match the recovered 3 D minutiae. Multiple 2 D fingerprint images (with varying illumination profile) acquired to build 3 D fingerprints can themselves be used recover 2 D features for further improving 3 D fingerprint identification and has been illustrated in this paper. The experimental results are shown on a database of 240 client fingerprints and confirm the advantages of the single camera based 3 D fingerprint identification.

40|$|Cellular senescence, {{the limited}} ability of cultured normal cells to divide, {{can result from}} {{cellular}} damage triggered through oncogene activation (premature senescence) or the loss of telomeres following successive rounds of DNA replication (replicative senescence). Although both processes require a functional p 53 signaling pathway, relevant downstream p 53 targets {{have been difficult to}} identify. Discovery of senescence activators is important because induction of tumor cell senescence may represent a therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer. In microarray studies in which p 53 was reactivated in MCF 7 cells, we discovered that Yippee-like- 3 (YPEL 3), a member of a recently discovered family of putative zinc <b>finger</b> motif <b>coding</b> genes consisting of YPEL 1 - 5, is a p 53 -regulated gene. YPEL 3 expression induced by DNA damage leads to p 53 recruitment to a cis-acting DNA response element located near the human YPEL 3 promoter. Physiologic induction of YPEL 3 results in a substantial decrease in cell viability associated with an increase in cellular senescence. Through the use of RNAi and H-ras induction of cellular senescence, we show that YPEL 3 activates cellular senescence downstream of p 53. Consistent with its growth suppressive activity, YPEL 3 gene expression is repressed in ovarian tumor samples. One mechanism of YPEL 3 downregulation in ovarian tumor cell lines seems to be hypermethylation of a CpG island upstream of the YPEL 3 promoter. We believe these findings point to YPEL 3 being a novel tumor suppressor, which upon induction triggers a permanent growth arrest in human tumor and normal cells...|$|R

The blocks are assumed to be of the same shape and are moved about quasistatically. The DaVinci Simulator has been used to simulate the stacking and it has been implemented using the Barrett arm. Simulation: The DaVinci Simulator can be used to analyze the stacking process using different forces and different placements of the <b>fingers.</b> An existing <b>code</b> for block-stacking simulates free fall of blocks. However, a free fall cannot be quasi-static. So, a modified code has been written to include additional forces (applied by the robot fingers) which act opposite to the gravitational force to enable quasi-static lifting of blocks. Since the DaVinci Simulator can currently handle two-dimensional motions only, the blocks are moved either parallel to the X-axis or parallel to the Y-axis, as shown in fig. 7.

40|$|Background. Poor {{control of}} {{grasping}} in spastic, hemiparetic patients {{could be because}} {{of a combination of}} poor individuation of joints, weakness, spasticity, and sensory loss. Objective. To investigate the effect of botulinum toxin injections (BTIs) on grasping objects of different shapes and to assess the effect on upper-limb function, reach-to-grasp kinematics, and hand position and orientation at the time of grasp. Methods. We included 15 patients with spastic hemiparesis and 9 healthy controls in this open labeled study, in which the patients were assessed before (M 0), 1 month after a first (M 1), and 1 month after a second BTI (M 4, at 4 months). A motion capture system recorded movements. Kinematic variables were computed as well as hand position and orientation at the time of grasping, and <b>finger</b> configurations were <b>coded</b> from video recordings. Results. In contrast with healthy participants, hemiparetic patients rarely used multipulpar grasps but used specific strategies combined with various directions of approach to the object. BTIs did not alter finger configuration but improved the final direction of the approach and the hand posture during the grasp. No significant changes in kinematic parameters were found using post hoc analysis, although a session effect was found for peak hand velocity. Individual analysis showed that the patients with the best potential for functional improvement are those with good proximal and moderate distal motor command. Conclusions. BTIs can modify hand kinematics as well as the approach and posture of reach-to-grasp movements. Function and grasping strategies are probably more dependent on motor recovery...|$|R

The modern research study reveals that fingerprint is not so secured like secured a password which consists of alphanumeric characters, number and special characters. Fingerprints are left at crime places, on materials or at the door which is usually class of latent fingerprints. We cannot keep fingerprint as secure like rigid passwords. Using some modern technology with copper and graphite spray it's easy to mimic fingerprint image. Fingerprints are a half-secret if passwords are leaked or hacked, it easily revocable using another password. But in a biometric security system, which uses only biometric features, is not easy to change fingerprint key or fingerprint are static biometric, which never change much throughout the lifespan.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the efficacy of selecting students for participation in string instrument instruction based on their performance on three categories (sets) of variables, i. e., aptitudes, behavioral/attitudinal characteristics and academic achievement. ^ The 114 participants, from three public elementary schools, were string players who had from one to four years experience playing their instruments (violin, viola, cello). The aptitudes measured skills that were directly related to playing a musical instrument. This set consisted of a music aptitude test (Measures of Musical Abilities), a visual-motor test (Coding, from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children), and four fine motor tests (Fist/Edge/Palm, Placing Pennies in Box with Preferred Hand, Tapping Board and Finger Tapper). A second set of predictors consisted of the Motivational Characteristics subscale, from Scales for Rating the Behavioral Characteristics of Superior Students, and a report card grade of conduct. The third set consisted of a standardized academic achievement test (SRA) and a report card grade of academic achievement. ^ The results of correlating these 10 predictors with string playing ability were that the academic achievement test and music aptitude predicted best (r =. 47 and r =. 46 respectively). Of the three sets, the aptitude set predicted best (R =. 59). The combination of the aptitude and academic sets yielded the highest overall prediction (R =. 67). The behavioral/attitudinal set made no contribution to the prediction. The most parsimonious set (music aptitude, <b>Coding,</b> <b>Finger</b> Tapper, achievement test, report grade of achievement) predicted as well as the 10 variables combined. This set improved prediction 76 % when compared to the informal criteria in use in the schools prior to this study. Cross-validation procedures suggest that the results may be generalizable to other samples. ^ The value of this research is in the improved selection of students for the study of a string instrument. When the selection process is based on those characteristics that enable a student to sustain musical growth [...] and thus sustain commitment and motivation [...] then that process is likely to be objective and equitable. ...|$|R
