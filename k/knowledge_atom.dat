40|$|Abstract Background Finding {{one small}} {{molecule}} (query) {{in a large}} target library is a challenging task in computational chemistry. Although several heuristic approaches are available using fragment-based chemical similarity searches, they fail to identify exact atom-bond equivalence between the query and target molecules and thus {{cannot be applied to}} complex chemical similarity searches, such as searching a complete or partial metabolic pathway. In this paper we present a new Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) tool: SMSD (S mall M olecule S ubgraph D etector) to overcome the issues with current heuristic approaches to small molecule similarity searches. The MCS search implemented in SMSD incorporates chemical <b>knowledge</b> (<b>atom</b> type match with bond sensitive and insensitive information) while searching molecular similarity. We also propose a novel method by which solutions obtained by each MCS run can be ranked using chemical filters such as stereochemistry, bond energy, etc. Results In order to benchmark and test the tool, we performed a 50, 000 pair-wise comparison between KEGG ligands and PDB HET Group atoms. In both cases the SMSD was shown to be more efficient than the widely used MCS module implemented in the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) in generating MCS solutions from our test cases. Conclusion Presently this tool can be applied to various areas of bioinformatics and chemo-informatics for finding exhaustive MCS matches.

40|$|Abstract. To {{face the}} {{challenges}} of knowledge-intensive environments, we investigate anovel self-organising knowledge-oriented (SOKO) model, called Molecules of Knowledge (MoK for short). In MoK, <b>knowledge</b> <b>atoms</b> are generated by knowledge sources in shared spaces – compartments –, self-aggregate to shape knowledge molecules, and autonomously move toward knowledge consumers. 1 The Molecules of Knowledge Model The Molecules of Knowledge model is a biochemically-inspired coordination model exploiting and promoting self-organisation of knowledge. The basic motivation behind MoK {{is the idea that}} knowledge should autonomously aggregate and diffuse to reach knowledge consumers rather than “be searched”. The main pillars of MoK are represented by the following (bio) chemical abstractions: atoms — the smallest unit of knowledge in MoK, an atom contains information from a source, and belongs to a compartment where it “floats”—and where it is subject to its “laws of nature”; molecules — the MoK units for knowledge aggregation, molecules bond together somehow-related atoms; enzymes — emitted by MoK catalysts, enzymes influence MoK reactions, thus affecting the dynamics of knowledge evolution within MoK compartments to better match the catalyst’s needs; reactions — working at a given rate, reactions are the biochemical laws regulating the evolution of each MoK compartment, by ruling knowledge aggregation, diffusion, and decay within compartments. Other relevant MoK abstractions are instead in charge of important aspects like topology, knowledge production and consumption: compartments represent the conceptual loci for all MoK entities as well as for biochemical processes – like knowledge aggregation and diffusion –, providing MoK with the notions of locality and neighbourhood; sources are the origins of knowledge, which is continuously injected in the form of MoK atoms at a certain rate within the compartmentsourcesbelong to; catalysts stand for knowledgeprosumers, emitting enzymes which represent their actions which affect knowledge dynamics 24 within their own compartment, especially to increase the probability of providing him/her with relevant knowledge items...|$|R

In general {{it is interesting to}} know the change in spacings – or the strain- in the proximity of a lattice defect or a coherent interface between two different substances. From the knowledge of the spacings e. g. relaxation processes can be studied. Mathematical transforms intermediate between direct and reciprocal space make possible digital darkfield strategies for mapping strain relaxation around interfaces and dislocations [1 - 5]. Here we examine applications to the measurement of lattice parameter differences between adjacent phases. A digitized photograph of a HRTEM image serves as input. The FFT is calculated to obtain the power spectrum (PS). One spot in the PS is chosen as a reference frequency, although the precise reference frequency (g-vector) will be chosen later. Next a smooth aperture centered around the chosen point is applied, and the data is shifted so that the reference point is at the DC peak. Calculating the inverse FFT of the shifted data yields a complex image, which can be interpreted as a darkfield (DF) image. Measurements can only be made at relatively bright areas in the DF image.

The sticking coefficient was measured over a wide range of surface temperatures using a highly collimated molecular beam. We showed that the standard way of measuring the sticking coefficient [...] - the King-Wells method [...] - leads to the underestimation of trapping events in which there is incomplete energy accommodation of the molecule on the surface.

Of many candidates as quantum simulators, Rydberg atoms have been extensively utilised due to its exaggerated and fascinating atomic properties. Example includes high susceptibility to electric fields and relatively long life time in comparison to atoms in low-lying states. The tunable interaction between Rydberg atoms have made them even more versatile in simulating quantum many-body systems, e. g. interacting spin- 1 / 2 particles. We will start the thesis by reviewing these properties of Rydberg atoms and explain how they lead to the Rydberg lattice gases that of interest. Following {{the review of the}} essential <b>knowledge</b> of Rydberg <b>atoms,</b> we first study the ground states of interacting Rydberg lattice gases in both one-dimension and two-dimensions. The many-body system we are interested in is initially prepared in a Mott-insulator state, with each lattice site containing one atom that is laser coupled to its highly excited Rydberg state. The extremely huge van der Waals interactions between Rydberg atoms at close distance leads to an interesting Rydberg blockade effect. As we shall show, these strong interactions lead to rich phases and critical behaviours in the ground states of the many-body Hamiltonians that describes the systems. The aim of the first three chapters is to analyse these ground states in detail. Having investigated the static properties, we then move on to study the dynamical behaviour of a class of generic spin models which can in principal be realised by Rydberg lattice gases with tunable blockade radius. By deriving an effective master equation, and comparing it to the exact calculation, we will demonstrate how different pure initial states eventually evolve to the same equilibrium state and analysed in detail the time evolution and the steady state...|$|R
40|$|Computing {{three-dimensional}} structures from sparse experimental constraints requires {{methods for}} combining heterogeneous ources of information, such as distances, angles, {{and measures of}} total volume, shape, and surface. For some types of information, such as distances between atoms, numerous methods are available for computing structures that satisfy the provided constraints. It is more difficult, however, to use information about {{the degree to which}} an atom is on the surface or buried as a useful constraint during structure computations. Surface measures have been used as accept/reject criteria for previously computed structures, but this is not an efficient strategy. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of applying a surface measure in the computation of molecular structure, using a method of probabilistic least square computations which facilitates the introduction of multiple, noisy, heterogeneous data sources. For this purpose, we introduce a simple purely geometrical measure of surface proximity called max/real conic view (MCV). MCV is efficiently computable and differentiable, and is hence well suited to driving a structural optimization method based, in part, on surface data. As an initial validation, we show that MCV correlates well with known measures for total exposed surface area. We use this measure in our experiments to show that information about surface proximity (derived from theory or experiment, for example) can be added to a set of distance measurements o increase significantly the quality of the computed structure. In particular, when 30 to 50 percent of all possible short-range distances are provided, the addition of surface information improves the quality of the computed structure (as measured by RMS fit) by as much as 80 percent. Our results demonstrate that <b>knowledge</b> of which <b>atoms</b> are on the surface and which are buried {{can be used as a}} powerful constraint in estimating molecular structure...|$|R

The fundamental electronic interaction of the methyl group substituted for a hydrogen on a metal-coordinated cyclopentadienyl ring is shown by a combined core and valence pe spectroscopic study {{of a series of}} methyl-substituted ferrocenes. Shifts of core and valence ionization energies upon methyl substitution are equivalent and additive for the iron <b>atom.</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of the core ionization energy shifts for both carbon and iron allow the relative changes in atomic charges upon methyl substitution to be found. In these molecules, the methyl group is found not to be an inductive electron donor as is commonly assumed. The primary electronic effect of methyl substitution is on the valence orbitals of the cyclopentadienyl ring. Methylation of the cyclopentadienyl rings of ferrocene causes a dramatic redistribution of valence electron density and greatly increases the covalent nature of metal-ring bonding. An understanding of the electronic effect of methylation of metal-coordinated cyclopentadienyl rings is used to establish the relative locations of ring π and Cl ionizations in the pe spectra of group IV and V early transition metal bent metallocene dichlorides with both unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands. The differences in chloride and methyl ligand bonding to an early transition metal center are reflected in the photoelectron data of the dichlorides and related dimethyls. The relative differences in metal-chlorine and metal-carbon bond strengths are also shown in the pe data. The relationship between bond strengths and ionization energies is detailed for early transition metal bent metallocenes of niobium and tantalum with a variety of ligands. The relative bond strength/ionization energy information for metal-hydrogen and metal-carbon bonds is shown to help in understanding the stability of niobocene and tantalocene ethylene-hydride complexes and their resistance to intramolecular olefin insertion. Evidence from the pe data concerning the electron distribution as well as the relative bond strengths in these ethylene-hydride complexes is found supporting the consideration of these complexes more properly as metallacyclopropane-hydrides...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{motivated}} {{by the fact that}} previous research on the structure and properties of Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 } showed unacceptably inconsistent results. The primary reason for these inconsistencies was interstitial contamination of Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 } by carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Thus, this study measured the effects that these interstitial atoms have on some of the previously reported properties. These properties include crystalline structure, thermal expansion anisotropy, electronic structure and bonding, and high temperature oxidation resistance. In Chapter 2 of this study, the lattice parameters and atomic positions of Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 } as a function of carbon, nitrogen or oxygen content were measured via x-ray and neutron diffraction. Comparing these lattice parameters to those reported in other studies on supposedly pure Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 } confirmed {{that the majority of the}} previous studies had samples with a considerable amount of interstitial impurities. In fact, the lattice parameter trends given in Chapter 2 can be used to estimate the types and level of impurities in these studies. Furthermore, Chapter 2 discusses how atomic positions change as interstitial atoms are incorporated into the lattice. These changes in atomic separations suggest that strong bonds form between the interstitial atoms and the surrounding titanium atoms. This is in full agreement with the electronic structure calculations given in Chapter 4. These calculations show that bonding does occur between titanium d-states and interstitial atom p-states at the expense of bonding between some of the titanium and silicon atoms. In addition, carbon seems to be the most strongly bonded interstitial <b>atom.</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of the exact interstitial content and its effect on bonding is important because Chapters 3 and 5 have shown that interstitial atoms have a marked effect on the thermal expansion and oxidation resistance. As discussed in Chapter 3, all interstitial atoms lower the thermal expansion anisotropy of Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 } due to the formation of bonds between the interstitial atom and the surrounding titanium atoms. Although interstitial atoms do have an effect on the thermal expansion of Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 }, these effects were not strong enough to explain all the scatter of previous studies. These studies most likely suffered from systematic errors as a result of poor experimental design. The experimental procedure used in this study was designed to significantly reduce these systematic errors...|$|R
