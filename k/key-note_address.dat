40|$|This is major {{study of}} early British {{photography}} (daguerreotypes), patent law and authorship based on extensive archival research, {{examination of the}} current literature on intellectual property law, and theories of the self. It is the first output from my Leverhulme Trust funded research on intellectual property law, photography and biography. Included are ten previously unpublished early daguerreotypes. A work of cutting-edge cultural history which, through studying the case law of early photography legal depositions and affidavits, held at the National Record Office, Kew, this essay reflects on the way that authorship and careers were shaped and constrained. In addition to lectures in British universities, I have presented preliminary versions of this paper at Yale University and University of California, Berkeley and as <b>key-note</b> <b>addresses</b> at the University of Bergen and the University of Leeds. While {{there has been much}} recent discussion of copyright, patents remain under researched as cultural phenomena. However, I argue that patent law {{played a central role in}} defining modern conceptions of art and photography by joining intellectual property with image production, to create a distinctly modern sphere of authorship. My essay focuses on the prosecutions, conducted during the 1840 s and 1850 s, by the British patent holder for the daguerreotype - the merchant Richard Beard. Investigating Beard’s business model for his three London studios and subsidiary licensed studios, I ask what authorship meant in the case of a mass-image producing enterprise, which employed dozens of operators as well as numerous subsidiary photographers all trading under license to Beard. My essay brings a fresh historical perspective to debates on the nature of authorship, considering the special characteristics of collective making and the mass production of portraits...|$|R

The conference was a two-day event and {{took place in}} the National University of Ireland, Galway, (NUI, Galway) on 18 th and 19 st July, 2002. MFCSIT 2002 is the second of a series of conferences to be held in Ireland whose main focus is the mathematical and foundational issues arising out of computer science and information technology. The first of these conferences, MFCSIT 2000, was held at NUI, Cork on 20 / 21 July 2000. The Proceedings were published as Volume 40 of the Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS), (T. Hurley, M. Airchinnigh, M. Schellekens and A. Seda (eds.)) The following extract from the introduction to the first conference is well worth repeating: “It is now widely recognised {{that there has been a}} very significant increase in Ireland over the last few years in activities relating to the production of software and hardware by many computer manufacturers, including some of the world's best-known names in the computer industry. However, it was felt by a number of people˙˙ that a need had emerged for a forum which could provide the means for discussion ˙˙ of related theoretical questions, and so help maintain a balance between theory and practice. The MFCSIT conferences are intended to provide such a forum and hence to help maintain this balance. ”It is my pleasure to record a debt of gratitude to a considerable number of people who made the meeting the success it was, both on my own behalf and on behalf of my fellow editors: Sharon Flynn, Mícheál Mac an Airchinnigh, Niall Madden, Michael McGettrick, Michel Schellekens, and Anthony Seda. We were fortunate in having seven internationally well-known speakers who gave key-note addresses: Steve Brookes, Matthew Hennessey, Derek Holt, Peter Jeavons, Bill Lawvere, David MacKay and Mark Sofroniou. The speakers brilliantly set the themes for this conference with their fascinating and stimulating talks. We are indeed grateful to these for their participation and talks - many of the participants expressed appreciation of the quality and depth of these <b>key-note</b> <b>addresses.</b> We had two special sessions, one on Coding Theory organised by Pat Fitzpatrick, and one on Topology in Computer Science organised by Michel Schellekens and Anthony Seda. Our sincere thanks go to the organisers of these special sessions, and to the invited speakers for those sessions: Achim Jung, Mike Smyth, Dieter Spreen, David McKay, Edgar Martinez-Moro and Eimear Byrne. On the editing side, we are extremely grateful to all those who refereed the proceedings. We are particularly indebted to Niall Madden who bore the brunt of the editing and preparation of the proceedings; his expertise was invaluable. A conference cannot exist, of course, without participants, so our thanks to those who attended. (Altogether there were 57 registered participants plus a number of occasional visitors.) We are grateful also to those who submitted papers, to those who chaired sessions, and to Jimmie Browne, Registrar and Deputy-President of NUI, Galway, who opened the conference. Finally, we wish to acknowledge the following sponsors, without whose support the conference could not have taken place: 				Science Foundation IrelandThe Registrar's Office, NUI, GalwayThe Mathematics Department, NUI, GalwayThe Information Technology Department, NUI, GalwayThe School of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, NUI, CorkThe Computer Science Department, NUI, CorkSepember 19, 2003 Ted Hurle...|$|R

Her <b>key-note</b> <b>address</b> “Meditations on a Dirty Word” on issues of skill in art and design was delivered to the Annual Conference of the Australian Council of University Art and Design Schools at the University of Tasmania(1 - 4 October 2003) (Proceedings published www. acuads. com. au/conf 2003 /conf 2003 htm) The studio project part of the residency {{was a response to}} the architecture and historic town-planning of Melbourne, and the exhibition (displayed alongside an exhibition of war-site drawings by Paul Gough) included the four meter drawing Taming the Bay 2003, as well as an ironic slide-show response to Melburbia called ‘Law and Order. ’ In its investigation of place the exhibition followed the format of Framing LA: A View from the Acropolis, June 2002 which ended Petherbridge’s year as a Scholar in the Getty Research Center, Los Angeles 2001 - 2002, where in addition to scholarly book research, she undertook a drawing series exploring the contradictory topologies of Los Angeles as a dream city punctuated by disorienting car parks and fly-overs. A similar City project was initiated during her residency at Beaconsfield National University Lahore, Pakistan (October – December 2006). Architectonic drawings from all these series were exhibited in Petherbridge Alone with Soane in Pitzhanger Manor, Ealing (19 January – 3 March 2007) and pieces were acquired by the British Museum. The exhibition accompanied Drawing As Vital Practice,a selection of nine international artists curated by Petherbridge. Both shows were previewed on BBC London News 18 January 2007. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Key-note</b> <b>address</b> {{delivered}} at the Geographical Association of Zimbabwe’s 1991 Conference on Global Environmental Issues with Special Reference to Zimbabwe. It is very recently {{in the history of}} humanity that we have begun considering environmental issues on a global scale. This is not only because we have recently realized that humanity is making {{a significant impact on the}} global environment, but mainly because it has been very difficult to get the complete subject in view. At the scale of the individual person, the global environment is a very large thing that cannot be fully understood from an Earth-bound perspective. This problem is analogous to that of trying to appreciate and understand the artistry of a large oil painting or tapestry, when standing only a few inches away from it. We no longer have this excuse, however, because modern man is now able to step back and see the full picture. In the present stage of the space-age it is possible to view the entire planet Earth in exquisite detail, like a small organism under a microscope...|$|E
40|$|During Sweden´s {{presidency}} of the European Union, in year 2001, a large conference “Work Life 2000 ” will be organized. The aim of this conference is to draw the attention of politicians and other decision makers to the problems in working life, but also the large potential, {{in terms of human}} resources and productivity, of developing working life. The preparations for this important event include a number of workshops on important issues in working life. In March 23 - 24 1998, such a workshop was organized in Brussels on “Ageing of the Workforce”. During this workshop, a group of eminent researchers in the field of aging and work brought together their expertise from areas such as Employment and retirement strategies, Learning and competence development, and Work ability and health. In each of these areas, a <b>key-note</b> <b>address</b> summarized the “state-of-the-art”. The background of the workshop is the ageing of the European population, lowered ages of exits from the labour market, and increasing public costs for these early exits. Against this background it is indeed a question of survival to create a working life that preserves and supports the health and work ability of the ageing workforce. The workshop was not a traditional research meeting. Rather, the intention was to dra...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the situation faced by the BBC in the United Kingdom, the Australian Government does not see that the national broadcasters have a role at the 'bleeding edge ' of digital, as a primary driver of change ” (Williams, 2004). When Federal Liberal Party member Daryl Williams was communications minister in 2004 he announced in a <b>key-note</b> <b>address</b> {{that it is not}} the role of Australia’s public broadcaster to drive innovation. Ironically at the same time in the UK it was a public and policy expectation that BBC be a driver in innovation and activist in electronic democracy (Kevill 2003). Media activism sounds like something you would not want your kids to be involved in- the phrase hints at questioning authority and rocking the boat. But as Mueller and Page (2004) point out in their major report on media activism in North America, public broadcaster and community media activism are at the heart of ensuring there are informed citizens. Abusive control of information is possible in a modern democracy and a modern dictatorship. Community media, radical media and marginalized media are all attempts to provide communicative spaces for democratic dialogue and diversification of sources of opinion. In this paper the authors will outline the results of a study on how the West Australian Islamic community is responding to Australian media and how it uses its media, national and international, as a means for democratic dialogue. There is a perception that Islamic media are primarily ideologically driven by religious fundamentalism, but the actual activity in Australian Islamic community media is far closer to the principles of public service broadcasting...|$|E
40|$|As {{early as}} {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century, some major European cities {{developed}} museums to present their history. This movement has grown around the world throughout the twentieth century. The phenomenon is now more relevant than ever, as evidenced by numerous projects of creation and renovation of such institutions. Nevertheless, it took a long time before this kind of museum began to be considered as part of a specific museum category, with its own characteristics and challenges. It was only in 1993, at the Museum of London, that representatives of museums devoted to the study of cities met for the very first time, in order “to discuss [their] problems, to develop theories and to promote [their] special place in the museum movement worldwide” (Hebditch, Max, <b>Key-note</b> <b>address,</b> in Johnson, Nichola, ed., Reflecting cities. The proceedings of a symposium. London, Museum of London, 1993, p. 1). The expression “city museum” took shape for this occasion, with the creation at the end of the symposium of what can be seen as the ancestor of CAMOC, the International Association of City Museums, which faded in 2005. For almost two decades, the city museum has become the object of study of a large number – almost one per year – of international conferences and collections of articles bringing together academics, but mostly professionals who live and experience the museum every day. Practitioners appear therefore as the main producers of discourse on the city museum. This presentation examines the concept of city museum through its different uses and definitions within the museological literature, between 1993 and 2008. The analysis of these speeches will highlight the fact that there are no unanimously established uses of the expression among the authors. It will also show that, as a museum category, city museum is an object whose identity is still under construction. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{world around}} human kind is {{changing}} continuously in different aspects, such as political, {{social and cultural}} life, education, work, health, aging, and many others. Special attention is currently given to the signs of global warming and climatic changes, which are under extreme debate. The sharp rise of the oil price to almost US$ 150 in July 2008 will be an extreme threat to the sustainable global economic growth and effects negatively many industrial sectors. Yet, all these topics impact significantly on the future concepts for wood coatings and their application technologies. According to several studies the Global Wood Coating Market will show steady growth over the next 5 to 8 years, with annual growth rates between 2 to 15 % varying strongly between continents. The market dynamics is much influenced by economic growth figures and other economic challenges present in specific regions {{but more and more}} to a larger extent by tight environmental legislation, customer's demands for superior products and consumer consciousness on health and quality issues. These aspects are serving as a strong engine to drive the innovation in wood coating development by investing and setting priorities in research and technology to create and launch new products and processes that meet the new specifications determined by future market demands. As one example the increasing number of regulatory standards concerning the release of VOCs, will force coatings manufacturers to reformulate existing product lines to meet these demands. Already in Europe customers of wood coatings manufacturers will need to comply with the new VOC regulation that came into force in January 2007. As one result of this an ongoing shift to radiation-curable, powder and waterborne coatings can be noticed almost in all regions with different states of maturity. The market demand for the New Generation of Wood Coatings will also be boosted by the greater use of coatings of higher value, featuring enhanced durability, greater ease of use, more functionality and easier cleanup. This paper will highlight on key market challenges and resulting Research & Development trends in key wood coating markets such as Asia, Europe, and the United States and reveal orientating results by presenting advanced and early-stage technical solutions provided by the scientific community both at academic and industrial level. Some examples include the introduction of nanotechnology to UV-curable parquet flooring for ultra-high scratch resistant systems, waterborne polyurethane furniture coatings, new UV-absorbers for transparent exterior wood coatings with extended durability, interior and exterior coating systems based on vegetable oils and sugars with environmental benefit and superior performance. An outlook for some up-coming Research & Development needs in the wood coating area, which are currently at an early research stage or not yet considered as priorities will conclude the <b>key-note</b> <b>address...</b>|$|E

The workshop, entitled ÒStrategies for Occupational Health research in a changing Europe", was arranged {{as part of the}} NIWL Working Life 2000 programme in preparation of the Swedish six month presidency of the EU Commission beginning in January 2001. The workshop addressed the overarching issues confronting the Occupational Health institutes of Europe in a work-life in a rapid change process and globalization of economy carrying important implications for research agendas and priorities in adaptation to a new horizon of societal expectations and tasks. To the workshop had been invited researchers and research executives from institutes in Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK and representatives of the EU Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Dublin, Ireland) and the EU Agency for Safety and Health at Work (Bilbao, Spain). These proceedings have been edited to comprise, after an introductory address of the editors: Three key-note addresses (Amanda Griffiths, UK, Tage S. Kristensen, Denmark and Christer Hogstedt, Sweden) and one abstract of <b>key-note</b> <b>address</b> (Jorma Rantanen, Finland) Results of questionnaire survey on research priorities of participating institutes Staffan Marklund Presentations reflecting the current situation in participating countries and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work: Denmark : Ib Andersen France : Jean-Claude André Germany : Gunda Maintz Italy : Antonio Grieco, Sergio Iavicoli The Netherlands : Frank Pot Norway : Tor Norseth UK : Malcolm J. Harrington European Agency for Safety and Health at Work : Markku Aaltonen The workshop participants had been requested in advance to reflect on the specific questions to be addressed by the workshop. The meeting had not been prepared with a view to achieve a consensus of opinion on the issues discussed. There {{was at the end of}} the workshop nevertheless agreement that the central themes and the general conclusions reflect well the joint views of the participants and the way occupational health researchers look at the world and Europe of today. There were also views expressed from many of the participants as to the relevance of the issues discussed and a distinct perception of agreement on the challenges facing our institutes and us as research professionals. We hope to offer our readers inspiring and informative reading on how representative research professionals perceive the ongoing change processes and their implications for occupational health research. We also wish to convey our delight to find so much in common between ourselves as researchers and, accordingly, to see the potentials at our hands. We have much to contribute to the convergence of scientific efforts and collaboration aiming at the visionary goal of a Healthy work for All Europeans...|$|E
