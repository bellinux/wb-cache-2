40|$|This paper {{describes}} how long-term use impacts the light output {{of a commercial}} 55 ” WRGB AMOLED display with InGaZnO TFT backplane. This covers effects which are known by the terms “aging”, “image-sticking,” and “burn-in. ” The focus is on three different observations: permanent change in light output {{as a function of}} time, permanent screen burn-in, and permanent shift in color point. Fromthis work it can be concluded that state-of-the art OLED displays still suffer from light output instability under prolonged stress. The results suggest that the permanent change in light output {{can be explained by the}} combination of three different phenomena: a decrease in efficiency of the OLEDs as a function of time for active subpixels, a positive threshold voltage shift of the <b>driving</b> <b>transistor</b> for active subpixels, and a negative threshold voltage shift of the <b>driving</b> <b>transistor</b> for inactive subpixels, if they are illuminated and/or kept at high temperature.

40|$|When a {{sufficient}} current density {{passes through the}} MTJ, the spin-polarized current will exert a spin transfer torque to switch the magnetization of the free layer. This is the fundamental of the novel write mechanism in STT-RAM, current-induced magnetization switching. It allows STT-RAM to have a smaller cell size and write current than MRAM, and also capable of what MRAM promises: fast, dense, and non-volatile. A technological assessment was conducted to verify the claims of STT-RAM by understanding the physical principles behind it. A comparison of performance parameters in various memory technologies was also made. STT-RAM scores well in all aspect except {{in the size of}} the memory cell. The high current density (> 10 ⁶ A/cm²) sets the lower limit of the size of the <b>driving</b> <b>transistor</b> and ultimately the cost of manufacturing STT-RAM. Cost models were presented to estimate the cost of a STT-RAM based on a three mask levels fabrication process. Although much effort has been put into reducing the switching current density, there are still no easy solutions to the problem.

40|$|While {{a lot of}} {{time and}} {{resources}} have been placed into transceiver design, due to the pace of a conventional engineering design process, the design of a power amplifier is often completed using scattered resources; and not always in a methodological manner, and frequently even by an iterative trial and error process. In this thesis, a research question is posed which enables for the investigation of the possibility of streamlining the design flow for power amplifiers. After thorough theoretical investigation of existing power amplifier design methods and modelling, inductors inevitably used in power amplifier design were identified as a major drawback to efficient design, even when examples of inductors are packaged in design HIT-Kits. The main contribution of this research is engineering of an inductor design process, which in-effect contributes towards enhancing conventional power amplifiers. This inductance search algorithm finds the highest quality factor configuration of a single-layer square spiral inductor within certain tolerance using formulae for inductance and inductor parasitics of traditional single-π inductor model. Further contribution of this research is a set of algorithms for the complete design of switch-mode (Class-E and Class-F) power amplifiers and their output matching networks. These algorithms make use of classic deterministic design equations so that values of parasitic components can be calculated given input parameters, including required output power, centre frequency, supply voltage, and choice of class of operation. The hypothesis was satisfied for SiGe BiCMOS S 35 process from Austriamicrosystems (AMS). Several metal- 3 and thick-metal inductors were designed using the abovementioned algorithm and compared with experimental results provided by AMS. Correspondence was established between designed, experimental and EM simulation results, enabling qualification of inductors other than those with experimental results available from AMS by means of EM simulations with average relative errors of 3. 7 % for inductors and 21 % for the Q factor at its peak frequency. For a wide range of inductors, Q-factors of 10 and more were readily experienced. Furthermore, simulations were performed for number of Class-E and Class-F amplifier configurations with HBTs with ft greater than 60 GHz and total emitter area of 96 μm² as driving transistors to complete the hypothesis testing. For the complete PA system design (including inductors), simulations showed that switch-mode power amplifiers for 50 Ω load at 2. 4 GHz centre frequency can be designed using the streamlined method of this research for the output power of about 6 dB less than aimed. This power loss was expected, since it can be attributed to non-ideal properties of the <b>driving</b> <b>transistor</b> and Q-factor limitations of the integrated inductors, assumptions which the computations of the routine were based on. Although these results were obtained for a single micro-process, it was further speculated that outcome of this research has a general contribution, since streamlined method can be used with a much wider range of CMOS and BiCMOS processes, when low-gigahertz operating power amplifiers are needed. This theory was confirmed by means of simulation and fabrication in 180 nm BiCMOS process from IBM, results of which were also presented. The work presented here, was combined with algorithms for SPICE netlist extraction and the spiral inductor layout extraction (CIF and GDSII formats). This secondary research outcome further contributed to the completeness of the design flow. All the above features showed that the routine developed here is substantially better than cut-and-try methods for design of power amplifiers found in the existing body of knowledge.
