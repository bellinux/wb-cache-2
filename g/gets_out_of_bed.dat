40|$|Background and Purpose. <b>Getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> is {{difficult}} for 27. 6 % of people over 65. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe movement patterns used by older adults for rising from bed. Subjects. 42 healthy subjects between the ages of 65 and 90. Methods. Subjects were videotaped performing 5 trials <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Movement patterns were categorized for each body part. Results. A number of movement patterns occurred that were not reported in younger people. The most frequent movement patterns used were: “roll off” (38. 3 %) for the trunk, “double push” (34. 7 %) for the far arm, “multi-push” (36. 0 %) for the near arm, and “synchronous” (31. 2 %) for the legs.
