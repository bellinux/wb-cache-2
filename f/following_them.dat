Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug.

This was extended in April 2009 for a further five years. Glasgow Warriors left Firhill after the 2011–12 season and moved to Scotstoun Stadium. During the 2012–13 season the ground was also used by Celtic's under-20 squad as their home ground, but following Partick's promotion this stopped for the 2013–14 season.|$|E

5|$|Soldiers of the ROK 1st Division {{captured}} a North Korean near Ka-san on September 4 {{who said that}} about 800 North Korean soldiers were on Ka-san with three more battalions <b>following</b> <b>them</b> from the north. The engineer company had succeeded only in establishing a perimeter briefly within the North Korean-held area. By evening of September 5, Ka-san was securely in North Korean hands with an estimated five battalions, totaling about 1,500 soldiers, on the mountain and its forward slope. A North Korean oxtrain carrying 82-mm. mortar shells and rice reportedly {{reached the top of}} Ka-san during the day. The ROK 1st Division captured this oxtrain a few days later south of Ka-san. By September 10, 400-500 North Koreans were on the ridge of Ka-San, as observed by a T-6 Mosquito spotter plane.|$|E
5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles.

After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of the father and then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father. It appears that if there were two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. <b>Following</b> <b>them,</b> the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E
5|$|Rain and fog {{were heavy}} {{throughout}} {{the morning of}} July 6, and visibility was limited for the emplaced troops. Just after daybreak, 13 North Korean T-34 tanks were spotted stopped at the bridge. <b>Following</b> <b>them</b> were two columns of infantry. The American forces originally believed {{that they might be}} survivors of Task Force Smith until they realized the forces were deploying in numbers too great, and began preparing to attack the unsuspecting North Koreans. The battalion's commander ordered mortar fire on the North Korean forces, causing them to disperse as the lead tank began firing on the positions of A Company, on a hill southwest of the road. Mortar fire destroyed a truck, but a round from a North Korean tank stunned the artillery observer and no one took his place in the confusion, ending the American mortar attack. North Korean forces immediately began advancing on A Company's position, but the company was not able to return fire effectively, with fewer than half of its soldiers using their weapons. For several minutes only squad and platoon leaders shot back {{while the rest of the}} soldiers hid in their foxholes. Within fifteen minutes, B Company was able to return fire effectively, and by this time the North Korean forces had advanced steadily toward 1st Battalion's position. Later examinations found many American soldiers' weapons were assembled incorrectly or were dirty or broken. The Americans had nothing with which to fight the tanks, and were unable to do anything to stop them.|$|E
5|$|The chronicles of Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus (and <b>following</b> <b>them</b> Skylitzes and Zonaras), however, {{report that}} he survived his wounds, {{allegedly}} being miraculously cured after renouncing iconoclasm {{at the behest of}} some monks. The same sources report that after Theophilos's death, he assumed the overall command of the Byzantine army and was appointed a member of the regency council for the infant new emperor Michael III (r. 842–867) along with Theoktistos and Bardas. His standing was so high that the populace is said to have acclaimed him as emperor at the Hippodrome, but he refused to accept the post. The same writers {{report that he}} {{played an important role in}} the restoration of the icons, and that he became a protomagistros before falling out with Theoktistos, being accused of lèse-majesté, and retiring from public life to his estates. According to the same sources, in the late 850s, he saved the Emperor's life in another battle at Anzen and died shortly after. Traditional scholarship has largely accepted this account, but some modern historians have expressed doubts as to its veracity. The Belgian Byzantinist Henri Grégoire was the first to highlight its incompatibility with the narrative of Symeon Logothetes, speculating that it was a later invention, possibly carried out by the monks of the Monastery of Manuel, who venerated him as a saint and tried to mitigate his iconoclast past. Warren Treadgold, who considers Symeon Logothetes more reliable, also dismissed the reports of Manuel's post-838 survival as invented.|$|E
