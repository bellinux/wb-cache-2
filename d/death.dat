5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of <b>death</b> as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before <b>death),</b> peri-mortem (at the time of <b>death),</b> or post-mortem (after <b>death).</b> Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E

40|$|Background: Maternal {{mortality}} {{continues to}} be a major public health problem in the developing world. Maternal mortality is a vital index of the effectiveness of obstetric services prevailing in a country. The present study was conducted at Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences, Hubli, which caters to 250 PHC’s/CHC’s and is a major referral centre for 4 districts with an average of 800 - 1000 deliveries per month. Methods: Data on the maternal <b>deaths</b> at KIMS, Hubli from October 2010 to March 20011 during pregnancy and within 42 days of delivery of any cause, irrespective of the duration and site of pregnancy were collected. Results: The maternal mortality ratio for the study period was per 1, 00, 000 live births. Among the 40 maternal <b>deaths,</b> 7 <b>deaths</b> (17. 5 %) occurred in primigravida, 14 <b>deaths</b> (35 %) had occurred in primipara, 4 <b>deaths</b> (10 %) in gravida 2 and above, 7 <b>deaths</b> (17. 5 %) in para 2, 5 <b>deaths</b> (12. 5 %) in para 3 and 3 <b>deaths</b> (7. 5 %) had occurred in para 4 and above. During the study period, 8 <b>deaths</b> (20 %) occurred within 1 hour of admission, 5 <b>deaths</b> (12. 5 %) within 1 - 6 hours of admission, 7 <b>deaths</b> (17. 5 %) between 7 - 12 hours of admission, 6 <b>deaths</b> (15 %) between 13 - 24 hours, 8 <b>deaths</b> (20 %) between 1 - 2 days and 6 <b>deaths</b> occurred after 2 days of admission. Maternal <b>deaths</b> had occurred mostly in delivered women (75 %) compared to undelivered women (25 %).
