5|$|In May 1943, Bainbridge joined Robert Oppenheimer's Project Y at Los Alamos. He {{initially}} led E-2, the instrumentation group, {{which developed}} X-ray instrumentation for examining <b>explosions.</b> <b>In</b> March 1944, he became {{head of a}} new group, E-9, which was charged with conducting the first nuclear test. In Oppenheimer's sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory in August 1944, the E-9 Group became X-2.|$|E
50|$|After 1987 {{professor}} V.

In particular, they were - the <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> Lviv city in a three-storey residential building; <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> a 5-storey building in Yevpatoriya; firesetting of pinball saloon <b>in</b> Dnepropetrovsk, <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> coal port terminal in Sevastopol, investigation of the gas cylinders <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> Luhansk hospital. Prof. Zakhmatov has spoken in court about his findings on many accounts.|$|R

Jordan's security {{as a whole}} was dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then.|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of the x rays from a supernova <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the surrounding molecular gas is discussed. A supernova <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> a molecular cloud {{results in a}} supernova remnant which radiates {{a fraction of the}} approximately 10 to the 51 st power erg kinetic energy of the supernova <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the form of x rays. The {{absorption of}} these x rays in the surrounding molecular gas produces ionization, dissociation, and heating. It is found that a 10 (exp 51) erg supernova <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> a uniform molecular cloud of density equal to 1000 per cubic centimeter results in the emission of photons in the H 2 line. This process may contribute appreciably to the strong S(1) line emission seen from some starburst galaxies, such as NGC 6240...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, lawyers have become {{accustomed}} to socio-legal 2 ̆ 2 explosions 2 ̆ 2 : the explosion into the law scene of legal services corporations; the <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> malpractice insurance rates {{as the result of the}} <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> medical malpractice suits and favorable jury verdicts; the <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> no-fault law, both in negligence and family disputes; and the legal profession 2 ̆ 7 s own population explosion. Therefore, it should come as no great shock that over {{the past decade}} there has been one additional socio-legal explosion: the <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the use of paralegals by lawyers, law firms, corporations, and government agencies of all descriptions. Although the <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the use of paralegals comes as no shock to lawyers, it may be mildly surprising to many that no state has yet passed a statute to regulate paralegal training programs or paralegal activity in general. This article is written on the assumption that some states may take legislative action with regard to paralegal regulation...|$|R
5|$|There {{were two}} <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> taxis caused by timer bombs. The first one {{occurred}} at 22:40 at Vile Parle, killing {{the driver and}} a passenger.

The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West.|$|E
5|$|Carroll's tenure {{was plagued}} by disasters, both natural and man-made. Flooding struck {{in the eastern part}} of the state and in the state capitol of Frankfort. Extreme cold gripped the entire state in 1977 and 1978, {{including}} the Great Blizzard of 1978. Two mine <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August, the Jewish Community Centre in Palmotićeva Street in Zagreb, and Jewish graves at the Mirogoj Cemetery, were bombed {{as a part}} of Operation Labrador. The explosions caused {{property}} damage, but {{resulted in}} no casualties. There were no public claims of responsibility for the attack. Aside from the two <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> Zagreb, agents assigned to Operation Labrador were thought to also be responsible for bombing the Zagreb–Belgrade railway near Vinkovci and a railway line between Glina and Vojnić. The railway attacks have also been ascribed to Operation Opera.|$|E

5|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} been a number of {{terrorist}} attacks, including <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> a landmark holy place, a court and a temple. The 2006 Varanasi bombings were a series of bombings that occurred across the Hindu holy city of Varanasi on 7 March 2006. At least 28 people were killed and as many as 101 others were injured. The blasts occurred simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 in the crowded Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University. Other blasts followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station near the waiting area next to the travel office. Initially, another blast was reported in the stationary Shivganga Express bound for Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The same report {{lists the}} {{following}} as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs, greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs), difficulties in ballast tank ventilation, {{the fact that}} ballast tanks need continuous monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, the greater number of surfaces to maintain, the risk of <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted, and that cleaning ballast tanks is more difficult for double hull ships.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the lower}} mass noble gases, the normal stellar {{nucleosynthesis}} process inside a star does not form xenon. Elements more massive than iron-56 consume energy through fusion, and {{the synthesis of}} xenon represents no energy gain for a star. Instead, xenon is formed during supernova <b>explosions,</b> <b>in</b> classical nova explosions, by the slow neutron capture process (s-process) in red giant stars that have exhausted their core hydrogen and entered the asymptotic giant branch, and from radioactive decay, for example by beta decay of extinct iodine-129 and spontaneous fission of thorium, uranium, and plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Parsons was {{employed}} by North American Aviation at Inglewood, {{where he worked}} on the Navaho Missile Program. He and Cameron moved into a house in Manhattan Beach, where he instructed her in occultism and esotericism. When Cameron developed catalepsy, Parsons referred her to Sylvan Muldoon's books on astral projection, suggesting that she could manipulate her seizures to accomplish it. They were married on October 19, 1946, four days after his divorce from Helen was finalized, with Forman as their witness. Parsons continued {{to be seen as a}} specialist in rocketry; he acted as an expert consultant in numerous industrial tribunals and police and Army Ordnance investigations regarding <b>explosions.</b> <b>In</b> May 1947, Parsons gave a talk at the Pacific Rocket Society in which he predicted that rockets would take humans to the Moon. Although he had become distant from the now largely defunct O.T.O. and had sold much of his Crowleyan library, he continued to correspond with Crowley until the latter's death in December 1947.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> {{the vicinity of}} the ambush and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania of backing the KLA. In response to the ambush, U.S. officials indicated that they would push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said they would look to freeze the country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged that the men had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. Such claims could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed that the men were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E
