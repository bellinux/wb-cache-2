5000|$|Internal {{diffusion}} is {{the spread}} of information and innovations within a network, flowing within a single adopting population a given industry or geographical network. Internal diffusion dynamics require that innovative and early adopter firms introduce new ideas into a network, which are then {{picked up by the}} majority of firms and laggard firms. DiMaggio and Powell (1983) [...] argue that firms search for the best ideas and practices and mimic new ideas that prove to work. This phenomenon is known as mimetic isomorphism, and ironically may lead to clustering of firm structure and practices. Additionally, firms are often forced to adopt new ideas as they are constantly competing with other firms; that is, firms want to seem modernized and seek legitimacy in implementing innovative practices. <b>External</b> <b>diffusion</b> refers to the introduction of ideas to a network from outside actors: firms or other agents {{on the edge of the}} network. Outside actors include the mass media and [...] "change agents." [...] Mass media can amplify trends and movements that occur in the marketplace, introducing new innovations to network members, exposing [...] "best-practice" [...] ideas, and conveying new principles. Change agents are usually business professionals (such as lawyers, consultants, bankers, or politicians) who spread new practices or aid in promoting new ideas. [...] These individuals often introduce business models, legal strategies, or investment techniques that are picked up by several entities within a network and continue to diffuse. Often, such <b>external</b> <b>diffusion</b> leads to conformity of a set of corporate strategies or structures, a phenomenon DiMaggio and Powell called [...] "normative isomorphism".|$|E
50|$|The second {{treatise}} {{starts with}} a classical experiment showing the proper alignment of the loadstone to the poles, followed {{by a lot of}} experiences about the interaction between two loadstones, between the loadstone and iron, and about the transmission of the magnetic virtue. Garzoni then considers the diffusion of the magnetic virtue inside the stone, outside it, and inside iron. These results are obtained by magnetizing bodies of different shapes and sizes. In particular, Garzoni considers the behaviour of magnetized iron dust. The behaviour of iron placed in the sphere of action of more loadstones is salso investigated. In the subsequent experiments, Garzoni studies the <b>external</b> <b>diffusion</b> of magnetic virtue by displacing a magnetic needle within the sphere of action. At every point, the direction of the needle gives the direction of the magnetic virtue. The configuration Garzoni obtains coincides with the one theorized in the first treatise (look at the accompanying diagrams displaying the lines of propagation of verticity). Garzoni then studies the behaviour of two magnetized needles, and he investigates the action of non-magnetized iron, the properties of the quality of one face and the alteration of the quality of one and two faces. Finally, he quickly mentions spontaneous magnetization and the loss of verticity.|$|E

In the experimental method, the internal and <b>external</b> <b>diffusions</b> were determined by varying the gas mass flow-rate (mg), catalyst pellet size (dp), and catalytic bed volume (Vcat). In the theoretical approach the dimensionless parameters such as effectiveness factor (η), Thiele modules (φ 1), and overall effectiveness factor (Ω) were calculated. The experimental results indicated no external mass transfer limitation due to constant glycerol conversion (94 - 97 %) at various conditions. In addition, both the theoretical and experimental approaches confirmed no internal mass transfer limitation in glycerol dehydration reaction with catalyst pellet sizes of dp = 2 -and 5 -μm due to effectiveness factor equal to 1 (η = 1).

These results indicated that intra-mat diffusion was not the only rate-limiting step. It may also suggest that the <b>external</b> <b>diffusion</b> assisted by agitation or oscillation can benefit the adsorption process, while our work was completed under static adsorption conditions where adsorption equilibrium was established by simple diffusion.|$|E
40|$|The {{isothermal}} differential {{characteristics of}} the gas-solid reaction occurring in a micro-fluidized bed reactor were studied using the indigenously developed Micro-Fluidized Bed Reaction Analyzer (MFBRA). The combustion of graphite powder in micrometers was taken as the model reaction because of its negligible internal diffusion and chemical-reaction simplicity. With minimized inhibitions from both the internal and <b>external</b> <b>diffusions,</b> the reaction in MFBRA at a preset temperature was analyzed by using the isothermal kinetic approach, resulting in an activation energy of 165 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 10 (6) 1 /s. The reaction was further found {{to be subject to}} the nucleation and growth model expressed by G(alpha) = -ln(1 - alpha). Measuring this reaction in TG via the programmed heating method resulted in the similar activation energy and the same reaction function model (by extrapolating to zero conversion). Comparing with the non-isothermal approach for TG that involves complicated mathematical calculations, the isothermal differential approach for MFBRA allowed the separation of the temperature effect (i. e., the reaction rate constant) and kinetic function model, thus providing a simple and reliable determination of the gas-solid reaction kinetics.

30|$|There {{are many}} case {{studies that show}} GCE model is not capable to predict {{variation}} of compositions perfectly (Hoier and Whitson 2000). One of the well-known reasons which affected these predictions is assumption of isothermal condition in reservoir, while there are some cases that show temperature gradient in depth. This leads to apply non-equilibrium condition in which, mass transfer phenomena, {{in addition to the}} concentration diffusion, will be a function of pressure <b>diffusion,</b> <b>external</b> force <b>diffusion</b> and thermal diffusion (Bird et al. 2002). Onsager was the first who proposed a linear relationship between driving forces and fluxes of different phenomena in a process (Lebon and Jou 2008; Le Bellac and Mortessagne 2004). Based on the Onsager’s theory, Ghorayeb and Firoozabadi developed a model to predict compositional grading in non-isothermal condition (Ghorayeb and Firoozabadi 2000). The main complexity of irreversible modeling is to evaluate the thermal diffusion factor. Thus, all the irreversible models proposed till now are based on two distinct approaches, i.e., static thermal diffusion and dynamic thermal diffusion.|$|R

Characterizations of clinoptilolite rich mineral and its modified forms were studied. Batch sorption experiments were performed and the effects of the parameters such as pH, initial concentration, agitation speed, particle size and temperature were investigated. Sorption kinetic data were analysed by external mass transfer, intraparticle diffusion, pseudo first and second order models. Intraparticle diffusion model results indicated that sorption of Cr (VI) on the sorbents was a multi-step process, involving <b>external</b> and intraparticle <b>diffusion.</b> Effective diffusion coefficient results implied that Cr (VI) sorption process was not solely intraparticle <b>diffusion</b> controlled and <b>external</b> film <b>diffusion</b> was also effective.

The diffusion process can be generally divided into three phases: the rapid <b>external</b> <b>diffusion</b> phase, the intraparticle diffusion phase and the slow equilibrium phase.

The first linear region as seen in WMID plot is the intraparticle diffusion phase, while the second linear region is the slow equilibrium phase. The WMID model states that if the linear WMID plot crosses the origin, then the diffusion mechanism is controlled by intraparticle diffusion. As seen in Table  2, the intercepts, C, for both NP-MV and NL-MV adsorption systems are non-zero, therefore, indicating that the intraparticle diffusion is not the rate-limiting step.
