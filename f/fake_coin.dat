40|$|In 2007, Alexander Shapovalov posed an old {{twist on}} the {{classical}} coin weighing problem by asking for strategies that manage to conceal the identities of specific coins while providing general information {{on the number of}} <b>fake</b> <b>coins.</b> In 2015, Diaco and Khovanova studied various cases of these "discreet strategies" and introduced the revealing factor, a measure of the information that is revealed. In this paper we discuss a natural coin weighing strategy which we call the sorting strategy: divide the coins into equal piles and sort them by weight. We study the instances when the strategy is discreet, and given an outcome of the sorting strategy, the possible number of <b>fake</b> <b>coins.</b> We prove that in many cases, the number of <b>fake</b> <b>coins</b> can be any value in an arithmetic progression whose length depends linearly on the number of coins in each pile. We also show the strategy can be discreet when the number of <b>fake</b> <b>coins</b> is any value within an arithmetic subsequence whose length also depends linearly on the number of coins in each pile. We arrive at these results by connecting our work to the classic Frobenius coin problem. In addition, we calculate the revealing factor for the sorting strategy. Comment: 14 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|As in many coin puzzles, we {{have several}} identical-looking coins, {{with one of them}} fake and the rest real. The real coins weigh the same. Our <b>fake</b> <b>coin</b> is special in that it can change its weight. The coin can pretend to be a real coin, a <b>fake</b> <b>coin</b> that is lighter than a real one, and a <b>fake</b> <b>coin</b> that is heavier than a real one. In {{addition}} to this, each time the coin is on the scale, it changes its weight in a predetermined fashion. In this paper, we seek to find our <b>fake</b> <b>coin</b> using a balance scale and the smallest number of weighings. We consider different possibilities for the <b>fake</b> <b>coin.</b> We discuss coins that change weight between two states or between three states. The 2 - state coin that changes weight from lighter to real and back has been studied before, so we concentrate on the 2 -state coin that changes weight from lighter to heavier, and back. We also study the 3 -state coin, which changes its weight from lighter to heavier to real, and back to lighter. Given the total number of coins and the starting state of the <b>fake</b> <b>coin,</b> we calculate the smallest number of weighings needed to identify the <b>fake</b> <b>coin.</b> We provide an oblivious optimal strategy for this number of weighings. We also discuss what happens if the starting state is not known or mixed. In such cases, adaptive strategies are often more powerful than oblivious ones. Comment: 37 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

25|$|Gold is, however, a {{difficult}} material to counterfeit without detection {{due to its}} unique density and colour.

40|$|Due to the {{proliferation}} of fake money these days, detection of counterfeit coins with high accuracy is in strong demand, yet not much {{research has been conducted}} in this field. The objective of this thesis is to introduce modern computer vision techniques and machine intelligence to differentiate real <b>coins</b> and <b>fake</b> ones with high precision, based on visual aspects. To that end, a high-resolution scanning device – IBIX Trax is deployed to sample the coin images. On top of that, three visual aspects are thoroughly inspected, namely lettering, images and texture. Six features are extracted from letterings, i. e. stroke width, contour smoothness, lettering height, lettering width, relative angle, and relative distance. As for classification, a hierarchical clustering – max spacing K-clustering—is adopted. Our experimental results show that the <b>fake</b> <b>coins</b> and real ones are totally separable based on these features. As for images, we propose a novel shape feature— angle-distance. After images are segmented, a vector of size 360 * 1 is deployed to represent each shape. For classification, a dissimilarity measurement is used to quantize the difference between two shapes. The results show it can recognize the <b>fake</b> <b>coins</b> successfully. As for texture, a cutting-edge feature maximum stable extremal region is adopted to automatically detect the holes and indents on the coin surface. Parameters associated with this feature are adjusted in the experiments. The detection results show this feature can be used as an indicator for assessing the qualities of coins...|$|R

40|$|In this expository {{paper we}} discuss a {{relatively}} new counterfeit coin problem with an unusual goal: maintaining the privacy of, rather than revealing, counterfeit coins in a set of both <b>fake</b> and real <b>coins.</b> We introduce two classes of solutions to this problem [...] - one that respects the privacy of all the coins and one that respects the privacy of only the <b>fake</b> <b>coins</b> [...] - and give several results regarding each. We describe and generalize 6 unique strategies that fall into these two categories. Furthermore, we explain conditions for the existence of a solution, as well as showing proof of a solution's optimality in select cases. In order to quantify exactly how much information is revealed by a given solution, we also define the revealing factor and revealing coefficient; these two values additionally act as a means of comparing the relative effectiveness of different solutions. Most importantly, by introducing an array of new concepts, we lay the foundation for future analysis of this very interesting problem, as well as many other problems related to privacy and the transfer of information.
