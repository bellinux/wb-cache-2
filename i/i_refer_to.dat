25|$|One {{friendship}} {{was made}} in these years that has been worth more than words can tell. <b>I</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> that of Matthew McClung. To {{be known as a}} co-official with McClung was a privilege that only those who knew him can appreciate. I had known him before at Lehigh in his undergraduate days, and had played on the same teams with him Never was there a squarer sportsman, or a fairer, more conscientious and efficient official; nor a truer, more gallant type of real man than he. His early death took out of the game a man of the kind we can ill afford to lose and no tribute that I could pay him would be high enough.|$|E
25|$|Now, in {{the chapter}} on Pangenesis in my Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any {{circulating}} system. It is, indeed, obvious {{that the presence of}} gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and <b>I</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, , are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.|$|E
25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As <b>I</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

500|$|The modern {{reassessment}} of Jones Very {{as an author}} of literary importance can be dated to a 1936 essay by Yvor Winters who wrote of the poet, “In {{the past two decades}} two major American writers have been rediscovered and established securely in their rightful places in literary history. <b>I</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville. I am proposing the establishment of a third.” Winters, in speaking of Very’s relations with Emerson and his circle, concluded, “The attitude of the Transcendentalists toward Very is instructive and amusing, and it proves beyond cavil how remote he was from them. In respect to the doctrine of the submission of the will, he agreed with them in principle; but whereas they recommended the surrender, he practised it, and they regarded him with amazement.” Subsequently, William Irving Bartlett, in 1942, outlined the basic biographical facts of Very’s life in Jones Very, Emerson’s “Brave Saint.” [...] A complete scholarly edition of Very’s poetic works belatedly appeared, over a century after the poet’s death, in 1993.|$|E

2500|$|Antonio de Morga (1559–1636), a Spanish {{official}} in Manila, listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China {{at the turn}} of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were [...] "rarities which, did <b>I</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it". After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, transported via Manila. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the Philippines and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.|$|E
2500|$|Bakunin {{thought that}} [...] "Does it follow that I reject all {{authority}}? Far from {{me such a}} thought. In the matter of boots, <b>I</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> {{the authority of the}} bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or the engineer. For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a savant. But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor savant to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch; I consult several; I compare their opinions, and choose that which seems to me the soundest. But I recognise no infallible authority, even in special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such individual, I have no absolute faith in any person." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Boyer {{published}} a pamphlet, Trailing an American Myth, {{in which he}} stated that the Clum manuscript was actually written by several authors. He wrote that their work formed [...] "the basis of the Tombstone years in I Married Wyatt Earp and [...] "the Ten Eyck Papers in Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta." [...] In the same year, Boyer wrote and {{published a}}nother pamphlet, [...] "Who Killed John Ringo?" [...] It stated that fiction writers Dashiell Hammett, Wilson Mizner, Rex Beach and Walt Coburn had written {{a portion of the}} [...] manuscript documenting Josephine' Tombstone years. [...] When questioned about the origins of the Clum manuscript during the early 1980s, Boyer changed his story to say that he did not receive the Clum manuscript from Colyn after all, instead it was given to him by one of Earp's nieces, Jeanne Cason Laing. When asked if these were all the same manuscript, Boyer replied, [...] "Some of them are a manuscript. Some are only a mishmash, as a matter of fact... The earlier ones of those guys all lean heavily on Clum and Parsons for insights, {{which is one of the}} reasons they got in trouble with Josephine Earp... This is a broad way when I say <b>I</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> a Clum manuscript, for example. It is a broad way of referring to something when really this is nobody's business in a way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another factor {{connected}} {{with these two}} schools demands separate attention, [...] {{because it is a}} consequence of segregation so outlandish that the Attorney General, with commendable candor, has in effect refused to defend it. <b>I</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> the fact that school bus transportation is provided those attending No. 29 who, except for color, are in the same situation as this infant plaintiff. Yet neither school bus transportation, nor its equivalent is provided this plaintiff even to attend No. 107. In fact, the State Board of Education refused to authorize the transportation of this then seven-year-old plaintiff to the Negro school, even though the bus for white children went right past her home, and even though the two schools are no more than a mile apart. Moreover, there is no public transportation available from or near plaintiff's home to or near the Negro school. The State Board ruled that because of the State constitutional provision for separate schools, a Negro child may not ride in a bus serving a white school. If we assume that this is so, then this practice in and of itself, is another reason why the facilities offered this plaintiff at No. 107 are inferior to those provided at No. 29. To suggest, under the facts here presented, that there are not enough Negroes to warrant the cost of a school bus for them is only another way of saying that they are not entitled to equal services because they are Negroes. Such an excuse will not do here.|$|E
