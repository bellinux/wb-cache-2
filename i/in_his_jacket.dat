5|$|A {{few hundred}} yards from the airfield, his plane crashed nose first into the ground. He was quickly freed from the {{aircraft}} by his men, but died in an ambulance minutes later; his orders to return home were found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket. Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.|$|E

They go to an {{apartment}} where they swim and eat food; Neto leaves the place when Lobo suggests that they reciprocate for the food by letting the men there caress them. Alone in downtown, Neto begs for money, and he is helped by a woman called Leninha. She takes him home {{to have lunch with}} some friends; after it, Neto and Leninha have sex. Later, at night, he is arrested for doing graffiti, and his parents pick him up at the police station. The following day, Neto is in his bedroom and his father finds a marijuana cigarette <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> Neto's sister advises his parents to send him to a mental institution.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bennett volunteered to serve with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and, after securing his release from AMP on full pay, was appointed second-in-command of the 6th Battalion, {{which was part of}} the 2nd (Victorian) Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 1st Division. After a short period of training, the 1st Division began to embark for Europe. Just prior to his departure overseas, Bennett became engaged to Bess Buchanan, who he had met at a dance in Canterbury. As an engagement gift, Bess bought her betrothed a miniature photo of herself, set in a gold frame. Bennett carried the picture <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket while serving overseas and it later saved his life on the Western Front, deflecting a German bullet.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E

25|$|Between early 1981 {{and the end}} of 1983 Chambers {{had made}} at least twelve trips abroad to {{transport}} heroin to Australia. In 1980 Chambers imported heroin to Australia using body packing techniques, placing the drugs in his anus. The rest of the load was swallowed. He used the same technique in 1981 when, on transit in Singapore, customs officers detected two vials of personal-use heroin <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket. He was released after bribing officers.|$|E

25|$|On 13 March 1940, Michael O'Dwyer was {{scheduled}} to speak at a joint meeting of the East India Association and the Central Asian Society (now Royal Society for Asian Affairs) at Caxton Hall, London. Singh concealed his revolver <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket (which he received from Puran Singh Boughan from Malsian, Punjab), entered the hall, and found an open seat. As the meeting concluded, Singh shot O'Dwyer twice as he moved towards the speaking platform, killing him immediately. Others hurt in the shooting include Louis Dane, Lawrence Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland, and Charles Cochrane-Baillie, 2nd Baron Lamington. Singh {{did not attempt to}} flee and was arrested on site.|$|E
25|$|That night Walt goes to {{the gang}} members' house, where they draw their weapons on him. He loudly berates them and enumerates their crimes, drawing the {{attention}} of the neighbors. Putting a cigarette in his mouth, he asks for a light, then puts his hand <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and provocatively pulls it out as if he were holding a gun, causing the gang members to shoot and kill him. As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the Zippo cigarette lighter with the 1st Cavalry insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy stay in prison.|$|E
500|$|On December 28, Transport Canada {{announced}} that {{for several days}} it would not allow passengers flying to the U.S. from Canada a carry-on bag, with some exceptions. British Airways said that passengers flying to the U.S. would only be permitted one carry-on item. Other European countries increased baggage screening, pat-down searches, and random searches for passengers traveling to the U.S. A spokesperson for Schiphol Airport said that heightened security would be in place for [...] "an indefinite period". However, {{in spite of the}} extra measures said to have been put in place to prevent a follow-up attack, Stuart Clarke, a photoreporter from the British newspaper Daily Express, claimed to have smuggled a syringe containing fluid, which could have been a liquid bomb detonator onto another plane. On January 3, 2010, Clarke said he boarded a jet from Schiphol Airport bound for Heathrow Airport just five days after the Christmas Day attack, and that the airport appeared to have imposed no additional security, such as precautionary pat-downs which could easily have discovered the syringe which he claimed he kept <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket throughout.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{episode is}} brought to an {{interrupted}} ending with {{just enough time to}} quickly overview the following day's newspapers (a parody of Jeremy Paxman on BBC2's Newsnight) printed with absurd headlines such as [...] "Lord Mayor's pirouette in fire chief wife decapitation", and a final humorously misused video. Each episode ends in a familiar style for news reports, with the camera panning out as the studio lights dim on Morris. Instead of shuffling his papers in clich√©d newsreader style, Morris takes advantage of the dimming lights to perform bizarre activities; putting lots of pens <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pockets, placing a tourniquet around his arm in preparation to inject heroin, removing his normal hair to reveal long blonde locks underneath, and, in the last episode, prostrating himself before the newsdesk.|$|E
2500|$|... 24-year-old Patrick Flynn {{was tried}} at Belfast Crown Court for double {{manslaughter}} {{and possession of}} explosives after his recovery from his injuries. Flynn was severely disfigured and badly scarred from the extensive burns the incendiary device had inflicted upon him. The judge was asked and agreed to take this into account for sentencing after reviewing the evidence and finding Flynn guilty due to his proximity to the explosion, his known IRA affiliation and the discovery of telephone numbers for The Samaritans and Belfast Central station <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> {{to be used to}} telephone bomb warnings. Mr Justice Kelly sentenced Flynn to ten years prison for each manslaughter as well as seven years for the explosives offences, to be served concurrently. He concluded by summing up with the words:"I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt {{you were one of the}} bombers. I am satisfied you and your associates did not intend to kill. Nevertheless, the explosion and fire caused the death of three people in most horrific circumstances. In sentencing you I am conscious you have suffered severe burns and scars, for the rest of your life which will be a grim reminder to you of the events of that day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gelman later {{stated that}} since {{he knew he would}} be caught, {{he was going to take}} down [...] "rats" [...] who had wronged him. Gelman then went to the house of a female {{acquaintance}} named Yelena Bulchenko, where he killed her mother, Anna, at about 10:30a.m. He then allegedly left the crime scene and waited several hours for Yelena, who had been staying at a friend's house, to return home. Once she did, she found Anna dead and called 9-1-1, but Gelman was on his way back to the scene to check if she returned home. Upon arrival at about 4:00p.m., he spotted her outside on the phone and got out of the car, upon which she yelled at him. He hid the knife <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> sleeve and approached her, but she took off running. However, Gelman caught up with her and stabbed her eleven times, killing her, before speeding off in Kuznetsov's car. Ramming into another car, Gelman stabbed and wounded the driver, Arthur DiCrescento, three times when he confronted him, before carjacking the vehicle. Gelman later ran down 62-year-old pedestrian Stephen Tanenbaum, who subsequently died of his injuries.|$|E

2500|$|On October 14, 1912, while {{campaigning in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Roosevelt {{was shot by}} a saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank. The bullet lodged in his chest after {{penetrating}} his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech titled [...] "", which he was carrying <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung, and he declined suggestions {{to go to the}} hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his [...] with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 90 minutes before completing his speech and accepting medical attention. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose." [...] Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura. Doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it, and Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life.|$|E
2500|$|Finally the {{trackers}} {{came upon}} the unsuspecting Natives {{on the banks of}} the Canadian River near Tucumcari Butte. [...] Catching them unaware, Carson, who was in the lead, moved towards the camp, motioning the others to follow. [...] In his autobiography Carson describes what followed: [...] "I was in advance, starting for their camp, calling for the men to follow. [...] The [...] officer called a halt, none of them would follow me. [...] I was informed that Leroux, the principle guide, told the officer in command, to halt, that the Indians wanted to have a parley. The Jicarillas started packing their goods for flight and a shot was fired that struck Captain Grier, causing no serious injury. (Due to the fact that Grier had a pair of heavy gauntlets tucked <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket)</b> The captain ordered a charge, but the delay allowed all but one of the Indians to escape. In about 200 yards, pursuing the Indians, the body of Mrs. White was found, perfectly warm, had not been killed more than five minutes - shot through the heart by an arrow.... I am certain that if the Indians had been charged immediately on our arrival she would have been saved." [...] Ann White's daughter and servant were never found.|$|E
