5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in <b>him</b> <b>going</b> into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his start line advantage and withstood Häkkinen's attempts to pass <b>him</b> <b>going</b> {{into the first}} corner. Further around the lap, a collision involving four cars prompted the deployment of the safety car and a fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti {{was struck by a}} flying wheel. When the safety car pulled into the pit lane on lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull clear from Häkkinen and kept the lead until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his own pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he held to clinch his sixth victory of the 2000 season; Häkkinen finished almost four seconds behind.|$|E

Denise tells Yusef {{that there have been}} rumours about <b>him</b> <b>going</b> round, Dot Branning (June Brown) is responsible so he goes and talks to Dot; she ignores him. Zainab tells Yusef that Afia will be welcome to the family but he will not. Yusef reminisces about the past leading to Zainab telling Masood they must stop the wedding. Yusef starts a relationship with Denise.|$|E

25|$|His parents, {{upon his}} graduation, {{had decided to}} give him a monthly {{allowance}} of $200 out of their earnings from Cobblestone Gardens, a substantial sum in those days. It was enough to keep <b>him</b> <b>going,</b> and indeed it guaranteed his survival for the next twenty-five years, arriving with welcome regularity. The allowance was a ticket to freedom; it allowed him to live where he wanted to and to forgo employment.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 he was {{appointed}} professor of missions and professor {{of the history of}} religion at the Princeton Theological Seminary, where he taught until 1937. He had married Amy Elizabeth Wilkes on May 18, 1896. He was famously turned down by the American Missionary Society, which resulted in <b>him</b> <b>going</b> overseas alone. He founded and edited the publication The Moslem World for 35 years. He was influential in mobilizing many Christians to go into missionary work in Islamic countries.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a goalkeeper, {{he would}} run into the attack on corner kicks if his team was behind. The sight of <b>him</b> <b>going</b> up for the corner was a great {{distraction}} to opposing defenders. He scored a goal in this fashion, for Man United, in a UEFA Cup match against Rotor Volgograd at Old Trafford in September 1995. He scored in the last minutes of the game to tie the match 2–2, though United were eliminated from the tournament on the away goals rule.|$|E

25|$|The Toronto Blue Jays took {{a chance}} by signing Burnett to a five-year deal despite his being prone to injuries, and the 2006 season began with <b>him</b> <b>going</b> on the {{disabled}} list when a piece of scar tissue—remnants of his Tommy John surgery—broke off in his pitching arm. However, some baseball commentators like RotoWorld and Tim Dierkes still considered the signing worthwhile, since many of the other free agent pitchers that year, like Matt Morris and Paul Byrd had less impressive career stats, even though they had fewer health risks.|$|E

I apologize for it / Yo, I can't call it, motherfucking Wyclef spoiled it!"). Said album, 2000 B.C., was also released to mixed feelings and reviews—the latter once more focusing on the lack of topical variety and uninspired production—and also suffered from very little promotion by Universal Records.|$|E

Under their influence he was able to continue to perform all over the country, up to a week before his death. Due to illegal (i.e. non-state-sanctioned) sales of tickets and other underground methods, these concerts pulled in sums of money unimaginable in Soviet times, when almost everyone received nearly the same small salary. The payouts and gathering of money were a constant source of danger, and Yanklovich and others were needed to organise them.|$|E

On December 11, 2013, YG revealed that My Krazy Life would be released on March 18, 2014 by YG's Pu$haz Ink, CTE World and Def Jam. He chose to release the album that day, {{as it is the}} five year anniversary of <b>him</b> <b>going</b> to prison. This was done to represent his journey and growth as an artist since then.|$|E

Bobby overhears Jane talking about Bobby leaving the school and when she stops <b>him</b> <b>going</b> back to the school, he hits her over the head with his hockey stick three times, leaving her in a critical condition. He tells Ian in the pub that he has killed Jane, just like he killed Lucy, within earshot of everyone in the pub.

They are reluctant to reopen the case but Ian is horrified when Bobby says he still has the murder weapon.|$|E
25|$|Kathy and Phil {{eventually}} {{sort out}} their differences, marry, {{and have a}} son, Ben (Matthew Silver), making Phil feel neglected and depressed so he turns to alcohol and develops an addiction. This makes him abusive and neglectful towards Kathy and Ben, so Kathy takes Ben and moves out. Realising what he has lost, Phil gives up alcohol and attends Alcoholics Anonymous, which helps reveal {{the basis of his}} problem – the physical abuse he received from his father and his fear that he may abuse Ben. He and Kathy reconcile when he attends counselling until he begins an affair with fellow alcoholic Lorna Cartwright (Janet Dibley), who starts stalking him. With his marriage in jeopardy, Phil takes Kathy to Paris and admits his affair with Lorna so Kathy throws her wedding ring into the river. Phil begins sleeping rough, gambling, and blaming Kathy for his decline so she decides to leave Walford for South Africa, letting it be known that an offer of reconciliation from Phil would make her reconsider. Phil is undecided until Lorna stops <b>him</b> <b>going</b> after Kathy by locking herself in his bathroom and attempts suicide. He later follows Kathy to the airport but is stopped by Kathy's son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who persuades him that Kathy and Ben are better off without him. Phil agonises over the loss of his son.|$|E
25|$|With Hamilton's and Rosberg's pit stops completed, Hülkenberg and Kvyat {{were now}} {{the first two}} drivers {{at the front of}} the field, {{followed}} by Grosjean. Rosberg was impeded by slower traffic which gave the potential for Hamilton to attack his teammate. He was protected from being overtaken by Hamilton on the main straight because he was using DRS to protect himself as he was running close behind Grosjean and both drivers were able to pass the Lotus car. Rosberg drew nearer to Kvyat and passed him for second on lap 12. On the same lap, Button overtook Sutil for eighth place. Hamilton was instructed by his team to manage the temperature in his right-rear tyre and lost more time to Rosberg after following Kvyat in the track's middle sector. Kvyat allowed Hamilton to pass <b>him</b> <b>going</b> into the Senna S chicane while Rosberg was now close by race leader Hülkenberg. He informed his team that his front-right tyre had developed a blister and lost the lead to Rosberg who passed him driving into the Senna S chicane at the beginning of the 14th lap. Massa got ahead of Grosjean and Bottas got ahead of the latter at the Senna S chicane to move into sixth place on lap 15. With his front tyres blistered, Hülkenberg was passed by Hamilton who used his DRS going into the Senna S chicane on the following lap.|$|E
