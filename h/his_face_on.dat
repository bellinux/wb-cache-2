5|$|The {{reason behind}} the pursuit was {{explained}} in the following episode in a promo, where he claimed that Vampiro rigged a casket with explosives during a match, with the explosion resulting in {{the damage done to}} <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>On</b> the eighth episode (which was taped on November 15, 2006) of the series, Banderas won the WSX Championship in his debut match for the promotion. Beforehand, he was involved in a series of brawls with Youth Suicide (Andre Verdun), as well as an allusion to a partnership with 6-Pac (Sean Waltman).|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila {{told him that}} he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E

25|$|The cover {{consists}} of {{a large amount of}} all-white instruments and recording tools stacked in a corner, with three red lines across the image. Rather than simply using photoshop, the album's design team carefully stacked all the equipment in a corner then used a projector to create the bars. They then painted red onto the equipment where the projection of the bars was, and replaced the projector with a camera to achieve the correct perspective for the image. Blueprint 3 would be Jay-Z's first album cover that did not feature <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> it.|$|E

But then we thought, what if somebody robs a bank wearing one, and the witnesses say, 'It was Tom Peterson!' So we're sticking with {{the black and white}} cardboard." ...|$|E

Adrian Fisher, State Department Legal Adviser and a close friend of Acheson, caught his arm, fortunately, because Acheson would have missed Wherry by about three feet and probably fallen flat on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> the floor.

500|$|In the 1994 film Forrest Gump, title {{character}} Forrest is jogging {{down the street}} when a T-shirt salesman approaches him, asking him to put <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> T-shirts as inspiration to people. While the men are jogging, a truck splashes mud into Forrest's face, and the salesman gives him a yellow shirt to wipe the mud off. Forrest rolls up the shirt and hands it back, saying [...] "{{have a nice day}}". Unrolling the shirt, the man finds a smiley face outlined on it. Thus the film credits Forrest Gump with inventing the Smiley logo and the have a nice day slogan.|$|E

His murder was really a traumatic loss for our community." [...] One member of J-FLAG stated that [...] "Brian Williamson is our Martin Luther King". Four days later, J-FLAG held a memorial devoted to Williamson, which was attended by almost two hundred people; the memorial involved personal tributes, poetry slams, and lip synching to Whitney Houston songs.|$|E
500|$|Stockhausen, {{along with}} John Cage, {{is one of}} the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in {{penetrating}} the popular consciousness ( [...] ; [...] ). The Beatles included <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [...] This reflects his influence on the band's own avant-garde experiments as well as the general fame and notoriety he had achieved by that time (1967). In particular, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (1967) and [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen web site (...) [...] Perhaps the most caustic remark about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham. Asked [...] "Have you heard any Stockhausen?", he is alleged to have replied, [...] "No, but I believe I have trodden in some" [...] ( [...] , annotated on 366: [...] "Apocryphal; source unknown").|$|E
500|$|In [...] "", [...] Lieutenants Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), and Peter Durst (Brian Markinson) are {{kidnapped by}} the Vidiians. Paris and Durst {{are forced to}} work in mines while waiting to have their organs harvested. Vidiian Chief Surgeon Sulan (also played by Markinson) {{experiments}} on Torres {{to find a cure}} for the Phage, since her Klingon genetic structure has an immunity to the disease. The procedure splits Torres into two bodies (a full-blooded Klingon and a full-blooded human); Sulan conducts further experiments on the Klingon Torres while the Human Torres is forced to work in the mines. Sulan kills Durst and grafts <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> top of his own. Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Lieutenant Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ), and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang), who had formed a search party to locate the missing crew members, are also captured by Vidiians and forced to dig tunnels. Chakotay, disguised as a Vidiian guard with the help of Tuvok and [...] (Robert Picardo), helps to rescue Torres; the Doctor combines both versions of Torres back together.|$|E

500|$|The Killing Joke (in {{which the}} Joker is the {{unreliable}} narrator) explains {{the roots of}} his insanity as [...] "one bad day": losing his wife and unborn child and being disfigured by chemicals, paralleling Batman's origin {{in the loss of}} his parents. He tries (and fails) to prove that anyone can become like him after one bad day by torturing Commissioner Gordon, physically and psychologically. Batman offers to rehabilitate his foe; the Joker apologetically declines, believing it too late for him to be saved. Other interpretations show that the Joker is fully aware of how his actions affect others and that his insanity as merely an act. Comics scholar Peter Coogan describes the Joker as trying to reshape reality to fit himself by imposing <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> his victims (and fish) in an attempt to make the world comprehensible by creating a twisted parody of himself. Englehart's [...] "The Laughing Fish" [...] demonstrates the character's illogical nature: trying to copyright fish which bear his face, and not understanding why threatening the copyright clerk cannot produce the desired result.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1932 Nordisk folkereisning i Norge {{was forced}} to confirm that even though Quisling {{remained}} in the cabinet, he would not {{become a member of}} the party. They further stated that the party programme had no basis in fascism of any kind, including the National Socialism model. This did not dampen criticism of Quisling, who remained constantly in the headlines, although he was gradually earning a reputation as a disciplined and efficient administrator. After he was attacked in his office by a knife-wielding assailant who threw ground pepper in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> 2 February 1932, some newspapers, instead of focusing on the attack itself, suggested that the assailant had been the jealous husband of one of Quisling's cleaners; others, especially those aligned with the Labour Party, posited that the whole thing had been staged. In November 1932, Labour politician Johan Nygaardsvold put this theory to Parliament, prompting suggestions that charges of slander be brought against him. No charges were brought, and the identity of the assailant has never been confirmed. Quisling later indicated it was an attempt to steal military papers recently left by Swedish Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Kleen. The so-called [...] "pepper affair" [...] served to polarise opinion about Quisling, and government fears grew concerning reasonably open Soviet elements in Norway who had been active in promoting industrial unrest.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{agreed to}} meet with Schwarzenegger about the film and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role. Upon meeting him, however, Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger who would {{talk about how the}} villain should be played. Cameron began {{sketching}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>on</b> a notepad and asked Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still. After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that [...] "he'd make a hell of a Terminator". Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Destroyer, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, [...] "Oh some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks." [...] He recounted in his memoir, Total Recall, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan the Barbarian and that the film was low profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. He also wrote that [...] "it took [...] awhile to figure out that Jim [...] was the real deal." [...] In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons {{to be able to use}} them and feel comfortable around them. Schwarzenegger speaks only 18 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. James Cameron said that [...] "Somehow, even his [...] accent worked... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out." ...|$|E
