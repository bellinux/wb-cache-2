5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum winters in tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The Asian <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> breeds further south than common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> {{in the mountains of}} central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move from the high mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is resident in the mountains of southern Asia.|$|E

5|$|The main predators of the <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> {{are those}} {{birds of prey}} which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud. The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal <b>house</b> <b>martins.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{effectiveness}} of installing spikes (® EcoPic E- 5) on building eaves and windows to avoid the nesting of <b>house</b> <b>martins.</b> We found that spikes cannot prevent the nesting or reduce colony size. The first year after installing the spikes the colony may be partially affected. However <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> are able to overcome the spikes in the next years and rebuild the nests even on the spikes. We conclude that spikes are ineffective as a deterrent system...|$|R

5|$|The Delichon martins were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> now largely uses human structures, as, {{to a lesser}} extent, does the Asian <b>house</b> <b>martin.</b> The typical nest is a grass or feather-lined deep closed mud bowl with a small opening at the top, but many Asian house martins leave {{the top of the}} nest open.|$|E
5|$|The Delichon species {{typically}} feed {{higher in}} the air, and take smaller prey than other swallows. It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, particularly with the barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small flies, aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The Asian <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows. In the case of at least the common <b>house</b> <b>martin,</b> the start of egg laying appears {{to be linked to}} the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide a stable and abundant food supply.|$|E

5|$|The {{numbers of}} the two Asian species are unknown, but both can be locally common or abundant, and the Asian <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is {{extending}} its range in southern Siberia. The lowland breeding common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> has greatly benefited from forest clearance, creating the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation which has given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites, although widespread declines in its numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970. This is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites. Despite this, the huge geographical range and large {{numbers of the}} common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> mean that its global status is secure.|$|E

5|$|The pale crag martin's {{flight is}} slow, with rapid wing beats {{interspersed}} with flat-winged glides, {{and it is}} more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian crag martin. It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a trrt resembling {{the call of the}} common <b>house</b> <b>martin,</b> a nasal vick, and a high pitched twee contact call.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of the regions where vector-borne diseases are transmitted is essential to study transmission patterns and to recognize future changes in environmental conditions that may potentially influence the transmission areas. SGS 1, one of the lineages of Plasmodium relictum, {{is known to have}} active transmission in tropical Africa and temperate regions of Europe. Nuclear sequence data from isolates infected with SGS 1 (based on merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP 1) allelic diversity) have provided new insights on the distribution and transmission areas of these allelic variants. For example, MSP 1 alleles transmitted in Africa differ from those transmitted in Europe, suggesting the existence of two populations of SGS 1 lineages. However, no study has analysed the distribution of African and European transmitted alleles in Afro-Palearctic migratory birds. With this aim, we used a highly variable molecular marker to investigate whether juvenile <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> become infected in Europe before their first migration to Africa. We explored the MSP 1 allelic diversity of P. relictum in adult and juvenile <b>house</b> <b>martins.</b> We found that juveniles were infected with SGS 1 during their first weeks of life, confirming active transmission of SGS 1 to <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> in Europe. Moreover, we found that all the juveniles and most of adults were infected with one European transmitted MSP 1 allele, whereas two adult birds were infected with two African transmitted MSP 1 alleles. These findings suggest that <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> are exposed to different strains of P. relictum in their winter and breeding quarters...|$|R
50|$|There are old legends, with {{no basis}} in fact, that <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> would wall-up <b>house</b> sparrows by closing the {{entrance}} of the mud nest with the intruder inside, or that they would gather en masse to kill a sparrow.|$|R
5|$|The {{common and}} Asian <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> have {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be}} a single species, although both breed in the western Himalayas without hybridising. There is also limited DNA evidence that suggests a significant genetic distance between these two martins.|$|R
5|$|The urban common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> has {{to compete}} with house sparrows, which {{frequently}} attempt {{to take over the}} nest during construction, with the house martins rebuilding elsewhere if the sparrows are successful. The entrance {{at the top of the}} completed cup is so small that the sparrows cannot take over the nest once it is finished.|$|E
5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, and the reason for their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} is omnivorous. It digs beetle larvae {{from trees}} and also takes many other invertebrates including adult beetles, ants and spiders. Crustaceans, molluscs and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for suet and domestic scraps. The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as tits, may be raided for their eggs and chicks; nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the woodpecker where necessary. <b>House</b> <b>martin</b> colonies can be destroyed in repeated visits.|$|E
50|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} seen flying along the cliffs. Some stonechats and meadow pipits gather on the meadow, while rock pipits move along {{the base of the}} cliffs. <b>House</b> <b>martins</b> make mud nests under the {{overhangs}} of the chalk cliffs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In a {{southern}} Spanish {{population of the}} colo-nial-breeding Afrotropical migrant <b>House</b> <b>Martins</b> Deli-chon urbicum, a high overall prevalence of (molecularly assayed) haemosporidian infections (in the non-parasito-logical literature usually denoted with the inclusive term ‘malaria’) was associated with negative fitness conse-quences for individuals carrying single or double infec-tions. To verify this in a northern population, we here report on the occurrence of malaria in 112 fledgling and 358 adult <b>House</b> <b>Martins</b> from The Netherlands. Repeat-ability of molecular essays was 94. 4 % (n = 125). Malaria was not found {{in any of the}} fledglings, but 77 % of the adults carried single or double infections of two Haemo-proteus haplotypes (Delurb 1, Delurb 2) and five Plasmo-dium haplotypes (GRW 2, GRW 9, GRW 11, COLL 6 an...|$|R
5|$|A Scottish {{study showed}} that {{mortality}} in common <b>house</b> <b>martins</b> occurred mostly outside the breeding season and averaged 57%. Females that had raised two clutches in a season had a higher mortality than those that were single-brooded, {{but there was no}} such correlation for the males.|$|R
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it {{is also found in}} mountains up to at least 2,200metres (7,200ft) altitude. As its name implies, it readily nests on man-made buildings, and will breed even in city centres if the air is clean enough. The other two species favour mountainous country (and sea cliffs in the case of Asian house martin); they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative. The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats.|$|E
5|$|The house martins nest in colonies on cliffs or buildings, {{constructing}} feather- or grass-lined mud nests. The typical clutch is two {{or three}} white eggs; both parents build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. These martins are aerial hunters of small insects such as flies and aphids. Despite their flying skills the Delichon martins are sometimes caught by fast-flying birds of prey. They may carry fleas or internal parasites. None of the species are considered threatened, although widespread reductions in common <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe. This decline is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites.|$|E
5|$|These martins are 12–15cm (4.7–5.9in) {{long with}} drab brown or grey plumage {{and a short}} square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and {{outermost}} pairs of feathers. The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are similar, but juveniles show pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The species differ in plumage shades and size, Eurasian crag martin being significantly larger than the others. The flight is slow, with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat-winged glides. The songs of these birds are simple twitterings, and contact calls include a high-pitched twee or chi, chi, and a tshir or trrt call {{like that of the}} <b>house</b> <b>martin.</b>|$|E

25|$|Swallows are tolerated {{by humans}} {{because of their}} {{beneficial}} role as insect-eaters, and some species have readily adapted to nesting in and around human habitation. The barn swallow and <b>house</b> <b>martin</b> now rarely use natural sites. The purple martin is also actively encouraged by people to nest around humans and elaborate nest boxes are erected. Enough artificial nesting sites have been created that the purple martin now seldom nests in natural cavities {{in the eastern part}} of its range.|$|E
