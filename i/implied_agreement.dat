In Mahanoy township, $60,000 was appropriated for the schools and eleven-twelfths of it stolen. Exorbitant road taxes were a fruitful means by which township officials robbed the taxpayers and put the money in their own pockets. In August 1875 an ex-county commissioner, a Molly; and two commissioners then in office, not actually belonging to the order but in sympathy with it, had been convicted of stealing the county funds and each had been sentenced by a full bench September 6 to two years' imprisonment. At the fall election for governor in this year (1875) the Molly Maguires, who were naturally Democrats, foresaw Republican success and sold their vote in Schuylkill and Luzerne counties to the Republicans for {{a certain amount of money}} in hand and an <b>implied</b> <b>agreement</b> that these convicted commissioners and other criminals who were called by a leading Molly [...] "our men" [...] should be pardoned. [...] It is hardly to be supposed that the Republican politicians who made this bargain were aware of the thoroughly criminal nature of the Molly Maguires, for they had astutely covered themselves with a virtuous cloak, securing from the Legislature in 1871 a charter for the Ancient Order of Hibernians whose motto was [...] "Friendship, Unity and Christian Charity." [...] On October 10, 1875, in a letter to the Shenandoah Herald Jack Kehoe denied with indignation that the Molly Maguires were synonymous with the Ancient Order of Hibernians, which latter was [...] "composed of men who are law abiding and seek the elevation of their members." [...] (2) Kehoe was crafty enough to see the advantage of throwing dust in the eyes of the public and, when the outside world was bargained with, the A.O.H. was put forward; but, as matter of fact, it was the old story of ravening wolves in sheep's clothing.|$|E

If it is only understood by both parties, {{it is just as}} binding as if it were fully expressed. For instance, if I go into a bookstore, and ask the bookseller to put me up certain books, and take them and carry them home, and then he charges them to me in his books, I must pay for them: for, though I did not say any thing about paying for them, yet my actions constituted an <b>implied</b> <b>agreement</b> to pay. By going in and getting them, under those circumstances, I, in fact, tacitly promise that I will pay for them when the bookseller sends in his bill. A very large portion of the agreements made among men are tacit agreements." ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Railton's silence <b>implied</b> <b>agreement</b> and Grace's curiosity {{was excited}} because of {{something}} she had heard at home. Railton's lease of the sheepwalk ran out in a few days, but he was by local custom entitled to its renewal after {{a review of the}} terms. Moreover, it was usual for the tenant to take the sheep with the farm, and leave them equal in number and condition when he went. The landlord could then demand a valuation and payment of the difference, if the flocks had fallen below the proper standard.|$|E
60|$|At length {{one of the}} {{pedestrians}} {{from the}} village stopped also, and fixed an earnest gaze at a new brick edifice that was throwing a long shadow across the fields of snow, as it rose, with a beautiful gradation of light and shade, under the rays of a full moon. In front of the academy was a vacant piece of ground, that was intended for a public square. On the side opposite to Mr. Jones, the new and as yet unfinished church of St. Paul’s was erected, This edifice had been reared during the preceding summer, by the aid of what was called a subscription; though all, or nearly all, of the money came from {{the pockets of the}} landlord. It had been built under a strong conviction of the necessity of a more seemly place of worship than “the long room of the academy,” and under an <b>implied</b> <b>agreement</b> that, after its completion, the question should be fairly put to the people, that they might decide to what denomination it should belong. Of course, this expectation kept alive a strong excitement in some few of the sectaries who were interested in its decision; though but little was said openly on the subject. Had Judge Temple espoused the cause of any particular sect, the question would have been immediately put at rest, for his influence was too powerful to be opposed; but he declined interference in the matter, positively refusing to lend even the weight of his name on the side of Richard, who had secretly given an assurance to his diocesan that both the building and the congregation would cheerfully come within the pale of the Protestant Episcopal Church. But, when the neutrality of the Judge was clearly ascertained, Mr. Jones discovered that he had to contend with a stiff necked people. His first measure was to go among them and commence a course of reasoning, in order to bring them round to his own way of thinking. They all heard him patiently, and not a man uttered a word in reply in the way of argument, and Richard thought, by the time that he had gone through the settlement, the point was conclusively decided in his favor. Willing to strike while the iron was hot, he called a meeting, through the news paper, with a view to decide the question by a vote at once. Not a soul attended; {{and one of the most}} anxious afternoons that he had ever known was spent by Richard in a vain discussion with Mrs. Hollister, who strongly contended that the Methodist (her own) church was the best entitled to and most deserving of, the possession of the new tabernacle. Richard now perceived that he had been too sanguine, and had fallen into the error of all those who ignorantly deal with that wary and sagacious people. He assumed a disguise himself—that is, as well as he knew how, and proceeded step by step to advance his purpose.|$|E

Two independent game developers named Robert Burton and Allen Coleman submitted a game to Milton Bradley titled [...] "Triumph" [...] that involved an electronic tower as the centerpiece. Milton Bradley rejected the game, but proceeded to release [...] "Dark Tower" [...] some time later. The inventors sued for misappropriation of trade secrets and won a jury verdict for over $700,000. The trial judge, however, vacated the jury's judgement. Despite finding that Milton Bradley had likely [...] "plagiarized the plaintiffs' idea {{without so much as a}} by-your-leave" [...] the judge proceeded to issue a directed verdict for the defendant because Burton and Coleman had signed a contract waiving any contractual relationship (which arguably included any duty of confidentiality). The First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding evidence that Milton Bradley entered an <b>implied</b> <b>agreement</b> to keep the game confidential and reinstated the damage award.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parties may}} vary the normal rules {{regarding}} risk by express agreement in their contract.

One salient question here is whether or not an undertaking by the seller to deliver the goods at a specified destination necessarily <b>implies</b> <b>agreement</b> to vary the incidence of the risk. The answer would appear to be no. Why should a mere agreement to deliver at a distance imply a term that risk is to remain with the seller until delivery? The situation would be quite different where the seller undertakes to deliver the thing [...] "safely" [...] to the agreed destination.|$|R

50|$|New Keynesian {{economists have}} sought to explain {{persistently}} high unemployment in industrialized economies. New Keynesians explain part of this excess supply {{in the labor market}} with real wage rigidities that hold wages above market clearing levels. Economists have three main groups of theories for explaining real rigidities in the labor market: implicit contract theories, efficiency wage theories, and insider-outsider theories. New Keynesian economics is especially associated with the latter two. Implicit contract theory attributes stable real wages to <b>implied</b> <b>agreements</b> between employers and workers. Firms serve not just as consumers of labor, but also as wage insurers. By showing their workers that they will provide stable real wages, firms secure their loyalty. Seeing implicit contracts as a poor basis for real wage rigidities, new Keynesian economists sought other explanations.|$|R
50|$|Giles was sued by {{his former}} girlfriend {{for more than}} $10 million. She alleged Giles broke an oral and/or <b>implied</b> <b>agreement</b> {{that he would take}} care of her for an {{indefinite}} period of time. She alleged Giles began abusing her in 2002, and battered her while she was pregnant with Giles' child, and caused her to have a miscarriage. She dropped the allegations that Giles caused the miscarriage before the trial began. A jury found that both Giles and his girlfriend, Cheri Olvera, committed acts of domestic violence against each other but that there were no damages. The jury also refused to award damages on Olvera's contract claim, finding that Olvera's alleged terms were not clear enough so that both Olvera and Giles could understand what each was required to do. Instead, the jury found that Olvera must return the $107,000 engagement ring Giles provided to her or pay the $107,000 as damages. Following Giles' dispute with Olvera and given the nature of the court case, Giles' endorsement contract with Nair Hair Removal products was terminated.|$|E
5000|$|The lack of {{precedent}} for treating animals as persons for habeas corpus purposes does not, however, end the inquiry, as the writ has over time gained increasing use given its great flexibility and vague scope. While petitioner proffers various justifications for affording chimpanzees, such as Tommy, the liberty rights protected by such writ, the ascription of rights {{has historically been}} connected with the imposition of societal obligations and duties. Reciprocity between rights and responsibilities stems from principles of social contract, which inspired the ideals of freedom and democracy {{at the core of}} our system of government. Under this view, society extends rights in exchange for an express or <b>implied</b> <b>agreement</b> from its members to submit to social responsibilities. In other words, rights are connected to moral agency and the ability to accept societal responsibility in exchange for those rights....Needless to say, unlike human beings, chimpanzees cannot bear any legal duties, submit to societal responsibilities or be held legally accountable for their actions. In our view, it is this incapability to bear any legal responsibilities and societal duties that renders it inappropriate to confer upon chimpanzees the legal rights — such as the fundamental right to liberty protected by the writ of habeas corpus — that have been afforded to human beings.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the present}} case, the trial judge, when rejecting the applicant's {{submission}} that marital immunity applied, doubted {{the extent to}} which it could ever have been permissible under the common law for a husband to beat his wife into having sexual intercourse with him The Commission considers that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape. As stated by the Court of Appeal in the applicant's case, lip service had been paid to the alleged general rule while the courts at the same time increased the number of exceptions. That there was uncertainty as to the width of the exceptions is apparent from the Law Commission Working Paper examining the question ....While there was no express authority for the proposition that an <b>implied</b> <b>agreement</b> of separation between husband or wife or unilateral withdrawal of consent by the wife would bring a case outside the marital immunity, the Commission takes the view that in the present case where the applicant's wife had withdrawn from cohabitation and there was de facto separation with the expressed intention of both to seek a divorce, there was a basis on which it could be anticipated that the courts could hold that the notional consent of the wife was no longer to be implied The Commission considers that this adaptation in the application of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable to an applicant with appropriate legal advice.|$|E

The results, from the two assay methods, may be compared to confidence intervals around the line of equality.
