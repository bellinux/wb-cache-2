5|$|Nabulsi soap was {{traditionally}} made {{by women}} <b>for</b> <b>household</b> use, {{even before the}} appearance of small soap-making factories in the 10th century. Trade with Bedouins was indispensable for soap-making, both in Nablus and Hebron, since they alone could furnish the alkaline soda (qilw) required by the process. By the 14th century a significant soap-making industry had developed in Nablus and the soap, reputedly prized by Queen Elizabeth I of England, was exported throughout the Middle East and to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} note is that {{chemical analysis}} of ceramic fragments {{has revealed that}} the very same workshops not only produced the highest-quality Ik-style polychrome ceramics but also general low-quality ceramics <b>for</b> <b>household</b> use. High quality Ik-style ceramics made at Motul de San José have been excavated from across the Maya region, including Tikal and Uaxactún to the northeast of the city, Copán far to the south, and Altar de Sacrificios, Tamarindito and Seibal, in western Petén.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale {{wind power}} is the name given to wind {{generation}} systems with the capacity to produce up to 50kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines have been used <b>for</b> <b>household</b> electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas.|$|E
40|$|Homeownership {{is widely}} {{advocated}} and believed to contribute towards economic activity, employment, wealth creation, economic, political, and neighbourhood stability and financial independence. Despite government’s interventions to advance homeownership {{there is currently}} a declining trend in homeownership {{and an increase in}} renting experienced in South Africa. As the government does not have the resources to provide adequate housing to all South Africans, identifying the factors which attribute to non-subsidised homeownership will assist in implementing interventions and strategies to increase access to non-subsidised homeownership and reduce reliance on government subsidised housing. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the comparative odds of variables contributing to non-subsidised homeownership in South Africa from secondary data obtained from a South African household survey. Compared to the heuristic model, the following variables were found to align closely with the expectation created; non-subsidised homeownership attainment was most likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> within high-income groups and least <b>for</b> <b>households</b> within the low-income groups, more likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> who have access to credit than those without, more likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> with no accounts in arrears than those with accounts in arrears, more likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> with an ability to save than those without, most likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> consisting of seven or more household members and least likely <b>for</b> single member <b>households,</b> most likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> where FKP (Financially Knowledgeable Person) has completed a tertiary education level and least likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> with primary not completed education levels, most likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> where the FKP is older (aged 65 and older) and least likely <b>for</b> young FKP <b>households</b> (aged between 18 and 24), most likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> residing in rural areas and least likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> residing in metropolitan areas, most likely <b>for</b> female FKP <b>households</b> and least likely <b>for</b> male FKP <b>households.</b> Unexpectedly the regression model indicated that non-subsidised homeownership is most likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> where the Financially Knowledgeable Person (FKP) is not economically active (for example pensioners) and least likely <b>for</b> employed <b>households,</b> most likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> from the African population group and least likely <b>for</b> Indian <b>households,</b> most likely where the FKP is never married or single and least likely for separated or divorced FKP households (which is expected) and most likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> residing in Limpopo (which is expected) and least likely <b>for</b> <b>households</b> residing Western Cape.

5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), whether <b>for</b> <b>household</b> use or {{a prayer}} mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour {{boundary}} is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Although cottage industries, both in boyar and peasant households, {{were still}} {{the main source}} of clothing, food and construction, {{specialized}} production, such as weaving and pottery, started to develop {{by the middle of the}} 15thcentury.

In Moldavia, Gypsy slaves were first mentioned in 1428 when Alexander I awarded 31 Gypsy families to the Bistriţa Monastery. In time Gypsies became specialized in several crafts: for example, throughout the Middle Ages the working of iron was an occupation reserved almost exclusively for them.|$|E
