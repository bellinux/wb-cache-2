50|$|Liquid dyes {{have very}} high gain as laser media. The beam {{needs to make}} only a few passes through the liquid to reach full design power, and hence, the high {{transmittance}} of the output coupler. The high gain also leads to high losses, because reflections from the dye-cell walls or <b>flashlamp</b> <b>reflector</b> cause parasitic oscillations, dramatically {{reducing the amount of}} energy available to the beam. Pump cavities are often coated, anodized, or otherwise made of a material that will not reflect at the lasing wavelength while reflecting at the pump wavelength.|$|E
40|$|A durable {{protected}} {{silver coating}} {{was designed and}} fabricated for possible use on <b>flashlamp</b> <b>reflectors</b> in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) to avoid tarnishing under corrosive conditions and intense visible light (10 J/cm{sup 2 }, 360 {micro}s). This coating provides a valuable alternative for mirror coatings where high reflectance and durability are important requirements. This paper describes a protected silver coating having high reflectance from 400 mn to 10, 000 mu. The specular reflectance is between 95 % and 98 % in the visible region and 98 % or better in the infrared region...|$|R
40|$|Purified air {{is being}} {{considered}} as a cost-effective alternative to evaporated liquid nitrogen for cooling laser amplifiers in the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Atmospheric corrosion of the associated <b>flashlamp</b> <b>reflectors</b> could cause significant degradation of overall laser performance. Therefore, a comprehensive study has been undertaken to address this important problem. Specific contributions include: (1) a detailed literature search, with a critical analysis of published data; (2) Predictive calculations based on the published data, {{as well as new}} measurements made a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL); (3) Analyses of proposed coolant gases to determine the actual concentrations of H 2 S, SO 2, COS, CS 2, H 2 O, NO 2, Cl 2, and organic forms of sulfur; and (4) Investigations of both ultra-filtration of air and protective optical coatings as possible means of preventing mirror tarnish...|$|R
