The novel also features Gump as an astronaut, a professional wrestler, and a chess player.|$|E
5|$|Presently, grid {{systems with}} large wind {{penetration}} require a small {{increase in the}} frequency of usage of natural gas spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electric power in the event that there is no wind.

According to a 2014 Cochrane review, {{while there is}} an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the cause. In 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning about psychiatric problems when used for stopping smoking.|$|E

5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a problem.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 Blackburn Olympic, a team {{composed}} {{mainly of}} factory workers, {{became the first}} Northern team to win the FA Cup, {{and the next year}} Preston North End won an FA Cup match against London-based Upton Park. Upton Park protested that Preston had broken FA rules by paying their players. In response, Preston withdrew from the competition and fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the North, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. A schism was avoided in July 1885 when professionalism was formally legalised in English football. The Football League was founded in 1888, and marked its independence from the London-based Football Association by establishing headquarters in Preston – the League retained a Northern identity even after it accepted several Southern teams into its ranks. Intense local derbies between neighbouring teams mean that there <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a North–South rivalry than in some other sports.|$|E
5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because}} of the practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E

5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing {{the rate at which}} fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E

25|$|Cold brewing {{has some}} {{disadvantages}} compared to hot steeping. Firstly, if the leaves or source water contain unwanted bacteria, they may flourish, whereas using hot water has {{the benefit of}} killing most bacteria. This <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a concern in modern times and developed regions. Secondly, cold brewing may allow for less caffeine to be extracted, {{which may or may}} not be desired.|$|E

25|$|The Pearson {{correlation}} is +1 in {{the case}} of a perfect direct (increasing) linear relationship (correlation), −1 {{in the case}} of a perfect decreasing (inverse) linear relationship (anticorrelation), and some value in the open interval (−1, 1) in all other cases, indicating the degree of linear dependence between the variables. As it approaches zero there <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a relationship (closer to uncorrelated).

25|$|Although {{there is}} {{insufficient}} evidence to classify nicotine as a carcinogen, {{there is an}} ongoing debate about whether it functions as a tumor promoter.

Nicotine {{in the form of}} nicotine replacement products <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a cancer risk than smoking.

25|$|As a {{tactical}} weapon for military use, {{a significant problem}} with a BW attack {{is that it would}} take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents (smallpox, pneumonic plague) have the capability of person-to-person transmission via aerosolized respiratory droplets. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> a concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.|$|E
25|$|If the two {{principles}} are authentically Plato's and the monistic interpretation is correct, then Plato's metaphysics strongly resembles the Neo-Platonic {{systems of the}} Roman Imperial period. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato is, {{at least in this}} central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>of</b> an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus, the founder of Neo-Platonism, as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.|$|E
