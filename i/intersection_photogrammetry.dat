The area {{is known as a}} former military camp from Thirty Years’ War in 17 th Century. There is an extensive underground compound with one entrance corridor and two transverse, situated approximately 2 to 5 m under the local development. The object has been partly documented by geodetic polar method, <b>intersection</b> <b>photogrammetry,</b> image-based modelling and laser scanning. Data have been analyzed and methods have been compared. Then the 3 D model of object has been created and compound with cadastral data, orthophoto, historical maps and digital surface model which was made by photogrammetric method using remotely piloted aircraft system. Then the measuring has been realized with ground penetrating radar. Data have been analyzed and the result compared with real status. All the data have been combined and visualized into one 3 D model. Finally, the discussion about advantages and disadvantages of used measuring methods has been livened up. The tested methodology has been also used for other documentation of historical objects in this area. This project has been created as a part of research at EuroGV. s. r. o. Company lead by Ing. Karel Vach CSc. in cooperation with prof. Dr. Ing. Karel Pavelka from Czech Technical University in Prague and Miloš Gavenda, the renovator...|$|E

Compared to stereopair, more observed information and theories of robust estimation were considered in the process of space intersection with multi-images, bringing about higher intersection accuracy and robustness. Finally, correctness and robustness of the method was verified though example analysis, which can enrich the space <b>intersection</b> theory in <b>photogrammetry</b> to some degree...|$|R
