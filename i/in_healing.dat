During that decade, Roberts and William Branham criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted {{in part by the}} expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent healing evangelists.|$|E

They have been involved in funding various projects and services that assist former residential school students and their families <b>in</b> <b>healing</b> from the trauma caused by the schools. The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing & Reconciliation Program.|$|E

5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as <b>in</b> <b>healing</b> – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|Tied {{into the}} battle {{system is a}} Job system: {{beginning}} with the Freelancer, the party can gain additional Jobs by obtaining gems called Asterisks from defeated human bosses. Twenty-four Jobs {{can be found in}} the game, ranging from the agile Valkyrie, and White and Black Mages that respectively specialize <b>in</b> <b>healing</b> and fighting magic. Each Job has different strengths and weaknesses in battle. Outside battle, characters can be assigned any available Job. In addition to the skills of the equipped Job, the skills of a second Job can be learned, allowing for free customization of parties and the mixing of Job abilities in battle. After obtaining the Summoner Job, characters can use summoned monsters to launch attacks that deal high damage on all enemies. Friend characters can also be summoned from other players' games: the more a friend summon is used, the more effective their actions become. Descriptions of defeated enemies, along with story recaps and descriptions of locations, are included in an item called D's journal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Purpose: The aim {{of present}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate marginal bone level after 5 -year follow-up of implants placed <b>in</b> <b>healed</b> ridges and fresh extraction sockets in maxilla with immediate loading protocol. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six patients {{in need of a}} single tooth replacement in the anterior maxilla received 42 Astra Tech implants (Astra Tech Implant system™, Dentsply Implants, Mölndal, Sweden). Implants were placed <b>in</b> <b>healed</b> ridges (group I) or immediately into extraction sockets (group II). Implants were restored and placed into functional loading immediately by using a prefabricated abutment. Marginal bone level relative to the implant reference point was recorded at implant placement, crown cementation, 12, 36 and 60 months following loading using intra-oral radiographs. Measurements were made on the mesial and distal sides of each implant Results: Overall, two implants were lost from the group II, before final crown cementation: they were excluded from the study and all remaining implants osseointegrated successfully after 5 years of functional loading. The mean change in marginal bone loss after implant placement was 0. 267 ± 0. 161 for one year, and 0. 265 ± 0. 171 for three years and 0. 213 ± 0. 185 for five years in extraction sockets and was 0. 266 ± 0. 176 for one year and 0. 219 ± 0. 175 for three years and 0. 194 ± 0. 172 for five years <b>in</b> <b>healed</b> ridges group.

This led to creation of a huge class of unemployed Haredi Jews (the exemption was conditional on attendance of a religious seminary, so they kept studying until they were too old for military service). By remaining students, they were a massive burden on the state, while also failing to participate in the military burden.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} multicenter clinical study was to compare 3 years implant survival, bone and soft tissue changes following immediate loading using single Osseospeed™ implants (Astra Tech AB, Mölndal, Sweden) installed <b>in</b> <b>healed</b> ridges or extraction sockets. Material and methods: Implants were provisionally restored the day of surgery using cemented acrylic crowns out of full occlusion. The provisional crowns were replaced after 12 weeks by full-ceramic crowns. Implant survival, bone levels, soft tissue levels and peri-implant health were monitored up to 3 years. Results: 55 patients (22 men, 33 women; mean age 45) had the implant installed in extraction sockets and 58 patients (25 men, 33 women; mean age 42) received conventional implant treatment <b>in</b> <b>healed</b> ridges. Three implants failed in the extraction group and one implant failed <b>in</b> the <b>healed</b> group, all failures occurred before the final crown placement. No further losses occurred during 3 years, giving a statistically comparable survival rate of 94. 6 % and 98. 3 %, respectively. The total bone loss after 3 years, compared to implant placement was 0. 4 mm (SD 1. 5) <b>in</b> <b>healed</b> sites, whilst the immediate sites showed a bone gain of 1. 6 mm (SD 2. 4) due to bone fill in the alveolus. Papillae retracted with 0. 3 and 0. 0 mm {{in the period of}} provisionalization, but grew back after final crown was placed with 0. 3 and 0. 5 mm <b>in</b> extraction and <b>healed</b> sites respectively after 3 years. Plaque and inflammation scores were very low throughout the study time, irrespective of treatment modality. Conclusions: Immediate implants restored at the day of surgery show comparable risk for implant failure, bone loss and midfacial soft tissue recession compared to conventionally installed implants. The 3 -years results suggest both hard and soft tissue stability...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the 5 -year outcome of {{immediate}} loading with that of conventional loading for anterior single-tooth implants placed <b>in</b> <b>healed</b> sites. It was hypothesized that immediate loading is not inferior to conventional loading. Materials and Methods: A total of 62 patients with a missing maxillary anterior tooth were included. At random, patients were treated with an implant that was restored either with a nonoccluding temporary crown within 24 hours after implant placement (immediate group) or according to a two-stage procedure after 3 months (conventional group). All implants were placed <b>in</b> <b>healed</b> sites. Follow-up visits were performed after definitive crown delivery and 1 and 5 years thereafter. Outcome measures were radiographic marginal bone level changes, implant survival, complications, soft tissue aspects (probing depth, plaque, bleeding, soft tissue level changes), esthetic outcome, and patient satisfaction. Results: Three patients in each study group were lost to follow-up. No significant differences were found in terms of marginal bone loss (1. 16 +/- 0. 93 mm in the immediate group and 1. 20 +/- 1. 10 mm in the conventional group), survival (one implant lost in the immediate group), complications, soft tissue aspects, esthetic outcome, and patient satisfaction.
