25|$|The {{telescope}}s amateur telescope makers build {{range from}} backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful {{contributions to the}} field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, astrometry, photometry, comet and asteroid discovery to name just a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing deep sky objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and astrophotography of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the design, size, and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers {{do not have access to}} high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford <b>focuser,</b> and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring precision machining.|$|E

40|$|The study {{deals with}} optical {{elements}} formed on layers of liquid photopolymerizing compositions. The work {{is aimed at}} development of new mechanisms of relief formation in layers of liquid photopolymerizing compositions allowing to form an optically smooth microrelief for diffraction optical elements - <b>focusers</b> operating in medium and far IR-band; studying a new mechanism of relief formation. An effect of formation and dark growth of a relief in layers of partially hardened oligoetheracrilates after preliminary irradiation by a light field with a space gradient of intensity is first revealed. Based on the developed liquid photopolymerizing composition high-quality <b>focusers</b> with optically smooth permanently variable microrelief profile for CO 321 -CO 321 -lasers are created. Diffraction efficiency of <b>focusers</b> of CO 321 -lasers is increased, dissipation over their surface is decreased.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare group_focusing and {{individual}} focusing using questionnaire and interview surveys, for clarifying the group_focusing feature. For the first study, 13 of those who experienced group_focusing described the similarities and differences between group_focusing and focusing for the second study, interviews were conducted for three participants from among those who had participated in the first study. They answered the questions of each experience of group_focusing and individual focusing, and were asked to provide reasons for their answers to the abovementioned questions. The following results were obtained : （ 1 ）as compared to focusing <b>focusers</b> had a superficial experience of group_focusing, （ 2 ）The feeling of safety of <b>focusers</b> decreased and the topic was changed for considering others’ existence at group_focusing. New findings of the study suggested that （ 1 ） Group_focusing was a structure that even the focusing beginner could feel the felt sense, and was able to feedback while examining felt sense closely as a listener. （ 2 ）The group_focusing session that nearly provided a sense of daily life easily enabled <b>focusers</b> to get a sense of daily life...|$|R

50|$|A {{dual speed}} <b>focuser</b> can provide two {{focusing}} speeds {{by using a}} set of co-axial knobs, one for fast focusing and another for fine focusing when the film or CCD is near the perfect focal plane. This {{is different from the}} two separate focusing knobs seen on low level microscopes. Another common reason to employ a dual-speed <b>focuser</b> is with the use of short focal length eyepieces, where the depth of focus is short, requiring critically accurate focusing.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} {{case of a}} dual speed <b>focuser</b> is fixed on the telescope tube. Three metal balls are placed 120° apart inside the case in a holder shelf. An input axle penetrates through the hole {{on the center of}} the holder shelf and is pushed and tightened by three surrounding balls. The fine focusing knob connects to the input axle while the fast focusing knob connects to the holder shelf. On the other side, the axle from the Crayford <b>focuser</b> is connected to the holder shelf.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} performance on a context-independent fault diagnosis task and two dimensions of cognitive style: field dependence/independence (D-I) and focusing/scanning (F-S). The effects on diagnosis performance of training {{and the ability of}} both dimensions of style jointly to predict fault-finding ability were considered. The results showed that field independents and <b>focusers</b> were superior fault diagnosticians. Training, in the form of verbal feedback messages, was uniformly effective for the D-I dimension although field independents maintained a superior level of performance, over field dependents. In general, for the F-S dimension, training had little effect on either the <b>focusers</b> or scanners. A combination of scores on the F-S and D-I dimensions significantly enhanced the proportion of the variance in testing efficiency that could be accounted for during fault-finding. Finally it is argued that the F-S and D-I dimensions should be recognized as measures of ability, not style. Future research should be directed at identifying between subject differences on fault diagnosis tasks with reference to theories of information processing...|$|R

50|$|The Crayford <b>focuser</b> is a {{simplified}} focusing mechanism for amateur astronomical telescopes. Crayford focusers are considered superior to entry-level {{rack and pinion}} focusers, normally found {{in this type of}} device. Instead of the rack and pinion, they have a smooth spring-loaded shaft which holds the focus tube against four opposing bearing surfaces, and controls its movement. It is named after the Crayford Manor House Astronomical Society, Crayford, London, England where it was invented by John Wall, a member of the astronomical society which meets there. The original Crayford <b>Focuser</b> is on display there.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, {{variations}} on the Crayford <b>focuser</b> concept have emerged, e.g. a helical Crayford where the drawtube is pressed against four tilted ball bearings, and focusing action is accomplished by rotating the drawtube.|$|E

50|$|Following {{coverage}} of ASCOM in Sky & Telescope magazine several months later, ASCOM architects such as Bob Denny, Doug George, Tim Long, and others later influenced ASCOM into becoming {{a set of}} codified interface standards for freeware device drivers for telescopes, CCD cameras, telescope <b>focusers,</b> and astronomical observatory domes. As a result, amateur robotic telescopes have become increasingly more sophisticated and reliable, while software costs have plunged. ASCOM has also been adopted for some professional robotic telescopes.|$|R

50|$|This {{particular}} {{design is}} also unusual {{in that it}} is a Cassegrain design but has a fixed primary and refractor-style rack-and-pinion <b>focuser</b> which removes the image shift issues seen with other catadioptric designs.|$|E
50|$|A 1:10 {{dual speed}} <b>focuser</b> has {{a gear ratio}} of 10 and R=4.5r. Thus the angular {{velocity}} ratio is actually 11. The gear ratio and velocity ratio {{should not be confused}} with each other.|$|E
50|$|The Crayford {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to a Rack and pinion <b>focuser,</b> but has no teeth on either the rack or the pinion. Instead, a round axle is pressed (for example by a spring-loaded or thumbscrew-tightened piece of PTFE plastic) against a flat {{on the side of}} the <b>focuser</b> drawtube, relying only on friction to move the drawtube as the axle is turned. This also presses the drawtube against a set of four ball bearings against which it moves smoothly with minimal friction. The pressure exerted on the axle can often be adjusted for smoothest operation, and the drawtube may be locked in position to support heavy eyepieces or cameras.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the amateur}} {{astronomy}} field {{there are many}} types of commercial and amateur built telescopes designed for astrophotography labeled [...] "astrographs". Optical designs of amateur astrographs vary widely but include apochromatic refractors, variations of Cassegrain reflectors including Ritchey-Chretien and Dall-Kirkham designs, or Newtonian reflectors. Most optical designs do not produce large, flat, and well-corrected imaging fields and therefore require some type of optical correction by way of field flatteners or coma correctors. Amateur astrographs typically have purpose-built <b>focusers,</b> are constructed of thermally stable materials like carbon fiber and are paired with heavy duty mounts to facilitate accurate tracking of deep sky objects {{for long periods of}} time.|$|R
5000|$|... 3 in. (76.2 mm) - The {{even larger}} barrel size in 3" [...] eyepieces allows for extreme focal lengths and over 120° {{field of view}} eyepieces. The {{disadvantages}} are that these eyepieces are somewhat rare, extremely expensive, up to 5 lbs in weight, and {{that only a few}} telescopes have <b>focusers</b> large enough to accept them. Their huge weight causes balancing issues in Schmidt-Cassegrains under 10 inches, refractors under 5 inches, and reflectors under 16 inches. Also, due to their large field stops, without larger secondary mirrors most reflectors and Schmidt-Cassegrains will have severe vignetting with these eyepieces. Makers of these eyepieces include Explore Scientific and Siebert Optics. Telescopes that can accept these eyepieces are made by Explore Scientific and Orion Telescopes and Binoculars.|$|R
