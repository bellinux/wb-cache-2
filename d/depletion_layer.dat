25|$|In a {{p-channel}} 'depletion-mode' device, {{a positive}} voltage from gate to body creates a <b>depletion</b> <b>layer</b> by forcing the positively charged holes to the gate-insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions. Conversely, in a p-channel 'enhancement-mode' device, a conductive region {{does not exist}} and negative voltage must be used to generate a conduction channel.|$|E
25|$|This {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} exploited by particle detectors to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of electron volts of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is {{deposited in the}} semiconductor material. If the <b>depletion</b> <b>layer</b> {{is large enough to}} catch the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.|$|E
25|$|When the {{transistors}} {{are extremely}} scaled down, {{it is necessary}} to make the gate dielectric layer very thin, around 1nm in state-of-the-art technologies. A phenomenon observed here is the so-called poly depletion, where a <b>depletion</b> <b>layer</b> is formed in the gate polysilicon layer next to the gate dielectric when the transistor is in the inversion. To avoid this problem, a metal gate is desired. A variety of metal gates such as tantalum, tungsten, tantalum nitride, and titanium nitride are used, usually in conjunction with high-κ dielectrics. An alternative is to use fully silicided polysilicon gates, a process known as FUSI.|$|E

30|$|The {{released}} electrons {{return to}} the surface of the ZnO sensor, increasing the width of the <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> on the inner and outer surfaces of ZnO; the width of the conduction channel will increase to D 3, which is larger than D 1. Accordingly, the resistance will decrease (see Fig.  5 c). For ZnO NWs-based gas sensors, the modulation of <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> in the presence of target gas, has been reported in many papers. For instance, Choi et al. [25] reported modulation of <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> in the networked ZnO NWs in the presence of CO gas. Drobek et al. [26] reported modulation of <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> in pristine ZnO and ZnO@ZIF- 8 composite NWs in the presence of some reducing gases. Additionally, for other metal oxide NWs such as SnO 2 NWs [27] and In 2 O 3 NWs [28], the same sensing mechanism has been proposed.|$|R

40|$|Commonly used {{ferroelectric}} perovskites {{are also}} wide-band-gap semiconductors. In such materials, the polarization and the space-charge distribution are intimately coupled, and this Letter studies them simultaneously with no a priori ansatz on either. In particular, we study {{the structure of}} domain walls and the <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> that form at the metal-ferroelectric interfaces. We find the coupling between polarization and space charges leads {{to the formation of}} charge double layers at the 90 ° domain walls, which, like the <b>depletion</b> <b>layers,</b> are also decorated by defects like oxygen vacancies. In contrast, the 180 ° domain walls do not interact with the defects or space charges. Implications of these results to domain switching and fatigue in ferroelectric devices are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract : We {{present a}} method for imaging <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> using the gaseous {{secondary}} electron detector (GSED) employed in environmental scanning electron microscopes. GSED images of a p-np-n junction were obtained from a Si P+PNP+PN power diode.

D 30, 2249 (1997) ]. Optimum imaging conditions are presented, and the contrast behavior is interpreted in terms of a previously unreported induced current component in GSED images. The presented technique is unique as it will enable imaging of <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> in uncoated semiconductor/oxide devices in controlled gaseous environments at elevated specimen temperatures...|$|R

2500|$|In {{this mode}} the diode is often reverse biased (with the cathode driven {{positive}} {{with respect to}} the anode). [...] This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the <b>depletion</b> <b>layer,</b> which decreases the junction's capacitance. The reverse bias also increases the dark current without much change in the photocurrent. For a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the illuminance (and to the irradiance).|$|E

In a long-channel device, {{there is}} no drain voltage dependence of the current once , but as channel length is reduced drain-induced barrier lowering introduces drain voltage dependence that depends in a complex way upon the device geometry (for example, the channel doping, the junction doping and so on). Frequently, threshold voltage Vth for this mode {{is defined as the}} gate voltage at which a selected value of current ID0 occurs, for example, ID0 = 1 μA, which may not be the same Vth-value used in the equations for the following modes.|$|E
2500|$|When {{a voltage}} is applied across a MOS structure, it modifies the {{distribution}} of charges in the semiconductor. If we consider a p-type semiconductor (with [...] the density of acceptors, p the density of holes; p = NA in neutral bulk), a positive voltage, , from gate to body (see figure) creates a <b>depletion</b> <b>layer</b> by forcing the positively charged holes away from the gate–insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions (see doping (semiconductor)).

50|$|Barrier {{lowering}} {{increases as}} channel length is reduced, even at zero applied drain bias, because {{the source and}} drain form pn junctions with the body, and so have associated built-in <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> associated with them that become significant partners in charge balance at short channel lengths, even with no reverse bias applied to increase depletion widths.|$|R

2500|$|A {{semiconductor}} diode's {{behavior in}} a circuit is given by its current–voltage characteristic, or I–V graph (see graph below). The shape of the curve {{is determined by the}} transport of charge carriers through the so-called <b>depletion</b> <b>layer</b> or depletion region that exists at the p–n junction between differing semiconductors. When a p–n junction is first created, conduction-band (mobile) electrons from the N-doped region diffuse into the P-doped region where there is a large population of holes (vacant places for electrons) with which the electrons [...] "recombine". When a mobile electron recombines with a hole, both hole and electron vanish, leaving behind an immobile positively charged donor (dopant) on the N side and negatively charged acceptor (dopant) on the P side. The region around the p–n junction becomes depleted of charge carriers and thus behaves as an insulator.|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis is presented for the stochastic interactions {{of a pair}} of Brownian hard spheres in non-adsorbing polymer solutions. The hard spheres are hypothetically trapped by optical tweezers and allowed for random motion near the trapped positions. The investigation focuses on the long-time correlated Brownian motion. The mobility tensor altered by the polymer depletion effect is computed by the boundary integral method, and the corresponding random displacement is determined by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. From our computations it follows that the presence of <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> around the hard spheres has a significant effect on the hydrodynamic interactions and particle dynamics as compared to pure solvent and pure polymer solution (no depletion) cases. The probability distribution functions of random walks of the two interacting hard spheres that are trapped clearly shifts due to the polymer depletion effect. The results show that the reduction of the viscosity in the <b>depletion</b> <b>layers</b> around the spheres and the entropic force due to the overlapping of depletion zones have a significant influence on the correlated Brownian interactions.
