500|$|Francesca died in 1992, aged two. Gunn {{played a}} match for Norwich against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road just days after his {{daughter}} died; he said of it, [...] "When I ran out, I thought, wow, I could feel the whole stadium was with me. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> packing it in." [...] At {{the end of the}} season, Gunn won Norwich's Player of the Year award, as the club finished third in the Premiership, its highest ever league position.|$|E
2500|$|I {{dropped the}} I-76 or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine {{down into the}} mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. And that was that. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it again {{particularly}} except to get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing, see? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. And it had no significance, see? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesign}} was criticised by {{some for}} having no specifically Welsh symbol (such as the Welsh Dragon), because the Royal Shield {{does not include}} a specifically Welsh symbol. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas, who was also campaigning to have the Welsh Dragon included on the Union Flag, called the omission [...] "disappointing", and stated {{that he would be}} writing to the Queen to request that the Royal Standard be changed to include Wales. The Royal Mint stated that [...] "the Shield of the Royal Arms is symbolic of the whole of the United Kingdom and as such, represents Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland." [...] Designer Dent stated [...] "I am a Welshman and proud of it, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the fact we did not have a dragon or another representation of Wales on the design because as far as I am concerned Wales is represented on the Royal Arms. This was never an issue for me." ...|$|E
60|$|GINGER Was a {{time when}} I didn't. I used to be all for--you know-- larking <b>about.</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> much <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it. Something between both, I think. Brown--not fair, and--and {{not very}} dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Dr. Martineau. [...] "Oddly enough, <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> that {{question}} before. At least, not from this angle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Norman's {{good enough}} for ME," [...] said the daughter, reflecting. [...] "We'll just settle it as Norman. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> that DES." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it, but {{of course}} she is lovely and I'm plain, {{so there is no}} {{possibility}} of comparison between us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it was--I noticed it. Well, it does beat {{all that}} <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body {{can see and}} don't see at the same time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never learned}} how to observe. Of course I know that some matches turn out well and some don't, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Hillmer's own words: [...] "My {{approach}} to architecture was as an art. The approach {{of most other}} architects is as a business. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> how much money I was getting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{shows the}} danger of circumstantial evidence,--and yet without it one never could get at any murder. I'm very glad, you know, that the key and the stick did turn up. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> the coat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, I don't know; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> her fortune if you'll believe me. I {{never even}} remembered that her brother's death would {{in any way}} affect her {{in the way of}} money, until after I left Grey Abbey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I shan't refuse it; {{but what}} I {{mean is that}} <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it when I asked her to have me; and I shouldn't {{have been a bit}} more likely to ask her if she had ten times as much." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him with a merciless steadiness. He drew back a few steps, cowering under her eye. [...] "I can't say," [...] he stammered. [...] "I don't know. What do you mean by these questions? <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the moles afterward; I never looked. She wears her hair low--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] Will said, when the colonel ceased. [...] "I am greatly obliged {{to you for}} your kindness. <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the army, but I am sure that I cannot {{possibly}} do better than accept your kind offer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--about the mill. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> it before, I {{always hated}} it," [...] she cried, {{dropping}} {{the papers and}} suddenly facing him. [...] "It was just drudgery. But now I want to learn everything, all I can, I'd {{like to see the}} machinery." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bel. That's a curse <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> on: Cast <b>about</b> quickly, {{and save}} all yet. Range, quest, and spring a lie immediately! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!--begging your pardon, Miss Snowe, but I {{think you}} are too partial. I like Polly: I like all her ways and all her looks--but then I am her father; and even <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> beauty. She is amusing, fairy-like, {{interesting}} to me;--you must be mistaken in supposing her handsome?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} making an ass of myself," [...] Wilfrid said penitently; [...] "but you believe that I am awfully glad, don't you? I was {{disappointed}} about Bob, but then, you see, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> you. Why, you must know, Mr. Atherton, what I think of you and how I care for you, and how I look up to you. Somehow it never seemed possible {{to me that a}} man like you could fall in love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Wait a while,' says Andy, 'and see {{how things}} turn out. We have taken up too noble a cause to draw out now. Besides, the further I gaze into the retail philanthropy {{business}} the better it looks to me. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> investigating it before. Come {{to think of it}} now,' goes on Andy, 'all the philanthropists I ever knew had plenty of money. I ought to have looked into that matter long ago, and located which was the cause and which was the effect.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{very first}} National Public Radio show that I worked on was Joe Frank's. I think I was {{influenced}} {{in a huge}} way... Before I saw Joe put together a show, <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> radio {{as a place where}} you could tell a certain kind of story.|$|R
6000|$|... "My boy?" [...] {{the student}} {{repeated}} in tones of surprise. [...] "Oh, yes; Edgar, of course. What am I {{going to do}} with him? Well, <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it. Does he want anything? My housekeeper always sees to that. Do you think that he wants a nurse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{it might}} be," [...] {{answered}} the other, quite innocently and gravely; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> the story <b>about</b> Atlantis was very solidly established." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I am {{almost a}} woman, Terence, but I don't feel so. You see out here girls often marry at sixteen. I know father said once {{that he hoped}} I shouldn't marry until I was eighteen, and {{that he wanted to}} keep me young. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> getting almost a woman until the bishop told me one day that if I chose to marry a señor that he would choose for me, he would get me {{absolution}} from my vows, and that I need not then resign my property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I do not, sir; I {{have been}} {{thinking}} all the morning. I had nursed them {{two or three times}} during the night, and of course had changed their position then. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> their having the same night-gowns on. If I had, of course I should have been more careful, for I have said to my husband {{over and over again that}} it was only by their clothes that I should know them apart, for if they had been twins they could not be more alike.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{hit in the}} arm. I can't tell {{much about}} it. I only know that I went slap down; and there is {{certainly}} something the matter with my shoulder. Like an idiot I did not take shelter as you told me, but I was watching you so anxiously <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it. If I {{had not been a}} fool I should have jumped up and got under cover at once; but I fancy I must have knocked my head as I fell. At any rate, I did not think about moving till I heard those two shots." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} album, Listen, {{includes}} much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as “percussion sonnets”. “The first couple albums <b>I</b> made <b>I</b> <b>never</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> rhythms, <b>I</b> {{focused on the}} recording and the lyrics”, Pritchard said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Arabella, Arabella; {{you be a}} deep one! Mistaken! well, that's clever--it's a real {{stroke of}} genius! It is a thing <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> o', wi' all my experience! <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> beyond {{bringing}} <b>about</b> the real thing--not that one could sham it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} I could have been so excited over a race between two horses," [...] she said to Mrs. Hunter; [...] "it was not the bets, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> even <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> them--it was just because I wanted to see Mr. Prothero's horse win. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> {{understood}} before why people should take such an interest in horse racing, but I quite understand now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know about}} it now," [...] said Dan, finally. [...] "I pumped {{it out of the}} eminent legal lights that turned over to me poor old dad's {{collections}} of bonds and boodle. It amounts to $2,000,000, Ken. And I am told that he squeezed it out of the chaps that pay their pennies for loaves of bread at little bakeries around the corner. You've studied economics, Dan, and you know all about monopolies, and the masses, and octopuses, and the rights of laboring people. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> those things before. Football and trying to be white to my fellow-man were about the extent of my college curriculum.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So I {{think it}} will come to my doing my work on Norfolk Island just as usual, with only {{occasional}} inconvenience or discomfort. But I think I shall have to forego {{some of the more}} risky and adventurous part of the work in the islands. This is all right. It is a sign that the time is come for me to delegate it to others. I don't mean that I shall not take the voyages, and stop about on the islands (D.V.) as before. But I must do it all more carefully, and avoid much that of old <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about.</b> Yet I {{think it will}} not, as a matter of fact, much interfere with my work.|$|E
60|$|I went to Australia {{to go into}} {{hospital}} and get tinkered up, after which I planned {{to go on with}} the voyage. And during the long weeks I lay in hospital, from the first day I never missed alcohol. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it. I knew I should have it again when I was on my feet. But when I regained my feet I was not cured of my major afflictions. Naaman's silvery skin was still mine. The mysterious sun-sickness, which the experts of Australia could not fathom, still ripped and tore my tissues. Malaria still festered in me and put me on my back in shivering delirium at the most unexpected moments, compelling me to cancel a double lecture tour which had been arranged.|$|E
30|$|Before {{beginning}} this study, <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> probing my students’ views about ethics and utility in science. After my students brought up ethical issues during their interviews, I thought that I should also consider ethics when re-designing the course. An interviewee in her pre-interview {{said that one}} feature of SP is to follow the proper ethical rules. I {{thought that she was}} right and that I ought to discuss this issue during my teaching.|$|R
500|$|Appearing on Nikita {{would be}} Q's first {{television}} role. During {{an interview with}} IGN, Q explained {{that she had not}} been on television before [...] "not because I didn't want to. <b>I</b> just <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] adding [...] "When this came up, everything just felt right. I knew McG and when Wonderland came on he was like, 'This is you, we're not doing this without you.' and I went 'That's very sweet!' So it felt right." ...|$|R
60|$|I was too angry {{to return}} to the cabin, and paced up and down the cold deck biting my lips with vexation. I had so {{expressly}} stipulated with the agents that no captain's wife was to come along. The last thing under the sun I desired in the pet quarters of a ship was a woman. But <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> a captain's daughter. For two cents I was ready to throw the voyage over and return on the tug to Baltimore.|$|R
