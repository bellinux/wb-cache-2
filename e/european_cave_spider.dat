50|$|There is no endemic faunal {{species in}} the cave. Common animals present include a {{subspecies}} of flatworm (Platyhelminthes) and black-colored molluscs, observed in the section between the entrance and the siphon. Blind <b>cave</b> millipedes (Diplopoda), <b>European</b> <b>cave</b> <b>spiders</b> (Meta menardi) and cave bats (Myotis velifer) are the other animals found in this section. No animals have been observed beyond the siphon. The pools formed by the subterranean river are habitat for fish the size of 10 - 15 cm.|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{suitable}} area to spiders where to lay eggs is promoted in terms of Darwinian fitness. Despite its importance, the underlying factors behind this key decision are generally poorly understood. Here, we designed a multidisciplinary study based both on in-field data and laboratory experiments focusing on the <b>European</b> <b>cave</b> <b>spider</b> Meta menardi (Araneae, Tetragnathidae) and aiming at understanding the selective forces driving the female {{in the choice of}} the depositional area. Our in-field data analysis demonstrated a major role of air velocity and distance from the cave entrance within a particular cave in driving the female choice. This has been interpreted using a model based on the Entropy Generation Minimization - EGM - method, without invoking best fit parameters and thanks to independent lab experiments, thus demonstrating that the female chooses the depositional area according to minimal level of thermo-fluid-dynamic irreversibility. This methodology may pave the way to a novel approach in understanding evolutionary strategies for other living organisms...|$|E

The other species being the very similar Carrai <b>cave</b> <b>spider</b> (Progradungula carraiensis). They can be distinguished from the latter by the presence of a single jutting structure (process) on the syringe-like copulatory organ (embolus) of the bulb on the male pedipalps, in contrast to two in Carrai <b>cave</b> <b>spiders.</b> Female odd-clawed spiders also have eight sperm receptacles (spermathecae) on their genitals (epigyne), in contrast to six in the Carrai <b>cave</b> <b>spiders.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Tooth <b>Cave</b> <b>spider</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1974 by Willis J. Gertsch, as Leptoneta myopica. At {{the time it}} was only known from Tooth Cave in Travis County, Texas, 15 miles northwest of Austin. The specific name myopica is from the Greek myopia, [...] "nearsighted". In 1977, Paolo Brignoli transferred the species to the genus Neoleptoneta. A 2011 phylogenetic study of Neoleptoneta and other North American genera in the family Leptonetidae showed that Neoleptoneta was not monophyletic. Several new genera were erected, including Tayshaneta, to which the Tooth <b>Cave</b> <b>spider</b> was transferred, as Tayshaneta myopica.|$|R
