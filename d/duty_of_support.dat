50|$|The court held, accordingly, {{that there}} was a {{differentiation}} in the Act, but that it did not amount to an infringement of the right to equality. This decision was based on the fact that, during a marriage, the parties have a reciprocal <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> but there is no such duty accorded to the unmarried. The aim of the legislation was not to encompass the unmarried. Accordingly, the court could not require the imposition of an obligation on a deceased estate where there is no such obligation on the deceased when he is alive.|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} {{that had to}} be considered was whether this rule of succession unfairly discriminated between persons on grounds of sex or gender, and was in conflict with the provisions of section 8 of the Interim Constitution. It was common cause that, in rural areas where this customary rule most frequently found its application, the devolution of the deceased's property unto the male heir involved a concomitant <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and protection of the woman or women to whom he was married by customary law, and of the children procreated under that system and belonging to a particular house. A widow in particular might remain at the deceased's homestead and continue to use the estate property, and the heir could not eject her at his whim.|$|E
50|$|In 1910, the National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws {{approved}} the Uniform Desertion and Non-Support Act. The act {{made it a}} punishable offense for a husband to desert, willfully neglect or refuse {{to provide for the}} support and maintenance of his wife in destitute or necessitous circumstances, or for a parent to fail in the same duty to his child less than 16 years of age. The 1910 act sought to improve the enforcement of the duties of support, but it did not take into account husbands and fathers who fled the jurisdiction. With the increasing mobility of the population, welfare departments had to support the destitute families because the extradition process was inefficient and often unsuccessful. In 1950, The National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws published the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA). The Commission stated that, “The purposes of this act are to improve and extend by reciprocal legislation the enforcement of duties of support and to make uniform the law with respect thereto.”URESA sought to enforce the provisions in two ways: criminal enforcement and civil enforcement. The criminal enforcement relied upon the obligee state demanding that the obligor state extradite the obligor to the obligee state, or for the obligor to submit himself/herself to the jurisdiction of the obligee state. The civil enforcement relied upon a system where the obligee would initiate proceedings in his/her state. The initiating state would determine if the obligor had a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> If the initiating court held that the obligor had a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> the initiating court would forward the case to the obligor’s state. The responding state, which would have personal jurisdiction over the obligor, would provide notice and a hearing for obligor. After this hearing, the responding court would enforce the support order.|$|E
50|$|There are, {{the court}} noted, other {{instances}} where a rule differentiates {{between men and}} women, but which no right-minded person considers to be unfairly discriminatory: for example, the provision of separate toilet facilities. It followed that, even if this rule of succession were prima facie discriminatory {{on the grounds of}} sex or gender, and the presumption contained in section 8(4) of the Interim Constitution were to come into operation, this presumption had been refuted by the concomitant <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> The rights conferred by this customary rule were not inconsistent with the fundamental rights contained in chapter 3 of the Interim Constitution and the injunction found in section 33(3) could accordingly be implemented: namely, to construe the chapter {{in such a way as}} not to negate those rights.|$|E

40|$|The {{one of the}} {{principles}} of the Public Assistance Act is the supplementary nature of welfare (Public Assistance Act, Article 4). "Duty of kinship support," in terms of the receipt of public assistance, was established (National Assistance Act Article 4 Clause 2) on the assumption that "any support given by a person responsible for support prescribed by the Civil Code (Act No. 89 of 1896) and any assistance prescribed by any other Act shall be provided in precedence to public assistance under this Act". Today 2 ̆ 7 s applicants for welfare face greatly changed conditions in terms <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> kinship <b>support,</b> and family social and economic environment to when the Public Assistance Act was enacted in 1950. Nevertheless, administrative guidance for the enforcement <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> kinship <b>support</b> for the receipt of welfare dates from that time. However, 60 years have now passed since the enactment of the Public Assistance Act and, due to the conditions imposed by the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> kinship <b>support</b> for the receipt of welfare, the welfare administrators faces various problems and various difficulties arise in their response to welfare applicants. In this study I discuss the deficiency in the supplementary nature <b>of</b> welfare in <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> kinship <b>support</b> from three standpoints: 1) changes in family structure, 2) changes in the public attitude to kinship support and 3) the obsolete nature of the welfare office 2 ̆ 7 s handling <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> kinship <b>support.</b> As a result, in order to adapt to today 2 ̆ 7 s family situation and public awareness, I emphasize the necessity of changing of the notion "duty of kinship support" to that of" <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> life preservation" when dealing with the receipt of welfare...|$|R

5000|$|The {{status quo}} {{is that none of}} the {{consequences}} of legal marriage is automatically conferred on an opposite-sex domestic partnership. There is, however, some statutory recognition in the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, and judicial recognition in the form of Volks v Robinson, which concerned {{a man and a woman}} who had lived together in a permanent life partnership. When he died, she lodged a claim for maintenance against his estate in terms of the Maintenance Act but was rejected by the executor. Having never married him, she did not fit the Act's definition of [...] "survivor." [...] It was requested of the court that it read-in partners in domestic partnerships or alternatively declare unconstitutional the relevant provision for its unjustifiable discrimination and its violation of the right to dignity. Handed down before the passage of the Civil Union Act, the majority judgment found that there had been no <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> while the man had been alive, so there should be no duty for maintenance by his estate following his death.|$|E
40|$|P a g e | 2 Maintenance law in South Africa {{is based}} on the {{existence}} of the common law concept of the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> between dependant parties. As a result of this <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> parents are obliged to support their children whilst they are unable to support themselves. This is a right of all children. There has been a constant evolution of the scope of the common law concept of <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> through both case law, and legislation, culminating in the Maintenance Act 99 of 1998. However, due to structural and procedural issues tied to the implementation of the Act, children's rights often go unprotected, particularly in cases where members of the public enter and engage in the maintenance system unrepresented. This dissertation aims to identify and address many of the problems encountered by maintenance court users on a daily basis. Specific reference is made to the experiences of the unrepresented public in the Eastern Cape Province, where research was conducted.

5000|$|There is a {{proposed}} amendment to section 1 of the Intestate Succession Act, {{which will include}} partners in a permanent same-sex life partnership in which the partners have undertaken reciprocal <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> {{in the definition of}} “spouse.” The amendment of the Act, it has been argued, is ill-advised. The memorandum to the Amendment Bill cites Gory v Kolver as authority, but {{it has been suggested that}} the situation which prevailed at the time that this case was heard no longer exists, due to the advent of the Civil Union Act. The decision in Gory v Kolver case was predicated on the fact that the parties were not able to formalise their relationship in any way. On the evidence, the parties had undertaken mutual <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Had it been possible for them to do so, they would almost certainly have formaised their relationship. Were the parties in that situation presently, they would have the option of formalising their relationship under the Civil Union Act. The survivor would be considered a [...] "spouse" [...] for the purposes of the Intestate Succession Act. The net effect of the proposed amendment, it has been argued, is that it elevates same-sex partnerships to a level superior to that of heterosexual life partnerships.|$|R

40|$|The Supreme Court's Guidelines of Dec. 16, 1987 {{encourage}} {{to examine}} once again some basic {{questions concerning the}} duty of alimony between the divorced spouses. The analysis of the Guidelines is preceded by the presentation of main views expressed in Polish legal writings with respect to ex-spouses' support obligations. Thus, the author distinguishes four groups of problems: 1) Attention should {{be focused on the}} question about the source of support obligations between the ex-spouses. Some authors maintain that such a source should be seen in the very fact of divorce. However, the author subscribes to a prevailing view that the source of the divorced spouses' duty of alimony is their former marriage. The Guidelines support the latter view. 2) Related to the above is the question whether there exists a marital <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> during the marriage. The author answers in the affirmative. He analyses the marital duty of contribution to the support of the family, (Art. 27 of the Family and Guardianship Code) referring frequently to other views expressed in legal writings. 3) According to Art. 60 of the Family and Guardianship Code, a distinction should be made between a regular and qualified <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> A qualified <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> (Art. 60 § 2 of the Family and Guardianship Code) is vested in a spouse considered to be solely guilty of the breakdown of marriage. The author analyses the premises of a qualified <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> In his opinion, the Guidelines have shed light on some important matters. The most important was the explanation of the statutory formula that the innocent spouse, whose material situation deteriorated considerably in consequence of the divorce, may demand that the solely guilty spouse should contribute to the satisfaction of the justified needs of the innocent spouse, even though the latter is not in poverty. 4) In the last part of his article the author considers the premisses of prolonging the 5 -year-period of the duty of alimony between innocent spouses (Art. 60 § 3 of the Family and Guardianship Code). 3 Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} basic {{aspects of}} cohabitation without {{marriage in the}} light of family law. In Poland, the problems of cohabitation without marriage are not dealt with by family law instruments. Most issues are resolved on a civil law basis. Besides, the Supreme Court has several times held that even a mutatis mutandis application of family law provisions to cohabitees is not allowed. However, {{it does not mean that}} family law is entirely excluded from the regulation of relations arising in the marriage-like families. In particular, if the cohabiting couple has their own children, the relations between the children and their parents are regulated by means of family law provisions. It is worth stressing that in Polish law children born out of wedlock enjoy all inheritance and maintenance right towards their unmarried fathers; in turn, such fathers have full parental authority (with some exceptions) over their natural children. The other issue of importance in connection with marriagelike unions is that of the influence of cohabitation on the duty to pay alimony vested in a former spouse of one of the cohabitees. Generally, cohabitation does not lead to an automatic termination of the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> However, it may be considered one of the circumstances the existence of which may lead to the modification of the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> or - in some extreme cases - to the termination of such a duty. Finally, cohabitation does not have any direct influence on the duty of one of the cohabitees to pay alimony to his or her former spouse.
