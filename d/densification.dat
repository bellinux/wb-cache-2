5|$|Jolin was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for the architectural and aesthetic preservation of the capital, as is written in his draft for a pamphlet called Mot strömmen (Against the Tide). According to him, Stockholm had become an ugly town, by insensitive mixing of styles, <b>densification,</b> and centuries of eager renovation. Jolin wanted {{to bring out the}} beautiful and the genuine in the cityscape, as well as restore, what he considered to be distorted parts of the city, to their former glory. According to Palmgren, perhaps it was that dream Jolin expressed in his depictions of Stockholm. At the end of the 19th century, and during some decades into the 20th century, artists depicted Stockholm in a variety of ways, each according to his own mind and individualism. Traditionalists worked side by side with Modernists, old with young, seasoned pursuers of the established view of the city and young enthusiastic individuals, such as Jolin. By the middle of the 20th century, his focus shifted from the cityscape to other motifs such as chinoiserie settings, but in his youth, he and his friends from his years in Paris found inspiration in Stockholm and its surroundings.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, {{a thermal}} treatment, or firing process, is often {{necessary}} in order to favor further polycondensation and enhance mechanical properties and structural stability via final sintering, <b>densification</b> and grain growth. One of the distinct advantages of using this methodology as opposed to the more traditional processing techniques is that <b>densification</b> is often achieved at a much lower temperature.|$|E
25|$|In addition, any {{fluctuations}} in packing density in the compact {{as it is}} prepared for the kiln are often amplified during the sintering process, yielding heterogeneous <b>densification.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{upgraded}} Falcon 9 rocket {{is currently}} the only space launch system that uses densified propellants. SpaceX successfully re-introduced this technology with the aforementioned Flight 20. Before, propellant <b>densification</b> had been used only on some ICBMs, which {{are no longer in}} service, and the (unsuccessful) Soviet lunar rocket N1.|$|E
25|$|Some pores {{and other}} {{structural}} defects associated with density variations {{have been shown}} to play a detrimental role in the sintering process by growing and thus limiting end-point densities. Differential stresses arising from heterogeneous <b>densification</b> have also been shown to result in the propagation of internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws.|$|E
25|$|Methods to {{mitigate}} the effects of soil liquefaction have been devised by earthquake engineers and include various soil compaction techniques such as vibro compaction (compaction of the soil by depth vibrators), dynamic compaction, and vibro stone columns. These methods result in the <b>densification</b> of soil and enable buildings to withstand soil liquefaction.|$|E
25|$|When {{solid biomass}} {{is already in}} a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the <b>densification</b> type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce wood pellets, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure wood product. The other types of <b>densification</b> are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with {{a broad range of}} input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.|$|E
25|$|Removal of the {{remaining}} liquid (solvent) phase requires a drying process, which is typically accompanied by {{a significant amount of}} shrinkage and <b>densification.</b> The rate at which the solvent can be removed is ultimately determined by the distribution of porosity in the gel. The ultimate microstructure of the final component will clearly be strongly influenced by changes imposed upon the structural template during this phase of processing.|$|E
25|$|The German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) and the Viceministry of Electricity and Alternative Energy {{recently}} {{signed an agreement}} to execute a Project for Network <b>Densification</b> in rural areas.

To facilitate the access to electricity, the Viceministry and GIZ will provide a US$20 subsidy per household to enable their connection to the existing network.|$|E
25|$|However, {{increased}} {{housing prices}} have also caused significant {{positive changes in}} East Vancouver, such as greater retention of existing residents (partly {{due to a lack}} of affordability in some other areas), increased <b>densification</b> (increasing the number of affordable housing options (e.g. townhouses)), more residential investment, neighbourhood-led artistic projects, more community-pride events (e.g. neighbourhood clean-ups, block parties and community gardening), and greater tax base for new amenities(e.g. a new planned library and $2.7 million in street, lighting and sidewalk improvements at Kingsway and Knight Street).|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{has recently}} adopted smart growth principles to guide its future development. The official {{plan calls for}} <b>densification</b> and infill of existing urban land, rather than acquiring more rural land. A near-doubling of Embrun's population will be accomplished in the next 10–15 years with only two new neighbourhoods (both in land already designated as urban land use zones) being built. The {{rest of the population}} growth will be done by building housing units in the open spaces between existing neighbourhoods, and by eventually replacing single-family homes on some busier streets with apartments and condos. Through this plan, Embrun's population will increase from its current population of around 6,000 people to upwards of 10,000 people in 2021, with only a small amount of land to the west being added to the urban zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{relaxation of}} a viscoelastic gel {{has been identified}} as primary mechanism responsible for <b>densification</b> and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the viscoelastic properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their viscoelastic properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the autocorrelation function near the point of gelation.|$|E
500|$|The first {{systematic}} {{study of}} snow and firn layers was by Ernst Sorge, {{who was part of}} the Alfred Wegener Expedition to central Greenland in 1930–1931. [...] Sorge dug a 15m pit to examine the snow layers, and his results were later formalized into Sorge's Law of <b>Densification</b> by Henri Bader, who went on to do additional coring work in northwest Greenland in 1933. [...] In the early 1950s, a SIPRE expedition took pit samples over much of the Greenland ice sheet, obtaining early oxygen isotope ratio data. [...] Three other expeditions in the 1950s began ice coring work: a joint Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE), in Queen Maud Land in Antarctica; the Juneau Ice Field Research Project (JIRP), in Alaska; and Expéditions Polaires Françaises, in central Greenland. [...] Core quality was poor, but some scientific work was done on the retrieved ice.|$|E

2500|$|A new Rural Electrification Decree was {{approved}} in 2005 (...) [...] This new decree aims at increasing rural access through the extension and <b>densification</b> of electric networks, development {{of renewable energy}} and {{a change in the}} energy mix (substitution of diesel by natural gas, biomass and other renewable energies) and an increase in distribution capacity. The Rural Electrification Decree and its associated regulatory framework encourages stakeholders in the energy sector to establish partnerships with other government agencies to implement the rural electrification plan. An agreement between the Ministry of Public Works, Services and Housing and the Ministry of Education will allow for the installation of solar PV systems in rural areas in conjunction with the literacy program, “I can” (Yo, sí puedo). Under the pilot phase, 500 solar panels are expected to be installed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{area was}} first {{inhabited}} by the Coast Salish people, including the Kwikwetl'em people. The first European settlers began farming beside the Pitt River in 1859. A major impetus {{to the creation}} of a municipality was when the Canadian Pacific Railway moved its freight terminus from Vancouver to [...] "Westminster Junction", where a spur line branched off to the Fraser River port of New Westminster in 1911. Port Coquitlam was first incorporated as a municipality on March 7, 1913. Port Coquitlam was originally mostly farmland; however, because of the <b>densification</b> and expansion of Vancouver, it has now become mostly suburban housing, especially in the northern and southwestern areas of the city. The economy has diversified with a variety of industrial and commercial developments, including metal fabrication, high technology industries, and transportation.|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{recognition}} of urban stream syndrome in the 1960s resulted in some movement towards holistic stormwater management in Australia. Awareness increased greatly during the 1990s with the Federal government and scientists cooperating through the Cooperative Research Centre program. Increasingly city planners have recognised {{the need for}} an integrated management approach to potable, waste and stormwater management, to enable cities to adapt and become resilient to the pressure which [...] population growth, urban <b>densification</b> and climate change places on ageing and increasingly expensive water infrastructure. Additionally, Australia's arid conditions means it is [...] particularly vulnerable to climate change, which together with its reliance on surface water sources, combined {{with one of the most}} severe droughts (from 2000–2010) since European settlement, [...] highlight the fact that major urban centres face increasing water shortages. This has begun shifting the perception of stormwater runoff from strictly a liability and nuisance to that of having value as a water resource resulting in changing stormwater management practices.|$|E
2500|$|Late 20th {{century and}} early 21st century Finland has {{witnessed}} greater {{consolidation of the}} greater capital region, Helsinki-Espoo-Vantaa. Helsinki, unable to expand outwards due to being hemmed in to the coastline by the neighbouring cities (formerly rural counties) of Espoo and Vantaa, has adopted planning policies of increased urban <b>densification,</b> also argued for under a policy of sustainable development and [...] "green building", but also de-industrialisation, that is, moving industrial concerns away from the shorelines in proximity to the city centre, which are then redeveloped for generally up-market housing. A good example is the shoreline-facing housing development on Katajanokka, Helsinki, by Nurmela-Raimoranta-Tasa architects (2006). Significant earlier planning policies that effected urban growth were the construction of three ring roads {{as well as the}} construction of a Helsinki Metro system, begun in 1982, which in turn had been reactions to a 1968 plan by the American-Finnish firm Smith-Polivinen to drive wide freeways through the centre of Helsinki. The Metro already extends into Eastern Helsinki, and is due (2014–15) to extend into Espoo, with new growth nodes being planned around the new stations. This already occurred within the boundaries of Helsinki in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the prime example being the construction of the Itäkeskus (east centre), with the metro station integrated into a shopping centre and adjacent library and swimming hall, the most significant architectural work of the ensemble being the main shopping mall and 82-metre-tall tower (1987) by Erkki Kairamo (Gullichsen Kairamo Vormala Architects), an architect much influenced by 1920s and 30s Russian Constructivist architecture. The former industrial, dockyard and shipbuilding areas of Helsinki are being replaced by new housing areas, designed mostly in a minimalist-functionalist style as well as new support services such as kindergartens and schools (which, for the sake of efficiency, are also intended for use as neighbourhood communal facilities; e.g. Opinmäki School and multipurpose centre [...] by Esa Ruskeepää), as well allowing for large-scale shopping malls (e.g. the new districts of Ruoholahti, Arabianranta, Vuosaari, Hernesaari, Hanasaari, Jätkäsaari and Kalasatama), projects often driven forward by architecture and urban planning competitions. Another major landmark in urban planning and architecture was the creation, on the basis of an 1995 architectural competition, of the eco-district of Viikki (plan by Petri Laaksonen), adjacent to a new campus for the University of Helsinki. Other major cities, in particular Lahti, Tampere, Oulu and Turku are adopting similar strategies as the Greater Helsinki region, while also developing more efficient rail and road systems within these networks, while also promoting extensive bicycle path networks.|$|E

5000|$|Today, modern {{vehicles}} {{widely known}} as amphirols, perform specialised {{tasks such as}} compacting tailings from industrial processes. The advantage of these machines to tailings <b>densification</b> is by way of providing a means to allow water or process liquor to run off without repulping the profile. This approach subsequently largely negates the impact of rainfall on <b>densification</b> and dewatering. However, the lighter, faster machines are better suited to marginal terrain access, but not <b>densification</b> due to repulping and their limited penetration depth.

50|$|Sintering in {{practice}} is {{the control of}} both <b>densification</b> and grain growth. <b>Densification</b> is the act of reducing porosity in a sample thereby making it more dense. Grain growth {{is the process of}} grain boundary motion and Ostwald ripening to increase the average grain size. Many properties (mechanical strength, electrical breakdown strength, etc.) benefit from both a high relative density and a small grain size. Therefore, being able to control these properties during processing is of high technical importance. Since <b>densification</b> of powders requires high temperatures, grain growth naturally occurs during sintering. Reduction of this process is key for many engineering ceramics.|$|E
