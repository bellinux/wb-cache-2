5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, {{she would have been}} the largest German aircraft carrier, longer <b>even</b> <b>than</b> the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|He {{could be}} charming or vulgar, {{ebullient}} or sullen, {{he was given}} to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But whatever he was, however he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or <b>even</b> <b>than</b> most of his foreign counterparts, and {{for much of the}} world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon radically changed this picture. By measuring Charon's orbital period, astronomers could accurately calculate Pluto's mass for the first time, which they found to be much smaller than expected. Pluto's mass was roughly one twenty-fifth of Mercury's, making it by far the smallest planet, smaller <b>even</b> <b>than</b> the Earth's Moon, although it was still over ten times as massive as the largest asteroid, Ceres.|$|E

5|$|The early anti-smoking {{campaign}} {{was considered a}} failure, and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany. The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster <b>even</b> <b>than</b> in neighboring France, where the anti-tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential. Between 1932 and 1939, per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year, while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630.|$|E
5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition {{meant more}} to Floyd <b>even</b> <b>than</b> trade advantages and justice; {{it was another}} step in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political plexus which had {{made it impossible for}} one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, without creating a corresponding movement in each of the others. He was tired of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, the hurricane's {{impact was}} {{extremely}} severe: the storm destroyed {{nearly a hundred}} ships and likely killed hundreds of individuals across the island, and also inflicted extensive crop damage and widespread flooding. The hurricane capsized nearly all crafts docked at Havana Harbor, and of the 104boats in the harbor prior to the storm's arrival, only 12remained after it subsided. Between 40and 50other cargo vessels were impaired, with significant structural damage in the city proper also observed. Damage to houses, crops, and shipping was catastrophic throughout the island; the storm was reportedly the worst in Cuban history at the time, more severe <b>even</b> <b>than</b> an earlier hurricane in 1844. Waves were high enough to reach the lanterns of the Morro Castle lighthouse. While no concrete death toll was established, reports indicated the deaths of several dozen individuals during the entire course of the storm, while other records noted that hundreds of deaths had possibly occurred across the island.|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} most Afro-Cuban musical forms {{lie in the}} cabildos, self-organized social clubs for the African slaves, {{separate}} cabildos for separate cultures. The cabildos were formed mainly from four groups: the Yoruba (the Lucumi in Cuba); the Congolese (Palo in Cuba); Dahomey (the Fon or Arará). Other cultures were undoubtedly present, more <b>even</b> <b>than</b> listed above, but in smaller numbers, {{and they did not}} leave such a distinctive presence.|$|E

25|$|Bolder <b>even</b> <b>than</b> Riemann, Clifford confessed {{his belief}} (1870) that matter {{is only a}} manifestation of {{curvature}} in a space-time manifold. This embryonic divination has been acclaimed as an anticipation of Einstein’s (1915–16) relativistic theory of the gravitational field. The actual theory, however, bears but slight resemblance to Clifford’s rather detailed creed. As a rule, those mathematical prophets who never descend to particulars make the top scores. Almost anyone can hit {{the side of a}} barn at forty yards with a charge of buckshot.|$|E
25|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of people manifested in Chișinău at the call of the Justice and Truth Platform. According to police, between 35,000 and 40,000 people attended the demonstration, while organizers estimated around 100,000 participants. The protest was the biggest since Moldova's independence movement in the early 1990s, bigger <b>even</b> <b>than</b> the mass anti-communist protests of April 2009. Participants adopted a resolution demanding early elections, the resignation of President Nicolae Timofti and all leading institutions of law, including the Prosecutor General's office and the National Anticorruption Center.|$|E
25|$|Earl Wilson was the team's No. 3 pitcher, going 13–12 for {{the season}} with a 2.85 ERA. Known {{as one of the best}} power hitters of all time among major league pitchers, Wilson hit seven home runs in 88 at-bats in 1968. Wilson's at bat-to-home run ratio of 12.57 was higher than any player in the major leagues in 1968 — higher <b>even</b> <b>than</b> home run leaders Frank Howard and Willie Horton. Wilson was the losing pitcher in Game 3 of the World Series, {{allowing}} 10 baserunners and three earned runs in 4 innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|Acute bleeds often develop {{after high}} speed {{acceleration}} or deceleration injuries and are increasingly severe with larger hematomas. They are most severe if associated with cerebral contusions. Though {{much faster than}} chronic subdural bleeds, acute subdural bleeding is usually venous and therefore slower than the typically arterial bleeding of an epidural hemorrhage. Acute subdural bleeds have a high mortality rate, higher <b>even</b> <b>than</b> epidural hematomas and diffuse brain injuries, because the force (acceleration/deceleration) required to cause them causes other severe injuries as well. The mortality rate associated with acute subdural hematoma is around 60 to 80%.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the Tărtăria tablets in Romania by Nicolae Vlassa in 1961 reignited the debate. Vlassa believed the inscriptions to be pictograms and other items found {{at the same place}} were subsequently carbon-dated to before 4000 BC (the tablets themselves cannot be dated by physical or chemical methods), thirteen hundred years earlier than the date he expected, and earlier <b>even</b> <b>than</b> the writing systems of the Sumerians and Minoans. However, the authenticity of these tablets is disputed. To date, more than a thousand fragments with similar inscriptions have been found on various archaeological sites throughout south-eastern Europe, notably in Greece (Dispilio Tablet), Bulgaria, Romania, eastern Hungary, Moldova, and southern Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Krugman {{published}} The Conscience of a Liberal, whose title {{refers to}} Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative. It details {{the history of}} wealth and income gaps in the United States in the 20th century. The book describes how the {{gap between rich and}} poor declined greatly in middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher <b>even</b> <b>than</b> in the 1920s. In Conscience, Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.|$|E
