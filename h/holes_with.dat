5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving their nest during {{the early hours of the}} day. Banded sugar ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Meat ants sometimes attract cats because of the chemicals they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin).|$|E

40|$|We present firstly a four-dimensional spherical {{symmetric}} black <b>hole</b> <b>with</b> small Weyl corrections {{and find}} that with increasing Weyl corrections {{the region of the}} event horizon existence for the black hole in the parameter space increases for the negative Weyl coupling parameter and decreases for the positive one. Moreover, we also obtain a rotating charged black <b>hole</b> <b>with</b> weak Weyl corrections by the method of complex coordinate transformation. Our results show that the sign of Weyl coupling parameter α yields the different spatial topology of the event horizons for the black <b>hole</b> <b>with</b> its parameters lied in some special regions in the parameter space. We also analyze the dependence of the ergosphere on the Weyl coupling parameter α {{and find that}} with the increase of the Weyl corrections the ergosphere in the equatorial plane becomes thick for a black <b>hole</b> <b>with</b> α> 0, but becomes thin in the case with α< 0, which means that the energy extraction become easier in the background of a black <b>hole</b> <b>with</b> the positive Weyl coupling parameter, but more difficult in the background of a black <b>hole</b> <b>with</b> the negative one.

These leafhoppers were attacked, suggesting no symbiotic relationship between the two.|$|E
5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Monica Guica, Thomas Hartman, Wei Song, and Andrew Strominger {{showed that}} the ideas of AdS/CFT could {{nevertheless}} be used to understand certain astrophysical black holes. More precisely, their results apply to black holes that are approximated by extremal Kerr black holes, which have the largest possible angular momentum compatible with a given mass. They showed that such black holes have an equivalent description in terms of conformal field theory. The Kerr/CFT correspondence was later extended to black <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> lower angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mission of}} the 96th was {{patching}} Jackson Drome's runways after Japanese bombing, but they also assisted with refuelling aircraft and loading them with bombs, and unloading ships in the harbour. It was found that craters could not be repaired simply by filling the <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> rubble. This would quickly fill with water, settle, and become a bog hole. A proper repair required that the water be pumped out, and the crater filled with stone, {{which had to be}} compacted, rolled and re-surfaced. In addition to the craters, bombing sprayed fragments over the runways that could cause punctures and blowouts in airplane tyres, resulting in accidents on takeoff and landing. A visual search for fragments had to be made after each bombing raid.|$|E
5|$|When mass is {{concentrated}} into a sufficiently compact region of space, general relativity predicts {{the formation of}} a black hole– a region of space with a gravitational effect so strong that not even light can escape. Certain types of black holes are thought to be the final state in the evolution of massive stars. On the other hand, supermassive black <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> the mass of millions or billions of Suns are assumed to reside in the cores of most galaxies, and they {{play a key role in}} current models of how galaxies have formed over the past billions of years.|$|E

5|$|Whenever {{the ratio}} of an object's mass to its radius becomes {{sufficiently}} large, general relativity predicts {{the formation of a}} black hole, a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses, and stellar black <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> a few to a few dozen solar masses, are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars. Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center, and its presence is thought to have {{played an important role in}} the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the race}} were overshadowed by {{speculation}} over IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard's job, after he tweeted that some team owners {{were trying to get}} him fired. Dixon claimed pole position {{for the race}}, the first IndyCar event in Detroit since 2008, and maintained his lead throughout the race. After 38 laps, James Hinchcliffe hit a dislodged piece of the track and continued straight into the tire wall. Further investigation discovered that the track was disintegrating in various places, and the event was red flagged. After a two-hour break, in which track officials ripped out the damaged sections of track and filled the <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> concrete, the race was restarted, shortened to 60 laps. Rain also started to fall lightly, and shortly after the restart a caution was issued when Hélio Castroneves spun. Dario Franchitti gained four places after the red flag, benefiting from his softer red tires, to finish second behind his teammate.|$|E
5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding <b>holes</b> <b>with</b> water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} auger type post hole diggers. These are {{generally}} easier to use, {{and they can}} be used to a much greater depth, as the hole can be dug as deep as {{the entire length of the}} shaft. More importantly, they form a much neater <b>hole,</b> <b>with</b> a well-defined circumference. However, the very fact that the person doing the digging is guaranteed a perfect <b>hole</b> <b>with</b> an auger post hole digger is also its greatest weakness: any given auger style post hole digger can only dig one size hole—a <b>hole</b> <b>with</b> the same diameter as the auger's screw.|$|R
