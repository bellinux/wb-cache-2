5|$|Modern {{reference}} books about aviation history represent the Coandă-1910 in various ways, if they mention the machine or the inventor at all. Some acknowledge Coandă as the discoverer of the Coandă effect but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> to power an aircraft in manned flight, and Frank Whittle the honour of completing and patenting the first <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> {{capable of such}} flight. In their 1994 book American Aviation, authors Joe Christy and LeRoy Cook state that Coandă's 1910 aircraft was the first jet.|$|E
5|$|These issues, {{coupled with}} {{emerging}} <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> technology, {{led to the}} cancellation of the Il-20 program on 14 May 1949.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium {{is added}} to {{high-temperature}} superalloys {{that are used to}} make <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> parts, using 70% of the worldwide rhenium production. Another major application is in platinum–rhenium catalysts, which are primarily used in making lead-free, high-octane gasoline.|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{aircraft}} are propelled by airbreathing <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b> Most airbreathing <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> {{that are in}} use are turbofan <b>jet</b> <b>engines,</b> which give good efficiency at speeds just below the speed of sound.|$|R
50|$|The B-29 {{was used}} in the {{development}} of <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b> Stripped of armament, a converted B-29B-55-BA (44-84043)(Bell) designated the XB-29G carried experimental <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> in its bomb bay, which were extended into the airstream for testing during flight. This plane was used to test the Allison J35, General Electric J47 and J73 <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} of the Korean War air power had been {{supplemented}} by the introduction of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine,</b> which allowed fighter and bomber aircraft to fly faster. As with their World War II predecessors, the newer jet aircraft proved capable of providing close air support for ground based troops, and were instrumental in aiding UN ground forces during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|In May 1948, AMC asked Boeing to {{incorporate}} the previously discarded, but now more fuel-efficient, <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> into the design. That resulted {{in the development of}} yet another revision—in July 1948, Model 464-40 substituted Westinghouse J40 turbojets for the turboprops. The Air Force project officer who reviewed the Model 464-40 was favorably impressed, especially since he had already been thinking along similar lines. Nevertheless, the government was concerned about the high fuel consumption rate of the jet engines of the day, and directed that Boeing still use the turboprop-powered Model 464-35 {{as the basis for the}} XB-52. Although he agreed that turbojet propulsion was the future, General Howard A. Craig, Deputy Chief of Staff for Material, was not very keen on a jet-powered B-52, since he felt that the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> had not yet progressed sufficiently to permit skipping an intermediate turboprop stage. However, Boeing was encouraged to continue turbojet studies even without any expected commitment to jet propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines {{proposed by}} other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E
50|$|Similar issues {{occur with}} {{single-stage}} vehicles attempting to carry conventional <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> to orbit—the {{weight of the}} <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> is not compensated sufficiently by the reduction in propellant.|$|R
50|$|General Esperanza's {{aircraft}} is a Fairchild C-123K Provider. This is a {{twin engine}} propeller aircraft modified to appear with four <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> for the film. The pods for the J-85 <b>jet</b> booster <b>engines</b> are still visible under the wings between the mock-up <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Ormat {{acquired}} a controlling stake of Bet Shemesh Engines, a manufactures parts for <b>jet</b> <b>engines,</b> that also overhauls, maintains and assembles <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b> In 2005, Ormat sold its shares the company.|$|R
5|$|Quantities of niobium {{are used}} in nickel-, cobalt-, and iron-based {{superalloys}} in proportions as great as 6.5% for such applications as <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> components, gas turbines, rocket subassemblies, turbo charger systems, heat resisting, and combustion equipment. Niobium precipitates a hardening γ-phase within the grain structure of the superalloy.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions were}} among few air-to-air {{battles in the}} early phase of the war as the North Koreans, realizing their {{aircraft}} were outmatched, quickly stopped using them aggressively against the UN. The battle also signaled {{a turning point in}} the Jet age, as new, <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> powered fighter aircraft had easily bested conventional fighters.|$|E
5|$|An-188: A {{program to}} develop this variant was {{launched}} at the 2015 Paris Air Show. This variant will essentially be a four <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> powered heavy-medium transport with modernized NATO- compatible western cockpit, slightly enlarged wings, winglets and aerial refueling capabilities. The An-188 is intended {{to fill the gap}} between a C-130 and C-17 while being a direct competitor to the A400M. Plans include incorporating a western engine option (as well as a Ukrainian one) to appeal to western markets and reduce dependency on eastern markets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>engines</b> {{are usually}} run {{on fossil fuels}} and are thus a source of {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere. <b>Jet</b> <b>engines</b> can also run on {{biofuels}} or hydrogen, although hydrogen is usually produced from fossil fuels.|$|R
50|$|NASA Glenn does {{significant}} {{research and}} technology development on <b>jet</b> <b>engines,</b> producing designs that reduce energy consumption, pollution and noise. The chevrons it invented for noise reduction appear on many commercial <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> today, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.|$|R
50|$|Compared to propellers, <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> {{can provide}} much higher thrust, higher speeds and, above about 40000 ft, greater efficiency. They are also much more {{fuel-efficient}} than rockets. As a consequence nearly all large, high-speed or high-altitude aircraft use <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E
5|$|Information {{gathered}} in Rennes, Paris, and Eindhoven pointed to Strasbourg {{as a place}} of particular interest. Physicists Rudolf Fleischmann and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were known to be working at the University of Strasbourg, as was Eugen von Haagen, an expert on viruses whose work was of great concern to the Alsos Mission's Biological Warfare section. The Naval section was interested in the torpedo research being carried out there, and <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> development was being undertaken at Strasbourg's Junkers plant.|$|E
5000|$|When Concorde {{was being}} {{designed}} by Aérospatiale-BAC, high bypass <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> ("turbofan" [...] engines) {{had not yet}} been deployed on subsonic aircraft. Had Concorde entered service against earlier designs like the Boeing 707 or de Havilland Comet, it would have been much more competitive. When these high bypass <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> reached commercial service in the 1960s, subsonic <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> immediately became much more efficient, closer to the efficiency of turbojets at supersonic speeds. One major advantage of the SST disappeared.|$|R

50|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>engines</b> {{can provide}} much higher thrust than propellers, and are {{naturally}} efficient at higher altitudes, {{being able to}} operate above 40000 ft. They are also much more fuel-efficient at normal flight speeds than rockets. Consequently, nearly all high-speed and high-altitude aircraft use <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Ryan FR Fireball was a mixed-power (piston and jet-powered) fighter {{aircraft}} {{designed by}} Ryan Aeronautical for the United States Navy during World War II. It was the Navy's first aircraft with a <b>jet</b> <b>engine.</b> Only 66 aircraft were built before Japan surrendered in August 1945. The FR-1 Fireball equipped a single squadron {{before the end}} of the war, but did not see combat. The aircraft ultimately proved to lack the structural strength required for operations aboard aircraft carriers and was withdrawn in mid-1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was much interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. In a conventional <b>jet</b> <b>engine,</b> thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit widely on the {{acoustics}} {{spectrum and}} the sounds are caused by multiple mechanisms. Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby <b>jet</b> <b>engine,</b> or combinations of these. Many tornadoes are not audible from much distance; the nature of and the propagation distance of the audible sound depends on atmospheric conditions and topography.|$|E
50|$|Precooled <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> are <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> with a heat {{exchanger}} at the inlet that cools {{the air at}} very high speeds. These engines may be practical and efficient at up to about Mach 5.5, {{and this is an}} area of research in Europe and Japan.|$|R

5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.|$|E
5|$|At a {{research}} lab in Colson, Washington, intellectually disabled janitor Roland Fuller is scolded by scientist Dr. Keats for forgetting {{how to use}} the facility's keycard locks. Keats walks in on his colleagues, Frank Nollette and Ronald Surnow, as they argue over a prototype <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> they are developing. Nollette wants to push testing of the engine to break mach 15, but Surnow is unwilling to risk damaging the prototype. After Keats and Nollette angrily leave, Surnow enters the facility's wind tunnel to make adjustments. However, Roland activates the tunnel's turbines, sending Surnow flying to his death.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|A jet {{aircraft}} (or simply jet) is an aircraft (nearly always a fixed-wing aircraft) propelled by <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> (<b>jet</b> propulsion).|$|R
50|$|All <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> require high {{temperature}} gas for good efficiency, typically achieved by combusting hydrocarbon or hydrogen fuel. Combustion temperatures {{can be as}} high as 3500K (5841F) in rockets, far above the melting point of most materials, but normal airbreathing <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> use rather lower temperatures.|$|R
50|$|In {{critical}} {{military and}} commercial aerospace applications, material engineers commonly specify VIM-VAR steels. VIM means Vacuum Induction Melted and VAR means Vacuum Arc Remelted. VIM-VAR steels become bearings for <b>jet</b> <b>engines,</b> rotor shafts for military helicopters, flap actuators for fighter jets, gears in jet or helicopter transmissions, mounts or fasteners for <b>jet</b> <b>engines,</b> <b>jet</b> tail hooks and other demanding applications.|$|R
