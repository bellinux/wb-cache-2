5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down {{tried to block}} the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E

Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.|$|E
