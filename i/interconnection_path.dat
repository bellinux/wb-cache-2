40|$|We {{propose a}} provably good performance-driven global routing {{algorithm}} for both cell-based and building-block design. The approach {{is based on}} a new bounded-radius minimum routing tree formulation. We first present several heuristics with good performance, based on an analog of Prim's minimum spanning tree construction. Next, we give an algorithm which simultaneously minimizes both routing cost and the longest <b>interconnection</b> <b>path,</b> so that both are bounded by small constant factors away from optimal. This method is based on the following two results. First, for any given value of a parameter c, we can construct a routing tree with longest <b>interconnection</b> <b>path</b> length at most (1 +) - R, and with cost at most (1 + (2 / 0) times the minimum spanning tree weight. Moreover, for Steiner global routing in arbitrary weighted graphs, we achieve longest path length at most (1 +). R, with wiring cost within a factor 2 (1 + (2 /,)) of the optimal Steiner tree cost. In both cases, R is the minimum possible length from the source to the furthest sink. We also show that geometry helps in routing: in the Manhattan plane, the total wire length for Steiner routing improves to 3 / 2 (1 + (1 /)) times the optimal Steiner tree cost, while in the Euclidean plane, the total cost is further reduced to (2 /x/) (1 + (l/c)) times optimal. Fur- thermore, our method generalizes to the case where varying wire length bounds are prescribed for different source-sink paths. Extensive simulations confirm that this approach works well, using a large set of examples which reflect both cell-based and building-block layout styles...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{presented}} dissertation aims {{to develop}} a graph-centric framework for the analysis and synthesis of networked dynamic systems (NDS) consisting of multiple dynamic units that interact via an interconnection topology. We examined three categories of network problems, namely, identification, controllability, and randomness. In network identification, as a sub-class of inverse problems, we made an explicit relation between the input-output behavior of an NDS and the underlying interacting network. In network controllability, we provided structural and algebraic insights into features of the network that enable external signal(s) to control {{the state of the}} nodes in the network for certain classes of <b>interconnections,</b> namely, <b>path,</b> circulant, and Cartesian networks. We also examined the relation between network controllability and the symmetry structure of the graph. Motivated by the analysis results for the controllability and observability of deterministic networks, a natural question is whether randomness in the network layer or in the layer of inputs and outputs generically leads to favorable system theoretic properties. In this direction, we examined system theoretic properties of random networks including controllability, observability, and performance of optimal feedback controllers and estimators. We explored some of the ramifications of such an analysis framework in opinion dynamics over social networks and sensor networks in estimating the real-time position of a Seaglider from experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{rapid growth}} in the {{wireless}} communications markets together with the emerging need for high-bit-rate (≫ 100 Mb/s) multimedia/data services are pushing the usage of radio spectrum resources below 10 GHz to the uttermost limit. The lack of bandwidth {{has led to an}} extensive development of mobile/fixed BWA systems for the higher microwave and millimetre-wave regions up to the V-band frequencies (50 – 75 GHz). In order for these systems to have mass deployment and to meet cost-sensitive consumer markets’ requirements, their cost and size must be reduced from current levels. One of the most viable packaging approaches to satisfy these demands is the low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) based system-in-package (SiP) module technology combined with fully automated surface-mount assembly techniques. However, one of the main challenges of this approach has been previously associated with the broadband radio frequency (RF) and reliability performance constraints of the board-level solder joints in LTCC/PCB assemblies. In this thesis the primary focus is to tackle these limitations and significantly extend the feasibility of the LTCC module technology to various wireless/mixed-signal packaging applications. The thesis is divided into three main parts. In the first part, design, modelling and implementation of vertical package transitions (BGA, flip-chip, substrate via) over a very wide frequency range are presented. In the second part, the emphasis is on the improvement of the thermal fatigue endurance of the board-level solder joints in the LTCC/PCB assemblies. In the last part, the results are merged to realize a high-performance LTCC module platform for use {{in a wide variety of}} SiP products in the telecommunication sector. The flip-chip, substrate-via and BGA transition structures exhibited excellent signal transmission properties up to the V-band frequencies. The developed equivalent circuit models of the transitions matched well with the measurements. Cascading the transitions together allows the building of different combinations of vertical <b>interconnection</b> <b>paths</b> in SiP modules. To demonstrate this, a surface-mountable LTCC filter package for K-band radio link frequencies was implemented. The developed composite BGA solder joint structure with plastic-core solder balls significantly enhanced the thermal fatigue life in LTCC/PCB assemblies in different thermal cycling conditions, indicating adequate board-level reliability for many practical LTCC-BGA packaging applications. Moreover, electromagnetic analysis showed that the use of the plastic-core solder ball has no detrimental impact on the RF performance of the solder joint. Finally, based on the obtained results a reliable lead-free LTCC-BGA module platform was developed for broadband packaging applications. The BGA module platform with a size of 15  mm ×  15  mm included 38 low-frequency and two wideband RF input/output connections up to the K-band frequencies. The module structure also allowed plenty of space to mount discrete SMD/bare-die components on the surface and/or to embed passive components in the 1. 2 mm thick substrate. Preliminary thermal cycling results of the soldered LTCC/PCB assemblies demonstrated sufficient reliability for telecommunication applications. Therefore, the presented module platform can serve as a physical building block for various wireless/mixed-signal SiP products, and hence significantly reduce their development time and associated costs...|$|R

40|$|Smart cities must {{integrate}} {{a number}} of interdependent cyber-physical systems that operate in a coordinated manner to improve {{the well-being of the}} city's residents. A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a system of computational elements controlling physical entities. Large-scale CPSs are more vulnerable to attacks due to the cyber-physical interdependencies that can lead to cascading failures which can have a significant detrimental effect on a city. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for analyzing the problem of allocating security resources, such as firewalls and anti-malware, over the various cyber components of an interdependent CPS to protect the system against imminent attacks. The problem is formulated as a Colonel Blotto game in which the attacker seeks to allocate its resources to compromise the CPS, while the defender chooses how to distribute its resources to defend against potential attacks. To evaluate the effects of defense and attack, various CPS factors are considered including human-CPS interactions as well as physical and topological characteristics of a CPS such as flow and capacity of <b>interconnections</b> and minimum <b>path</b> algorithms. Results show that, for the case in which the attacker is not aware of the CPS interdependencies, the defender can have a higher payoff, compared to the case in which the attacker has complete information.

Unfortunately, usable system performance is often limited by excessive interprocessor latency. To overcome this bottleneck, this thesis explores {{the use of}} all-optical <b>path</b> <b>interconnection</b> networks using a new topology defined by Coke Reed [31]. This work overcomes limitations of previous optical networks through a novel use of defection routing to minimize latency and allow more processors to collaborate on the same application and dataset. In this thesis research, the data vortex is formally characterized and tested for performance. Extra angles serve as virtual buffers to provide required system performance, even under asymmetric mode operation. The data vortex is compared to two well-known interconnection networks (omega and butterfly) using metrics of average latency and message acceptance rate. The data vortex is shown to outperform the comparison networks, with a 20 - 50 % higher acceptance rate and comparable average latency. The impact of angle size is also studied, and a new, synchronous mode of operation is proposed where additional angles are added to increase the virtual buffering of the network. The tradeoff between virtual buffering and angle resolution backpressure is explored, and an optimal point is found at the 1 : 6 I/O to non-I/O (virtual buffering) angle ratio. The new mode and optimal angle count are used to form data vortex networks that perform as well as larger networks with fewer total nodes. Finally, hierarchical layering with data vortex clusters is proposed and compared to a single-level data vortex. In todays technology, similar performance is attained at high network communication locality loads (> 2 / 3), and a 19 % latency reduction is obtained at the highest locality loads (> 95 %) for current optical switching technology. For projected future technology, the clustered system is shown to yield up to a 55 % reduction in latency for applications with 2 / 3 or better locality. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. D.
