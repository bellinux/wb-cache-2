5|$|The {{disaster}} received nationwide coverage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following,</b> sharing headlines with Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic crossing (though Lindbergh's crossing {{received much}} more attention) and eliciting a national outpouring of grief.

5|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, the 3rd Australian Brigade—of which the 12th Battalion was part—was designated as the covering force for the ANZAC landing, and as such was the first unit ashore on 25 April 1915, at approximately 04:30. Newland was wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the landing, suffering a gunshot wound to his arm, and was evacuated to the 1st General Hospital.

The Indian Army and Air Force also provided assistance with rescue, medical and heavy lift helicopters, by collecting bodies and maintaining security at the site.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to claiming North Korea was planning a moon mission, Hyon Kwang-il, {{director of the}} scientific research department at NADA, said the satellite had completed 2,513 orbits and had transmitted 700 photographic images <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>following</b> its launch. <b>The</b> satellite passes over North Korea {{four times a day}} and continues to transmit data. However, international experts, such as astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, have not confirmed any transmissions from the satellite.|$|R
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather {{data from this}} and past tornado outbreaks, hoping {{to be able to}} identify conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Myanmar {{where the}} storm moved ashore, and winds of 157km/h (98mph) were reported. Widespread areas reported winds of 40km/h (25mph). The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission estimated {{that up to}} 500mm (20in) of precipitation fell along the Bay of Bengal coast in Myanmar and Bangladesh. There were reports of waves 15m (50ft) in height along the coast. A high storm surge and coastal flooding inundated four towns in Rakhine State, causing damage to water systems. Flooding was visible on satellite imagery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the cyclone. Eight townships in the state were affected, five of them severely.|$|E
5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E

5|$|In a {{fundraising}} {{speech on}} 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform, and realised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> {{that the most}} effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.|$|E
5|$|In his {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the incident.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the cyclone, the Australian government distributed financial and emergency aid, offering to provide assistance to hard-hit banana and sugar cane farmers in northern Queensland. Hundreds of State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers were deployed to restore electrical and water services, evacuate local citizens, provide food, and repair and protect structures. The Department of Social Security (DSS) sent employees to receive claims for damage, requests for financial aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth of Australia initiated a three-year, $150million program to provide relief to damaged areas. Fund payments, however, were frequently incorrectly distributed, and in some cases, fraudulent. In the confusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the cyclone, looters stole possessions in areas within the vicinity of Innisfail, and relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms at Cairns. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) was subject to heavy criticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the storm's landfall, accused of not giving ample warning in advance of Winifred's approach; however, these concerns were later addressed in its report on the cyclone's impact. Due to the severity of the storm's damage, the name Winifred was retired after the season ended.|$|E
50|$|Chile's civil union {{provisions}} enable {{couples to}} claim pension benefits and inherit property if their civil partner dies {{as well as}} more easily co-own property and make medical decisions for one another.

In March 1942, he moved to Goodfellow Field (now Goodfellow Air Force Base) in San Angelo, Texas for basic flight training where he flew a Vultee BT-13 Valiant. Roddenberry graduated on August 5, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> this interaction, Presley and Jackson {{spoke on}} the {{telephone}} almost every day, forging a strong friendship.

Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{incidents}} of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians were reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the attacks.

5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could {{be seen from the}} tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of the}} Heights. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>following</b> the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack.

The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E
